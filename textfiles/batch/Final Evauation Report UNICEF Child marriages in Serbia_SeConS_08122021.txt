EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Child marriage is a fundamental violation of human and child rights. It causes numerous devastating
consequences for girls, disempowering them within their communities and in their own homes, harming
their health, excluding them from education, and denying them the opportunity to fulfil their potential.
Recognizing the need for global action, the UN Sustainable Development Agenda has set out the goal of
ending child, early, and forced marriage globally by 2030.
This document represents the Evaluation Report of the programme “Towards ending child marriage in
Serbia” (the Programme), which was implemented by UNICEF with the great support of the Korean
Committee for UNICEF who provided the necessary funds (The Programme’s total budget was USD
510,099). The implementation of the Programme was helped by many local and national level
partnerships, including governmental bodies such as the Coordination Body for Gender Equality (CBGE),
the Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veterans and Social Affairs (MOLEVSA), the Ministry of Education,
Science and Technological Development (MoESTD), and national institutions such as the Institute of
Psychology and the Republic Institute for Social Protection; and civil society organizations including the
Centre for Education Policy, the Roma CSOs RWC Bibija, Association Ternipe, Association of Roma Novi
Bečej, CSO Novi Svet, and the Association of Roma Students. The Programme was carried out from
January 2018 to December 2019, in three localities in Serbia (Novi Bečej, Belgrade, and Pirot). The
evaluation was conducted by the SeConS Development Initiative Group.
The main purpose of the evaluation was to determine the extent to which the strategies, approaches,
and activities applied during the implementation of the Programme laid the groundwork for promoting
and expanding a comprehensive response to factors that maintain the practice of child marriage within
Roma settlements in Serbia. In addition, the intention was also to provide recommendations to the
Government of Serbia, national and local stakeholders, UNICEF, UN agencies, and donors about the best
way forward in further planning and intervention on child marriage.
In this regard, the main objectives of the evaluation are twofold:
• To show the extent to which the interventions which were the subject of this evaluation have
contributed to:
- strengthening the knowledge and evidence base on child marriage,
- strengthening the commitment, ownership, advocacy, and coordination skills of key actors
at the national level,
- strengthening the leadership of the Roma community and addressing general population
stereotypes about Roma,
- empowering Roma girls and mothers through education, health, and protection, together
with a strengthened (peer) support network,
- increasing access to social protection services and to an education system that integrates
early risk identification with appropriate support in child marriage cases,
- long-term, comprehensive efforts to end child marriages in Serbia by 2030.
• To identify gaps, lessons learned and provide feasible recommendations aimed at further
improvement of the model and overall programming towards ending child marriage in Serbia.

Methodology
The evaluation applied a mixed-method approach, combining quasi-experimental and comparative
methods. The quasi-experimental method enabled the evaluation team to assess the impact of the
intervention (as an independent variable) on programme beneficiaries in terms of changes in their
attitudes and behaviours related to child marriage (as dependent variables). The comparative method
was used to compare the models, as implemented with slight variations in different communities, across
groups of beneficiaries, and between individual cases.
In accordance with the evaluation criteria, specific mixes of different methods were used, including
content analysis of programme documents, relevant policies, reports, studies, baseline and end-line
surveys implemented for the programme; stakeholder mapping; stakeholder analysis; contextual
analysis; analysis of narratives of primary beneficiaries; multi-case study; financial analysis; soft cost-
benefit analysis; qualitative analysis of primary data collected through semi-structured interviews and
FGDs with primary beneficiaries and other stakeholders; system analysis of current situation in the social
protection and education systems in response to child marriage, with an analysis of opportunities and
constraints for scale-up; quasi-experimental analysis.
A total of 70 individuals participated in the evaluation: 34 national and local actors were interviewed,
and 36 beneficiaries from Roma settlements participated in FGDs (in Pirot, Belgrade, and Novi Bečej).
Being mindful of the sensitivity and confidentiality of the topic, the evaluation team took all necessary
steps to apply the highest ethical norms and standards during the evaluation process (including
participants’ informed consent, protection and respect of their anonymity, minimisation of the risk of
harm, and the right to withdraw from the interview or FGD). All ethical principles were applied to
protect the integrity and rights of participants. In the case of respondents who were minors, parental
consent was obtained for every individual. Recruitment of participants who were minors and their
preparation for the interview process was carefully organised by local Roma NGOs, ensuring that
children felt secure and safe during the process of interviewing. Thanks to excellent coordination
provided by local Roma partners, the research team managed to conduct interviews and FGDs in which
our informants felt safe.
Furthermore, a human rights-based and gender-sensitive approach was adopted in all aspects of this
evaluation. The evaluation complied with the UNECE Policy on Gender Equality Empowerment of
Women. The Evaluation Team also ensured that the evaluation procedure respected UNICEF’s
Evaluation Technical Note: Children Participating in Research, Monitoring and Evaluation.
Additionally, the fieldwork was organised in accordance with relevant COVID-19 social distancing
measures. The research team followed all measures introduced by the Government of Serbia to prevent
the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that every single person involved in the fieldwork
used face masks, hand sanitizers, and other necessary equipment, maintained social distancing, etc. The
data collection, which was conducted using remote, online channels due to restrictions related to
COVID-19, was also in accordance with strict ethical standards. The individual and group interviews with
various stakeholders were scheduled in advance using the Zoom platform, and the interviewees were
asked for their consent to participate in the interview and to be recorded. Their consent for the
participation in the interview was secured as evidence prior to the start of the interview.

Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
Key findings for each evaluation criterion are presented below.
➢ Relevance:
• The design and objectives of the Programme as defined through the ToC are relevant to the
depth and scope of the practice of child marriage in Serbia, including the lack of adequate
response of relevant institutions.
• The programme was grounded in solid evidence, designed to take care of the needs of targeted
groups of primary beneficiaries but also other diverse stakeholders.
➢ Coherence:
• The design of the Programme, the Programme’s ToC and the method of delivery of the
interventions ensured internal coherence and outputs and consequently the results of the
individual components fed into and built on each other.
• The Programme is consistent with relevant national and local policies and seeks to further
improve and harmonise them, to fully recognise the importance of child marriage.
• The Programme achieved a high level of coherence with other processes related to Roma
inclusion, through cooperation with governmental institutions as well as with international and
domestic NGOs.
➢ Effectiveness:
• The Programme has managed to strengthen data collection and the evidence base in the social
sector and to improve statistics on the prevalence of child marriage to a significant extent.
• The Programme interventions have been successful in building on and upgrading a large variety
of training activities and social and interpersonal events for girls and boys and mothers and
fathers in the communities in which the three local NGOs were already implementing activities.
• The programme has contributed to Roma organizations and individuals being recognized by
other local actors as originators of the interventions against child marriage.
• The Programme has significantly contributed to opening a dialogue within Roma settlements on
the harmful impact on child marriage.
• The Programme has succeeded to a significant extent in increasing capacities of local
stakeholders to identify and address child marriage and enhanced local coordination of key
stakeholders.
• The Programme succeeded (at least initially) in strengthening coordination and action in
addressing child marriage by establishing the National Coalition for Ending Child Marriage as an
important general platform for action which did not exist before, gathering institutions,
organisations, and individuals both locally and nationally who have a responsibility to combat,
and/or who are active in combating, child marriage.
• The engagement of local organisations and other available mechanisms, such as family outreach
workers, Roma health mediators and pedagogical assistants were all crucial for ensuring that the
interventions started from the needs of the Roma communities and individuals, and for
continuing their work in the prevention of child marriage, supporting families and girls at risk of
child marriage, in establishing continuous relationships of trust and support.
• The Programme has had limited success in reaching the most vulnerable families.
• Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic did not hinder the achievement of the planned results, but it
did hamper the effective implementation of sustainability measures.
8 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
➢ Efficiency:
• The steering and management of the Programme were well balanced and result-oriented in
practice.
• The monitoring tools allowed for and facilitated changes in the Programme level.
• The design and implementation of the education segment and the Family Outreach Service of
the Intervention Model to end child marriage were not the most cost-effective way to obtain
the expected results of the Programme.
➢ Impact:
• The Programme interventions in Roma settlements had significant impact on the attitudes and
behaviours of adolescent girls among whom the proportion of those who left education before
completing secondary school was much lower, as was visible in the results of a post-test survey
and in interviews and focus groups with beneficiaries of the Programme.
• The impact of the Programme was visible on mothers, male peers, and men in the targeted
communities, as well as on professionals in local institutions (schools and centres for social
work) engaged in the response to child marriage, as well as on national level stakeholders,
particularly those who participated in or cooperated with the National Coalition for Ending Child
Marriage.
• Due to limited time and scale, the Programme was not able introduce profound changes in
targeted communities, but the evidence indicates that it has opened a dialogue on child
marriage in targeted Roma communities, including broader groups of men and boys, women,
and girls, raising the visibility of the issue and providing arguments against child marriage.
• Local systems enhanced their capacity to identify, recognize and react to risks or actual cases of
child marriage, particularly in two out of three targeted communities, while at the national level
evidence indicates some processes have been initiated (increased focus, mobilized stakeholders,
identified legal and policy gaps) however the impact in terms of achieved systemic changes
cannot be, and is not, yet visible.
The Programme has mobilized a number of diverse stakeholders at local and national levels,
mainly through the National Coalition for Ending Child Marriage and local programme activities.
There is evidence of significant enthusiasm among stakeholders, but at the same time,
uncertainty about how these new partnerships and synergies will be maintained in the future.
➢ Sustainability:
• Undoubtedly the Programme induced a lot of enthusiasm among different stakeholders to
contribute to the ending of child marriage, but how long this mobilization can be maintained
after the Programme ends will depend on financial allocations for these types of models in the
future as well as on other sustainability factors that will be analysed in the following section.
➢ Knowledge generation:
• For mainstreaming the model, it is necessary to improve the national legislative framework, to
replicate it in other local communities with Roma settlements, to provide mandatory and
regular trainings of professionals in the welfare and education systems and also in other
institutions engaged in local multisectoral cooperation (such as police, health system,
prosecution services), to enable systematic knowledge transfer and promotion of good practices

in multisectoral cooperation among local communities. At the national level, the role of the
National Coalition for Ending Child Marriage is seen as crucial as it can advocate for political
commitment and for replicating or upscaling the model with adequate allocation of funds.
The Evaluation has concluded that the Programme has delivered valuable results in terms of:
Raising the profile of child marriage in policy discourse in Serbia. The visibility of the issue of child
marriage has significantly increased as a direct result of the Programme.
Enhancing evidence-based policymaking on child marriage. The Programme was highly effective in
terms of promoting improved data collection and analysis and strengthening and promoting evidence-
based policy and programme design in general.
Working directly with communities, girls at risk of child marriage, women, boys, and men in changing
power dynamics in communities especially in terms of addressing child marriage. The community
work, which included girls, mothers, boys and fathers, was extremely beneficial and impactful.
Strengthening cooperation between different stakeholders in addressing child marriage at the local
and community levels. The Programme was effective in enhancing multisectoral cooperation to address
the issue of child marriage, although the scope of interventions varied in terms of effectiveness at the
local level.
Recommendations
Recommendations were proposed having in mind the specific role of UNICEF and with the idea of the
possible future UNICEF action that might contribute more to the favourable environment for ending
child marriages than through direct support of small-scale projects.
The project has successfully piloted the model for addressing the issue of child marriages. In the
following period, the other stakeholders should take over the responsibilities and take control over the
roll out of the initiatives. The UNICEF should retain the role of the 'guardian' of the model and the
'supportive force' to others engaged in ending child marriages. Starting from this rationale, the possible
streams of actions that UNICEF might take could include:
• Targeted advocacy activities should focus on leveraging or mobilising stakeholders whose
actions are essential to provide a more favourable legislative, institutional, policy environment
for the effort directed to ending child marriages to provide some specific changes. The advocacy
should be particularly focused on legislative changes of the Family Law, Criminal Code and Law
on Prevention of Domestic Violence. The advocacy should also focus on effective
implementation of policies that entail measures for ending child marriages, particularly Roma
inclusion strategy, Strategy on prevention of violence against children, Gender Equality Strategy
2021-2030, and Strategy for prevention and combating violence against women and domestic
violence 2021-2025. Targeted advocacy should focus also on mobilising sufficient financial
allocations at different levels of the system to fund the model’s elements and its rollout in the
future.
• Strengthen the partnerships with other UN agencies and international/bilateral organisations
(for example, UN Women, GIZ, SIDA, SDC) to accommodate more concerted dialogue with the
10 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
Government of Serbia on the need to provide an adequate framework for addressing child
marriages. Through this cooperation, UNICEF can transfer abundant knowledge obtained
through this project and other projects and programmes on effective ways to address child
marriages.
• Supporting the National Coalition for Ending Child Marriages as one of the key stakeholders
contributing to the more favourable environment for action against child marriages.
• Supporting cooperation and experience exchange of various stakeholders by (co) organising
events for knowledge and experience sharing, promoting good practices.
• Mainstreaming the issue of child marriages in the regular work with relevant stakeholders, such
as social protection, judiciary institutions. This does not entail additional or separate activities
related to child marriages. However, it means that stakeholders could focus on already planned
trainings, workshops, or other capacity-building activities with stronger emphasis and relevance
to child marriages.
• To explore new fundraising opportunities for financing action against child marriages that were
not previously used, such as IPA funds.

1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents findings from the final evaluation of the Programme “Towards ending child
marriage in Serbia” (henceforth, the Programme), implemented by UNICEF with the financial support of
the Korean Committee for UNICEF. The Programme was focused on four intervention areas: (A)
improving data collection, strengthening policy and developing evidence-based practices to tackle the
social exclusion and poverty that commonly drive child marriage; (B) working with and within Roma
communities in order to strengthen their leadership and embrace alternatives to harmful traditional
practices; (C) strengthening key system capacities for timely identification of girls at risk of chid marriage
and for giving quality support (access to improved services), and (D) strengthening intersectoral
collaboration at the municipal and national levels.
Under the guidance and with the technical support of UNICEF, the Programme was implemented from
January 2018 to December 2019, in cooperation with numerous stakeholders, including governmental
bodies such as the Coordination Body for Gender Equality (CBGE), the Ministry of Labour, Employment,
Veterans and Social Affairs (MOLEVSA), the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological
Development (MoESTD), and national institutions such as the Institute of Psychology and the Republic
Institute for Social Protection; and civil society organizations including the Centre for Education Policy,
the Roma CSOs RWC Bibija, Association Ternipe, Association of Roma Novi Bečej, CSO Novi Svet, and the
Association of Roma Students. The Programme also involved communities in three localities (in Novi
Bečej, Belgrade, and Pirot).
PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE EVALUATION
The main purpose of this evaluation is to determine the extent to which the adopted strategies,
approaches and activities, applied throughout three years of Programme implementation, set a
foundation for promoting and scaling a comprehensive response to a diverse range of factors
perpetuating the practice of child marriage within Roma settlements in Serbia. In addition to being a
summative evaluation, assessing the Programme accountability, results, impact and their sustainability,
this is also formative evaluation. This means that its purpose is to provide recommendations to the
Government of Serbia, national and local stakeholders, UNICEF, UN agencies and donors about the best
way forward in further planning and intervention on early child marriage.
The objectives of the evaluation are to:
1. Provide evidence of the extent to which the interventions which are the object of this evaluation
contributed to the achievement of the following results:
• Strengthened knowledge and evidence base on child marriage;
• Strengthened commitment, ownership, advocacy skillset and coordination of key actors at
the national level;
• Longer-term, comprehensive efforts to end child marriage in Serbia by 2030 are an integral
part of the social inclusion of Roma and the promotion of child rights and gender equality;
• An empowered Roma community leadership together with promoted champions of change
play an important role in transforming harmful traditional practice within the affected
community and tackling general population stereotypes about Roma;
• Empowered Roma girls and mothers better express and exercise their choices through
increasing knowledge of, and ability to challenge attitudes around, health, education and
protection, along with a strengthened (peer) support network;
12 | P age

• Increased access to timely, coordinated and quality services, with particular focus on the
capacity of social welfare and the education system, that successfully integrates early
identification of risk with appropriate support in cases of child marriage.
2. Identify gaps, lessons learned and provide feasible recommendations aimed at further
improvement of the model and overall programming towards ending child marriage in Serbia.

2. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
TRENDS IN CHILD MARRIAGE
Child marriage is a fundamental violation of a child’s human rights. According to UNICEF estimates, 12
million girls get married annually, and presently there are 650 million girls and women alive who were
married before their 18th birthday.4 Child marriage has devastating consequences for girls,
disempowering them within their communities and in their own homes, harming their health, excluding
them from education, and denying them the opportunity to fulfil their potential. It also leads to early
pregnancy, which can significantly increase the levels of maternal mortality and morbidity. Recognizing
the need for global action, in 2013 the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution to strengthen
efforts to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage. This was followed up in the UN
Sustainable Development Agenda until 2030, which set out the goal of ending child, early and forced
marriage globally by 2030 (SDG 5.3).
Prevalence of child marriage in the general population in Serbia is low, but a comparison between the
most recent two cycles of the MICS survey (2014-2019) shows a slight increase of 1.1 percentage point
overall, an increase from 6.8% to 7.9% (Figure 2). Child marriage is more prevalent in certain groups,
such as rural populations (13.8%), women with no or low education (44.1%), and women from the
poorest households (24%). This clearly indicates that poverty and social exclusion increase risks from
child marriage and suggests that perhaps child marriage could be understood as representing an
(inappropriate) strategy to cope with poverty and exclusion. These risks are particularly high among
people living in Roma settlements, where child marriage is the most prevalent. Although there are some
positive changes in values indicating a decrease in child marriage in Roma settlements between two
MICS cycles (from 57% to 55.7%), these changes are very weak and the prevalence of child marriage
remains high (Figure 2).5

Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
Child marriage among the Roma population in Serbia, as well as in other Balkan countries, is a very
complex issue, influenced by a range of different factors, including, in addition to poverty and exclusion,
also some cultural factors such as patriarchal social norms and gender stereotypes which assign to
women primarily the reproductive role and responsibilities related to the household and family6. Some
of these factors are manifested through specific practices. For example, arranged marriage within Roma
communities often involves the payment of money or livestock to a girl’s family. This
sometimes incentivises families facing financial difficulties to marry off their daughters at a young age.7
Since engaging in pre-marital sex can bring shame to Roma families, child marriage is sometimes used to
preserve a girl’s and the family’s ‘honour’.8
There are many serious consequences of early marriage for all women but particularly for Roma women
who face multiple factors of discrimination and exclusion (based on gender, ethnic minority status,
severe poverty, and deprivation). Due to early marriage women drop out of school before getting the
skills necessary for the labour market. Their employment opportunities are therefore heavily
undermined, and they have poor life chances and little hope of getting out of the poverty cycle. This also
reflects on the life chances of their children. Without education, economic and social power, Roma
women who got married early struggle to provide an adequate environment and support for the
development of their children. This continues the vicious circle of poverty and exclusion.
INITIATIVES IN COMBATING CHILD MARRIAGE
Until recently, the problem of child marriage was almost invisible in Serbia. According to an analytical
report on child marriage published by UNICEF9, until 2016 there was no reliable data available in the
literature on the prevalence of child marriage, except for UNICEF’s MICS and the Bibija Roma Women’s
Centre’s research on virginity from 200610. There have only been a few interventions related to child
marriage recently; almost all of them have been undertaken by Roma women’s civil society
organizations. Regarding the issue of child marriage, UNICEF has had a leading role, working directly to
strengthen the ability of Roma communities to tackle the issue of child marriage by providing
information on alternatives – through community dialogue, direct support to families and the
engagement of successful young Roma role models.
In 2017 UNICEF supported a significant research programme (in cooperation with the Ethnographic
Institute and the Roma women’s’ centre “BIBIJA”) on child marriage. The results were published in the
report Child marriage among the Roma population in Serbia – Ethnographic research11. In addition, the
Coordination Body for Gender Equality and the UNICEF Office in Serbia started a joint initiative in
February 2019, establishing the National Coalition for Ending Child Marriage12 which aims to contribute
to ending child marriage in Serbia, particularly among the Roma population. The coalition represents a

community of individuals, institutions and organizations that jointly work on strengthening the options
for safe choices for girls of Roma nationality, ensuring that women and men of Roma nationality are
empowered to change the existing practice of child marriage.13
INSTITUTIONAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK
The Republic of Serbia has ratified many international documents and adopted laws and other acts that
directly or indirectly attempt to suppress and punish the practice of child marriage. The most important
are the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Freedoms14; UNGA Resolution 84315; the

Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
In 2021, the Republic of Serbia endorsed the Law on Gender Equality,32 which provides an overarching
normative framework for the promotion and safeguarding gender equality. As a part of its programme
to address child marriage, the government of the Republic of Serbia has adopted several legislative and
regulatory systems which all address a number of issues related to child marriage. For example, the
Family Law of 2005 prescribes that the minimum age for marriage is set at 18 years of age, though it is
also prescribed that a court may, for justified reasons, permit a minor who has reached sixteen years of
age and who has reached the physical and mental maturity necessary, to conclude a marriage.
Furthermore, during the last decade, child marriage has become an integral part of several significant
strategies, such as the Strategy for the Social Inclusion of Roma in the Republic of Serbia (2016-2025)33
and the National Strategy for Gender Equality (2016-2020)34 which has a specific focus on preventing
early and forced marriages, especially of Roma girls and young women, and on supporting young
women and mothers to continue their education. Finally, the Strategy for Prevention and Protection
against Discrimination (2014 - 2018)35 also deals with the vulnerable position of children of Roma
nationality and with their risk of discrimination, as the consequence of the specific status of the overall
Roma community in Serbia. In May 2020, the Government of the Republic of Serbia adopted the
Strategy for the Prevention of and Protection of Children from Violence (2020 – 2023), along with an
Action Plan for 2020 and 2021. This Strategy includes definitions of child marriage and of forced and
early marriage, all of them recognized as a severe violation of the rights of children and girls in
particular. Nevertheless, measures prescribed in many of these strategies, in particular those related to
prevention of child marriage in Roma communities, were not systematically implemented and
monitored and are therefore have not been entirely effective.
Recent analysis, specifically the analysis of the Strategy for Prevention and Protection against
Discrimination and its implementation until 2017, shows that although some steps forward were made
with respect to human and minority rights and the fight against discrimination, there has not been a
substantial overall change in the position of Roma people within the wider society in Serbia.
The Law on Foundations of the Education System and Strategy for Development of the Education
System until 2030 provides important grounds for drop-out measures to be implemented in the
Education system. The Strategy for the Social Inclusion of Roma in the Republic of Serbia (2016-2025)
sets the overall objective of improving the socio-economic status of the Roma ethnic minority in Serbia,
including full enjoyment of minority rights, eliminating discrimination, and achieving greater social
inclusion of Roma men and women into all segments of society. However, the adoption of the relevant
action plan (2019-2020) has been seriously delayed36, and there were no plans for measures or activities
specifically addressing child marriage.
The National Strategy for Gender Equality (2016-2020) emphasises the importance of active work in
preventing early and forced marriages, particularly related to Roma girls and young women. However,
the realisation of the Action plan (2016-2017) was not assessed as satisfactory and measures related to
the prevention of child marriage, especially in Roma communities, were assessed as not effective.

Overall, although the wider policy framework recognises the importance of social inclusion of Roma and
of gender equality, those processes currently in place do not secure a coherent and systematic approach
to addressing child marriage as one of the most harmful practices and fundamental violations of
children’s rights.

3. EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAMME’S THEORY OF CHANGE
The theory of change for this Programme was quite clear, reflecting the Programme’s goal and long-
term aim to contribute to the creation of an enabling environment where girls fully enjoy their
childhood free from the risk of marriage and experience a healthier, safer, and more empowered life
including making choices and decisions about their education, sexuality, relationships/marriage, and
childbearing.
Outputs expected by 2030 were ambitious:
 Adolescent girls at risk of and affected by child marriage are better able to express and exercise
their choices;
 Social norms and harmful beliefs are transformed, and behaviours are changed regarding
gender equality and the practices of child marriage and violence against children;
 The social, education, health, police and justice sectors deliver quality services to meet the
needs of adolescent girls (and boys) at risk, in a coordinated way;
 The relevant national laws, strategic cross- sectorial policy frameworks and mechanisms
mainstream the issue of child marriage;
 The Government supports and promotes evidence-based programming, monitoring, and
reporting.
To achieve these objectives the Programme has been leveraging Serbia’s commitment to end child
marriage by 2030, as per the Sustainable Development Goals, and to this end the interventions focused
on:
 Working with and within Roma communities to strengthen their leadership and embrace
alternatives to harmful practices through the development and implementation of interventions
in pilot sites with girls, mothers and fathers, through supporting positive role models/champions
of change, through supporting the employability of girls and young mothers, and through raising
awareness, networking, and sharing experiences within and outside Roma communities;
 Strengthening the capacities of key systems for the timely identification of girls at risk of child
marriage and providing quality support (access to improved services) through the development
of risk indicators and through the capacity building of social service providers; and supporting
schools in pilot localities to upgrade drop-out prevention programmes to provide support to
Roma girls at risk;
 Improving data collection, strengthening policy, and developing evidence-based practices to
tackle the social exclusion and poverty that commonly drive child marriage through the
realisation of a baseline and retest study in pilot sites, and through the documentation of good
practice examples and evaluation;
 Strengthening intersectoral collaboration at the municipal and national levels through
facilitating local-level coordination in pilot municipalities and supporting the establishment of a
National Coalition to End Child Marriage.
The Programme intervention was operationalised within the structure of the following results
framework:

The model promoted through the evaluated Programme was indeed a compilation of good practices and
interventions in the child protection, education, social inclusion, and healthcare sectors, as no single
intervention is enough by itself, in any given sector, to address this issue comprehensively. The
proposed model adopted by the Programme assumed that working on child marriage with central
government (the top-down approach) is not sufficient to ensure full implementation of the existing
strategies, regulations, or plans on either central and/or local levels. Similarly, working solely with
women’s organizations towards ending child marriage, by empowering women and girls is not enough
to bring a system-wide change. This combination of strategies within one Programme, together with an
individualised approach to bring all the stakeholders to sit together at one table, was assessed by all
stakeholders and beneficiaries alike as an extremely successful approach.
At the heart of every part of the intervention was a desire to change the way that the problem of child
marriage, specifically within Roma communities, was tackled and addressed, by establishing and
implementing an evidence-based model that would further empower Roma girls, parents, and leaders,
and strengthen support networks and access to services. The idea was to create a model based on
already-proven and successful strategies and interventions but focused specifically on addressing the
attitudes and behaviours towards the practice of child marriages which are largely driven by poverty and
social norms and are deeply rooted in gender inequality. Although the Programme itself did not focus on
all system-wide bottlenecks (it did not include direct work with police and justice institutions nor with
reproductive rights and health institutions) it did instigate discussions regarding inconsistent

professional practices. These discussions covered the lack of coordination of key systems in early
identification of risks and in providing timely and comprehensive response in addressing negative norms
and beliefs, including on gender, shared by the general population, and particularly by caregivers and
service providers. The proposed model, based on a child-centred approach, presented and established
mechanisms that reconcile work with institutions and service providers on the one hand and work with
individual girls, women, and men on the other hand: as a way to ensure greater gender and child
marriage responsiveness of those services and to address existing gaps in service provision for this
target group.

The evaluation team carried out a critical review of the ToC approach with the key stakeholders
throughout this evaluation report, comparing the ToC with empirical data gathered for each of the
evaluation criteria to assess if the major assumptions and the elements of ToC remained valid
throughout the duration of the Programme, and to assess the extent to which the expected outcome
level changes occurred and if the initial indicators of the Programme’s desired change were (and are
still) relevant. In order not to repeat those issues discussed under individual evaluation criteria, this
section of the report only focuses on the key evaluation questions related to the Programme’s ToC, as
follows:
• The plausibility of ToC: Assessing the logic of the outcome pathway. Did the current ToC make
sense? Were the outcomes in the right sequence? Were the preconditions each necessary and
collectively sufficient to reach the long-term outcomes and ultimate impact? Were there any
gaps in the logic?
• The feasibility of the ToC: Assessing whether the evidence-based model produced within this
Programme can realistically lead to achievement of the long-term outcomes and impact: Did/do
the organizations, government, UNICEF, CSOs and local authorities have adequate resources?
Do they need additional partners? Were the scope and timeline realistic?
• To assess any need to adjust the ToC for future rollout of the interventions, i.e., replication of
the model in other locations in Serbia.
Although the stakeholders were not always familiar with the comprehensive ToC model as presented in
Figure 3, many of them validated the overall logic of the outcome pathways and saw the outcomes and
the relevant outputs as being firmly established and reflecting Serbian context as well as the complexity
of the issue of child marriage. Whilst the evaluation cannot ascertain the impact of the Programme in
terms of achieving the overall outcome - girls fully enjoy their childhood free from the risk of marriage
and experience a healthier, safer, and more empowered life including making choices and decisions
about their education, sexuality, relationship formation/marriage, and childbearing - collected data from
the stakeholder interviews and focus groups with beneficiaries pointed to compelling evidence of
activities and outcomes at different implementation levels feeding into each other, especially in terms of
collective impact on the creation of the enabling environment, and on the conditions and capacities for
achieving the overall goal in the future.
The Programme’s utilisation of different strategies in securing the engagement of national decision-
makers firstly in addressing the issue and garnering their commitment to action as a basis for
establishing a broad National Coalition of stakeholders from across relevant sectors (bringing together
ministries, independent institutions, civil society organizations, academic bodies, and the Roma
community) and secondly in creating a platform for learning and sharing knowledge, advocacy, action
and accountability on the issue of child marriage have both proven to be advantageous in terms of
putting the issue of child marriage on the policy agenda. Furthermore, Programme interventions
focused on enhancing the work of the coalition as well as enriching evidence-based policymaking on
child marriage, at both the national and local levels, did lead to the strengthening of supporting
mechanisms for collecting reliable data, improved intersectoral cooperation and have contributed to
better practices in identifying girls at risk of child marriage. This work was not only focused on
enhancement of technical capabilities but has contributed to the creation of improved and more
responsive mechanisms, practices, and processes and also to the creation of conditions for establishing
firmer and deeper dialogue between institutions and community leaders, role models, and CSOs.
Consequently, improvements in individual empowerment and in the norms and values among the Roma
23 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
girls and women and in Roma communities can be closely linked to the very pragmatic provision of
support at the community levels.
A few stakeholders questioned whether the sequencing of the interventions and approaches, identified
under pathway of change in the ToC, could have been planned differently to help achieve the best
outcomes and desired changes. Namely, given the legislative frameworks and the pace of changes in
terms of harmonisation of relevant laws one could argue that if the regulatory framework was more
explicit in referring to child marriage as a separate and specific issues and prescribing specific mandates
to certain institutions in addressing this issue, the conditions for working at the local levels would have
been easier and more conducive to implementation.
The elements of the model (taken collectively and individually) are sound enough to reach the long-term
outcomes and ultimate impact, but only if all the elements are integrated in public finance systems at all
levels and only if the practices developed are an integral part of larger public administration reforms
(especially in key sectors of health, education, and social protection). Whilst there is no need for any
huge adjustments of the existing ToC in terms of individual strategies or pathways to change, for the
future rollout of the intervention i.e., for the replication of the model in other locations in Serbia,
greater attention in the future should be put on including assumptions and risks related to fiscal
frameworks that would improve the future sustainability and resilience of the model and would
potentially lead to the achievement of long-term outcomes. In an overall assessment of the ToC, within
this evaluation, it is important to restate and recognise that structural bottlenecks in the Programme
implementation were not specific for the issue of child marriage alone. Rather it must be recognised
that the bottlenecks which the Programme faced in its implementation are also general bottlenecks
within wider governance systems38, creating obstacles to other social protection and education issues as
well. To address these bottlenecks in practice in any future replication of the model would require closer
linkage to public finance reform processes so as to ensure the efficiency of the model and the continuity
of those results already achieved.
38 The social protection sector has been the most underrated, underfunded and “de-funded” element of the system,
significantly understaffed whilst the number of users is steadily growing. The education sector is in the process of structural
reforms, as is the justice sector. The health sector is perceived as the most efficient and best functioning among them but is
nevertheless perceived as fairly overburdened.

4. EVALUATION APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY
4.1 Evaluation approach
The evaluation methodology and the evaluation approach are developed taking into account the
evaluation purposes as defined in the ToR and utilising the evaluation criteria defined by OECD DAC39
and adhering to the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards for Evaluation. The
evaluation is designed with UN System-wide Action Plan (UN-SWAP) indicators40 in mind, which should
ensure that human rights and gender equality values are respected, addressed and promoted
throughout the evaluation process in all its components, underpinning the commitment to the principle
of ‘Leaving no-one behind’. The evaluation also took into account the principles highlighted in the UN
Women Evaluation Handbook, including fair relations of power, empowerment, participation and
inclusion, independence and integrity, transparency, quality, credibility and ethics. This means that:
 the principles of human rights and gender equality were integrated into the evaluation scope,
and that the evaluation questions were designed in a way that ensures the collection of data on
gender equality and human rights,
 a gender-sensitive methodology was developed, including methods and tools, as well as data
analysis techniques that enable fully gender-disaggregated data, alongside gender-sensitive
data collection techniques and processes, and gender-sensitive analysis;
 the evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations reflect this gender analysis and
provide gender-sensitive insights and recommendations that enable future beneficial
interventions to target groups in a way that promotes gender equality, human rights and
empowers women and girls.
The evaluation approach was based on the following principles:
1. The Steering Committee and Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) were extensively informed of
the evaluation methodology. This close cooperation enabled a Collaborative Outcomes
Reporting approach41 (an approach to evaluation based around a performance story that
presents evidence of how a programme has contributed to outcomes and impacts). Evidence
was reviewed by both technical experts and programme stakeholders, including community
members. Thus, rather than focusing on general and abstract users and uses, the evaluators
were able to make the final recommendations based on detailed discussions with stakeholders
and to facilitate decision-making among the exact people who will be using the evaluation
findings.
2. In terms of lessons learned and good practice models, the evaluation team utilised Appreciative
Inquiry42 and the Positive Deviances Approach43, focusing on existing strengths but also

identifying main weaknesses and challenges to the implementation of the Programme and to
the achievement of desired results and impacts.
3. Finally, to ensure Utilization-Focused Evaluation44, evaluation was assessed on the basis of utility
for intended users. Thus, evaluation was planned and conducted in a way that encourages the
use of results and the decision-making process itself, as well as performance improvement.
The quality assurance of the evaluation was guided by the UNICEF Global Evaluation Reports Oversight
System (GEROS) quality assurance criteria and indicators.45
4.2 Design of the evaluation process
The evaluation process was organized in four phases: inception, data collection, analysis, and reporting
and validation (Figure 4).

evaluation framework (evaluation questions and evaluation matrix, including the definitions of
indicators and sources for each evaluation question), also including the data collection instruments,
were all presented in detail in the Inception Report. The Ethical Review Board provided comments and
suggestions on how to improve the ethical standards, and this enabled optimization of the ethical
principles and alignment of the evaluation procedures with the highest ethical standards (see chapter
4.4).
DATA COLLECTION PHASE
The data collection phase was implemented using mixed methodology, combining secondary sources,
interviews with 34 stakeholders, and focus group discussions (FGDs) with 36 beneficiaries. Due to the
COVID-19 pandemic regime, which restricted direct contacts during this component of data collection,
interviews were mainly conducted online. They took place during January and February 2021. Interviews
followed semi-structured interview guides and were led by highly skilled evaluators.
Focus group discussions with beneficiaries from targeted Roma communities were organized in the field
and face-to-face, as this was considered to be the optimal approach for groups of beneficiaries who are
difficult to access online especially on such a sensitive topic. Separate FGDs were organized for different
groups of beneficiaries: girls, mothers, boys and men. In total 9 FGDs were organized during February
2021. Ethical considerations were carefully taken into account during the data collection phase. All
interviews and FGDs were recorded with the consent of the participants.
Data collection was implemented in line with ethical standards (see chapter 4.4).
After the completion of the data collection mission, an online debriefing was held with the UNICEF
team.
THE ANALYSIS PHASE
The analysis of the primary data collected during the evaluation was conducted using MAXQDA software
for mixed analysis. All interviews and FGDs records were transcribed and inserted into the database.
These were coded according to the evaluation questions and sub-questions. In addition, the analysis
included evidence from pre-test and post-test surveys. Evidence collected through desk research was
also used both in the analysis of key findings but also for the purpose of contextualisation of the
evaluation findings.
After the first findings were formulated based on this analysis, a presentation was made to the UNICEF
team and based on the feedback provided by them, it was decided to strengthen the formative aspects
of the evaluation and elaborate more findings that could be used in the future attempts to upscale the
model and progress towards ending child marriage.
REPORTING AND VALIDATION
The outline of the final evaluation report was proposed to the UNICEF team and approved. The report
was developed by the evaluation team in line with the adopted outline.
27 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
A quality assurance (QA) review in line with the UNICEF Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for
Research Studies and Evaluations (RSEs)46 was applied to both the Inception Report and the Final Draft
Report. The QA was performed by the Country Office, using an external review facility.
In preparing and finalising the Inception and Final Draft Reports, the Steering Committee and ERG47
were consulted, and final changes were made on basis of their comments and suggestions.
4.3 Design of the evaluation methodology
The ToR48 requested that the evaluation be conducted applying a methodology that demonstrates
impartiality and lack of bias by using a cross-section of information sources (stakeholder groups,
including beneficiaries, etc.), and by using a mixed methodology to ensure triangulation of information
through a variety of means. In line with this, the methodology designed for this evaluation is a hybrid
one, combining quasi-experimental and comparative methods. This mixed-method approach requires a
simultaneous focus on different levels of the analysis:
1) Programme focus – as an initiative that included phases of pre-modelling, modelling and model
implementation, within a specific contractual framework and obligations;
2) Model focus – an evidence-based programme that established a complex set of interventions
through which ending child marriage should be achieved, piloted in the targeted communities
and among targeted beneficiary groups (girls, mothers, boys and men in Roma communities)
with the potential to be scaled up;
3) Community focus – based on the targeted areas in which the model of ending child marriage
was implemented and where due to the specific modes of implementation and/or contextual
characteristics, the main model gets certain distinctive features;
4) Individual focus – taking into consideration the targeted girls, mothers, boys and men who were
exposed to the Programme interventions and should experience the impact of the
Programme/model through the ultimate change of attitudes and behaviours towards child
marriage.
The quasi-experimental method49 enabled the evaluation team to assess the impact of the intervention
(as an independent variable) on Programme beneficiaries in terms of changes in their attitudes and
behaviours related to child marriage (as dependent variables). The type of quasi-experimental method

47 The ERG was formed at the onset of this evaluation to facilitate the participation of relevant stakeholders in the design and
scope of the evaluation, raising awareness of the different information needs. This group was chaired by UNICEF and the
Coordination Body for Gender Equality, and provided information quality assurance throughout the process, supporting the
dissemination of the evaluation results.
48 Annex 1 of the Final Evaluation Report is attached as a separate document.
49 “A quasi-experimental method enables observations that are structured similarly to an experiment, but the conditions and
experiences of participants lack some control because the study lacks random assignment, includes a preexisting factor (i.e. a
variable that is not manipulated), or does not include a comparison/control group. A quasi-independent variable is a preexisting
variable that is often a characteristic inherent to an individual, which differentiates the groups or conditions being compared in
a research study. Because the levels of the variable are preexisting, it is not possible to randomly assign participants to groups”

DATA COLLECTION SAMPLE
Individual interviews were conducted with different stakeholders, including:
 UNICEF team
 Representatives of the Government of Serbia, particularly the ministries involved (MoLEVSA,
MoESTD) and CBGE
 Representatives of the National Coalition to End Child Marriage
 Representatives of the Institute for Social Protection,
 Representatives of local institutions, such as Centres for Social Work (CSWs), schools, Roma
mediators
 Representatives of partner CSOs.
In total 34 stakeholders were interviewed based on a semi-structured interview guide specifically
adapted to different types of stakeholders.
FGDs were conducted with 36 beneficiaries from Roma settlements: 8 in Belgrade, 16 in Novi Bečej and
12 in Pirot. They were clustered in four groups: 12 girls, 8 boys, 12 mothers and 4 men. The detailed
sample structure is presented in Annex 4.
METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, CHALLENGES AND EVALUATION RISKS
The main methodological limitation is related to the timing of the evaluation itself, in terms of
measuring the effectiveness and impact of a Programme which is still ongoing, and the fact that the
evaluation scope extends beyond the Programme, referring to the model that can potentially be scaled
up to address child marriage in general. This risk was mitigated with the extension of the data collection
phase into 2021, gathering evidence on all activities which could be implemented during last phase of
the Programme despite the COVID-19 pandemic.
Another risk is related to the communication with beneficiaries, some of whom came from very
marginalized communities, who faced language barriers and had limited capacities to understand the
programmatic jargon. This risk was mitigated by engaging skilled evaluators who were highly qualified
for work with vulnerable groups and had extensive experience in work with Roma communities and on
the topic of child marriage.
30 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
Some methodological limitations were related to the COVID-19 restrictions in data collection, but this
was mitigated by online interviews with those stakeholders for whom this kind of interview was deemed
suitable, as described above.
One of the most complex methodological challenges was related to the twofold approach: on the one
hand it was important to conduct the evaluation according to standard evaluation criteria, but on the
other hand for the formative evaluation purpose it was important to use an approach adapted to the
complexity of the Programme model. This challenge was addressed in the following way: within the
chapters on relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability, the model (as adapted to
local communities) was evaluated using the standard criteria. While evaluation components structured
around previously listed criteria were more focused on programme implementation, in the chapter on
knowledge generation, the analysis is fully focused on the model itself with the aim to understand what
worked well and what should be changed in order to successfully upscale it or replicate it.
4.4 Ethical considerations and safety of the persons involved in the
evaluation process
Child marriage is a highly sensitive topic; it is a form of gender-based violence, which is prohibited by the
Istanbul Convention (though not fully prohibited by the domestic law52), so ethical considerations were
of special significance during the evaluation.
It is important to emphasize that the evaluation was conducted completely independently, all potential
conflict of interest of evaluation informants were avoided, as well as a potential conflict of interest of
the members of the evaluation team.
The evaluation team took all necessary steps to ensure that the highest ethical norms and standards
were applied during the evaluation process. The evaluation was conducted in compliance with the “do
no harm” principle, i.e. the rights of the individuals involved in the process were completely protected.
Firstly, full anonymity of all participants in the process and the confidentiality of all information shared
with the evaluation team were guaranteed. Before the interviews and FGDs, participants were informed
about the purpose of data collection, emphasising that the participation of every individual was
voluntary. At the beginning of every interview or FGD, informed consent from each individual
respondent was obtained (informed consent forms are presented in Annex 5).
In this data collection process, the main social risk was due to the fact that the information may be
perceived as sensitive within the social context, which is particularly true for respondents from Roma
communities. So there was special emphasis on the protection of the most vulnerable interviewees –
Roma girls and women who participated in FGDs. The main social risks included information or
52 As indicated earlier, the Family law prescribes that a court may, for justified reasons, permit a minor who has reached sixteen
years of age and who has reached the physical and mental maturity necessary, to conclude a marriage.
31 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
statements that could be perceived as inappropriate or shameful from the perspective of other
members of the community, given the presence of strong social norms related to specific gender roles
and marriage in particular. To avoid this, the research team, together with local Roma partners,
managed to secure interview locations where our informants felt safe. In most cases, FGDs were
organised in one of the participants' households or in the local Roma NGO offices, making sure that only
participants and the researcher were present during the interviews. Thanks to excellent coordination
provided by local Roma partners, no difficulties were noticed during the face-to-face interviews.
Additionally, FGDs were organized in accordance with relevant COVID-19 social distancing measures
(face masks and hand sanitizers were provided by the research team).
In the case of respondents who were minors, parental consent was obtained for every individual (see
Annex 5). This also included the good practice of involving Roma coordinators in FDGs, taking care of any
potential risk and harm boys and girls could be exposed to during the interview process. Recruitment of
minor participants and their preparation for the interview process was carefully organised by local Roma
NGOs, ensuring that children felt secure and safe during the process of interviewing.
The identities of the respondents were protected and known only to the evaluation team, as mandated
in the UNEG Guidance on Integrating Human Rights53. Furthermore, the evaluation complied with the
Policy on Gender Equality Empowerment of Women54. A human rights-based and gender-sensitive
approach was adopted in all aspects of this evaluation. The Evaluation Team also ensured that the
evaluation procedure respected UNICEF’s Evaluation Technical Note: Children Participating in Research,
Monitoring and Evaluation.
The COVID-19 pandemic led to the introduction of additional measures to protect both respondents and
researchers involved in the evaluation process. In July 2020 SeConS developed an internal protocol for
working under these new circumstances: A Plan for Implementing Measures for Prevention of Spreading
Infectious Diseases During Epidemics55. All of the researchers involved in the evaluation were familiar
with this protocol and conducted the evaluation in accordance with its principles. The research team
followed all measures introduced by the Government of Serbia to prevent spreading COVID-19. This
means that while conducting the fieldwork, every single person involved in the evaluation process used
face masks and other necessary equipment, maintained social distancing, etc. Also, the evaluation team
ensured that the number of people participating in an FGD was not larger than 4, which was the
maximum number of people allowed to gather at the same place as per measures stipulated by the
Serbian government at the moment of the interviewing process.
Ethical and safety considerations related to online data collection
Since some of the data collection for this evaluation was conducted using remote, online channels due
to COVID-19 related restrictions, many safety issues had to be taken into account to maintain strict
ethical standards. The individual and group interviews with various stakeholders were scheduled in
advance using the Zoom platform, and the interviewees were asked for their consent to participate in

the interview and to be recorded. Their consent for the participation in the interview was secured as
evidence prior to the start of the interview.
All of the files and collected data were stored anonymously. Every subject was assigned a unique
identifier, and personal information was kept separate from the responses. A database with
participants’ responses and a separate database containing personal information was secured with a
password. Only one researcher in charge of data analysis was allowed to access the databases. The
computer containing the hard drive with the collected data is protected to the highest standards
including the use of Windows Defender and Malwarebytes.
The evaluation team, and each of its members individually, safeguarded the international evaluation
principles of:
✓ Independence: by setting standards that increase impartiality in the evaluation process and in
reporting on findings;
✓ Credibility: by setting standards that ensure evaluations are evidence-based and follow
transparent and systematic processes; and
✓ Utility: by building milestones into evaluation processes for timeliness and reporting standards
to ensure accessibility.

5. EVALUATION CRITERIA AND EVALUATION QUESTIONS
The evaluation was conducted with respect to the following key evaluation criteria, based on OECD/DAC
framework56:
➢ Relevance
➢ Coherence
➢ Effectiveness
➢ Efficiency
➢ Impact
➢ Sustainability
➢ Knowledge generation
For each of the evaluation criteria, a set of evaluation questions was developed which guided the
evaluation and served as a framework for the formulation of evaluation findings. The evaluation matrix
including evaluation questions, sources of evidence and evaluation criteria/indicators (attached in
Annex 6) was agreed with the UNICEF team.
RELEVANCE
Relevance is a measure of the extent to which the objectives of the intervention are consistent with
beneficiaries’ requirements, country needs, global priorities and partners’ and donors’ policies. The
evaluation was focused on A) the relevance of the Program’s intermediate outputs (Outputs by 2020 -
ToC) and B) the importance and relevance of the final outputs (Outputs by 2030 - ToC).
COHERENCE
The compatibility of the interventions under this Programme with other similar interventions in the
area, and in the country, were evaluated under this criterion. The evaluation team accordingly tried to
specify the extent to which other interventions, particularly, national, and local policies support or
undermine the intervention and vice versa. Within this criterion, internal Programme coherence was
also evaluated, meaning the assessment of coherence and consistency of activities, outputs, and
outcomes.
EFFECTIVENESS
Effectiveness is a measure of the extent to which a programme attains its objectives/results. This
criterion was evaluated against the objectives set out in the programme document and the results
framework in accordance with the theory of change. Effectiveness is presented essentially as a
qualitative measure of immediate and observable change in the target groups/institutions as a direct
result of implemented activities and the delivery of outputs. This also included an assessment of the
appropriateness of measurable indicators, appraisal of whether planned benefits have been delivered
and received, and the review of the extent of behavioural and organizational change among beneficiary
groups and target institutions, including an examination of whether assumptions at the results level
56 https://www.oecd.org/dac/evaluation/daccriteriaforevaluatingdevelopmentassistance.htm.
34 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
were relevant and adequate in explaining the achievement of the programme purpose and whether any
unplanned results have affected the benefits received.
The assessment of effectiveness relies on two frameworks: the original results framework, which has
indicators for measuring progress in the achievement of results, and the independent evaluation
questions. The results framework with indicators is presented in Annex 7; the independent evaluations
questions are presented in the following table.
EFFICIENCY
The efficiency criterion refers to the extent to which the programme outputs (results) have been
achieved at reasonable cost. It concerns the link between results and the activities or inputs that lead to
the achievement of each output or intermediate outcome. For the purpose of this evaluation, this
criterion was focused on analysing the extent to which the management of the Programme provided an
efficient framework for delivery of services, utilization of resources and accounting for results as well as
establishing and promoting partnership throughout the country (from the start to the end of the
programme implementation phases). Furthermore, the level and the extent of coordination of resources
were assessed to see if they encouraged synergy: leveraging donor/domestic resources and avoidance
of overlap.
As part of the Programme was implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation examined
whether activities were delayed and the effects those delays have had on the timeliness of the
achievement of the results/intermediate outputs57.
IMPACT
Impact refers to the changes that can be attributed to a particular programme. It relates specifically to
higher-level effects (both intended and unintended). The evaluation team paid specific attention to both
intended and unintended results of the intervention and assessed it at different levels of Programme
intervention: individual, group, community level, system, and the whole of society.
SUSTAINABILITY
Sustainability refers to whether the positive outcomes of the Programme continue or are likely to
continue after the external funding ends. It includes an examination of the financial, economic, social,
environmental, and institutional capacities of the systems needed to sustain net benefits over time and
involves analyses of resilience, risks, and potential trade-offs. It also seeks to establish whether any
longer-term impact on the wider development process can be sustained at the level of the sector,
region, or country.
KNOWLEDGE GENERATION
This is not a typical evaluation criterion, but rather an aspect of the evaluation that enables the
evaluation team to systematise the knowledge generated through the Programme to inform future
interventions. The knowledge generation criterion in this evaluation was focused on the analysis of
57 These and other prevailing contextual factors will be assessed in terms of their influence on the Program results.

preconditions needed to scale up or replicate the model of intervention to end child marriage, deriving
from findings on previous criteria.

6.1 Relevance
Evaluation of relevance criteria was based on the following evaluation questions:
EQ1:Towhatextentweretheobjectivesanddesignoftheinterventionrelevant
tothedepthandscopeoftheproblemofchildmarriageinSerbia,andinformed
bytheneedsandinterestsofdiversegroupsofstakeholders?
EQ2: To what extent was the Programme relevant to the needs of stakeholders and
right-holders (Roma children and others in Roma communities) in regard to child
marriage?
KEY FINDING: THE DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAMME, DEFINED THROUGH THE TOC WERE RELEVANT TO
THE DEPTH AND SCOPE OF THE PRACTICE OF CHILD MARRIAGE IN SERBIA, INCLUDING THE LACK OF ADEQUATE
RESPONSE OF RELEVANT INSTITUTIONS.
The Programme is highly relevant for addressing the depth and scope of the phenomenon of child
marriage in Serbia. As presented by the data in the background section, there are indications of a slight
increase of child marriage in the general population of Serbia and no significant change in Roma
settlements. Child marriage is grounded in poverty, deprivation and based on specific gender dynamics
and gender norms, further limiting the roles of Roma girls and women to reproductive and domestic
tasks and undermining their wellbeing. According to MICS6 2019 findings, the prevalence of child
marriage in the Roma population is still very high (55.7% of women married before turning 18).
Comparing to the data collected in MICS5 2014, there was no visible progress in reducing the practice of
child marriage in the Roma population, while there was a tendency for those practices to increase in the
general population.
The Programme’s design approach and objectives are highly relevant to establishing a coherent model
to address the issue of child marriage in Serbia. The proposed model adopted by the Programme
recognised that working on child marriage through the implementation of either a top-down or the
bottom-up approach alone is not sufficient to ensure substantial and system-wide change. A mixture of
both approaches complemented further with an individualised approach for each specific context was
relevant in ensuring the involvement of a wide variety of key stakeholders needed to address this issue
inclusively. Also, taking into consideration the impact of different local contexts on the prevalence of
child marriage in different communities, the specific relevance of different Programme interventions
attests to the flexibility that has been included in the design of the Programme from the beginning.
All elements of the Programme as defined by the Theory of Change are relevant for the complex issue of
child marriage:
a) Improving data collection, strengthening policy, and developing evidence-based practices. Any
intervention focused on child marriage in Roma communities requires solid evidence and data .
That evidence was initially very limited, particularly concerning the communities which were
targeted by the intervention. Whereas more general data on trends and background
39 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
characteristics of child marriage in Roma communities in Serbia were available from previous
UNICEF MICS surveys, as well as important findings which were available due to previous
ethnographic research commissioned by UNICEF, more specific knowledge about the situation,
including more precise measures on attitudes and behaviours regarding child marriage in
targeted communities was missing. Also, data gaps were present in the form of incomplete or
insufficient administrative records either on child marriage cases, or on girls and families at risk
of child marriage. Administrative data records were not harmonised between the education and
social protection systems - which was an obstacle to a more effective multisectoral response to
child marriage. The Programme design responded to these gaps through the implementation of
baseline and end-line studies implemented by the Institute for Psychology. These studies
provided more specific, contextualized knowledge about the situation in the targeted
communities. The research has also provided insights into attitudes of the beneficiaries within
Roma communities towards child marriage and more broadly towards gender relations, which in
turn has informed better planning and targeting and has offered an opportunity for the
Programme to address key enablers of, and barriers to, the reproduction of the practice of child
marriage.
b) Working with communities – The Programme was relevant to the needs of local communities
which are noticeably affected by child marriage and to the needs of girls at risk of child marriage
or who already got married. At the same time, the Programme was relevant to needs of other
groups in targeted communities whose attitudes and behaviours are critical to addressing these
issues – mothers, boys and fathers, as well as community leaders. The opinions of these
stakeholders were and are important for shaping or changing community norms and practices.
One particularly relevant aspect of the Programme is mentored professional training for girls
and young women who left the educational system, including but not limited to, those who did
so due to marriage and childbirth. This component corresponded well to the needs of these
groups and their limited life chances later in their lives.
c) Working with institutional stakeholders – The Programme responded to the needs of
stakeholders in the systems of education and social protection, whose knowledge, skills and
attitudes are critical in day-to-day work on child marriage and proper response to its challenges.
Having in mind that many of practitioners in both the social protection and the education
systems still hold misconceptions on the practice of child marriage, the Programme’s design was
particularly relevant in addressing this issue, and specifically increasing knowledge of those
practitioners about this practice, helping them understand that this is a form of gender-based
violence, understanding and recognising its causes, removing biases and enabling them to be
ready to intervene in preventing CM through their roles more adequately.
Some of the evidence that supports the argument of weak institutional capacities to identify
child marriages comes from The Instruction on the Operation of Centres for Social Work -
Guardianship Authorities in Protecting Children from Child Marriage, developed within the
programme. According to data for 2019, there were a total of 174 child marriage cases with 87
of these children belonging to families receiving financial social assistance, while the remaining
97 children had not been on the records before. Among them, 43 children come from families
that receive financial support. That means that during the official procedure to determining
whether the conditions for obtaining financial support were met (including field visits), CSW
professionals either had not noticed the risk for the child or had not reported it to the
competent children's service within CSW, or the children's service had not reacted to these
40 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
reports. The Instruction is the first, essential, step in the process of making CSW professionals
more alert to child marriage. In the future, this component will be crucial for the coherence of
the model in terms of the response of CSW professionals in cases when other actors (Roma
health mediators, pedagogical assistants, NGOs) recognise children who are at risk from child
marriage.
The evaluation has confirmed that the drop-out prevention model, developed by the Centre for
Education Policies and UNICEF, which had a broad focus on the design and development of early
warning instruments for children at risk, and which suggested resources for teachers as well as
individual work with students, was extremely relevant as it responded to the life situation and
the needs of girls in targeted communities.
From an interview with a national NGO (recognising the CM cases and reacting appropriately)
It is not the same when children go for seasonal labour and when they are forced to get married. That was
the crucial point, to encourage a dialogue about child marriage in schools. They were aware of the existence
of that practice, but they couldn't deal with it, they didn't know how to react in cases of child marriage.
d) Enhancing multisectoral cooperation – Programme responded to the need for strengthening
multisectoral mechanisms and contributed to achieving a more coherent and better-
coordinated action in response to child marriage in local communities. Multisectoral
cooperation on this issue was weak or almost non-existent in the selected communities before
the Programme. Given that child marriage is a complex phenomenon that does not depend on
one public policy or one sector, the networking of stakeholders was an important part of the
model when it comes to its prevention.
From an interview with an IO
The implemented interventions are very relevant. The establishment of intersectoral teams involved
with the child marriage issue is really important, to connect local institutions with civil society
organisations in order to provide quick and adequate reactions. Because one of the biggest problems,
and drivers too, is the inadequate reaction of local institutions in charge of the issue of child marriage.
e) Building National Coalition (NC) – Programme also responded to the need of diverse
stakeholders to join their efforts in creating a critical mass and providing them with the platform
that yield substantial impact on awareness raising of different groups of the population,
decision-makers, and more successfully advocate for the improvement of the legislative, policy
and institutional frameworks at all levels in response to child marriage. Gathering diverse actors,
from governmental bodies to Roma NGOs, the Coalition provides a broad framework for action
and as such is highly relevant. The aim of the Programme’s interventions, linked to the National
Coalition, was to encourage and create a normative framework that enables national and local
institutions to combat child marriage, particularly encouraging cities, and municipalities to be
active in this field. According to several parties consulted, in practice, the National Coalition (NC)
is just starting with its activities, and the COVID-19 pandemic only placed further limitations on
41 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
what it could do. Nevertheless, the work of the NC continues to be relevant even under the
complex circumstances which were caused by the pandemic. Particularly because of the fact
that planned advocacy activities were postponed from 2020 to 2021 under the pressure of
pandemic restrictive measures. Recent activities of the NC included an official proposal for
changes to the Criminal Code (child marriage is a criminal offence and should be recognized as
human trafficking), the Family Law (abolishing the possibility of marriage before the age of 18),
as well as the Law on Prevention of Domestic Violence (child marriage recognized as domestic
violence). They also include the campaign ‘Childhood, not marriage’. The continuous relevance
of these activities is undoubtful.
KEY FINDING: THE PROGRAMME WAS GROUNDED IN SOLID EVIDENCE, DESIGNED TO TAKE CARE OF THE NEEDS OF
TARGETED GROUPS OF PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES BUT ALSO OTHER DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS.
The Programme design was well-grounded in the long-lasting experience of UNICEF working with
Roma communities, issues of child protection in general and in Roma communities, and work with the
specific phenomenon of child marriage. Although the design of the Programme was not specifically
based on a traditional participatory consultation approach58, this extensive use of research evidence
helped ensure that needs of multiple stakeholders were acknowledged not only at the start and end
points but also during Programme implementation.
The evidence that was crucial in informing Programme design included:
• Two waves of Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys conducted in Serbia and Roma settlements in
2014 and 201959, which revealed the magnitude of child marriage in the general population and
Roma settlements and shed light on socio-economic determinants linked with child marriage;
• The in-depth study on child marriage among Roma was published in 2017 based on thorough
ethnological-anthropological research commissioned by UNICEF and conducted by the Institute
for Ethnography of the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts.60 The study provided
comprehensive knowledge on roots, causes, forms, consequences of child marriage, forming a
solid evidence base for planning the intervention and developing the model for addressing child
marriage issue through Programme which is the subject of this evaluation.
• A baseline study was conducted specifically for the Programme design and implementation61.
• The stakeholders mapping analysis, which provided solid ground for designing the National
Coalition for Ending Child Marriages.
58 Some of the long-term stakeholders had already had an important role in the design of the programme. Well-established
partnerships between UNICEF and NGOs and CBOs ensured the relevance of the programme’s content as it was built on results
of long-lasting partnership and previous successful practices.

Beyond this initial evidence-based Programme design approach, the overall real time evidence-based
approach applied during the Programme implementation enabled an adjustment/(re)design of the
Programme activities continuously during its implementation to better respond to the needs, interests,
or capacities of participating stakeholders. The approach functioned as a real-time evaluation tool,
providing immediate feedback on the situation on the ground and in certain cases freeing up
operational bottlenecks and providing real-time learning. For example, during the first year of
implementation, local Roma organisations recognised the importance of involving boys and men in
programme activities and accordingly in the second year of implementation, The Association of Roma
Students from Novi Sad developed two thematic workshops for Roma men aiming at changing attitudes
towards child marriage, which were implemented initially in Novi Bečej and after that in Belgrade and
Pirot.
Primary beneficiaries and other stakeholders interviewed during the evaluation mission have
confirmed the relevance of the Programme and its components for their needs or the addressing
phenomenon of child marriage more generally. Activities such as social inclusion programmes, thematic
forums and individual work with girls are recognized for their relevance not only in terms of raising
awareness and educating girls and women but for facilitating dialogue and enabling continuity in
working within the community and consequently establishing trust relations that later provide room for
the implementation of new activities. As especially relevant and transformative were emphasized the
activities aimed at the male population that was developed and implemented in Belgrade, Pirot, and
Novi Bečej. These workshops were regarded as a pioneer undertaking and came from a genuine
reflection on the ground that to tackle the issue of child marriage, an inclusive model of empowering
individuals as well as their immediate family and communities are the only way to overcome barriers
and change norms and values.
From an interview with a national NGO
It is particularly important to introduce this topic in the public space but dealing with it demands dedicated long-
term, structural engagement by all stakeholders. Things might not change immediately, like everything else in
Serbia, there is not much changed in the last three years, but some small steps have been made, which is
particularly important. We still have much work to do.

6.2 Coherence
The evaluation of coherence was based on the following evaluation questions:
EQ 3: To what extent has the Programme ensured internal coherence between activities,
results and outcomes?
EQ 4: To what extent has the Programme ensured external coherence with similar
interventions and to what extent is it aligned with international and national laws and
policies related to child marriage, Roma inclusion and gender equality?
6.2.1 Internal coherence between activities, results, and outcomes
KEY FINDING: THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAMME, THE PROGRAMME’S TOC AND THE METHOD OF DELIVERY OF THE
INTERVENTIONS ENSURED INTERNAL COHERENCE AND OUTPUTS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE RESULTS OF THE
INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FED INTO AND BUILT ON EACH OTHER. HOWEVER, IN REGARD TO SOME ELEMENTS OF
THE MODEL COHERENCE WAS UNDERMINED DUE TO THE SHORTFALLS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION RELATED TO THE
COMMITMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL STAKEHOLDERS AND INEFFECTIVE STATUS OF FAMILY OUTREACH WORKERS. IN
OTHER CASES, THE COHERENCE WAS WEAKENED DUE TO THE SPECIFIC LOCAL SETTING, SUCH IN THE CASE OF
BELGRADE.
The internal design of the Programme, expressed clearly in the Programme’ s ToC, included three types
of activities: activities at the level of Roma communities, activities at the level of the wider local
communities and activities at the national level. Given the wide scope of the Programme, the coherence
of the key components and activities within them was supported by UNICEF's key role in coordinating
the key processes, such as establishing the National Coalition to End Child Marriage, as well as close
coordination and management of the different Programme components, both of which are crucial for
the coherence of the Programme implementation. At the same time, the objectives and outcomes of
the programme feed into each other.
The internal coherence of the implemented activities at the level of Roma community, mainly
implemented by Roma NGOs, was high both in terms of careful design of activities and continuous
coordination between Roma NGOs during the programme implementation. Furthermore, the choice of
the workshop topics in all three pilot locations were dedicated to issues of women and children's rights
(discrimination / violence), participation in decision making, education, child marriage, reproductive
health, and Roma traditions, all of which fully correspond to wider issues of child marriage prevention
within the education, social protection, and health sectors, and also correspond to the broader policy
framework on women's and children's rights and anti-discrimination.
Social inclusion activities implemented specifically in form of workshops fit well within the context of the
empowerment of Roma communities and in particular Roma girls and women for whom the Programme
interventions are designed. An example of such practice is the activity "Roma to our town" organized by
the NGO Ternipe from Pirot, which deepens cohesion within the Roma community and also acts
positively in terms of integration into the wider community. These types of intervention have been
available for more than a decade in a more ad-hoc format, however they were adopted by the
44 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
Programme as a good practice worth implementing as part of the wider model and child marriage
approach. This is a good example of the flexible way in which the Programme included existing good
practice, ensuring not only coherence but also continuity of work, implementing these practices in
environments already sensitised to the issue of child marriage, for enhanced impact and effectiveness.
The formal workshop approach was complemented by a more informal set of activities such as
promoting visits outside the Roma settlements, something which is of primary importance for the
personal development and inclusion of young Roma women in the life of the community and helps
prevent child marriage. Likewise, the training courses with mentoring support presented an additional
layer of intervention to Roma girls, promoting the importance of education, economic empowerment
and, consequently, a greater role in decision-making for Roma girls and women.
Turning now to objectives focused on enhancing specific services, the Family Outreach service piloted in
the first year of the Programme in all three locations proved to be a key part of the programme, with the
idea of using this service as a measure to early marriage and child marriage. The fact that this measure
was implemented only in the first year of the programme, due to the government legislative regulations
not being adopted, affected the coherence of the Programme after Year 1. The assumed consistency of
this component with other interventions did not work optimally in practice. The service provider’s
reports state that there was a problem in the selection of families, primarily due to the lack of
experience of the local NGOs to recognize adequate cases in which family outreach workers could make
a full contribution. Also, practice has shown that family outreach workers didn't have much influence in
cases when children were at risk of child marriage and that in such cases the direct influence of the
Centre for Social Work was required. 62Furthermore, the coherence of this element of the model was
assessed by local NGOs and beneficiaries to be weak in localities where there was no cooperation
between CSWs and Roma NGOs. The Family Outreach service was undoubtedly important within the
logic of the Programme since the idea was to reach out to the most vulnerable families and include
them in other programme activities. The idea was to support girls via this service who attend the
workshops but at the same time are at risk of child marriage. So, the activity was in theory coherent
with other programme activities, but due to the lack of support from institutions and no real authority
given to Family Outreach workers, it was not sufficiently effective in practice (see more in the chapter
on effectiveness) and therefore, the coherence of this component of the programme was undermined.
The potential of this component of the model was not fulfilled since there was no opportunity (due to
the fact that government did not provide legal ground for it) to learn from these initial experiences and
improve the service to better fit the model for preventing child marriage as whole.

outreach worker (as a new intensive family-support service for families with complex problems) was piloted and evaluated
before this programme (the process lasted more than 5 years, more than 1000 families involved). Given its positive results, the
idea was to test its effectiveness in this context as well. As you rightly say discontinuation was critical – one year is simply not
sufficient to make all its components work smoothly. Its inclusion into the programme was based on assumption (as there were
very strong indications in that regard from MoLEVSA) that the service will be mainstreamed into the system so its financing will
be secured. Since it didn’t happen and given shortage of programme funds and challenges during the first year, it has been
decided to stop it.

these types of situations, to establish full coherence, while
acknowledging the considerable importance of non-governmental sector participation, it is necessary for
local government to take more proactive role and ensure coordination between diverse stakeholders.
Turning now to interventions aimed at enhancing the capacities of the education and social protection
systems and their ability to cooperate in addressing and preventing child marriage, certain weaknesses
were identified by local NGO partners which might have affected the overall coherence of the
Programme itself, in particular frequently poor communication between educational institutions and
other institutions such as CSW, and their overall slow response (Novi Bečej and Belgrade). In terms of
activities focused on strengthening the role of the Centres for Social Work in the prevention of child
marriage and the formation of the Coalition to End Child Marriage, coherence with other activities was
primarily secured through the creation of mechanisms by which the Centres for Social Work fully
recognize child marriage as a standalone issue.63 This enables the recognition of this phenomenon by
CSWs and thus enables coherence in the process of identifying and preventing child marriage in cases of
Roma children who are at risk.
Finally, the establishment of the National Coalition as one of the Key Results of the Program made an
essential contribution to the coherence of the Programme and the child marriage prevention model.
Bringing together all key stakeholders (national and local institutions, non-governmental sector,
advocacy organisations) contributed considerably to establishing consistent action on the issue of child
marriage. The programme has taken steps to start the work of the National Coalition.

Programme and its results act as an additional advocacy and
evidence-based policy making tool to further the work on the
harmonization of national legislation and public policies with
relevant international conventions (CDC, Istanbul Convention, CEDAW, ICPD), recognizing child marriage
as an act of violence against children64.
The Programme is also in line with international legal and policy documents, in particular with objectives
recognised in 2013 by the UN Human Rights Council Resolution to Strengthen Efforts to Prevent and
Eliminate Child, Early and Forced Marriage and with the SDG goals of ending child, early and forced
marriage globally by 2030, especially those highlighted under Target 5.3 of SDG 5, providing a new
platform to advocate for and take action to end child marriage around the world. The programme
specifically addresses the SDG Indicator 5.3.1: Proportion of women aged 20–24 years who were
married or in a union before age 15 and before age 18.
64 According to the GREVIO report (Baseline Evaluation Report: Serbia. Council of Europe Expert Group on Action against
Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, 2020), the Strategy for the Social Inclusion of Roma in the Republic of Serbia
does not contain special measures to protect Roma women from gender-based violence, including measures to combat early
and forced marriages. In addition, the problem is that the Action Plan for this Strategy for 2019 and 2020 has never been
adopted. Also, one of the goals of the Program was to change the Family Law in the context of recognizing child marriage as an
act of violence against children, but that has not happened yet. Also, the Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence recognises
the problem of child marriage only as a consequence of domestic violence, through the criminal offense of forced marriage
(Article 187a of the Criminal Code) and the criminal offense of extramarital union with a minor (Article 190 of the Criminal
Code). In this way, the problem of multisectoral cooperation arises when child marriage is not a direct consequence of domestic
violence.
In the GREVIO report (ibid), it is stated that the database on types of gender-based violence used within CSWs is not adequate,
especially with respect to early and forced marriage. An improvement is expected pending on the full implementation of the
Instruction for CSWs, which is one of the results of the Programme.
On the other hand, the Strategy for Prevention and Protection of Children from Violence 2020-2023, apart from dealing with
early and forced marriages, specifically recognizes child marriage as a violation of human rights that compromises the well-
being of girls and explicitly requires a ban on marriages of minors. Also, the Strategy for Preventing and Combating Gender-
Based Violence against Women, and Domestic Violence for the period 2021-2025 fully recognizes child marriage as a violation
of children's rights.

The Programme is also fully in line with international agreements that further underscore the
importance of free, full, and informed consent to marriage, including: the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights65, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women66, the
Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages67, and
the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child68.

further economic empowerment. Furthermore, both programmes aimed to improve and strengthen
institutional frameworks, capacities and resources, specifically through improving the framework for the
implementation of the Strategy for Social Inclusion of Roma in the Republic of Serbia 2016 - 2025.
Likewise, the programme activities between the Economic Empowerment of Roma Women: Improving
Employment and Self-Employment Capacities Programme, implemented by NGO Bibija with the support
of GIZ and UNICEF and evaluated Programme have also been harmonised primarily by promoting gender
sensitive measures for employment and gender equality, which further build on empowerment of Roma
women and offer significantly brighter perspectives for economic empowerment of Roma women. The
economic empowerment in itself plays a significant role in reducing incentives for child marriage, among
the girls, their families and also their communities.

A good example of harmonisation with other programmes and of the pooling of resources is also the link
created with the regional programme supported by the EU and UN Women entitled “Implementing
Norms, Changing Minds”. This programme aims at ending gender-based discrimination and violence
against women in the Western Balkans, with a particular focus on the most disadvantaged groups of
women. In attempt to ensure that Serbia adopts and fully implements frameworks aligned with
international norms – including the standards outlined in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Istanbul Convention, the Programme focused on
strengthening the capacity of women’s organizations to hold governments accountable, advocate for
effective implementation, and monitor prevention of and response to violence against women. Beyond
the full implementation of legislative frameworks, the Programme also addresses the structural causes
of gender inequality – and one of its most pervasive expressions, violence against women – through a
transformation of gender discriminatory stereotypes, perceptions, and beliefs. UNICEF’s interventions

combated negative and discriminatory stereotypes and both programmes shared the same goal of

6.3 Effectiveness
The effectiveness of this Programme can be understood as a qualitative measure of immediate and
observable change in the target groups and institutions as a direct result of the implemented activities
and outputs. However, the evaluation team has not used the approach of measuring individual results of
the activities but has rather focused on assessing whether the Programme has been effective as a model
of intervention towards ending child marriage, using the effectiveness criteria as mentioned in the ToC.
Alongside this, in Annex 7, we have identified the extent to which the individual interventions were (or
were not) implemented according to the outputs and indicators set out in the original results
framework.
The evaluation of effectiveness was based on the following evaluation questions:

The baseline and end-line data collected through the surveys implemented by the Programme provided
a wealth of new information on social norms, knowledge, attitudes, perception of girls and their parents
on girls' education, reproductive health, and social participation, in addition to facilitating better
measurement of the success of the Programme interventions.
50 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
The Programme has contributed to improving monitoring of the practice of child marriage within the
social protection system, including the gender and national structure of the children victims of child
marriage, as well as the educational structure of children and parents of children victims of child
marriage at the national level. Evidence was collected through a household survey covering general
demographic data on household members, including age, marital status, education, marriage and
childbirth, as well as data on attitudes toward child marriage but also about some broader relevant
gender relations and practices. The survey was conducted in Belgrade (800 Roma households in the 8
designated settlements), Novi Bečej (400 households) and Pirot (600 households). The actual number of
families has been established which is a prerequisite for assessments of the impact that child marriage
has on them.
The Analysis of the normative framework and practices related to child marriage of CSWs and the
Instructions on the code of conduct of the social welfare system in response to child marriage,
developed within the programme, have improved operational procedures, also around data gathering,
and has enabled early warning of child marriage. Data collected based on the Instructions have enabled
deeper insight into the child marriage issue and the response of the centres for social work to child
marriage. Key stakeholders said in interview that significant changes to the social protection database
were made to allow for more accurate data collection by CSWs on child marriage specifically.
Data collection following these new formats has been improved as is evident from the data reported
by RISP. However, due to delays with the technology routine data collection by CSWs needs further
improvements. The statistics collected are not yet routinely utilized for the planning of future
interventions. Data sharing also needs to be better addressed, as is visible in the low rate of response of
CSWs approached recently to provide data for policy analysis conducted by the organisation Praxis.
6.3.2 Strengthening the role and leadership of local Roma communities in the fight
against child marriage
KEY FINDING: THE PROGRAMME INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN BUILDING ON AND UPGRADING A
LARGE VARIETY OF TRAINING ACTIVITIES AND SOCIAL AND INTERPERSONAL EVENTS FOR GIRLS AND BOYS AND
MOTHERS AND FATHERS IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE THREE LOCAL NGOS WERE ALREADY IMPLEMENTING
ACTIVITIES.
Various activities implemented during the programme, such as training activities, interpersonal events
for girls as well other groups in targeted communities covered important issues such as reproductive
health, gender roles, negotiation, and decision-making, as well psychosocial and socio-educational
workshops with girls focusing on information and skills, particularly around life aspirations. They
included contents adapted for each location and resulted in a well-tested methodology on increasing
knowledge of reproductive health for Roma girls and women. Under the Programme, a model of
workshops to influence the attitudes of Roma men and boys towards child marriage that could be
repeated and replicated in other communities was developed and successfully tested. Young Roma men
and women increased their capacities as trainers for work on child marriage and as positive role models
in the communities. Girls from Roma communities were successfully encouraged to enrol and/or
continue education especially while in transition periods, such as enrolment in elementary school,
transition to 5th grade of elementary school or the transition from primary school to secondary school.
KEY FINDING: THE PROGRAMME HAS CONTRIBUTED TO ROMA ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS BEING
RECOGNIZED BY OTHER LOCAL ACTORS AS ORIGINATORS OF THE INTERVENTIONS AGAINST CHILD MARRIAGE.
51 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
The Programme has contributed to the important collaboration of Roma organizations with the
education system in preventing child marriage, as schools recognized them as partners who provide
valuable and timely information on children at risk of dropping out and child marriage. They have also
increased their role in strengthening capacities of the teachers/school staff in assisting workshops,
planning measures or early risk identification.
At the national level, Roma organizations have played a significant role in the National Coalition to End
Child Marriage and one of the organizations is a co-chair of the Coalition. Local expertise and good
practices in fighting child marriage in Roma communities are recognized and validated at the national
level through the Coalition. The design of the local levels of the Programme intervention, working with
Roma communities, aimed to mobilise individuals, communities and relevant professionals, creating a
strong constituency for NGOs, resulting in support to NGO efforts to bring the issues on to the national
agenda. This is another contribution to Roma participation in the Coalition.
KEY FINDING: THE PROGRAMME HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO OPENING A DIALOGUE WITHIN ROMA
SETTLEMENTS ON THE HARMFUL IMPACT ON CHILD MARRIAGE.
Intergenerational workshops with boys and men were assessed as successful by participant as a way of
starting the dialogue within Roma settlements and in the wider community on the harmful impact of
child marriage. Those workshops provided both formal and, more importantly, informal forums, during
breaks and after the workshops, for men and boys, often from the same extended families and of
different ethnicities, to openly discuss and exchange information on the topic. The interventions have
contributed to increasing awareness of child marriage and its harmful effects (also on boys). However, it
is felt by the participants of those workshops that the Programme did not last long enough to result in
actual changes in behaviour that would show significant changes in power relations in local
communities. Since the success in raising awareness of the harmful effect of child marriage was uneven
across the municipalities, the intervention was repeated in those communities where it took longer to
achieve changes. Both the interviews with the beneficiaries and the results of the end-line study clearly
show the changes in attitudes among Roma girls participating in the programme (see more in chapter on
impact). Girls and women have a more critical view of child marriage after the intervention, and they
now consider that that the practice of child marriage was more common in the past than today. This has
also been confirmed by the findings of the end-line research: among the girls that participated in the
programme, there was a lower share of those who got married and who left education, and the average
desired age for marriage among them has increased.
On the question of the success in increasing online connectivity and raising awareness of the child
marriage programme with a view of expanding opportunities for linking with peers, role models and
education activities, the evaluation established that the planned activity of connecting up to five Roma
settlements to the Internet has not been implemented, due to high costs and some technical issues. The
component related to linking with peers and role models was substituted by establishing groups using
the WhatsApp digital platform.
The Programme has been effective in raising awareness on the issue of child marriage as part of gender-
based violence and its harmful effects on girls. These Programme activities were complemented through
a partnership with the Roma NGO Novi Svet and their Roma radio activities. It can be judged that
awareness of the issue of child marriage has been increased through media activities, such as the highly
visible campaign of 16 days of activism against violence against women and girls, which also included
52 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
the campaign “Child Marriage is not a Roma tradition”, that had wide media coverage. The Programme
and National Coalition were specifically focused to communicate positive role models (through human
interest stories, videos, their participation at other external youth events, etc.) which also contributed to
their recognition.
The Programme has had some significant success in supporting those families who already had a critical
attitude towards child marriage, supporting their children in getting an education and participating in
social activities in the community. However, neither schools nor NGOs had the capacity to reach the
most vulnerable families, those whose children did not regularly attend schools or who lived in remote
areas or were vulnerable in other aspects, so the role of the CSW remained crucial. The Programme has
contributed to some extent to directing welfare services more towards those families where there was a
risk of child marriage. But there were the usual obstacles in reaching such families, for instance their
lack of trust in institutions or an insufficient number of CSW professionals (case managers).
6.3.3. Strengthening coordination and action to end child marriage at local and
national levels
KEY FINDING: THE PROGRAMME HAS SUCCEEDED TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT IN INCREASING CAPACITIES OF LOCAL
STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS CHILD MARRIAGE, AND ENHANCED LOCAL COORDINATION OF KEY
STAKEHOLDERS.
The policy changes introduced (the new Instructions and particularly the accompanying indicators
developed within the programme) have provided welfare professionals with tools for improved
recognition and identification of girls at risk of child marriage and offered a framework that enabled
them to utilise and commit to a problem-solving approach in tackling the root causes of child marriage,
i.e. in as many interventions in one family as needed until the identified problem has been solved.
From an interview with a CSW professional
The benefit from this Programme for our institution is that we have received the Instruction from the Ministry
on the code of conduct in relation to the risk of child marriage. That is very important for all centres, as it was
not directed only at the centres and local communities included in the Programme, but it came out of it and it
is beneficial for all Centres for Social Work at the level of the Republic.
…
It is even more important that, together with this Instruction, we received some indicators that are much more
important for the CSW professionals so that they can identify it (a risk of child marriage) while working with a
family on another form of social protection.
However, the training programmes developed based on the new guidelines/instructions for case
managers were not delivered to CSW professionals as planned and it is yet to be assessed whether the
new guidelines have been successfully implemented.
According to the respondents coming from the local education institutions, the Programme has
contributed to the capacities of the education system to better understand the nature of child marriage,
its causes and consequences and therefore better recognize risks of child marriage, and to be able to
link it to dropout and to recognize early warning signs. Schools are also now recognized by other local
actors as the primary environment for early warning of risks of child marriage via information on school
53 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
dropout. The system of Unique Education Number that will soon be put in place, as planned by the
Education Strategy 2020, will provide a unique identifier for each child and will enable more systematic
collection of data, including those relevant for additional support to child’s education. School
representatives and teachers also confirm that the most important collaboration is with the CSWs. This
has been helped by the role of pedagogical assistants who have been equipped to prevent children
dropping out of school and recognize the link to risks of child marriage. The pedagogical assistants have
established a community of practice and, in collaboration with CSWs and NGOs, have managed to bring
back to school some girls who changed their minds after marrying young, and some young mothers who
wanted to continue their education after they had children. Material support for education (in the form
of school supplies) has been singled out as a very effective and much-needed intervention. Efforts have
been made towards supporting and mentoring Roma girls to return to secondary schools or complete
vocational courses to enable them to get a job. 70 girls and young mothers have completed vocational
training and 30 girls have received mentorship support. In spite of all this, some girls who attended the
mentorship programme did marry young, but at least they completed the vocational training.
Overall, intersectoral collaboration at the local level has been effectively improved due to the
Programme interventions. Collaboration among the schools, CSWs and Roma organisations have been
strengthened in all the municipalities/communities. The cross-sectoral meetings facilitated with RISP in
partnership with local Roma CSOs were held in all three Programme locations. In one of the
municipalities (Novi Bečej), an Agreement on the prevention of violence against children was signed
between the NGO and the Prosecutor’s Office. This had positive effects of changes in understanding of
the issue of child marriage by representatives of this institution. Yet, the intersectoral collaboration has
been more effective in two and less effective in one of the communities where the interventions were
implemented.
From an interview with a national NGO
As for the prosecution, I also wanted to say that we had a very good cooperation with them, so we inquired
about some cases to refer us to this and that, since we signed with them exactly the name of the Agreement on
the Suppression of Violence against Children. We were the initiators of that agreement through the
programme, and this is what it is called when a representative of the prosecution was here to visit us, what is
his name, we were surprised by his opinion and his support. They want to get involved through some activity
and they think that in some way the Roma community is not guilty because they are not informed, they do not
know that it is a crime. They don't know what the consequences are when it happens and when you tell them
they say I didn't know that…
So I think that this program was very successful because we achieved cooperation, whatever cooperation we
achieved. We have some support, we see that they also care, that they want to react after that and that the
opinion is changing, that somewhere in the beginning some senior employees in those institutions were of the
opinion that it is a Roma custom where in the end it all changes, when through those meetings with them they
state that they were wrong and that it is not so and that it can be worked on. So I think that, at least 70 percent
of that has been done properly and you can see the success.
KEY FINDING: THE PROGRAMME’S INTERVENTION HAS SUCCEEDED (AT LEAST INITIALLY) TO STRENGTHEN
COORDINATION AND ACTION IN ADDRESSING CHILD MARRIAGE BY ESTABLISHING NATIONAL COALITION FOR
ENDING CHILD MARRIAGE AS AN IMPORTANT GENERAL PLATFORM FOR ACTION WHICH DID NOT EXIST BEFORE,
GATHERING TOGETHER BOTH LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY INSTITUTIONS, ORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH A
RESPONSIBILITY TO COMBAT, AND/OR ACTIVE IN COMBATING, CHILD MARRIAGE.
54 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
The stakeholders at all levels pointed out that the strongest evidence of the Programme effectiveness, in
terms of enhanced awareness raising, is the Coalition’s work on bringing the topic of child marriage
more strongly into public discourse, contributing to the use of adequate language when speaking about
child marriage, and understanding child marriage as a form of violence against children and a result of
wider issues of gender inequalities, discrimination, poverty and cultural norms that devalue women and
girls. The effectiveness of the Programme is also visible in the Coalition’s work ensuring that child
marriage is singled out as a specific problem, and as such has been specifically targeted within the
context of protection and prevention of violence against children, with a comprehensive understanding
of its complex nature. Furthermore, the Coalition has improved transparency, information exchange
and, to a significant extent, coordination of various activities of different stakeholders aiming at
preventing and ending child marriage through the formal planning of activities of each institution and
organisation, in order to avoid overlaps. Further support to the Coalition during 2021-2022 has been
secured through Joint UN Programme “Integrated Response to Violence against Women and Girls in
Serbia, Phase III”, supported by SIDA.
Moreover, the interventions focused on supporting the Coalition’s work have been effective and
recognised as an example of a good mixture of top-down and bottom-up approaches, which have
brought recognition to local experts and have validated local successes in tackling child marriage, and
which have enabled local organisations to act at the national level whilst simultaneously providing the
local level with valuable coordination and policy guidance on ending child marriage.
The Programme interventions have been effective in integrating measures to end child marriage in key
national policies. Namely, the Programme has provided important inputs to the draft strategy on child
marriage and provided close coordination with previously adopted Strategy for the Prevention of and
Protection of Children from Violence (2020 – 2023), along with the Action Plan for 2020 and 2021. This
Strategy includes definitions of child marriage, forced marriage and early marriage, all of them
recognized as a severe violation of the rights of children and girls in particular. Important legislative
amendments to the Family Law to prohibit child marriage (by changing the current age limit for
marriage from 16 to 18) and to include a definition of child marriage, forced marriage and early
marriage, have been prepared, but getting them adopted will require further advocacy efforts. The
Programme has identified gaps in national legislation and policy, particularly relating to implementing
regulations of relevant strategies, such as in the Strategy for the Social Inclusion of Roma in the Republic
of Serbia (2016-2025), that does not address child marriage and does not have an action plan for its
implementation. Over the last period, the important initiatives related to the amending Criminal Code
were also initiated, as well as initiative to amend the Law on Prevention of Domestic Violence, which will
enable that coordination teams for prevention of domestic violence can also deal with child marriage.
6.3.4 Indirect or unforeseen effects, contribution towards improvement of the
position of Roma girls and Roma communities
An important, complementary, strategy in addressing the attitudes of Roma males towards child
marriage was developed and implemented during 2019 in one programme site (Novi Bečej), and then it
was replicated in the other two in 2020 (Pirot and Belgrade). The approach re-examines child marriage
as part of Roma heritage and questions the dominant attitudes and beliefs of Roma males through male-
to-male dialogue in interactive workshops. The Roma male attitude change has been reported in all
three programme sites.
No negative unforeseen effects on Roma communities and Roma girls have been identified.

6.3.5 Main internal intervention factors contributing to effective implementation and
achievement of results in key outcome areas
KEY FINDING: THE ENGAGEMENT OF LOCAL ORGANISATIONS AND OTHER AVAILABLE MECHANISMS, SUCH AS FAMILY
OUTREACH WORKERS, ROMA HEALTH MEDIATORS AND PEDAGOGICAL ASSISTANTS WERE ALL CRUCIAL FOR
ENSURING THAT THE INTERVENTIONS STARTED FROM THE NEEDS OF THE ROMA COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS,
AND FOR CONTINUING THEIR WORK IN THE PREVENTION OF CHILD MARRIAGE, SUPPORTING FAMILIES AND GIRLS AT
RISK OF CHILD MARRIAGE, IN ESTABLISHING CONTINUOUS RELATIONSHIPS OF TRUST AND SUPPORT.
The evaluation has found that the Programme design considered the specific needs of the Programme
intervention areas and their Roma communities. In the Programme sites where the local organisations
and local government were already collaborating well, the Programme intervention built on the
previous good practice in working with Roma communities. The Roma NGOs commended the
Programme design’s recognition of Roma communities as equal partners whose participation from the
beginning was essential for the success. Involvement of Roma women’s organizations ensured access to
girls, women, and families in the communities where issues of communication and trust building were
specifically important. The involvement of Roma men in the interventions in the communities was
successful in achieving changes in attitudes towards child marriage in the targeted communities and
families.
The Programme aspired to address gaps in providing a coherent response to child marriage that does
not overlap with any other work or interventions of the relevant institutions and organizations. This
requires that individuals and organizations active in fighting child marriage as well as local institutions
each recognise their scope of work and work together towards the same goal. Interviews with local
institutions and NGOs pointed out that in the communities where such collaboration already existed,
the interventions were more successful. The intervention in Belgrade, that could not be considered a
single community that could be mobilized to provide support, had to be modified as there were a
number of external factors and events that affected the original intervention design: Roma families were
moved from one settlement to a number of other settlements in different municipalities, which fell into
the catchment of different CSWs, and made it impossible to bring together schools and CSWs in a
number of cases. The intervention focused on directly targeting girls at risk and young women in Roma
communities who dropped out of education and on working with boys and men addressing their
attitudes towards child marriage.
The main factors that inhibited the effectiveness in key outcome areas can be identified as:
• the lack of clear responsibilities and roles of all sectors/institutions, particularly but not only at
the national level: a key external factor;
• the lack of accountability at higher-level institutions, which can be seen as an issue of political
culture, preventing an effective intersectoral response: a key external factor.
The Programme has contributed to strengthening the capacities of the local organisations both through
their engagement in the communities as implementing partners and through their management role in
the National Coalition to End Child Marriage. At the same time, it has also contributed to building
knowledge of child marriage among national actors and government institutions, due to the exchange
with the local organisations who have expertise in fighting child marriage. These partnerships have had
56 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
effects on the local level through the implementation of the new methodology of work and approach in
dealing with the issue of child marriage.
The Programme implementation strategies have resulted from a mix of top-down approaches,
addressing the issue of child marriage at the national level, and at the level of local of Roma
communities and at the level of individuals. The task of achieving an effective balance between this
diversity of interventions and partnership with many (various) stakeholders has been a challenge and at
this moment, the evaluation is satisfied that the implementation strategies have been effective given
the resources and time limitations. However, as leaving school and entering child marriage are two
interrelated phenomena, it is significant that the end-study shows that every third girl who was included
in the Programme (38%) left school before completing secondary education, which is still significantly
lower than among the girls who lived in the Programme sites but did not participate in it. Therefore, the
evaluation finds that a more comprehensive intervention should be implemented to achieve the 2030
outcome.
This Programme could be seen as bringing necessary changes in the social protection sector in dealing
with child marriage. The social protection sector, in particular CSWs, is seen by all stakeholders as a key
duty bearer in child protection, given that it is the ultimate institution that can impose and implement
effective measures, when necessary, while the Programme has contributing to strengthening its
preventative role as well as. The education sector, health sector or NGOs can work more in the area of
prevention or referral. This implies that the social protection sector could have been more in the focus
of the intervention meaning inevitably that more resources should be allocated.
KEY FINDING: THE EVALUATION EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE PROGRAMME INTERVENTION HAS NOT YET RESULTED
IN A SYSTEMIC RESPONSE TO CHILD MARRIAGE.
The system bottlenecks are mainly reflected in the lack of an adequate response from the decision-
makers: ministries and the institutions responsible for prosecution services and sanctioning. As the
evidence shows, the National Coalition has not yet succeeded in building consensus, acknowledgment,
and prioritization around the importance of this particular child rights violation that primarily affects
girls/boys from an already discriminated minority groups. It is hard to say at this point whether these
systemic bottlenecks will be addressed in the future work of the government and its partners, as it is an
issue that can be dependent on the functioning of the National Coalition, as an adequate platform for
keeping the issue of child marriage in focus. Also, adequate funding for achieving the identified strategic
goals is another bottleneck, resulting, among other things, in the discontinuation of the work of family
outreach workers, thus affecting individualized work with vulnerable families. In order to implement
positive changes to data collection and capacity building efforts or the continuation of the activities that
were only implemented in the first year of the Programme, additional budget allocations both at
national and local levels would be required for sustainable changes to be made in the various social
services systems.
KEY FINDING: THE PROGRAMME HAS HAD LIMITED SUCCESS IN REACHING THE MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES DUE TO
A NUMBER OF FACTORS, THE MOST IMPORTANT BEING THE USUAL FACTORS THAT EXCLUDE THOSE FAMILIES FROM
OTHER COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES.
The integration of child marriage into the activities of family outreach workers has proved to be
important in overcoming trust issues towards institutions in targeted families, as well as the provision of
material resources supporting girls to stay in school. The fact that the FOWs were discontinued after the
57 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
first year of the Programme is found to have significantly influenced the effectiveness of the
intervention. The material resources helped provide incentives for getting involved in the Programme
but were not limited to the duration of the Programme. Additionally, local government has not been
very visible in terms of providing support or ensuring the sustainability of the interventions.
KEY FINDING: OVERALL, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC DID NOT HINDER THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE PLANNED RESULTS,
BUT IT DID HAMPER THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUSTAINABILITY MEASURES
The vast majority of the activities were completed, and the targets were achieved before the start of the
pandemic: out of 32 activities, the COVID-19 pandemic affected five, of which three related to the
functioning of the National Coalition. Four of the five were rescheduled.
The training programme for social protection professionals (case managers on the new Instruction) and
the Guide for dealing with child marriage were not completed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, thus it
was not possible to strengthen the capacities of case managers. This could be considered a major gap
which has significantly affected the ability to sustainably implement new guidelines and protocols and
increase coordination on the local level. An adjusted short version of the training was planned to be
delivered online, but the activity was not completed. Three online panels were organized for 47 CSW
caseworkers from 16 CSWs (November-December 2020).
The re-test research, utilising a survey of girls and mothers to focus on perceived social norms,
knowledge, attitudes and behaviour towards education, reproductive health and social participation was
originally scheduled for September 2020, but it was re-scheduled due to COVID-19. This did not affect
the achievement of the output as the Report was produced in February 2021 and was available to this
evaluation.
The COVID-19 pandemic affected the dynamics and the planned results of the work of the National
Coalition to End Child Marriage which was put on hold during 2020. What was planned for 2020
happened in 2021 – 1. Campaign “Childhood, not marriage” and 2. Launching the initiative for
amendments of three laws and The last Programme year (2020) was supposed to be marked with the
advocacy and visibility efforts by the National Coalition, however, it could not have been done. This
could potentially diminish the focus and the momentum around the issue of child marriage that was
created by the Coalitions’ good work.

6.4 Efficiency
EQ 10: To what extent did the Programme provide an efficient framework for delivery
of services to companies, utilisation of resources, and accounting for results?
The Programme had a total budget of US$ 510,099 of which US$ 382,000 was allocated to the
Programme interventions as per the key areas identified by the Programme’s logic pathway. While the
subject of this evaluation is not to assess whether the total interventions were adequately budgeted,
important results have been achieved for the allocated resources. However, the evaluation team finds
that the interventions in the social protection sector are seen as a sector reform which requires a
longer-term approach and a larger financial commitment.
It has not been established whether the Programme has made any efforts in securing financial
sustainability of the results achieved, apart from the partnership with GIZ that would replicate the
model in several new municipalities and the financing of the National Coalition through Joint UN
Programme “Integrated Response to Violence against Women and Girls in Serbia, Phase III” (financed by
SIDA). However, the Costing of the Child Marriage Prevention Model document provides detailed
financial information needed for planning and implementing future interventions on ending child
marriage.
The results of the Programme were not significantly affected by contextual factors due to the effective
monitoring mechanism which allowed for modifications and adjustments of the intervention in a simple
procedure initiated by the partners and based on mutual trust.
KEY FINDING: THE STEERING AND MANAGEMENT OF THE PROGRAMME WERE WELL BALANCED AND RESULT-
ORIENTED IN PRACTICE.
This means that the Programme interventions were flexible, and this flexibility was already included in
the original programme design. Likewise, the monitoring of the Programme progress was done both
through UNICEF’s monitoring mechanism and also through daily contact with partners, which has
resulted in timely minor modifications and adjustments in the interventions "on the go" as proposed by
the implementing partners based on changes in the context or the priorities of the beneficiaries. For
example, the Programme changed the intervention in Belgrade, as it was concluded that the
intervention had to be different in this city. These changes were implemented quite quickly, as the
programme plans developed by the partner organisations identifying programme activities, which
included budgets and changes of activities, were possible without additional budget funding.
KEY FINDING: THE MONITORING TOOLS ALLOWED FOR AND FACILITATED CHANGES IN THE PROGRAMME LEVEL.
The most important monitoring tool is found to be continuous communication with the partners.
Modifications of up to 20% of the budget could be approved by e-mail, which ensured solid financial
59 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
monitoring and use of not only financial but also HR resources, avoiding unnecessary additional
administration.
KEY FINDING: AN ISSUE OF UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES WAS NOTED.
Members of government institutions were not remunerated for their engagement in the Programme
and they brought up this as an issue: that they were expected to implement activities which they saw as
add-on without additional remuneration, unlike the non-government organisations. However, this is not
a unique issue for this Programme, given that the policy of most donor organisations is not to provide
remuneration to government officials for activities that they carry out within the scope of their duty.
On the other hand, more on a general note, a real problem is that there are practically non-existent
funds from domestic sources which can be allocated to activities to end child marriage. Local
governments generally want to participate if there are funds provided by donors and most activities are
funded through programme funds, including funding for positions such as the Roma coordinator in the
municipalities.
KEY FINDING: THE EVALUATION FINDS THAT THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EDUCATION SEGMENT AND
THE FAMILY OUTREACH SERVICE OF THE INTERVENTION MODEL TO END CHILD MARRIAGE WERE NOT THE MOST
COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO OBTAIN THE EXPECTED RESULTS OF THE PROGRAMME.
A significant amount of Programme funds was given to the schools and for the family outreach service,
but the design of this part of the intervention was not best suited to address the problem of child
marriage. Namely, the schools included in the intervention did not seem to be well prepared, very few
people were actually engaged in the implementation and awareness of the problem was very low at the
beginning. Also, according to the COP report, the mentoring work was very narrowly designed, which
could be interpreted as a waste of resources given how low the goals were set.
The family outreach service is assessed to be not entirely efficient intervention as it could not be
sustained beyond the first year of the Programme. This intervention was undoubtedly important in
terms of reaching out to the most vulnerable families and supporting girls who are at risk of CM.
However, the actual reach of Family Outreach Workers was limited since they faced obstacles in
establishing cooperation with local CSWs, particularly in Novi Bečej and Belgrade. Also, according to the
service provider’s reports, the selection of the families for the work of the FOW was problematic,
primarily due to insufficient experience of the local NGOs to recognize cases in which FOWs could make
an efficient contribution.

6.5 Impact
Impact is evaluated at the level of the overall programme outcome and at the level of Key Results. As
described in the introductory chapters, the overall outcome of the programme was expressed as:
Girls fully enjoy their childhood free from the risk of marriage: experience healthier, safer and more
empowered life, including making choices and decisions about their education, sexuality, relationship
formation/marriage, and childbearing.
Three planned Key Results were:
1. Strengthened data collection, policy, and practice
2. Strengthened role and leadership of local Roma communities in the fight against child marriage
3. Strengthened coordination and action at the national level to end child marriage in Serbia by
2030
This section of the evaluation focusses on assessing changes that can be attributed particularly to this
programme and aims to highlight specifically contributions to higher-level impact (both intended and
unintended). The evaluation team tried particularly to capture both intended and unintended results of
the intervention and assessed them at different levels: individual, group, community level, system, and
the whole of society.
As the programme framework does not contain outcome level indicators but rather only states output
levels, the evaluation of impact relied on mixed (but mainly qualitative) indicators as defined in the
evaluation framework.
The findings on impact are presented along with the key evaluation questions:
EQ11: What potential short and/or long-term effects has the
Programme had on individual Roma girls and women and on selected
local communities that benefited from the Programme intervention?
EQ 12: What was the impact of the Programme on the Roma
communities?
EQ 13: What was the impact of the Programme on the system at local
and national levels?
EQ 14: What was the impact of the Programme on the broader
mobilisation of stakeholders in combating child marriage?

6.5.1 Potential short/long-term effects of Programme on the individual Roma girls and
women and selected local communities benefiting from the Programme intervention
KEY FINDING: THE PROGRAMME INTERVENTIONS IN ROMA SETTLEMENTS HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE
ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOURS OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS AMONG WHOM THE PROPORTION OF THOSE WHO LEFT
EDUCATION BEFORE COMPLETING SECONDARY SCHOOL WAS MUCH LOWER AS WAS VISIBLE IN THE RESULTS OF
POST-TEST SURVEY AND THE INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS WITH BENEFICIARIES OF THE PROGRAMME.
The Programme significantly contributed to changes in attitudes on child marriage among girls living in
targeted Roma settlements and played an important role in supporting the girls in expressing and
exercising their choices against child marriage. However, this contribution should be understood in
interaction with other important structural and normative factors, since the impact was larger where
girls were already more critical towards child marriage and better integrated into the education
system. However, the evidence also points to an ‘empowerment paradox’: While girls were
empowered to refuse offers of early marriage, they felt equally emboldened to use their power to
decide to get married at an early age, as demonstrated through their narratives during the evaluation.
The narrative evidence from the evaluation undoubtedly shows the contribution of the programme to
the changes in attitudes towards child marriage among girls living in targeted Roma settlements who
participated in the programme activities. Quantitative evidence supporting this finding can be found
also in the post-test study: a much lower share of girls who married, left education or who do not see
the benefits of secondary education among those girls who participated in the programme in
comparison to those who did not participate.

Additionally, among underage girls who participated in the programme only 3% got married between
the pre-test and post-test surveys, while among underage girls who did not attend programme activities
that percent is much higher: 19.7% got married. Moreover, girls from the targeted settlements viewed
sexual intercourse before marriage and having a boyfriend as acceptable in a significantly higher
proportion than girls from settlements in the control group.

The Programme has had an impact also on the attitudes towards a desirable age for marriage and
childbearing. Among girls participating in the programme, the average desirable age for marriage has
increased from 21.4 to 22.4 years, while in settlements from the control group there was no significant
change (Institute for Psychology, Child marriage – two years later, Belgrade 2020).
Due to their participation in the programme activities, the girls were also empowered to rely more on
their own autonomous decisions. However,

enabling environment for better integration of Roma children and particularly Roma girls in schools, less
rigid patriarchal structures within the families or in the immediate social environment. In such contexts,
girls were already more critical towards early marriages, and they often expressed the desire not to
repeat the same life-course patterns of their mothers. In such circumstances, the programme had a
stronger impact as its effects complemented already initiated positive changes.
Finally, aside from self-assessed changes captured through FGDs, these changes in girl’s attitudes were
also noted by the professionals interviewed by the evaluation team. Teachers working with girls
targeted by programme activities also reported noticeable changes related to the girls’ self-confidence.
Even if some changes in attitudes and distancing from dominant norms in their communities had taken
place before programme activities, the participation in the workshops gave a legitimacy to these girls to
continue with the development of views which are distinctive from dominant community norms.
6.5.2 Impact of the interventions on the new perspectives on child marriage among
different stakeholders/Programme beneficiaries
KEY FINDING: THE PROGRAMME IMPACT WAS VISIBLE ON MOTHERS, MALE PEERS AND MEN IN THE TARGETED
COMMUNITIES, AS WELL AS ON PROFESSIONALS IN LOCAL INSTITUTIONS (SCHOOLS AND CENTRES FOR SOCIAL
WORK) ENGAGED IN THE RESPONSE TO CHILD MARRIAGE, AS WELL AS ON NATIONAL LEVEL STAKEHOLDERS,
PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN OR COOPERATED WITH THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR ENDING CHILD
MARRIAGE.
Professionals working in the welfare and education system, as well as those from other institutions
participating in the multisectoral response to child marriage, better understand after participating in the
Programme the nature and causes of child marriage, value cooperation more highly in addressing the
causes of child marriage and have better skills to do so due to newly acquired knowledge, skills, and
tools. The evidence suggests that Programme interventions contributed to the abandonment of
frequently held prejudice among professionals that child marriage is limited to Roma communities
and that it represents an ethnic custom rather than a distinct form of gender-based violence on girls
as defined by the Istanbul Convention.
Though the implementation period was too short to enable a large scale and profound impact on
diverse stakeholders’ understanding and views on child marriage, many short-term impacts are visible.
In addition to the already-described impact on attitudes of girls living in targeted communities, there
was a visible impact on their mothers, male peers and men in the same communities (which will be
described further in the following section), as well as on professionals in local institutions engaged in the
response to child marriage, particularly schools and centres for social work, as well as on national level
stakeholders, particularly those who participated in or cooperated with the National Coalition for Ending
Child Marriage.

Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
know what to do or how to react when informed about individual cases of child marriage. However,
after their participation in programme activities, their awareness of child marriage has significantly
increased, and they learned how to recognize early warning signals for risks of child marriage and how
to react in such cases. An important role in their learning processes was played by examples of good
practices from local communities which showed higher achievement in preventing and combating child
marriage (for example the work of the Centre for social work from Zrenjanin). With increased skills for
early identification of girls under risk of child marriage, and knowledge on how to tackle it, their
motivation to address the problem increased. Women from targeted Roma communities also reported
during focus group discussions that the change among professionals from CSWs was visible. They
started to behave differently towards them, showing them more understanding.
The programme’s impact was likewise in reducing stereotypes towards child marriage that are
widespread across different groups of stakeholders and at different levels of governance as well as
across diverse communities. The preconception that child marriage is a custom, a tradition linked solely
and specifically to Roma culture, and not a severe social problem that is deeply rooted in social exclusion
and poverty was addressed and removed among participating stakeholders. Local stakeholders, Roma
NGOs in particular, indicated the importance of this kind of change in knowledge and attitudes. The fact
that now early marriage shows sign of increase in the general population (though still relatively low),
contributes to the understanding of child marriage is not only limited to Roma communities, but also to
other groups which use it as an adverse strategy for coping with the poverty. Therefore, the programme
managed to highlight the social rather than the cultural nature of the problem. Stakeholder awareness
was also raised with the support of a firm legal framework that defines child marriage as a form of
gender-based violence, grounded in the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating
Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, which Serbia has ratified in 2014.
6.5.3 The impact of the Programme on the Roma communities
KEY FINDING: DUE TO LIMITED TIME AND SCALE, THE PROGRAMME WAS NOT ABLE INTRODUCE PROFOUND
CHANGES IN TARGETED COMMUNITIES, BUT THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT HAS OPENED A DIALOGUE ON CHILD
MARRIAGE IN TARGETED ROMA COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING BROADER GROUPS OF MEN AND BOYS, WOMEN, AND
GIRLS, RAISING THE VISIBILITY OF THE ISSUE AND PROVIDING ARGUMENTS AGAINST CHILD MARRIAGE.
There are also indications that Programme-supported processes challenge strong traditional patriarchal
structures both within the family and the community, however as the Programme has only recently
ended it is too early to ascertain how big a shift it has brought in terms of gender relations and overall
power dynamics.
What is already clear is that the Programme activities have introduced a new dynamic to the targeted
communities. During workshops discussions, which were separate for mothers and girls and boys and
fathers in targeted communities, a dynamic dialogue transpired. Participants were ready to share their
own adverse experiences due to their own early marriages or those of their parents and they felt
empowered to express openly opinions that were often not positive towards the practice of early
marriages. The most visible effects of the interactions and dialogues facilitated by the Programme were
among mothers who often expressed an aspiration for their daughters not to marry early, to continue
with education, achieve a significant level of economic independence and to better plan and time their
transition to married life and motherhood so as not to miss on life chances, as was the case with their
own lives. Some of the representatives of implementing organizations said that mothers would often
stay after the workshops for additional advice, for example on the education of their daughters.

Although the influence of mothers’ opinions has a crucial role in shaping attitudes, preferences and life
choices of girls, the in-community workshops confirmed that the key strategic decisions were still in
hands of the girl’s fathers: the typical patriarchal power dynamic in Roma families. Consequently,
decisions related to schooling or marriage must be brought or approved by fathers. Participation of
fathers in the workshop was therefore important for facilitating a more inclusive dialogue on this issue
in the targeted communities. The evaluation found evidence during interviews of fathers who changed
their attitudes after the workshops they attended and after consulting with organizations who had
organized programme activities in their communities. For example, some of them were previously very
hostile towards the idea that daughters should enrol in secondary school (‘school will spoil them’, ‘they
will run around with boyfriends’). After the workshop where they had the opportunity to share views
and discuss with other participants, male participants changed their attitudes to some extent and some
of those girls were allowed to enrol in the secondary school eventually.
While the evaluation team cannot judge that the Programme has already made profound changes in
patriarchal relations in the communities and changed gender dynamics entirely, it can be concluded
based on evidence collected during focus groups and interviews with community members, that due to
the programme activities, those rigid patriarchal structures are no longer accepted as a given norm,
without questioning and without defiance, due to the newfound awareness and power acquired
through programme activities. The empowerment of mothers, girls and boys as well, contributed to this
shift simple because they could openly express their opinions, and because their opinions and views
were accepted as just as legitimate as the opinions of other members of the community. The issue of
child marriage became public and open to debate. Representatives of the implementing organizations
noticed that women became more determined to oppose the opinions of husbands and express their
opinions more openly in public.

KEY FINDING: LOCAL SYSTEMS ENHANCED THEIR CAPACITY TO IDENTIFY, RECOGNIZE AND REACT TO RISKS OR

were more visible. Actually, very positive multisectoral cooperation was achieved by the stakeholders in
Pirot, however it should be mentioned that although this municipality already had a very good record of
multisectoral cooperation, the strengthening came in the form of enhanced and targeted participation

Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
of local Roma organizations in activities focused on the improvement of social inclusion of the Roma
population.
The cooperation between schools, CSWs and Roma organizations was evaluated as improved.
Consequently, the prevention of child marriage was easily incorporated in the local action plan.
Representatives of local schools indicated that with enhanced multisectoral cooperation they feel
supported by other institutions, they do not have to decide alone how to proceed with cases, they have
clearer protocols on how to deal with it and feel that they are working in line with the law.
Implementing organizations testified that the Programme increased their capacities and improved the
cooperation with other local communities participating in the Programme. The cooperation with the
Republic Institute for Social Protection was received particularly positively as it provided expert help and
new tools that can be used for identifying and addressing child marriage.
6.5.5 Impact of the Programme on the broader mobilization of stakeholders in
combating child marriage
KEY FINDING: THE PROGRAMME HAS MOBILIZED A NUMBER OF DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS AT LOCAL AND NATIONAL
LEVELS, MAINLY THROUGH THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR ENDING CHILD MARRIAGE AND LOCAL PROGRAMME
ACTIVITIES. THERE IS EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT ENTHUSIASM AMONG STAKEHOLDERS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW THESE NEW PARTNERSHIPS AND SYNERGIES WILL BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE.
Undeniably, child marriage has become an important public issue, present in public discourse and media
due to the involvement of different stakeholders through the National Coalition or in local communities
targeted by the Programme. child marriage has been the topic of various campaigns implemented by
the organizations involved in the Programme or their partner organizations. It was one of the key topics
during the annual campaign 16 Days of Activism. The debate about child marriage was initiated on
different occasions and in different places involving public institutions, civil society organizations and the
National Coalition. Representatives of Roma women’s organizations participating in the Programme
reported on the spill-over impact of the Programme. The mobilization of different stakeholders around
child marriage contributed to the organization of two conferences by other Roma women’s
organizations, as the issue gains importance and includes broader groups of organizations and donors
supporting similar initiatives.
Many groups of stakeholders were included in the work on national legal frameworks and policies. The
National Coalition advocated for much needed legislative changes, particularly in the Family Law and
Criminal Code. However, the legislative processes were slowed down during the Programme
implementation due to the elections and due to the pandemic of the activities related to legislative
changes were postponed for 2021. Furthermore, there are different opinions about work on legislation:
some national-level stakeholders think that legal analysis must precede legal changes, while other
stakeholders think that the requirements of international legal instruments (mainly CEDAW and the
Istanbul Convention) are sufficient. Some stakeholders think that amending the legal framework is not
even necessary but a more effective implementation of the existing legal framework.
Undoubtedly the Programme induced a lot of enthusiasm among different stakeholders to engage and
contribute to the ending of child marriage, but how long this mobilization can be maintained after the
67 | P age

Programme ends will depend on financial allocations for these types of models in the future as well as
on other sustainability factors that will be analysed in the following section.
68 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
6.6 Sustainability
The evaluation of sustainability considered the following evaluation questions:
EQ15: To what extent did system-level factors (at local and national levels), as
well as international obligations derived from key conventions, contribute to
the sustainability of results?
EQ17: To what extent did the intervention manage to strengthen local
systems for social protection and education, as well as strengthening the role
and leadership of local Roma communities in combating child marriage?
6.6.1 Contribution of the system-level factors (at local and national levels) and
international obligations derived from key conventions on the sustainability of
results
KEY FINDING: THE SUSTAINABILITY OF ALL KEY PROGRAMME RESULTS IS FRAGILE. THIS IS DUE TO VARIOUS
FACTORS: THE MODEL IS STILL NOT SUFFICIENTLY MAINSTREAMED AT NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL; THERE ARE
DOUBTS ABOUT THE ALLOCATION OF SPECIFIC FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND ABOUT LEGISLATIVE CHANGES WHICH
STILL NEED TO HAPPEN.
The sustainability of this Programme depends on the overarching national legislative and policy
frameworks which currently do not provide an optimal basis for ending child marriage. Recent legislative
and policy developments (the adoption of new Law on Gender Equality and an amendment to the Law
on Prohibition of Discrimination) could contribute indirectly to the sustainability of Programme results
and further mainstreaming of the model for ending child marriage, by creating more a favourable
gender-equality and anti-discrimination context, if effectively implemented. However, national
legislation still needs improvement, for example, the Family Law should facilitate better prevention of
formal or informal child marriage, while the Criminal Code should be better aligned with the Istanbul
Convention, which was ratified by Serbia in 2014, on the issue of child marriage.
However, there are two additional supporting factors which should already be recognized and utilized as
a potential resource for further addressing child marriage as they provide a good policy basis and could
potentially facilitate further sustainability of the Programme’s results and model. Those two factors are
two important national policies: the Strategy for the Prevention of and Protection of Children from
Violence 2020-2023 and the Strategy for Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and
Domestic Violence 2021-2023. However, it is hard to predict how these national policies will translate
locally, both in the areas targeted by the Programme and in other communities, and how specifically
they could contribute to the sustainability of results and or provide better context for the replication of
the model.
Sustainability has been assessed along Programme’s key results, with key result 1 assessed in this sub-
chapter and two other key results assessed in following sub-chapters.
69 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
Key Result 1 includes a complex set of sub-results related to the improved evidence on child marriage,
improved policies and practices. Sustainability to a large extent depends on specific local contexts. Some
general prerequisites are needed at the national level to provide an adequate framework for combating
child marriage in local communities and at the moment these prerequisites are not always given.
However, on the local level, factors contributing to the sustainability of results are stronger, as follows:
• The existence of enriched local systems for prevention and protection from child marriage,
which are also able to maintain an improved system of evidencing incidence of child marriage;
• Local networks of stakeholders with a strong record of multisectoral cooperation and
cooperation. As was already noted, the more experience exists of cooperation between
stakeholders in this sector, the higher the likelihood for sustaining results at the local levels. Key
factors include the existence of Roma pedagogical assistants in schools and their good
cooperation and teamwork with teachers, school psychologists and educational specialists and
active civil society organizations, as well as good cooperation between CSOs and local
institutions.
• Institutions with low fluctuation of personnel. These can more easily institutionalise newly
acquired knowledge, skills and intervention procedures and ensure a longer-term institutional
memory which in turn contributes to the sustainability of results;
• A commitment of the local authorities to combating child marriage - in the form of the
existence of local policies and financial resources allocated to this issue from local budgets.
Keeping in mind the above factors, it follows that local models established in Pirot and Novi Bečej have
much higher sustainability chances, and less so in Belgrade due to more complex institutional settings,
an overlap of responsibilities between municipalities and city authorities, less closely knitted
communities and a higher fluctuation of staff due to the better opportunities in the local labour market.
6.6.1.1 Contribution of international obligations derived from key conventions to the
sustainability of results
Serbia’s obligations related to international human rights instruments, such as CEDAW and the Istanbul
Convention, are important factors contributing to sustainability since the pressure on the Serbian
Government to implement policies can bring more decisive and effective action. These obligations and
recommendations by the CEDAW Committee and GREVIO are supportive of all interventions related to
ending violence against women, including child marriage and empowerment of Roma girls. In its
recommendation no. 32, the CEDAW Committee recommends Serbia to establish a system to track all
cases involving child marriage and stateless children, in particular, Roma girls; in recommendation no.
34, it calls for strengthening mechanisms for keeping Roma girls in the education system, while in
recommendation no. 48 it calls for the eradication of child marriage and forced marriage through
coordinated action by the competent authorities, non-governmental organisations, and the Roma
community.69
69 Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Concluding observations on the fourth periodic report of

In its first report on Serbia, GREVIO acknowledged the scale of the problem of child marriage and
welcomed the establishment of the National Coalition, emphasizing the importance of effective work by
the Coalition. GREVIO delivered sets of recommendations to Serbia on how to improve the prevention
and protection of women and girls from violence, encompassing all forms of violence as defined by the
Conventions, which also includes child and forced marriages.70
6.6.2 Sustainability of changes in the Roma communities
The sustainability of Key Result 2 can be assessed at different levels. At the individual level, changes in
awareness and attitudes (harmfulness of early marriage, links with worse lifestyles, lower opportunities,
changes in preferences towards increased age for first marriage, more frequent acceptance of pre-
marital relations, etc.), once instigated are not easily lost. However, unfavourable living conditions could
in the future adversely impact these newly introduced norms and acquired attitudes. Consequently,
prolonged or increased poverty and social exclusion could have a stronger impact on choices, leading to
the re-introduction of the practice of child marriages even in communities where currently there has
been progress. Additionally, lack of opportunities and the absence of extracurricular or free time
activities can limit and narrow the scope of life choices for girls, increasing the tendency towards early
marriage.
Amongst Roma communities there is visible impact in the form of a more critical stance towards child
marriage and initial processes of deconstruction of very rigid, hierarchical patriarchal relations in those
communities. This certainly contributes to the increased resilience of these communities to child
marriage and its adverse consequences. However, increased poverty and social exclusion, particularly as
a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result of the economic crisis caused by it, combined
with the refocused attention of local and national governments towards particularly urgent economic
issues, could undermine these achievements and decrease once more the resilience of communities to
child marriage, which is often mentioned as one of the only possible socio-economic coping strategies of
poor families. Keeping in mind the differences between the three local communities, it can be assumed
that increased resilience of local Roma communities can most probably be sustainable in Pirot as the
Roma communities in that location are faced with less exclusion and are targeted more by local social
inclusion policies. Furthermore, community resilience in this location is strengthened by the continuous
and strong engagement of local Roma women’s organizations and other civil society organizations.
Somewhat lower sustainability and resilience could be expected in Roma communities in Novi Bečej,
due to the less favourable context (weaker social services and the more excluded Roma communities),
but this can be mitigated with additional support and the continued active contribution of CSOs. Finally,
evidence points to a lower chance of results sustaining in Belgrade, indicating that the model should be
revised to better suit the particularly complex social and administrative context for Belgrade and similar
(bigger and less homogeneous) locations.

The sustainability of Key Result 3 is strongly dependent on central government’s commitment in the
future. The motivation of most stakeholders is positive. National Coalition members have a high level of
commitment, however the coordination role as it was defined during the Programme cycle cannot
ensure sustainability without firmer governmental support (both political and financial). This does not
mean that coordination should necessarily be transferred from CSO to government, rather that the
government should financially support the coalition, ensure regular representation of government
institutions among Coalition members, and adopt Coalition proposals in legislation and policy initiatives.
At least for the immediate future (2021-2022) the financing of National Coalition has been secured
through the UN Joint Programme “Integrated Response to Violence against Women and Girls in Serbia,
Phase III”, financed by SIDA.

6.7 Knowledge generation
The knowledge obtained through the evaluation was systematised around the following questions:
What is needed for mainstreaming the model at the national and
local level? Which kind of resources? What is the availability of these
resources?
To what extent did the prevailing contextual factors influence the
adaption of new knowledge and technology?
What are specific comparative advantages of different models of
intervention in the targeted local communities?
What were the most successful intervention strategies and what
adjustment of existing strategies or alternative strategies would be
needed for more effective interventions in the future?
KEY FINDING: FOR MAINSTREAMING THE MODEL, IT IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THE NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE
FRAMEWORK, TO REPLICATE IT IN OTHER LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITH ROMA SETTLEMENTS, TO PROVIDE
MANDATORY AND REGULAR TRAINING OF PROFESSIONALS IN THE WELFARE AND EDUCATION SYSTEMS AND ALSO IN
OTHER INSTITUTIONS ENGAGED IN LOCAL MULTISECTORAL COOPERATION (SUCH AS POLICE, HEALTH SYSTEM,
PROSECUTION SERVICES), TO ENABLE SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER AND PROMOTION OF GOOD PRACTICES IN
MULTISECTORAL COOPERATION AMONG LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, THE ROLE OF THE
NATIONAL COALITION FOR ENDING CHILD MARRIAGE IS SEEN AS CRUCIAL AS IT CAN ADVOCATE FOR POLITICAL
COMMITMENT AND FOR REPLICATING OR UPSCALING THE MODEL WITH ADEQUATE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS.
The model for ending child marriage designed within the Programme is a complex one. To be
mainstreamed and implemented in different local communities it should have on the one hand key
universal components that provide its main functions, but also to be flexible to enable adjustment to
specific local communities. As one respondent indicated, it should be provided as a menu of options
from which each local community should be able to pick the elements that are most suitable or feasible
in its own context.
Resources needed for mainstreaming the model include:
• An adequate legal framework that enables effective prevention, and sanctioning, of cases of
child marriage;
73 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
• Human resources: trained professionals in various institutions engaged in preventing and
combating child marriage;
• Organizational resources: effective multisectoral local teams equipped with solid protocols and
prevention and protection mechanisms and procedures;
• Financial resources: allocated from local public budgets as regular financial support and from
the national budget for coordination of the National Coalition for Ending Child Marriage;
• Active civil society organizations, with an emphasis on local Roma women’s organizations
continuously present in local Roma communities.
Many stakeholders (such as local social protection and educational organisations, NGOs) told the
evaluation team that the model should be replicated in other local communities. Some stakeholders
shared the view that the model for combating child marriage should be defined in a way that is
applicable to all populations, not only focused on Roma communities, as an increase of child marriage is
noticeable also in other populations.
In replicating the model, it is of utmost importance to consider specific contextual factors, including the
level of inclusion of Roma communities and their inhabitants in the broader communities of which they
are a part, the level of development of local services involved in the action against child marriage, the
previous history of multisectoral cooperation, and the presence of active and influential civil society
organizations. Depending on these various factors, certain components of the model should be
enhanced, and ‘missing links’ should be compensated for by providing other elements or initiatives. For
example, the evaluation evidence points to the crucial role of local Roma women’s organizations and the
high importance of other civil society organizations for achieving programme results. The presence and
long experience of individual Roma women’s organizations, and their continuous presence in local
communities, have a beneficial effect for the establishment of local models for ending child marriage.
Therefore, replication could first focus on communities with a significant proportion of Roma population
and with experienced Roma women’s organizations. However, the need to replicate the model in all
communities with a Roma population living in deprived settlements, even if there is no strong civil
society, was clearly communicated by various stakeholders during the evaluation. In such communities,
local governments could have a key responsibility. Even if there are some missing links, such as a lack of
local Roma women organizations, local governments should adjust the model to the local context. Some
respondents suggested that even if this ‘top-down’ approach is not optimal, the very attempt to
establish the model could increase awareness among local authorities of how important is to support
local CSOs, as they can play a major role in the effective implementation of the model. The presentation
of the benefits of the model in targeted communities should be the first step in any plan to replicate the
model. Local authorities should understand the returns from social investment in this model.
The model for ending child marriage requires diverse and well-qualified human resources. Professionals
(teachers, social workers, policemen, judges, health workers) should be trained not only in the issue of
child marriage, but more broadly on discrimination and stereotypes, as many of them are not aware of
harmful practices, some of which they may even be reproducing. They should also be aware of the legal
framework in regard to child marriage. Teams for dropout prevention in all schools should be further
trained for more effective drop-out prevention caused by child marriages in the context of the model
developed through the programme, which places the emphasis on cooperation with local social welfare
systems and a more proactive approach to the work with girls under risk and Roma communities.
Evaluation of education institution quality should be enhanced, through development of descriptors
specifically targeting child marriage risks, and implementation of such descriptors in the process of the
evaluation of education institutions.
74 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
Some complementary initiatives contribute to the sustainability of the Programme results, for example
the work with the Judicial Academy related to the capacity building of prosecutors and judges engaged
in family law proceedings include the issue of child marriage.
The model should include health centres and particularly gynaecologists. Health centres do not seem to
have played an important role in current local models. However, according to the experiences of some
implementing partners, health centres and particularly gynaecologists are often the first entry point of
cases of child marriage into the system. Since marriages are not formal and could stay below the radar
of the law and other social services, the gynaecologist service could be an important element of the
system that can sound the alarm and set into motion multisectoral teams.
Important elements of the model which should be mainstreamed include various elements focused on
the education-employment nexus. This would include not only dropout prevention, but also easy return
to school, training for employability skills and at least minimum qualifications. However, according to
some evaluation respondents, this would pose too heavy a burden for some small and poor local
communities. In these cases, stronger cooperation with the National Coalition or national institutions
could help to adjust the model to a version feasible for their communities.
According to some respondents, models should include a broader version of the empowerment
components. This means that not only awareness raising, schooling and employment should be used in
order to empower girls, but also a broader set of activities that expand their choices, such as travel and
participation in sport and cultural activities. Girls should be supported to develop diverse interests so
they can expand their life choices.

7. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
CONCLUSIONS
The Programme has delivered valuable results in terms of:
Raising the profile of child marriage in policy discourse in Serbia. The visibility of the issue of child
marriage has significantly increased as a direct result of the Programme. Its policy and advocacy
interventions as well as the evidence-based approach to programming and policy making have made it
clear that although the existing national policies and programmes dealing with child rights and GBV, if
effectively implemented, could contribute to addressing some of the aspects of child marriage, without
establishing and sustaining the model of multisectoral service provision and support promoted within
this Programme these national legislative and policy frameworks are not sufficiently supportive for
effective action against child marriage. This is especially true as key frameworks like the Family Law and
the Criminal Code do not contain provisions that will enable full alignment with the Istanbul Convention
which defines early marriage as a form of gender-based violence. The sustainability of the Programme
results and the continued visibility of the issue in the policy arena depend now on government
commitment in terms of assigning coordination responsibilities to the Coalition, supporting financially
the work of the Coalition and using its expertise in legislation and policymaking around the issue of child
marriage.
Enhancing evidence-based policymaking on child marriage. The Programme was highly effective in
terms of promoting improved data collection and analysis and strengthening and promoting evidence-
based policy and programme design in general. Design and implementation were informed by a wealth
of evidence-based research, which has the potential to be used as a baseline for many individual
institutional Monitoring Evaluation and Learning (MEAL) frameworks. Bearing in mind the limitations of
capacity-building for child marriage data collection and considering still limited data user capabilities this
Programme has been an example for decision makers of the potential benefits of evidence-based
policies and of an environment where policy makers can and do consider the existing available evidence,
and engage with researchers/analysts to produce new evidence when needed. The component of the
Programme on improving data collection and analysis at the institutional level was also beneficial, as
delivering evidence-based policy is only possible if the institutions involved are independent,
professional and have the credibility to perform their function. Indeed, one way to establish that
credibility is through demonstrating an ethical approach to acquiring and using evidence and through
transparency around every stage of policy development and implementation.
Working directly with communities, girls at risk of child marriage, women, boys, and men in changing
power dynamics in communities especially in terms of addressing child marriage. Workshops aimed at
girls and women in Roma settlements were relevant not only in terms of raising awareness and
educating girls and women but in terms of facilitating dialogue within the community. Particularly
effective and transformative were the activities aimed at the male population, serving as an inclusive
model of empowering individuals as well as their immediate family and communities as the way to
overcome barriers and change norms and values. Changes in individual preferences among girls as well
as the resilience of Roma communities to child marriage however depend on the broader context of
social inclusion. The likelihood of these results sustaining is higher in communities that are better
included in the local social context, with lower incidence of poverty.
76 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
Strengthening cooperation between different stakeholders in addressing child marriage at the local
and community levels. The Programme was effective in enhancing multisectoral cooperation to address
the issue of child marriage, although the scope of interventions varied in terms of effectiveness at the
local level. The overall Programme approach and model are still of great relevance as the general trend
of early marriage continues to be an issue in Serbia, particularly among the Roma population.
Interventions related to the strengthening of the systems of social welfare were effective at the
institutional level, however in the education sector they were effective mostly at the level of individuals.
The impact of the Programme on the strengthening of the social welfare response to child marriage is
already visible in outputs such as the Instruction for Local CSWs, developed within the programme,
which recognised child marriage as a standalone issue and as a significant violation of children’s rights.
Further effects are seen in the way that child marriage is now recognised within the education system as
an important factor for withdrawal from the system. However, there are still gaps to overcome
regarding the educational and social service system, particularly on the local level.
Having in mind the limited time and scope of the Programme, it was not realistic to expect it to have a
profound impact. However, the evaluation evidence indicates that within these limits the Programme
succeeded in achieving a noticeable impact on different levels:
• On the individual level, impact is particularly noticeable among girls participating in the
Programme. As confirmed by the post-test study, they developed attitudes that are different
from the pre-Programme period or in comparison to girls not participating in the Programme.
They appreciate education and economic independence more, they are more aware of the
harmful effects of early marriages and consider it preferable to start marriage and childbearing
later.
• Programme activities also instigated changes in gender and generation dynamics which depart
from traditional patriarchal models of decision making and expressing opinions.
• On the system level, impact is visible through newly gained awareness of child marriage among
professionals, but also there are now clear instructions on how to assess the risks, how to
address cases and how to cooperate with other local institutions and civil society organizations
in tackling the issue. The impact is stronger in communities that already have a good record of
multisectoral cooperation.
• The impact on mobilization of diverse stakeholders was also visible, with the National Coalition
for Ending Child Marriage as a recognizable key actor which gathers together various forms of
expertise and commitments.
• The general assessment is that the impact is stronger in smaller communities where local
stakeholders are more easily mutually reachable, where there is a record of previous good
cooperation and where there are established links between different institutions, and between
them and civil society organizations. Moreover, the impact in targeted communities is stronger
where there is stronger and longer involvement of civil society organizations. Also, the impact is
positively correlated with broader social inclusion, so the effects are better among girls in
communities that are better integrated into the broader local community. At the same time, the
most marginalized families and individuals were very difficult for the Programme to reach and
they are less likely to benefit from its impacts.
• Finally, clear instructions, protocols and legal norms are very important for a more effective
institutional response. Further interventions should follow the example of this Programme and
focus not solely on building the capacities of individuals performing professional roles in local
institutions but rather also on equipping their institutions with clear procedures and tools on
how to deal with cases of child marriage.
77 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
The Programme has shown that a successful model to end child marriage consists of effective actors at
the local level who all have in their mandate child protection and the prevention of, and fight against,
gender-based violence, with a strong child-centred approach; and who work together. There is no
effective response to child marriage if any of the actors fail to provide this.
o The Programme has succeeded in redistributing the focus of the traditional task of the
CSW: to act upon identified risks of child marriage in families, or once a child marriage
happens to other actors in the local communities. This has been done successfully in the
communities where local government recognized and promoted a shift towards
prevention of child marriage and the CSW has played a key role in establishing and
leading a local coalition of all stakeholders who work towards ending child marriage; this
has happened at national level too, mobilizing existing resources such as Family
Outreach Workers, Roma health mediators and mobile teams.
o However, the effectiveness of multisectoral cooperation, as the most important
element of the model to respond to child marriage, varied depending on the
programme location. In Belgrade, it was difficult to establish cooperation among
relevant institutions, particularly schools and CSWs, due to the complex city
administration systems. In Novi Bečej and Pirot, formal and informal communication
channels among the relevant actors were established and are operational.
o The role of local Roma women’s organisations and other CSOs active in fighting against
child marriage is judged to be crucial in achieving Programme results. The continuous
presence of Roma women’s organisations in local communities was recognized, and
these organisations have been integrated into Programme design; the Programme relied
heavily on these partnerships.
o The intervention aimed at supporting educational opportunities for girls at risk of child
marriage was effective in linking school drop-out and risks of child marriage. Moreover,
the intervention that supported teachers and pedagogical assistants in preventing child
drop-out was effective in raising awareness and mobilising some teachers but not entire
schools. However, the success of the intervention in the Programme sites relied on the
work of individual teachers and cannot be evaluated as effective in the education
system more broadly – or at least not as successful as those in the social sector.
• Although the Programme and the approach were judged in this evaluation to be coherent
and harmonised with many of the ongoing national and local reform activities, the
Programme model requires some adjustments due to limitations related to specific contexts
in localities where the institutional jurisdiction is not clear and targeted communities were
less homogenous.
• In terms of the efficiency of the Programme, the funds were allocated and spent for the
most part in an accountable and cost-effective way. Indeed, in relation to the budget
allocated, the Programme has achieved significant results. However, stakeholders said that
the design and implementation of the education segment could have been more cost-
effective, as significant funds were disbursed to schools, but results were not achieved at
the level of schools, but with individual teachers. Also, the FOW service was discontinued
after the first year, despite being provided with substantial funds. Finally, the plan to
connect Roma settlements to the internet had to be abandoned due to high costs, raising
the question whether sufficient preparation work/budgeting was done for this.
• The Programme was overall well-managed and coordinated and oriented to results, which
allowed adapting the interventions to the priorities of the beneficiaries. These changes in
the interventions were implemented without additional budget funding.

Key Conclusions as per ToC components
1. Evidence-based policymaking
1.1. The databases of families and girls at risk of child marriage are not fully satisfactory.
Databases are still not fully developed and functional in all communities partly as it is still
not clear whose mandate it is to manage these (despite the guidelines and procedures
which have been developed). Data collection is not done routinely, and the database is not
present in an easily accessible IT format: it is hard to see any type of centralised working
database functioning at the community level.
1.2. Research on child marriage produced as part of the Programme activities has had a
significant impact on presenting a clear picture on the ground in terms of prevalence of and
attitudes towards child marriage in Serbia.
1.3. The test and re-test research on attitudes to child marriage were useful in determining the
baseline and end-line for the Programme and were useful for monitoring changes and
adjusting the model to fit the needs of communities.
2. Work in Communities
2.1. The community work, which included girls, mothers, boys and fathers, was extremely
beneficial and impactful. Economic empowerment interventions, supporting educational
opportunities for girls at risk of and affected by child marriage resulted in changes of
perception of the importance of employment. Some beneficiaries gained employment, but
these mainly stayed within stereotypical gender-assigned roles (cosmetician, hairdresser,
etc). Empowerment activities were narrowly focused on economic empowerment and not
necessarily on increasing social and cultural activities that would serve to expand girls’
perception of their life opportunities. Online connectivity was also not achieved as planned
because of the cost.
3. Multisectoral cooperation on child marriage
3.1. Actors in multisectoral cooperation have learned more about child marriage, have improved
cooperation, and established new procedures through a set of guidelines framing their
coordination. However, this mechanism is partially parallel to those created for
multisectoral cooperation according to the Law on Prevention of Domestic Violence, thus
creating a heavy burden on local stakeholders: the same representative/s must participate
in both mechanisms.
3.2. Healthcare institutions were not sufficiently included in the coordination mechanism, yet
they might be a very important entry point and a great source of potential information
sharing (family planning, SRH etc).
3.3. Roma Women’s NGOs play a very important role in the functionality of the multisectoral
cooperation in the targeted communities. They are key mobilisers connecting different
stakeholders and providing a continuous presence in the community.
4. Broader mobilization of stakeholders in combating child marriage
4.1. The National Coalition has provided an important and previously non-existent general
platform for action. However, despite the impact that it had on mobilising different
79 | P age
Evaluation of the programme ‘Towards ending child marriage in Serbia’ (2018 - 2020) – Final Report |
stakeholders through advocacy and awareness-raising on child marriage during Programme
implementation, it is questionable how sustainable it can be in the future without
institutional budgetary support.
4.2. The National Coalition has ambitious goals that are often too many and too broad.
The sustainability of the overall model is difficult to assess at this point, both because it is still too
early to say, as some of the Programme activities have only recently been finalised, and because the
model for preventing and combating child marriage is complex and the sustainability of each
component depends on specific sets of factors and the external local context. The likelihood of the
sustainability of the model varies between the three targeted communities: it is highest in Pirot,
medium in Novi Bečej and low to medium in Belgrade. It would be useful for any further
implementation in bigger cities and less homogenous Roma communities to examine local contexts
in detail, focusing on identifying the appropriate functions and levels as well as potential
bottlenecks.
LESSONS LEARNED
Although some of the key lessons and insights gained were presented in the chapter on knowledge
generation as well, those were related more so to the understanding of what areas of the model were
identified as those that needed further enhancement for the model’s rollout and for the model to work
in the future and different contexts. Lessons learned, however, those more related to the processes of
the project design and implementation. Key lessons could be summarized as follows:
• The intervention combating child marriage must be complex including various components and
activities. The project implementation confirmed that each component as stand-alone would
not have the sufficient effect and that combination of different interventions simultaneously
targeting key aspects, such as knowledge on child marriage, awareness, norms, attitudes, and
behaviours, including the interaction between different groups (girls, parents, boys, men, and
women), the system response and mobilization of diverse stakeholders only can bring positive
effects.
• The project should be designed in a flexible manner allowing for additional contextualization
after initial implementation as factors influencing the outcomes could be so numerous,
insufficiently known or even volatile in certain times that require revision and adjustment of
project activities to achieve similar effectiveness in quite different communities.
• Combined top-down and bottom-up approach is very important for the effective
implementation as local interventions get additional stimulus and a more favourable
environment for the implementation, while ‘real’ change comes from the root levels in local
communities and among primary beneficiary groups.
• Relying on CSOs closely linked with targeted communities and with well build relations with
beneficiary groups increases the likelihood of effectiveness.
• The time for the project cycle is not sufficient for a bigger impact, particularly in times marked
by the pandemic or other crises. Such a complex phenomenon requires longer project cycles
and more resources.
• Bringing together diverse stakeholders builds synergy enabling exchange, mutual learning,
mutual support and increased motivation and commitment, like in the case of the National
coalition for ending child marriage.

8. RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendations were proposed having in mind the specific role of UNICEF and with the idea of the
possible future UNICEF action that might contribute more to the favourable environment for ending
child marriages than through direct support of small-scale projects.
The project has successfully piloted the model for addressing the issue of child marriages. In the
following period, the other stakeholders should take over the responsibilities and take control over the
roll out of the initiatives. The UNICEF should retain the role of the 'guardian' of the model and the
'supportive force' to others engaged in ending child marriages. Starting from this rationale, the possible
streams of actions that UNICEF might take could include:
• Targeted advocacy activities should focus on leveraging or mobilising stakeholders whose
actions are essential to provide a more favourable legislative, institutional, policy environment
for the effort directed to ending child marriages to provide some specific changes. The advocacy
should be particularly focused on legislative changes of the Family Law, Criminal Code and Law
on Prevention of Domestic Violence. The advocacy should also focus on effective
implementation of policies that entail measures for ending child marriages, particularly Roma
inclusion strategy, Strategy on prevention of violence against children, Gender Equality Strategy
2021-2030, and Strategy for prevention and combating violence against women and domestic
violence 2021-2025. Targeted advocacy should focus also on mobilising sufficient financial
allocations at different levels of the system to fund the model’s elements and its rollout in the
future.
• Strengthen the partnerships with other UN agencies and international/bilateral organisations
(for example, UN Women, GIZ, SIDA, SDC) to accommodate more concerted dialogue with the
Government of Serbia on the need to provide an adequate framework for addressing child
marriages. Through this cooperation, UNICEF can transfer abundant knowledge obtained
through this project and other projects and programmes on effective ways to address child
marriages.
• Supporting the National Coalition for Ending Child Marriages as one of the key stakeholders
contributing to the more favourable environment for action against child marriages.
• Supporting cooperation and experience exchange of various stakeholders by (co) organising
events for knowledge and experience sharing, promoting good practices.
• Mainstreaming the issue of child marriages in the regular UNICEF work with relevant
stakeholders, such as social protection, judiciary institutions. This does not entail additional or
separate activities related to child marriages. However, it means that in these such as trainings,
workshops, or other capacity-building activities the stronger emphasis could be placed to child
marriages. Another example could be the work of Roma health mediators who should be
trained and engaged in screening for child marriage risks.
• To further explore financing aspects, including the tracing of public financing and to advocate
for more generous public budget funding of activities dedicated to ending child marriages,
including through implementation of previously mentioned strategies. Also, to explore new
fundraising opportunities for financing action against child marriages that were not previously
used, such as IPA funds.
