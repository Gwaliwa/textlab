Final report
Executive summary
1. Introduction
Guinea-Bissau made the reform of the civil registration a priority issue, in the context of the reform of the framework
Legal and policies in the area of children and adolescents, with the elaboration of the new integral protection policy
of the child and their dissemination as well as with the child's integral protection code with the new
Civil Registration Code, in the approval phase. In this area, it was found that: (i) data and information on
births in health facilities, vaccinations and civil registration events are shared and
coordinated among the structures responsible for the civil registration and health, (ii) the civil registration service is
decentralized at the regional level, coordinated at the central level by the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights,
while the health service is accessible to communities level with the implementation of the strategy
National Community Health, (iii) Health technicians are involved in the management of registration events
Civil, (IV) Secondary birth registration centers exist in all hospitals and in a large
number of health structures and (v) a data collection and systematization system was implemented
Statistics related to the registration of birth and vital statistics (Rapidpro, with support from UNICEF). THE
hypothesis presented, therefore, that the implementation of interoperability between the civil registration and the
health services was a strategy that enabled the improvement in the geographical coverage of the systems
civil registration and that captured, at least, all births that occurred in the establishments of
health. By adding interoperability with education from the need to present the
Birth registration on the act of registration (piloted in 46 schools) would reinforce the initial hypothesis.
The government in partnership with UNICEF initially developed a project to support the modernization of
Civil Registration System in Guinea-Bissau, which included the formation of regional instructors; the formation of
Civil Registry and Local Administration actors in all regions; the provision of safe civil records for
the communities; the reinforcement of the civil registration system in each regional service, the supply of materials
Computer - the Directorate - General of Civil Identification, Registration and Notary (DGICRN), the
supply of office equipment and material for all civil registration conservatories, centers
Regional Health Health Health and the Autonomous Sector of Bissau (SAB); support for
development of decentralized monitoring and monitoring instruments, to the collection,
Transmission and reception of real -time civil registration data (Rapidpro); the systematization of information
monthly data from the birth registration of the centers; the implementation of social mobilization actions
and Community, with programs and spots on traditional communication and registration methods of communication and registration
free birth during all community registration initiatives and the implementation of
Interoperability Health/ Civil Registry throughout the country.
The execution of the two projects was coordinated by UNICEF, through its child protection section,
with the support of the United Nations Fund for the Consolidation of Peace (PBF), local partners and some
UN agencies like UNHCR. UNICEF offered financial, technical and logistics support for the
implementation of interventions, as well as support for training activities (in the formation of
technicians, support with equipment and services for social mobilization). UNICEF also supported the
monitoring and coordination, through meetings of the National Committee of the Civil Registry of Activities,
in close collaboration with DGICRN.
This project was implemented from 2018 until March 2021 and the total cost was $ 1,395,558.15
2. Purpose and objectives of the evaluation
This formative assessment aims to evaluate the overall performance of the implementation of the mechanisms
of interoperability. Its objective is to provide solid evidence on the interventions of registration of
birth that achieved objectives and identify experiences as a way of defining new

propitious mechanisms to improve birth registration interventions in Guinea-Bissau (objective
of learning). Specific objectives are listed as:
- Determine the relevance, efficiency, consistency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability of strategies
supported by UNICEF to improve birth registration rates in Guinea-Bissau;
- Identify lessons learned about what worked and what did not work in strategies for
accelerate the regional birth registration program, both as an autonomous program
as in terms of multisectoral convergence, including unintentional results (both
positive as negative);
- Make recommendations, based on strategies used, on how to improve implementation
and the performance for the promotion of birth registration;
- Determine to what extent innovations and new technologies have been leveraged through partnerships
new or existing (private sector, NGOs) and contributed to the results of CCR#7;
- Contribute to the improvement of RCC#7 program strategies and toC in Guinea-Bissau in
private and in West and Central Africa in general;
- Evaluate to what extent the strategy of interoperability for the promotion of the birth record
and the main interventions integrated the gender equity and equality in their conception,
implementation and monitoring.
Users of the evaluation are UNICEF, MOJ/DGICRN, the technical and financial partners of the registration sector
Civil of the country and the ministries involved (health, justice, education, INE, SCOS, UNHCR, UNFPA, WHO)
associated in the scope of interoperability.
3. Evaluation scope (thematic, geographical, chronological)
Thetically, the scope of the evaluation meets the activities related to the reform of the registration system
civil; interoperability and coordination of interventions. The evaluation focused on approaches and
promising birth registration strategies that were particularly successful in acceleration
results at national and regional level, including, but not limited to identified drivers
by RCC#7 (public financing, partnerships, social drivers, etc.).
Geographically, the interventions reached the entire country, that is, in the eight regions (38 subsectors and the
zone of the capital) including in the farthest regions. Chronologically, it is limited to the January period
From 2018 to August 2021
4. Evaluation criteria and issues
The evaluation was made based on six (06) OECD-CAD1 criteria (relevance, consistency, effectiveness,
Efficiency, sustainability, impact) to which the non-OECD criteria (genre,
Human rights and equity). The evaluation questions (QAS) were developed, first, with
based on the terms of reference and then based on the theory of change, in order to facilitate the collection of evidence
related to expected results (immediate and intermediate results); the implementation of activities
planned; the links between activities and results; and other factors that may have occurred.
5. EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
This evaluation is based on qualitative and quantitative data. The approach adopted in this assessment is the
Contribution Analysis. This approach, based on change theory, allows an analysis to be made
participation in order to establish to what extent the intervention contributed (or not) to the results
observed. The reconstruction of change theory allowed the determination of the expected results, the
activities planned to achieve these results and the identification of external factors that may have

interacted. Hypotheses were developed to explain the conditions under which activities can
contribute to obtaining intermediate results. In this base, the evaluation was carried out, looking for
Consolidated tests on: the activities implemented; the chain of results achieved; The causal links
Between activities and results (theory of change); and the external factors that may have interacted.
The quantitative data used are secondary data, derived from project reports, inquiries
Demographic and health (IDS) or routine data. Data collection methods used include
documentary research; interviews; discussion groups; structured observation; and a participatory method
which consists of the dialogue of multiple participants and the most significant change technique.
5. Main findings and conclusions
Relevance
By improving or increasing the registration of birth, the assistance provided by UNICEF meets the
needs of both holders of obligations (ie, registration conservatory) and holders
rights (children), since the system had a number of disabilities that had
discouraged people to use it, confirming that only 46% of children under 7 years
of age has the registration of birth (MICS6, 2019.) The results of the analysis indicate that, in terms of
relevance, interoperability with health services helped strengthen the bond with the
community, whose expectations are being met in terms of giving legal identity to their
descendants, however, are the need to expand to all health centers, given success
obtained. Contributes to the National Civil Registry Strategy and Vital Statistics Production
(Horizon 2028), according to which it is a credible source of citizens' identification, ensuring the
exercise and compliance with civic rights and duties. Although UNICEF's technical assistance has
played an important role, favorable political and legal contexts, including the
commitment of human resources to the cause of the recognition of universal law, to support a
Coordinated action synergy are undeniable factors for the success of this venture. At the rate of
registration of birth within the project time limit, to take advantage of opportunities in
maternities and vaccination points are in accordance with the objectives of sustainable development,
particularly those related to gender equality, the right to a legal identity and the struggle
against the absence of homeland (ODM 5 and 16). They contribute to the achievement of the goals, including the agenda
2063 of Africa and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The adoption of the new code of
Civil registration in 2021 reinforces the favorable political and legal context and operationalize the
interoperability.
Coherence
In terms of coherence, the institutional nature of the implementation of interoperability suggests that the
synergy of intra-governmental actions favors the coherence of interventions and alignment with
the international mechanisms that the country has ratified. UNICEF in the context of its cooperation with the country
guarantees the consistency with the priorities of the Directorate - General of Civil Identification, Registrations and
Notary, in order to channel in this direction the coordination of all interventions in the field of
civil registration in the country. The implementation of interventions has adapted to contextual factors such as the crisis
COVID-19 in order to ensure the continuity of services. Likewise, socio-political crises
and the delays observed in the organization of local elections did not prevent the activities of
training, the involvement of the new community and religious leaders, journalists and radio announcers
Community, directors of national schools and deputies, among others. The interventions of the
UNICEF address the continuity and quality requirements of birth registration services.
Incorporate at least four international standards: continuity, permanence, free access and
ensure or facilitate interoperability between the different components of the civil registration system
in the country. The involvement of community and religious leaders, the communication system (television, radios

and face -to -face activities) and the participation of various ministries in the coordination technical meetings
national boosted the RN. It is noteworthy that in all interventions the requirements were addressed
gender in the implementation of activities.
Effectiveness
Regarding the effectiveness of the project, the activities implemented certainly contributed to an increase
gradual of the birth record. From 2019 to 2021 of the total of children registered 49% refer to the
registration document obtained in the registration centers and 51% refer to the total of children,
Up to 7 years old with birth records in some health infrastructures. These actions contributed
to recognize that the health sector is one of the entry doors in the attribution of the registration of
birth. Coupled with the health sector, the education sector, is also considered a
entry to increase the coverage of the birth registration, because the school enrollment requires
Presentation of this test document. The synergy with education was piloted in some schools
(child schools) and the technical and political space favorable for the development of a
operational strategy to be implemented in all schools. The program has a good level of
effectiveness in that the planned results were overcome, in particular: with the
development and adoption of a political framework that guides the interventions of all actors in the
Civil Registry and Birth Registration Area. The interventions performed allowed to create a structure
to coordinate the civil registration activities in general, to reinforce the capabilities of registration actors
civil and to equip some offices of the civil registration centers. However, the sanitary context linked to the
COVID-19, the late availability of secure records by the Directorate-General of Civil Identification,
Records and notary and the sociopolitical context often affected the programming of activities
operational (with the cancellation and/or delay of several scheduled activities) that affected the obtaining
full of results. Promising practices that have contributed most to obtaining results
They are interoperability and coordination among all actors; social mobilization and
Empowerment of communities; the use of advanced strategies for communities with the
involvement of community health agents and the opening of new registration posts
birth. In the context of social mobilization, the involvement of traditional and religious leaders in the service
Community of the birth registration encouraged families to seek this service. It is also emphasized,
that these communication actions promoted the equity and equality of gender in the right to the registration of
Birth and social awareness that is a right of girls and boys.
The implementation of the strategy developed in the project can be affected over time, since
Additional funds are required to be used to support civil registration. UNICEF is managing
Technical support for the government regarding the operation of funds. Obtaining the results
was negatively influenced by several factors, the most significant of which the
of civil registration professionals; the lack of supervision in training to ensure the operation
permanent and continuous of conservatory and civil registration posts in the quality of the
Birth registration; interoperability not only in health centers but at all posts
health that hold maternity or prenatal consultations and monitoring with the absence
of a data control mechanism of the birth record. So far the strategy of
support of education for the RN requirement is not yet fully implemented but is being
developed for adequate execution.
Efficiency
In terms of efficiency, a budget of US $ 1,399 million facilitated the implementation of
interoperability and contributed to the achievement of the objectives. This financing was used for the
training of 205 health workers, qualified by the state, 147 conservative civilians, about 5700
Community health activists, 106 community and 25 parliamentarians leaders. Was also used

for the implementation of the communication strategy, in different dialects, which certainly
It influenced the community awareness about the need for RN.
Was also used for the acquisition of support materials (motorcycles to reach the most
distant, computers and forms of RN), for national and regional coordination meetings,
among other expenses for implementation. Most of the expected results with this project were
achieved and exceeded within the stipulated period, which were regularly monitored
Meetings of the Coordination Technician Group. Re-food with the regional authorities, enabled
greater implementation efficiency. However, the decentralized coordination, at the regional level was a factor
limiter, both due to the lack of resources and the frequency of meetings, which
Employed.
The involvement of community leaders brings qualitative benefits to the RN (areas
mostly vulnerable) and quantitative (substantial increase in registration given knowledge
existing about the number of children to serve in the community).
When the interoperability between health and civil registration and the coordination mechanism of all
actors of the registration system is fully operational, especially at the regional level, certainly
It will represent better results (in real time and at the lowest cost). The availability of resources
and the quantity and quality of human resources are still insufficient to ensure
a wide geographical coverage of the country's regions. In some of the current health posts they have
registration of birth there are several constraints, especially those related to the
availability of human resources that may be permanently in hospital services (all
the mornings) and in health centers (3 times a week). Thanks to regular monitoring of activities
with the DGICRN, Cirmec and at operational level with the regional authorities, the implementation has been
optimized to facilitate the operationalization of the little availability of resources. But this
monitoring has to be improved and improved forming technicians for monitoring,
updating the data with a minimum monthly frequency and ensuring the quality of the infromes
provided.
Sustainability
The involvement of health services is an important aspect to be consolidated. The training waterfall
provided by community health agents is a strong indicator in the sustainability of the
Long -term health birth record. So far this sustainability does not
It can be achieved without the help of UNICEF, whose support is still essential in the short and medium term.
The approach used in birth registration interventions to support the sustainability of
results have been to strengthen the capabilities of civil registration officers to ensure registration

involved in the program. Low public and local funding for civil registration is a great challenge for
the sector and may limit the sustainability of interventions and the implementation of the modernization of the registration
civil in the coming years.
Impact
The birth registration interventions carried out under the support of the child's protection program
UNICEF resulted in the significant increase in the percentage of children with birth registration in
the entire national territory, with interoperability in health units, which should be extended to
all health centers. Given the success of the interventions, community and religious leaders
they voluntarily acted in the sensitization of the population. The demand for training in the area of registration of
Birth by legislature deputies demonstrates the importance of the subject in question.
Gender, human rights, equity
The principle of human rights (children's rights, including access to an identity), genre and
equity was taken into account by the program on planning and implementation through a
data collection mechanism that offers information about girls and women who benefit
of interventions. Although the objectives are focused on improving the quality of service provision
and social mobilization, the objectives of the program were to promote access to the birth record of
vulnerable children through specific actions that encompass all rural areas. The data
Existing in the RapidPro database, refer to the geographical locality, gender and vulnerability. THE
The fact that this program has served 100% children in homes and orphanages,
demonstrates the commitment in equal rights and the equity of the gender. The involvement of leaders
community, religious and traditional, the use of community radios, the organization of campaigns for the
issuance of certificates on market days and vaccination campaigns, and the equipment in some
of the civil registry offices with motorcycles, facilitated the access of the populations to the newborn (even those who
live in rural and enclaves).
The project monitoring system allows to measure the results of a perspective of rights
humans and gender (number of registered girls and number of women formed) in various activities
concerning the RN. However, program monitoring needs more actions for its effective
action, such as training and technical discussion workshops, supervision of monitoring activities and
Human Resources Guarantee.
6. Lessons learned
L1: the establishment of structures to coordinate interventions at regional and national level provides
a space for dialogue between the different actors of the civil registration system. At national level decisions
They are taken after these coordination meetings.
L2: the support and involvement of community and religious leaders in promoting registration activities
strengthens the coordination of interventions and allows conditions to be found to overcome and
face the main problems in providing services.
L3: an integrated approach (registration services, immunization programs, pre-queries
natal, implementation of child protection activities and in the child's friendly schools) helps
identify children who were not registered.
L4: Approach sub-registration in the coordination group meetings and the dissemination of reports
analytical to all partners, as a way of finding alternative solutions and monitoring implementation
of actions to prevent the recurrence of subregute (synergy with the social action for children in
vulnerability).

Final report
L5: the development of an effective monitoring strategy (data collection and
reports) based on the consideration of socioeconomic and gender disparities such as support for
of timely decisions to strengthen the integration of gender considerations and equity.
L6: The use of new technologies to promote birth registration helps improve levels of
registration. In the experience carried out in Gabú, led by the young people, techniques used by
young “Twitter, Telegram, Instagram, as well as the development of some teaching games”, which should
be considered as a lesson learned.

of an administrative view, the national territory is divided into eight regions (bafatá, biombo, ball/bijagós,
Cacheu, Gabú, Oio, Quinara and Tombali). The regions are also subdivided by 38 sectors and the sector
Autonomus of Bissau (Sab), which is the political, economic and administrative capital of the country. In the partner domain,
economic and political, Guinea-Bissau occupies the 176th place among 187 countries, with an index of
Human Development (HDI) of 0.353. The average age of the population is 18.83 years, being the age
median 19 years for the female population and 17 years for the male population4. The population in
2019 was 1,920,922 inhabitants and in 2020 of 2,023,552 inhabitants (with the female population to
represent 50.4%) 5. According to the same statistics, the Guinean population was, in 2009, of 1,565,842
inhabitants.

with generic skills, and the Public Order Police (POP) is under the direct supervision of the Ministry
from the interior6.
The presence of the state in the administrative regions is still institutionally fragile and is challenged by the force
of traditional leaders and the consumed authorities. The various ethnic groups that make up the rich
Cultural diversity in the country has non -formalized mechanisms of governance and distribution of justice.
These mechanisms and their authorities can be designated "traditional justice" 7. All these structures
interact with a series of community organizations, NGOs and other entities that often
undertake actions by which the state should be responsible.
Population growth has been a permanent feature of demography in Guinea-Bissau since
Independence. From 1975 to 2005, the population grew 3% per year. The last census of the population in Guinea-
Bissau Bissau was held in 2009, (INE, 2009), when there were 1.5 million inhabitants. It is believed that
These projections underestimate the UN population and agencies consider the real population in 2019
as being 1.9 million8. In terms of geographical distribution, SABI houses more than a quarter of the
Guinea-Bissau population (30.8%), followed by the Oio region (16.7%) and the two Oriental regions, Gabú
(11.5%) and Bafatá (11.1%) 9. In addition to SAB, the largest cities in the country include Gabú, Bafatá and Canchungo,
All with about 300,000 inhabitants as a whole (INE, 2009; UN-HABITAT/CMB, 2019). These areas
urban, and Bissau in particular, are increasingly concentrating population growth and
play a significant role in the general development of the country. The level of urbanization seems to have
quickly accelerated in recent years in Guinea-Bissau-Bissau. The urban population was little less
40% in 2009 and projections suggest that it would rise to only 49% by 2030 (AFRISTAT/INE, 2013). Node
However, more recent estimates and projections suggest that Guinea-Bissau is close to having half the
population in urban areas in 2019 (Un/Des, 2019), making it one of the most urbanized countries of
West Africa.
The most recent population data, from the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DES),
Population Division (UN/DES, 2019), it appears that Guinea-Bissau follows the standard of other countries
Africans when having a visibly young population. Just under 42% of the population has less than 15
Years and just under 20% is between 15 and 24 years old. In addition, these last projections indicate
that population youth will continue in the near future, despite the continuation in the past of a
Trend of decline of birth, decline of fertility and increased life expectancy. THE
Percentage of the population under 5 is 15.6%.
Allied to population data, Guinea-Bissau is one of the poorest countries in the world, according to most
development indicators. The country has been on the list of the least developed countries (PMDs) since
1981, (UN/CDP, 2019). Remains within the group that the World Bank designates as low countries
Income (PBR), with a per capita gross national income of US $ 1,025 or less, in 2018.
Bissau occupied the 178th place among 189 countries in the United Nations Human Development Index
In 2019, (UNDP, 2019). It also has a high level of income inequality measured by a coefficient
Gini of 50.7 and 42% of income to Senr detained by the richest 10% of the population (WBG, 2019). This puts this
Inequality in Guinea-Bissau well above most of its structural peers. According to the index
From the fragile states of 2019 (FFP, 2019), Guinea-Bissau is the 19th most fragile country among 178 index countries.
Although its risk assessment has improved in recent years, it remains the fourth state
Fragile of West Africa, after Nigeria and Niger. The main factors of fragility emphasized are

Final report
Classifies Guinea-Bissau as "fragile" for three reasons: a) It is eligible to receive assistance from the Association
International Development (IDA) (B) has a UN peacekeeping mission in the country
(UNIOGBIS) 10, and (c) has a low score of "governance" 11.
Internally to the country MICS-6 data present that 20% of the population is considered as very
Poor (in the fifth Quintil) with the second Quintil combining 20% of the population. The richest represent
only 20% of the population. Observing that more than 60% (first and second quite) are in the
rural environment. Still according to the same source, due to the prejudice of gender in access to resources,
Poverty affects women more than men. Young women and girls in Guinea-Bissau
They are more vulnerable (with fewer teenage girls with access to education).
The fragility of the country's institutions is reflected in the fragility of the national statistical system. The difficulty
of having accurate and updated data affects the level of accuracy in planning, programming and
Budgeting of the results. However, two major national research was conducted during 2019:
The MICS-6 supported by UNICEF and research the living conditions of the World Bank/Economic Union and
West African monetary (Waemu) (performed in 2020).
There are 139 public health (US) units in the country (19 US are private), 10 are regional hospitals, 3
Health Centers (CS) Type A, 34 CS Type B and 92 CS Type C (primary basic treatment) 12. The nomenclature
A, B and C distinguishes them in relation to the intervention package assigned to them (more or less
Complexes such as surgeries in CS type A).
Education is the responsibility of a single ministry, the Ministry of National Education (MEN). With
The support of the UNESCO team in the "Dakar Polo", Men developed a sectoral education plan
(PSE) for the period 2017-25, where there are a series of future investment reforms and priorities,
(MEN, 2017).
1.2 Context of interventions and key challenges in the birth record in Guinea-Bissau
Birth registration is a basic human right and an essential means of protecting the right to a
child to a name and an identity. Serves for statistical purposes and offers proof of age against certain
forms of abuse and exploitation, such as child marriage, trafficking in children and/or children in conflict
with the law13. The direct consequence of the lack of birth registration makes children access to
their basic rights, such as education and medical assistance; It makes it difficult for governments to do
Planning based on reliable population data; and exposes children to a higher risk of violations,
like children's marriage and child labor. The lack of registration has a negative impact on both the
access to basic services such as health or education, and protection of rights
Individuals, as regards the realization of other rights, such as voting, employment, inheritance, etc.
The diagnostic study of the civil registration system, carried out in 2017, highlighted the disabilities that
characterize the civil registration system in Guinea-Bissau: numerous deficiencies in the current legal framework
(inconsistency of texts, which are not very explicit about essential procedures and, conversely,
They are unnecessarily restrictive about other registration methods); bad property and application of texts
by the actors in the area; lack of political commitment to civil registration, which results in a
sector sub -finance; insufficient number and lack of qualified personnel in the structures involved in the
civil registration to support the registration of civil registration events, with the result that the poor quality
Services may lead to the disability of certain certificates issued; insufficient availability of inputs
(valid records); office or logistics equipment for a more effective strategy of

In terms of the demand for civil registration services by the population, the low level of literacy of the
population, combined with the lack of registration procedures, has an effect on consciousness
the importance of registering events, including the birth registration.
Given the connection between birth registration, the realization of other rights and development, is
important contextualize the tendency of sustainable development objectives (SDGs), whose objective
ODS 16.9 aims to offer legal identity to everyone, including the birth registration,
access to education, better data for health, migration and insurance and travel documents
by 2030. It was from this perspective that several initiatives emerged to support the levels of registration of
Birth in West and Central Africa (WCA), both regional and national level.
Given the magnitude and complexity of the challenges to children's rights, their impact on the load and
prevalence of fundamental private private and central Africa region (WCA), and ambitions
growing agenda for sustainable development of 2030, which require new forms of work
To accelerate progress, UNICEF has defined fundamental results for children (RCCs) and in the area of
Birth registration, RCC#7 aims to accelerate the process of reducing the proportion of
Children not registered.
To promote the universal registration of children and reposition the civil registration system and
Vital Statistics (CVRs) in Africa, the African Union (UA) and UNICEF launched a campaign on 17
June 2020 that aims to combat the "indignity of the invisibility of all children
Africanas. "The campaign is based on the premise that the lack of birth of children increases
their invisibility in societies and makes them more vulnerable to marginalization, discrimination, abuse and risks
associated protection, such as children's marriage, child labor, forced recruitment for groups
and armed forces and trafficking3. Three priority strategies were supported by the AU to accelerate the registration
Universal of Birth: i) computerization of civil registration systems; II) Strengthening of
Interoperability with other social services, such as health and even education; and iii) decentralization of
provision of services.
At national level, the government of Guinea-Bissau, led by the Ministry of Justice, through the Directorate-General
of civil identification, registrations and notaries and with the support of UNICEF, other agencies of the NU and partners
development, is involved in projects in the scope of modernization of civil registration through the
law, and in the assistance and acquisition of computer materials for the process of digitizing the

value of US $ 1,000,000, which was completed in 2018. UNICEF was responsible for this project
cooperation, in the modernization of civil registration services and the improvement of conditions in the environment of
work, having rehabilitated four centers of civil registration services and beginning the interoperability
between the health sector and the records.
However, the registration of all children remains a challenge. In recognizing the growing relevance
registration of birth for regional and continental policies and in recognizing the huge
learning opportunities among countries about increasing strategies and operations of
Birth registration, UNICEF has commissioned this formative assessment of several RCC countries#7 (registration
of birth).
1.2 BACKGROUND OF THE EVALUATION
The evaluation process began in June 2021 with the organization of an opening meeting with
The Monitoring Team of the UNICEF Regional Office. This meeting helped harmonize the
Understanding the mandate between UNICEF and OAG. Subsequently, a meeting organized on 13
July 2021 with the Unicef office in the country also allowed to collect expectations and identify the
List of the main documents. Sharing key documents with the consultant team helped
develop a first draft of the initial shared report to collect the various inputs (August-
September 2021). This report was also presented to the members of the Follow -up Committee
National Level of Guinea-Bissau. Once approved by UNICEF, the OAG team organized the formation of
Local staff with the support of the National Consultant (October 8-10, 2021). The launch of
Data had some delay for the need to obtain the necessary authorizations. Was finally released in
October 30 and completed on December 2, 2021. Based on the collected data, a presentation
preliminary results was made in January 2022 to have UNICEF (National Office and
Regional office), employees of the Directorate-General for Civil Identification, Registrations and Notaries, as well as
partners of other sectors (health, education, statistics, justice, social action, NGOs) and other partners of
development involved in the evaluation process.
The interventions carried out under the project to support the modernization of the civil registration system in
Guinea-Bissau were the subject of a final review with the support of the country's office in October
201915.Assessment
1.3 Objectives and expected results from interventions
Since 2016, UNICEF as a partner of the Guinea-Bissau government has been reinforcing the executive in its
ability to expand and consolidate the coverage of the birth registration of children, cooperation
agency technique covers the areas of policy (definition and implementation), institutional reinforcement
(capacity), increment of multisectoral dialogue for integrated responses and the improvement of production of
CRVS System Data.
In 2019 a meeting was held to reassess the existing strategies that contributed to the low
percentage of registered children (46%) that compromised the expected results by 2030. To change
The registered trend were analyzed and discussed the following action proposals:
• Increase birth registration coverage through the health sector through the use of
immunization/vaccination platforms;
• Increase coverage of action with the insertion of the Ministry of Education as a platform
for birth registration;

Final report
• Modernize and innovate services through the adoption of a
Information16 (ICTs) that replaces the analog system used;
• Strengthen the investigation with the inclusion of new records;
• Build partnerships and boost resource mobilization.
1.4 Planned activities and implementation strategy
This assessment focuses on the interventions supported by UNICEF, in Guinea-Bissau, in the record of
birth. Relate to the main strategies used at national level: i) interoperability with
Health, including immunization and intropeability with the inclusion of education; II) CVRS reform; and III)
Mobilization/Community involvement.
The main activities of supporting the modernization of the civil registration system in Guinea-Bissau included the
establishment of several agreements to enable cooperation between the related state institutions
with the RN; the formation of regional instructors; the formation of civil registration actors and health technicians;
the conclusion of the evaluation of the civil registration and vital statistics (CRVs), with the conclusion of the new strategy
National for civil registration and vital statistics (CRVs) prepared with the involvement of employees
Regional Civil Registry and Health and Education sectors; the reinforcement of the civil registration system with the
Construction and rehabilitation of 4 new civil registration centers; the supply of computers to the
Directorate -General for Civil Identification, Registration and Notary (DGICRN) and Regional Representations, the
supply of furniture and office supplies for all hospital registration centers and
Civil registration, hospital and conservatory centers of registration; support for instrument development
monitoring and decentralized monitoring, the collection, transmission and reception of data from
Civil registration in real time (Rapid Pro); the systematization of monthly data data from the registration centers
Civil; the implementation of social mobilization service with radio ads, methods of
traditional communication and free birth registration throughout the campaign and the implementation of
interoperability health/civil statute in all regions, in addition to the formation of registration officers and the
other technicians in the area of civil registration and the vital events system.
Based on achievements in 2018, UNICEF supported the extension of interventions with the increase in
birth registration services in the sanitary units, located in all regions of the country, of 15
(in 2018), 24 (in 2019) to 27 sanitary units (in 2020), to have the objective to increase the rate of
Birth registration of children under seven in all regions. Also, due to
equipment offered to RN officers, the community range strategy has been expanded to areas
remote, aiming at the most vulnerable populations, especially in the regions of bijagos, Tombali and Gabu,
where 950 children in 2019 and 4,435 children in 2020 were covered (including children at risk of
apostride, in partnership with UNHCR). Within the partnership between the Ministry of Justice and the National Institute
Statistics - INE, the RN Data Management System continued to be improved and the capabilities in
Data collection matter were reinforced.
The main activities are briefly presented:
- reinforcement of the coordination mechanism (justice/health/civil/statistics) at level
decentralized (in the regions);
- The development of clear instructions (protocols) to reinforce the interoperability between
Services (Civil Registry/Justice/Health/Statistics/Education);
- Acquisition of the necessary equipment for civil registration services, health centers and courts
in all regions, to improve the functioning of civil registration and vital statistics;
- Support in the routine operation of the birth registration (notification and filing of
Civil Registration Documents);

vaccination centers, in addition to 100% of civil registration posts, thus starting an increase in
coverage of birth registration services. During the period of interventions the response of the
project focused on reinforcing the Ministry of Justice's multisectoral capacity to increase the
coverage of birth registration services:
the reinforcement of the partnership between the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Health allowed to extend the
Service for Health Units;
the partnerships between the Ministry of Justice with civil society (OSC, religious leaders and
traditional) and the private sector, increased social mobilization for the relevance of
registration and increased its demand;
It is noteworthy that the project promoted the multisectoral articulation to increase the coverage of services

1.6 Role of UNICEF and stakeholders in the implementation of the program
All UNICEF projects have a systemic purpose of approach that articulates the main theme
with areas that are intrinsically linked because they reinforce it. In this regard, the project combined other
areas, summarily described below:
- Multisectoral reinforcement focused on health services and education services
- Social mobilization with the involvement of religious leaders and traditional leaders
- CRVS Reform
- Gender equality.
For the first component and in the health area we highlight the birth registration service in
service infrastructures with qualified professionals and the activities of promoting their
Access made with pregnant women and children at vaccination age. These actions
contributed to recognize that the health sector is one of the entry doors in the assignment of the
Birth record. Regarding the education sector, it is also considered a gateway
to increase the coverage of the birth registration, because the school enrollment requires
Presentation of this test document.
In the context of social mobilization, the involvement of traditional and religious leaders in campaigns
of the birth registration encouraged families to seek this service. It is also emphasized that
these communication actions promoted the equity and equality of gender in the right to registration
of birth and social awareness that is a right of girls and boys.
In the area of gender equality and empowerment of women the implementation of the project fulfilled
with the planned. Established partnerships with OSCs that work with women's movements and
with obcs to ensure that interventions that promote access to registration services
Children (R.N) are included in their programs. The OSCs who work at the community have
identifying adolescent girls and women without access to birth registration and have
referred to the cases for the services of R.N. In addition to these, community interventions were
reinforced to ensure that girls and vulnerable women have access to social services and
are more trained to engage in community participation. The women involved
in economic and political activities, as well as the vulnerable girls enrolled in

The project was implemented throughout the national territory, that is, in the 8 regions (38 subsectors and the
of the capital) including in the farthest regions.
1.8 Change Theory
The project change theory was developed based on project documents and reports
activities. Presents an overview of the main interventions and results intended for Guinea-
Bissau. The intervention logic highlights the following aspects:
 The expected results
 The main activities planned to achieve these results
 causal relationships between activities and results in the form of hypotheses
 factors that can potentially interact due to mechanisms driven by intervention
 Strategies used in interventions
 Hypotheses and Risks
The reconstruction of the theory of change is the first step in the evaluation process, as it highlights the links
among the main activities of the project and the expected results, which guides the development of
assessment questions.

3. Evaluation focus
3.1 Thematic Areas
Formative evaluation will focus on four main components:
- Multisectoral reinforcement focused on health services and education services
- Social mobilization with the involvement of religious leaders and traditional leaders
- CRVS Reform
- Gender equality.
For the first component and in the health area we highlight the birth registration service
service structures with qualified professionals and promotion activities to their access
performed with pregnant women and children's children. These actions contributed to
Recognize that the health sector is one of the gates of entry into the attribution of the birth record.
Regarding the education sector, it is also considered a gateway to increase coverage
of the registration of birth, because the school enrollment requires the presentation of that document of
proof.
In the context of social mobilization, the involvement of traditional and religious leaders in the campaigns of the
Birth registration encouraged families to seek this service. It is also emphasized that these
communication actions promoted the equity and equality of gender in the right to the registration of birth
and to the social conscience that is a right of girls and boys.
In the area of gender and empowerment of women, the implementation of the project complied with
the planned. Established partnerships with OSCs working with women's movements and obcs
to ensure that interventions that promote access to children's registration services (R.N) are
included in your programs. Community OSCs have been identifying girls
adolescents and women without access to birth registration and have been referring cases for services
of the places. Beyond these the community interventions were reinforced to ensure that girls and
vulnerable women have access to social services and are more trained to engage in the
Community participation. Women involved in economic and political activities, as well as
vulnerable girls registered in literacy and income creation programs, they were integrated
in awareness processes.
3.2 Geographic Scope
The evaluation extends to the national territory, that is, in the eight regions (38 subsectors and the capital zone)
including in the farther regions. The sample covered the regions/subsectors that are supported by UNICEF
and operate the existing CRVS system and the subsectors who have not yet implemented a system of
Integrated civil registration.
The main activities implemented were:

5. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
5.1 Evaluation Approach
The general assessment approach adopted is called the contribution analysis. In this analysis
the theory of change is reconstructed to determine the expected results, the activities planned for
achieve these results and identify the external factors that may have interacted during the project. To the
hypotheses were developed to explain under what conditions the activities contributed to the obtaining
of intermediate results. Based on the approach of the contribution analysis, the evaluation was performed,
looking for consolidated evidence in:
• The activities implemented;
• The chain of results achieved;
• The causal links between activities and results (theory of change); and
• The external factors that interacted with the implemented activities.
Through the theory of change it was possible to perform the analysis of evolution, in order to establish until
Point The intervention contributed (or not) to the identified results.
Whereas, primary quantitative data, such as home research, cannot, in themselves
only, offer the complete information necessary to understand the levels of birth registration,
mainly in some target areas, it was considered that: existing research based on the population
and routine monitoring data linked to national CRVs systems offer greater

Final report
clarity. The combination of secondary quantitative data and qualitative data to use methods
participants offer deep enough information about the use of registration services
Birth and the perceptions and expectations of direct and indirect beneficiaries. From the perspective of
formative research, qualitative and participatory methods can help to better understand what and
why it worked, in the opinion of the beneficiaries and implemented partners, and to identify lessons
learned obtained in the implementation of interventions.
The evaluation, therefore, followed a participatory and consultative approach, ensuring the participation of
All stakeholders involved in the implementation of interventions, including women.
Throughout the evaluation, from conception to analysis, the genre was considered as a dimension
transverse. A gender and age sensitive approach was adopted both in the conception of instruments
collection and data analysis, as in sampling for collecting primary qualitative data and
Development of ethical and security measures. Regarding the Convention on the Rights of the Child,
the evaluation team ensured that children and young people18 were sufficiently involved throughout the
evaluation process. The data were disaggregated by sex, age and other relevant variables.
5.2 Data collection methods and tools
It was used for this evaluation, a pre-test/post-test approach. A cross-sectional study
and exploratory to use mixed methods, such as endline assessment (bottom line). The base line was (re)-
built from relevant monitoring routine data, the data were based on the population,
originating in the district health information systems (DHIS), MICs and IDS and depended on where
Data on the birth registration were collected, and the years covered by population research.
The telephone line consisted of the analysis of secondary quantitative data such as monitoring data
Routine, MICs, IDS, DHIS, etc. Discussions in reflection groups, semi-interviews were organized
structured and dialogues with the project partners. Qualitative interviews will allow more
Information on contextual factors.
For the telephone line, a convergent design of mixed methods was used - the quantitative data and
Secondary qualitatives were collected simultaneously (within the same period of time). THE
Integration was performed during data analysis and interpretation of results.
The secondary quantitative data offered the starting point for analysis, and the qualitative data
provided a better understanding of the quantitative results.
5.2.1 Qualitative Methods
Qualitative methods consisted of:
1. Document Review - of program documents, including national and international literature. THE
documentary review will include all documents related to the program, such as the
Assistance to the development of the United Nations (UNDAF), documents from the National Program of
UNICEF (CPDS), annual reports from Unicef countries, national action plans of nine countries,
Regional strategies and other documents that will be suggested by the UNICEF Regional Office. This
Review will be supported by preliminary discussions with the regional office evaluation advisor
UNICEF and ERG that will contextualize and offer additional clarifications on the relevance of
Documents and other relevant information for a better assessment framing.
2. Semi-structured interviews (SSIS) for the collection of information to the main partners: (i) at level
Community including local authorities, OCS (s) and other community service providers; (ii)

Final report
Key informants (kiis) providers of health services, education, legal and children's protection, gender
and social action, at sub-national, national, international and regional level. In semi-structured interviews
(SSI) Thematic scripts will be used and individuals representing the main
partners. The objective is to collect detailed information and data related to what works and what
does not work in terms of community involvement that positively or negatively influences
the service of R.N. It is noteworthy that the semi-structured interviews will also earn the quality of
community mobilization, if behavioral changes occur and if they are
lasting, if the quality of the service provided has changed, if the demand has increased and still
will allow you to identify gaps and good practices in community mobilization.
3. Interviews with key informants (kiis) using thematic scripts aims to the main
interested, including representatives of local implementation partners or non-organizations
government, community, religious and women; Sectoral offices and relevant ministries; the
UN and other development partners; The UNICEF Regional Office and National Office:
Protection section to the child. Development Communication Section (C4D) and other sections
considered relevant.
Kiis offer information and data on the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and
sustainability of community mobilization strategies such as: to what extent the activities
RRC programming included equity and gender in its conception (drawing) and the system of
Monitoring (drawing and implementation); identify good practices and gaps and offer information
institutional basis on thematic areas that cannot be captured quantitatively or
through reflection groups. Interviews will also explore the lessons learned from the
implementation of interventions, as well as the factors that facilitated the achievements of the main
Results. Respondents will be chosen based on their involvement in national programs
supported by UNICEF and will be transverse to all categories of the target groups and key actors of the
project. In Guinea-Bissau, will be held between 10-15 kiis. The participants of the interviews will be
chosen from the list of participants provided by the UNICEF Regional Office and by
Guinea-Bissau national offices. Consent form and thematic guides for the
SSI/ KII are detailed in Annexes 5 and 6.
4. Discussions of Center Groups (DGCs) to use participatory assessment techniques. These will be
performed with adolescents and children (12-18 years), parents/educators; Community dialogue and/or
Education facilitators, organizations of women and community leaders. The discussions of the groups
of centering (DGCs) will be performed with adolescents (12-18 years); adolescent parents (15-18 years);
Young adults (18-24 years); and parents/educators (women and men). The female participants and
Male will be grouped separately to promote open and active participation; organizations
female (religious organizations and women who work in political participation) and leaders
traditional and religious. The sampling groups in which thematic scripts will be used will
offer information about the quality of community mobilization activities and change of
Sustainable behavior achieved with the project, as well as equity and gender; What worked
And it did not work in terms of community mobilization and suggestions for improvements. This will allow a
profound understanding of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, sustainability of
Community mobilization.
The choice of participants for the discussion groups will be made when using sampling methods
purposeful (the evaluation team will develop some clearly contextualized eligibility criteria
to participate in discussion groups) with the support of the country's program and the
“Guardians” and mobilizers of the community. DGCs will be recorded in audio. To maintain the
anonymity, the name will be registered on the presence sheet and will never be cited or correlated with the
data. Audio transcripts of the results will be presented in a graphic guide and

later analyzed. About 55 DGCs are foreseen in Guinea-Bissau (Table 4 in the
Annex 5). Consent form and topics' guys for group discussions are
In Annexes 7 and 8.
During group discussions, especially with the most vulnerable groups, such as single mothers
and refugee women, we will ask if they were able to record their children's births
And if the answer is negative we will try to create this opportunity especially if the reason is barriers
in access. We will ensure that field teams articulate with local authorities
competent to guarantee the birth registration service to mothers who do not have their
registered children.
Participatory Assessment Techniques: DGCs will include the use of the "proportional stacking method
Before and after. "This participatory tool, similar to a game, will be used during discussions
with groups, especially with children/young people and with rural communities. The procedure
begins with a brief discussion of ideas about a particular topic (for example, "what is your
Opinion on the campaigns of mobilization and awareness of the community? ")
will receive a series of stones (20 to 40) so that they can represent the previous satisfaction levels and
After the program. The answers are recorded figuratively by the proportion of stacked stones
on a particular subject. The discussion of the issues is guided by the representation of
stacking of each group of stones, allowing the team to unveil a set of information
qualitative about the project. The topics of discussion are exposed by the stones and the exercise continues
progressively with participants to consensus on the proportions of each group
of stacked stones. Proportional stacking can also be used to represent the line
base and compare it with the situation prior to the project (2018) and after its implementation. THE
visual proportion of each group of stacked stones allows us to (qualitatively) the impact
Community mobilization activities of the program.
The most significant change technique (MSC) is another participatory evaluation tool
with reference to the nature of the project, key interventions and target groups. We propose as
sample the target groups of adolescents (15-18) years (boys and girls) who were involved
In the activities of the project. Is one of the techniques of telling very useful stories to capture the
Results/changes resulting from the participation of beneficiaries in the project. In Guinea-Bissau, they are
the facilitation of two (2) MSC exercises provided for.
MSC's philosophy of use is to promote collective learning among project participants
and the stakeholders. Can also be used to develop some case studies, short,
based on the extracted stories that can be used to highlight the main conclusions and the
Final reflection of the evaluation. The identification of history is a decision of the participants and should include in the
His narrative, the most significant changes that resulted from participation in the project. All this
construction script of the chosen case studies has support documentation and are stories
human generated by the implementation of the project.
Dialogues with multiple actors - this will involve a dialogue process with the main actors
involved in the implementation of the program: UNICEF employees (child protection sections)
in national and regional offices; Ministry of Education and Health in each of the countries
participants. Ministry of Planning and the National Institute of Statistics, as well as the entities
of the Civil Registry System. Add the technical and decentralized implementation partners
as the local authorities and social actors of the promotion of gender equality.
5.2.2 Quantitative data (exploration and analysis of secondary data)
As part of the evaluation, secondary quantitative databases will be used to analyze
indicators related to the birth registration (national and regional registration fees), MICs,

In addition to other national data systems that consider themselves relevant and still reports
of previous programs can be used. The triangulation of the data will allow to establish the
Comparative analyzes between the base line and the results of the RCC 7 program.
5.3 Sampling method
A purposeful sampling was used for the selection of ESS (including CIS) and DGC participants.
Tables 4 and 5 detail sampling methods for different participants and
expected sample.
Figure 6: Qualitative research sampling
The data were collected
as presented in
Figure 6 to seek to meet
nearby and distant places
to guarantee a
homogeneous coverage of
country. The kiis were all
held in the city of
Bissau (Sab).
The recruitment of
DGC participants was
made by the consultant
national, in collaboration
with community leaders and
stakeholders of the
government. In discussions of the center of centering (DGC), participants were chosen to use several
criteria (occupation, religion, gender, ethnicity, civil registration, age, neighborhood), including criteria of
Vulnerability, such as deficiency, displacement or refugee condition, etc. This ensured that the
different groups of the communities were well represented and also allowed a diversity of
participants' opinions. Once in a locality, the national consultant had a first session of
I work with community leaders to make a sociological profile of the village. This knowledge of
context helped to better structure groups and samples in order to ensure greater diversity
representative of the local reality.
To make the field survey, they were chosen between two or three toilets in each of the
main intervention regions. In each of the three regions, 7 toilets were chosen
randomly (all rural). In the region of Bissau, only the city was chosen. Thus, they were chosen8
sanitary areas that benefited from the intervention. In total 30 DGC and 6 SSI and 12 KII were performed,
which represents 191 people interviewed (43% of the female genre and 57% of the male genre). As
representativeness of the number of people interviewed in the 3 regions, the regions of Gabu and Oio had
a representativeness of 38 and 34 percent respectively, in the region of Quinara with 23 percent
interviewed and the SAB region with 6 percent. It is noteworthy that 95% of the kiis were performed with the

5.4 Data analysis and quality assurance
5.4.1 Data Analysis
For qualitative data, DGCs and SSIS (including the kiis) were recorded and transcribed. The data were
analyzed to use the method of analysis of thematic content. Based on the main evaluation criteria,
a tabrade matrix was used to identify for each of the evaluation questions the main
Key themes by tool type and informant category. The techniques used were the approach
inductive and an open thematic coding20. Transcripts were codified, using themes and sub-themes
common, according to the evaluation matrix.
The analysis of the results was guided by the evaluation matrix, in order to ensure the triangulation of the sources
of data. The data were processed and synthesized to collect and analyze the results of each of the
Evaluation criteria and questions (Annex 3).
Data triangulation was performed to use data from different qualitative methods. This
It allowed to identify points in agreement and disagreement within the respondent groups.
We also triangulate qualitative data with secondary quantitative data to better understand
the results.
RCC#7's theory of Change (OCD) offered information on how the activities contributed to
achieve the results.
5.4.2 Quality guarantee
The quality assurance of evaluation products will be a priority of the evaluation team. All
products will be shared with the UNICEF Regional Office Evaluation Advisor Responsible for
Evaluation and ERG, for information and approval. Quality checks will be included in all
process steps. We will use data triangulation to increase the validity of the study. We will
Systematize in the evaluation matrix the research data sets by subjects and not by lot.
Assessment questions and study instruments will be harmonized and understood unanimously
by the evaluation team. All field staff (supervisors, inquirers, data facilitators and
Information annotators) will have intensive training facilitated by international and local experts.
The training will be performed through the use of a training manual with information on the purpose
and objectives of the evaluation. This was designed to improve interview skills, control of
data quality, adherence to ethical principles, and familiarize the field team with the
data collection. The training will be participatory, interactive including presentations and simulations of
interviews and discussion groups.
The evaluation tools will be tested to verify the practicality of the methodology, as well as the
Fluidity and ease of implementation of questionnaires and guides. The instruments will be tested as
integrality, ambiguity, adequacy, etc. Pilot tests will also serve as an essay for the
OAG team tune their approaches and techniques. A moderator and an information notigator will be
designated for each of the discussion groups. When necessary, local translators will be used

by the coronavirus. Based on this reality, several measures were incorporated:
1. Social distancing: social distancing, also known as physical distancing, involves
Reducing close contact with others to avoid spreading contagious disease.
During the discussion, we ensure social distancing, through the implementation of the following
Measures: 22
a) Session configuration: use of circular arrangements where participants in discussions of
reflection groups were invited to sit one meter (3 feet) to 1.5 meters (4.5 feet)
distance.
b) Avoid hand grip: we ask participants to avoid common greetings, such as
Hand tightening; instead we encourage them to greet with a hand signal or a
reverence, among other locally acceptable gestures.
2. Handwashing: We offer a portable set of handwashing with base sanitizers
alcohol in all meeting places to allow participants to often clean the
hands.
3. Offering face masks: we offer participants masks to be used during
the meetings and the interviews.
4. Video Conference: All efforts were made to limit near or prolonged physical contact
Between individuals during the evaluation, or with external stakeholders. The national consultant had the

an unstable political environment by 2018.
The strategy is part of the general development structure of the country and contributes to achieving
objectives of the National Development Plan related to the rule of law, governance, cohesion
and respect for human rights and the priority needs of the country, as it was

15. As part of the development of interoperability protocols, a partnership was established
with the health service and the judicial system to strengthen the collaboration between the centers of
civil registration and these services. The partnership with the Statistics Institute was also signed in 201946.
According to UNICEF RAM, in 2021 the immunization campaign with the support of partners
(UNUR, UNDP and PLAN) increased the number of children registered (in 2019 and 2020) and this connection
With the immunization campaign, it was considered crucial in reinforcing the National Statistics System.
Rel Q 3 - To what extent is the identified interventions contributed to reinforce the system
of national data and the birth registration system?
16. The Civil Registry sector is one of the areas of the national statistical system where data is not easy to obtain
to monitor the activities, as the main indicators are very often offered by
national surveys made by the National Institute of Statistics, whose sampling methods
do not allow information such as village or neighborhood47. In order to remedy this
situation and having useful data for decision making, UNICEF implemented the collection system
rapidpro routine data, which offers information on various indicators (number of
Births made in the conservatory; Number of births registered after the deadline; number
of deaths occurred; direct registration fee, etc.) 48. UNICEF inserted the existing data in CVRS,
last 7 years49. This strategy allows you to obtain reliable and timely information (monthly or annual)
on the birth registration process and evaluate the activities performed. This helps to offer
local information when national research data cannot be made available or
monthly or annually. Therefore, the strategy used for data collection strengthens the system
national vital statistics and contributes to its continuous functionality. It was from the information
extracted from RapidPro that data related to the NB of under 1 year and RN of Minors was obtained
5 years, as can be seen in Figure 6.

Final report
The system is still being managed by UNICEF, but is being passed on to DGICRN, but some
data has a time of delay to be inserted in the system, given the arrival time of the
paper forms.
REL Q 4 - To what extent is the different monitoring and evaluation strategies were capable
To measure the results of the chosen approaches? And how could they be improved?
18. All regions manage their monthly data communication mechanism, as indicated in
Documentation of the project offered by UNICEF and the quarterly technical meetings held. This
system allows to monitor the evolution of the Civil Registry, at the community level, monthly,
according to the planned births, calculated from the projections of the National Institute of
Statistics (INE). This allows the civil registration service to have a scoring form and a goal
monthly for birth registration. These data are validated by employees in charge of
Community organization (COC) at the region's level and presented at the technical group meetings
regional. This feedback makes the various actors analyze and discuss the causes
poor performance of certain places. During the first quarter of 2019, the use of Rapid SMS was
tested to facilitate data collection and reporting: each civil clerk was formed
To report data via free SMS. All these efforts made it possible to have community data
based on the existing civil registration in the region. As extracted from the SSI:

project and availability of information and data at decentralized level, by gender, by groups
And by locality it can be said that the monitoring system is critical to the project result.
As part of the monitoring and evaluation of birth registration interventions, two strategies
They have been used by UNICEF, one at operational level and one at national level. Nationally, it was
created a consultation table with several stakeholders, with regular meetings organized under
the authority of a representative of the Ministry of Justice. At the operational level, this mechanism was
decentralized to the regions. Independent of the level, these structures reinforced monitoring
constant and enable the participation of birth registration activities, to put this area of
protection to the child at the center of the priorities of local authorities with a political commitment
for their promotion as a fundamental right of children. According to an interview with the general director
“The organization of periodic follow -up meetings, both central and operational,
with all key actors, allowed to regularly monitor progress, evaluate the difficulties and
find solutions according to the actors involved… we can now say that we already have data
reliable to make decisions. ”

State, the Ministry of Women and Social Action and the Ministry of Education) were able to meet and were
protocols developed to strengthen interoperability between services (civil/justice registration,
Health/Statistics/Justice, Education/Justice). This practice facilitated registration procedures and reduced
the gaps between civil registration and other ministerial entities.
Preliminary conclusions
REL 1: RCC#7 interventions address the main problems of the birth registration system
in Guinea-Bissau, having been built from the analysis of the needs identified in the studies
initial diagnoses (paragraphs 1-3). Support for the development and technical and political validation of a
national strategy with a budget action plan, allowed the country to improve documents
appropriate legal (decrees/orders), as well as interministerial memorandum of understanding as
political and legal framework documents for the civil registration system to be renovated, the
culminating with the revision of the national strategy for civil registration and identification of CRVS. They are, therefore,
relevant to the country's development vision regarding the civil registration sector (paragraphs 1-5);
REL 2: The effective implementation of health interoperability through maternity services
and vaccination approached the services of the civil registration of the population, reduced the seizures and barriers of
psychological, financial and structural nature, and created a synergy of action among the actors who deal
with the issue of identity. The partnership, although limited to government institutions, reflects a
Action synergy. Interoperability with education and the institute of social action increases the
Awareness and a synergy of action mainly regarding law (paragraphs 6-8);
REL 3 - The different strategies used and the partnerships developed around the implementation of
RCC#7 interventions contribute, on the one hand, to strengthen the quality of civil registration services
and improve its use by the population to ensure access to an identity for
Guinean children. Coordination meetings are fundamental for the updating of
implementation and the strategy of implementing all actors, helping to reduce bottlenecks in
provision of services. (Paragraphs 8 -13).
Rel 4: The Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanism, which integrates the systematic production of reports of
Civil Registry Analysis, promotes the continuous measurement of expected results indicators over
of the years and makes it possible to evaluate the progress done. This mechanism contributes to decision making
national level in terms of planning for national development, but still lacks a
greater updating as to previous years (paragraphs 14-16).
REL 5: The systematic and continuous supply of birth registration materials and the maintenance of
functional bond between health and civil registration services contributed to the strengthening of
Birth registration system at both local and national levels (paragraphs 17-18).
Rel 6: The uniqueness of UNICEF technical assistance, reflected in the specialized support transferred from
regional office for the country's office, as well as the continuous financial support adapted to
Implementation of interoperability, found a favorable terrain in human resources

28. UNICEF interventions are in accordance with the project proposal established in 2018 by
all stakeholders and supported by the Ministry of Justice DGICRN, to ensure the
Modernization of the Civil Registration System in Guinea-Bissau. To meet the government program
raised in its strategy, the reform of services involved several technical and financial partners,
Among them Bad, the Portuguese Financing Agency (PBF), the EU, UNUR, Oim, UNICEF,
UNFPA and UNDP. In addition to these partners, national organizations were also called to participate,
mainly those linked to the genre. As an example the PBF supported the implementation of the strategy

relating to civil registration. Still as a title of example, scholarships, obtained in Brazil, allowed
that master's theses were carried out on the analysis of civil registration in the country focusing on problems
priorities in order to improve the sector.
29. UNICEF was DGICRN's main actor and partner in civil registration activities, although some
actors had activities that included civil registration in their missions. This can justify the fact of
UNICEF approach has been holistic, and addressing various types of obstacles: those related
With the political environment, the offer of services and the search for services. In this context, the creation of
coordination group, where existing data analyzes were performed, launched the foundations for the
collaboration between all ministerial departments and partners interested in the issue of registration
Civil. This group allows UNICEF to ensure coherence between its strategies and those of others
partners, as well as the intervention areas chosen for each partner and the needs to meet
in terms of RN.
30. The creation of the Technical Working Group allowed a gradual and stronger mobilization and a better
involvement of all actors, but also facilitated the intersectoral coordination of all
actors and the alignment of UNICEF interventions with those implemented by PLAN
International This group provided a framework for the sharing of the activities developed by

the various programs to support the civil registration, in order to mobilize actors with directed approaches and
agreed, which meet international standards.
32. By promoting interoperability, UNICEF's strategy facilitated the alignment of its interventions
and the choice of areas with those of other partners who work in the area of civil registration. UNICEF
promoted complementarity, especially at the decentralized level, in communities, with
health interventions (involvement of community centers and vaccination campaigns), with
interventions in education (request for birth registration when registration at school) and
field of governance (connection of communities to the internet network). Despite decentralization is
note that the coordination is still predominantly at national level and dependent on the
UNICEF.
33. It is noteworthy some success stories in implementation in Guinea-Bissau, such as the activities of
RN to children victims of violence (children assisted by protection services) and children visited
and supported by homes and orphanages where 26 houses were supported by interventions
information and awareness about the importance of RN (97% of all homes) 53 by
partners of the Institute of Social Action.
Cohe q 7: to what extent were the contextual factors (political instability, movements
population, emergency, among others) considered in the conception and execution of the intervention?
34. The socio-political situation and the emergency context strongly influenced the conception and
Implementation of birth registration interventions supported by UNICEF. During conception
of interventions, socio-political instability, socio-political crises were identified as
Main risks that had to be faced to facilitate the implementation of interventions. From the
The same way, weak political support to civil registration was initially one of the main obstacles, but
through promotion actions UNICEF was able to involve national authorities during the process

Formative evaluation of the main result for children on birth registration (RCE7) in Guinea-Bissau
Final report
The messages were passed to the entire population. This approach, which was fully led by
Community members ensured involvement in the project. According to conversation maintained with the
Community and Religious Leaders: The interesting thing is that we have always led this process. Only
We had the training and did everything. We have to improve and put more young people to get
reach more people. We have many young people here in the community… SSI with community and religious leaders
in Gabu and Oio.
37. During the implementation, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began on March 13, 2020,
UNICEF has performed actions to mitigate the effect of this pandemic, both on professional contacts and
by providing protection equipment to all civil registration agents, community leaders
and religious, in order to maintain operational civil services and ensure the continuity of
birth registration in civil registration services at the regions. This intervention contributed
strongly for the continuity of awareness actions across the country. By way of example were
Delivered sets of hand wash, masks and leaflets in all regions of the country.
Cohe q 8: to what extent is the conception and execution of the intervention throughout the country, they were
in agreement with international norms and principles?
38. The adoption started in 2018 and approved in 2021 of the reform of the civil registration system, offers the
national institutional and political context for the monitoring and application of norms and standards
both globally by the African Union and allowed the strengthening of the role
health services in the declaration of births, which are registered.
39. The implementation of interoperability is in accordance with the expected results of PDN 2018-
2022 In its effect 3 "People exercise their rights and duties in a context of democracy
promoted "of impact 1 on the strengthening of the rule of law of the strategic axis 1 connected
"Strengthening the quality of institutions and governance" that stipulates in their points IV and VI
respectively that "human rights are respected in the national territory" with "a single
population file ".
40. With the support of UNICEF, DGICRN created safe records to ensure certificate reliability
of birth, according to UNICEF RAM and confirmed in Kiis with all conservatives
of the records both central and regional.
41. UNICEF framed the communication and awareness strategy of the RN according to the standards
international, but adapting it to the reality of the country, where cultural practices were taken in
Consideration (example, a mother whose father does not want to register her child should not go to the newborn, a child
which died shortly after birth does not need to be registered, among other cultural practices). THE
Figure 7 presents some of the communication materials used. According to a technical report
Published in the Journal of Science, Tropical Medicine and International Health55 (“Tropical and Health Medicine
International ”), most women surveyed (86%) had received messages about the registration
of birth, but few women whose children had died had heard of the need
to record deaths (22%). The main sources of information about the birth record were
messages transmitted on radio or posted on health facilities. Registration information
of deaths were obtained mainly through informal social networks.

Final report
Figure 7: Communication on birth registration
42. This communication strategy is in accordance with the priorities defined by the African Union in the
scope of the implementation of agendas for Africa, namely the agenda for Africa 2063 and
Agenda for sustainable development of 2030, which "give primordial importance to the need
ensure that all vital events of each citizen are recorded and the information collected,
compiled and disseminated in a continuous and regular way to guide policy, planning and for
inform the decisions, which ensures mutual transparency and responsibility in all issues of
development. In short, interoperability supports the campaign "My name is nobody: to
each child is a legal identity, for each child access to the newborn. "
interoperability contributes to the implementation of the African Union's recommendations on the
Interconnection between the different components of the civil registration system.
Preliminary conclusions
Cohe 1: The partnership developed under the implementation of intervention interventions is
fundamentally institutional among government actors. However, the specific actions of
local implementation partners are aligned with those developed in the context of
interoperability (paragraphs 27 to 29).
Cohe 2: The implementation of interoperability is reflected in the PDN, respect for human rights,
including the right to a legal identity, and extends to the priorities of the agenda for the
Sustainable development of 2030 and the 2063 agenda of the African Union, and is completed by
provisions of article 24 (2) of the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights and Article 7 of
Convention on the Rights of the Child, which enshrines the registration of birth as a right
Fundamental (paragraphs 35 to 39) + the GDs (paragraph 39).
Cohe 3: The contextual factors were taken into account during the conception and implementation of
interventions and adjustments have adapted to the objective of achieving the results expected by the
Project (paragraphs 30-31). The socio-political situation and the emergency context influenced the
Implementation of birth registration interventions. Yet, during the health crisis linked to covid-
19, the continuity of services was ensured through the involvement of health services and measures
protection strongly disseminated by the project (paragraphs 32 to 34).

Final report
Cohe 4: UNICEF interventions in the birth registration program have helped to ensure
continuity of civil registration services through equipment, training supports,
communication strategy among others (paragraphs 39 to 42).
6.3 Effectiveness
Effectiveness measures the degree of achievement of project activities.
EFICA Q9: To what extent is it that the birth registration interventions achieved the objectives
intended in relation to the planned results? It is possible to highlight the more
promising?
43. Although it is undeniable that efforts have been made to achieve the results expected by UNICEF
(Table 6), 15% of the results were not fully achieved. The most evident performance
refer to the provision of routine data by public services, coordination meetings
and to the mechanisms of interoperability that extrapolated the intended results. Table 6
shows the expected results and achieved according to the project's logical paintings, according to

44. According to the interviews, there are promising practices observed that were defined and
classified as the most prominent: i) coordination mechanism at national level and in
development of collaboration between the main actors involved in the implementation of
interoperability, ii) in the existence of conditions, health centers and civil registration offices,
with management tools related to the registration of civil registration events, iii) in the existence of
structures and tools for monitoring civil registration services by the authorities involved
central level that must be chained to all regional levels, iv) in the efficient management of
instruments and forms, v) the availability of statistical reports, on the registration of
birth, monthly, although this is not systematic in all regions, VI) in the existence of
a community declaration mechanism in all regions, by leaders
Community, religious and traditional, which is sent to regional headquarters VII) in the training of actors
involved in the implementation of interoperability (training of health workers, officers
community health, education officers etc.), viii) social mobilization to increase the awareness of the
importance of birth certificates, (IX) use of radios and television programs as a way of
increase social mobilization and (x) in regular data collection to monitor the performance of
system, notification of births in health facilities for civil registration, despite the
LACK OF THE SAME SYSTEM IN PRIVATE HEALTH ESTABLISHMENTS.
45. At the national level, the program worked to support the government in the creation of a political framework and the
establishment of an interoperability mechanism between civil registration, health and education,
as reported in the annual monitoring reports of UNICEF and in all interviews
realized as kii. As a result, the country now has a national strategy for reform and
modernization of civil registration. The support of UNICEF, within the scope of the thematic group for the
Decentralization has been useful for obtaining the government's political commitment. However, the lack of

public financing for the strategy does not allow its effective implementation at all levels
as was the intention of UNICEF and the government.
46. As part of the new strategy for increasing the birth registration rate for minor children
7 years, the skills and capacities of the various social actors of different social actors were reinforced
services, in particular traditional and religious leaders, local administration technicians, technicians
civil registration, responsible for community -based organizations, teachers, health technicians, between
others. For this, a manual was prepared (which was the basis for training and training sessions)
which contains basic information about the importance and benefits of birth registration for
240 health technicians in the field of registration birth, where 127 community health agents,
45 immunization technicians, 13 hospital social workers and 55 nurses, where women
They represent 45% of the total participants in the 7 regions of the country. 105 were also trained
traditional and religious leaders and 01 queen in regions whose rates are very low. Participation and
involvement of these leaders, causing communities and families to have more
information about the birth record, and should be considered a lesson learned to be
expanded to all more distant areas. It is to emphasize the importance that in SSIS leaders
community and directors of the sanitary regions granted the work done by the agents of
Community health and social workers, regarding the awareness of the population.
47. On the part of the political decision makers, the Ministry of Justice, through the Directorate -General of Civil Identification,
of the records and notaries, organized a seminars with the 25 deputies of the nation, including the
deputies who are part of the specialized committee for women and children
in the popular National Assembly, with the aim of reinforcing their influence with the areas in
that were elected to mobilize populations in demand and access to registration services
civil, especially the birth registration and, on the other hand, advocate together those responsible for
more investment in the area of civil registration. This seminar repercussions nationally in several programs
television (as mentioned in an interview by the conservative of central services and the conservative
of the Quinara region).
48. To further enhance and reinforce the knowledge of the populations in relation to the benefits of
birth registration in a child's life, UNICEF supported the Ministries of Justice and
Social communication, in the formation of 60 technicians from the different media (radios
community, commercial, religious, newspapers and television) about the relevance of the birth record and,
above all, they can be strong driving agents, through correct information
related to new strategies, approaches and forms of diffusion of information in languages
places were strongly discussed and agreed. As a result, several
types of audio-visual materials written, about the registration of birth and the amount of
radio programs increased considerably from 2020 to 2021 (according to information obtained
at SSI meetings at regional level).

Table 6 portrays the 539 actors related to the civil registration formed in Guinea-Bissau, by genre56.
It is verified, by the table that the female genre is always below the male, especially in what
refers to the religious, but this is justified by the predominance of the male genre as strength
of work. In an interview with UNICEF's monitoring area, this one assured that all
existing female technicians were formed.
49. A real -time monitoring system for the registration of civil registration events was
implemented and regular data collection was reinforced in order to monitor system performance
and notify the civil registration of births occurred in health facilities. This mechanism
monthly data collection and information and opinions is functional in all regions through the
SMS57 system. Thus, the training of civil registration actors, judicial actors and actors
statistics involved in the civil registration system addressed issues regarding how to perform tasks
related to the civil registration, the standardization of the birth registration, the notification of the registration,
data collection mechanisms to monitor system performance and archiving
Civil registration documents.
50. At the capital level, Bissau, the Youth Association and its agents were formed with the concepts
on the importance of birth registration (90 young people). Table 7 presents the training

53. Support for the organization of awareness campaigns in 2018 reached approximately 400,000
people through educational conversations, community dialogues, messages in churches and centers
health. Communication and awareness activities through the 65 community radios and the
Ads produced by UNICEF reached 60% of the population.
54. At the decentralized level, the project strengthened demand through training activities
community and social mobilization, and the offer of civil registration services through the improvement of
capabilities of the various institutions involved. Sensitization activities and free campaigns
helped improve the demand for services by the population. According to the UNICEF report
In 2018, 90 young people were formed to support awareness raising and 2020 38
Young people were formed as a way to increase awareness.
55. One of the assumptions made during the strategy of modernizing the civil registration was that a better
birth registration fee would be reached by capturing children who come to consult
during vaccination. Thanks to the simulation created by the reform and modernization of the civil registration, the agents
of health were part of the birth record in the vaccination campaigns that were held.
56. For community leaders, the formation and support of the action plan focused on mobilization
social and community involvement in the birth record, as extracted from the meetings
realized.

Formative evaluation of the main result for children on birth registration (RCE7) in Guinea-Bissau
Final report
EFICA Q10: To what extent is it that the birth registration approaches contributed to
the planned objectives of the RCC 7 project
57. The implementation of the above activities allowed the development of approaches to
achieve the expected results of the program and promising practices were identified for
constitute solid pillars in case the program is extended to the next 3 years. These
promising activities were referenced in the meetings that occurred with the key informants,
mainly:
- Interoperability is a tangible reality due to the results obtained; The use of
advanced health strategy (monitoring of vaccination campaigns by
civil registration agents) to register children who have not been registered;
- The installation of advanced civil registration posts in health facilities, in order to
Record children during routine immunization sessions;
- The coordination mechanism at national level and development of synergies between
main actors of ESA (interoperability) when properly established and in
operation is the place of discussion and management of the process and the obstacles to be
outdated;
- Strengthening the capacity of the actors of the civil registration system (training of presidents
of the Chamber, civil registration agents, COCs, health and justice employees, etc.) and
Functionality of registration services is one of the pillars of the project; operations between
health facilities and civil registration centers are now synchronized and contribute
implicitly for the quality and reliability of civil registration data;
- Community involvement in regions for the declaration of birth, where the pre-pre-
records are filed in a notebook (according to information obtained in the interviews
directed), remains an efficient activity because it is based on traditional rituals;
- Social mobilization to sensitize public opinion on the importance of
birth;
- Regular data collection to monitor system performance, notification of
births in health facilities to the registrar so that it can include in the
Rapidpro;
- The partnership with the Ministry of Women and Social Action to care for the most
vulnerable and reception centers and
- The involvement of traditional and religious leaders in birth registration activities.
The latter were involved in disclosure activities that sensitized people
for the importance of birth certificates, during religious sermons (according to the DGC
with mothers of children, more details about the RN can be obtained during the sermon
religious). The involvement of educational establishments also boosted the registration
(Both by requesting the registration at the act of enrollment and the meetings with parents and
educational guardians).

EFICA Q11: What are the factors (UNICEF internal and external) that made the most
of the planned objectives of the project? Other factors beyond the crisis can be added
Pandemic from Covid-19?
58. During the implementation of the program, there were factors that influenced the progress of activities.
These factors may or may not be related to UNICEF. These were characterized in all
interviews conducted as being primarily:
- the delay in the supply of harmonized records, which affected the possibility of registration;
OAG - March 2022 www.myoag.org / info@myoag.org Page 60

- The country's socio-political situation (referendum disputes, presidential elections, etc.) that affects
the continuity of the activities provided for;
- illiteracy of the population;
- Lack of means for formative supervision in all regions, with a scarce number of

59. These factors were extracted from the information collected from the key informant interviews:
- The creation of a national coordination mechanism, with quarterly meetings with
a very high frequency and opening for the entry of new partner agents;
- Joint exits of registration agents and health agents for advanced strategies during
immunization campaigns for the registration of children;
- The installation of advanced civil registration posts in health facilities, in order to
Record children during routine immunization sessions;
- The coverage of remote areas for interventions with the help of moving means put to
provision of civil registration centers;
- involvement of community, religious and traditional leaders;
- involvement of the technicians of the Ministry of Women and the social action.
EFICA Q13: What are the unexpected (positive and negative) results produced by the
Birth record?
60. Interviews with Unicef corroborated by those with the holders of rights, direct or indirect,
indicate that two main positive results were achieved, namely rehabilitation and construction
new civil registration units, and the commitment and support of the municipalities to the process of
implementation of interoperability mechanisms to improve collaboration between the civil registration
and health through maternal units. In this regard, the request for involvement is note
of the Ministry of Education in commitment to promoting the birth registration in the meetings
with those responsible for education, as highlighted by secondary sources and interviews with actors
of the sector.
EFICA Q14: To what extent is the interventions responded to the expectations of the community and the
partners?
61. In the meetings of the discussion groups, it was found that although the level of registration is still low
(46%), having a legal identity for your descendants is a key expectation of all parents, without
gender difference. As such, interoperability has helped meet the needs of
communities, which facilitates parents to register in the maternity ward where childbirth occurs, which reduces
Indirect costs affecting access to civil registration services. According to interviews with the
Health Officers (in the three chosen regions and in SAB) it was evident that all mothers only leave the
motherhood with the registration of the son.
62. The population's awareness of the child's fundamental right to have a birth record,
According to the interviews, group discussions and interviews with key people are undoubtedly

Final report
Paradigm change and health interoperability is crucial. There is already the conscience that
It is not necessary to wait for school age to register the birth.
63. The continuous involvement of partners, especially local partners and advocates of rights
humans was a comprehensive practice that encouraged participation and awareness of the genre,
As a result of the meetings with community leaders and religious leaders. The involvement
From the Institute of Social Action was an added value.
Preliminary conclusions
EFFICE 1: Birth registration interventions have a very good level of effectiveness, as
in which they allowed to achieve the vast majority of the planned results, and in some cases overcome the
predicted results, in particular: i) the development and adoption of a political framework that guides
interventions of all actors in the area of civil registration in general and the registration of birth in particular,
which takes into account all the main challenges of the sector; ii) the establishment of a structure of
multi-actor coordination, the implementation of reformed procedures with protocols
interoperability with health and justice, combining education and social action; iii) the centers equipment
civil registration and other related services (health and justice); iv) the social mobilization of communities in
favor of birth registration; v) the formation of personnel of civil and health registration with the objective of
improve your ability to provide services in accordance with the standards for interoperability with
Statistics was also ensured (paragraphs from 40 to 44 and 54-56). But data monitoring
It is not yet desired, it makes bottlenecks not effective and allied
to this, the low use of vaccination centers by the population reaches the good performance of
interoperability.
EFFICE 2: These interventions allowed to create a table for the coordination of civil registration activities
in general, to develop the capacity of civil registration actors and to equip the offices of the centers
of civil registration, to overcome obstacles (sanitary context linked to COVID-19, of late availability
of records and the socio-political context), which often influenced the programming of activities
Operational (paragraphs 45 - 49)
EFICA 3: Of these interventions, promising practices are interoperability, coordination among all
actors, social mobilization, communities empowerment and the use of advanced strategies for
communities, which support the increase in birth record. However, coordination and
interoperability of multiple factors do not work everywhere, including health centers
Private (paragraphs 50 - 52)
EFICA 4: Technical Commitment, the availability of financial resources and the training of technicians
offered by UNICEF are the specific factors that led to the success of the
interoperability. The support of the Ministry of Health in synergy with vaccination campaigns and with
ASC supported the success of the project. In addition to these internal factors, there are those external to Unicef, in
particular the express will of the government in the National Development Plan, the quality and the
commitment of the ministries involved in the national civil situation and in the birth registration strategy
in Guinea-Bissau (paragraphs 33 to 36). The involvement of parliamentarians in the awareness campaign
increased the confidence and faith of the population (paragraphs 45 - 47)
EFFICE 5: The weak communication on the implementation of interoperability in the Bottom-UP direction
(“Ascendant”), illiteracy among the population in rural areas, the perception of the birth record
as an additional workload and the insufficient awareness of the community are the main
Obstacles for the achievement of the objectives (paragraphs 58, 59 and 63). It is noteworthy that it is the commitment
Community with the birth registration (paragraph 53) that exceeded the obstacles that occurred.

put into practice in Guinea-Bissau?
69. the availability of financial resources, in the face of financial insufficiency and the commitment
insufficient state, as observed by the registrar of the Civil Registry of Oio, “we are not
financially capable of managing financial records financially, but we have the ideas, but to
perform the activities we need we had to resort to the financial contribution and the ability to
Schedule donors by UNICEF. With this support we were able to operationalize the strategy of
interoperability in 17 maternal units of the country and with the 2,766 health agents, we got
Achieving almost all over the country and we grant RN to 25,161 vulnerable children in the 4 years of the project. ”
70. This financing established a link between health and civil registration services, which goes beyond
of birth registration and strengthens collaboration bonds between actors with different practices.
“It facilitated the availability of logistics (existence and availability of records), provided during the
pregnancy monitoring visits to establish a social dialogue with parents and midwives,
granted a deeper relationship with the newborn's parents, according to interviews with
Health technicians at Quinara, Oio and Gabu units.

Final report
71. Financing for sanitary units, vaccination campaigns with agents of the registration of
birth and social health agents (interoperability with health), made education and
the Institute of Social Action to approach vital records for support in increasing the
Sensitization and awareness of the need of the newborn. Although important, financing continues
insufficient, given the current scope of the commitment to sensitization and communication on the
children's rights to identification, which reinforces and requires greater involvement and accountability of
State. As the group of the heads of the tabancas in Quinara expressed themselves, “the expression for the newborn
it is only more with the government and we municipal leaders, with the churches, the youth groups,
with schools, with social action, with the elderly, with health (mainly), that is, it is with all
we Guineans ”, DGC in the Qinara region, Buba Community, with community leaders and heads of
Tabancas.
Efficiency Q17: What were the main factors that influenced implementation in terms of
cost-benefit ratio?
72. The interoperability implementation project was conceived and implemented according to a
approach based on close collaboration with all state structures with responsibility
by civil registration (Ministry of Interior and Safety, Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Health and
Public hygiene). Interviews with central directors and some civil registration officers reveal that the
coordination in a participatory structure and the relationships of this coordination with the partners,
repercussions on the good use of human resources, the inclusion of more partners who offered themselves as
Voluntary support, they represent greater consistency to implement the strategy.
73. In financial terms, the separation of management (supply (“supply” and administrative) at UNICEF
It made it possible to inject the scarce resources mobilized. In terms of resource availability
the co -optation of institutional actors and their commitment to work for reorganization
of the Civil Registry Management System contributed greatly to the adoption of laws to promote practices
and system stability. The quality of human resources and, above all, their availability and
commitment to work in the civil registration sector, as highlighted by interviews with the holders
rights (central directors, UNICEF and partners) and annual monitoring documentation
demonstrate that these were the factors that contributed to the optimization of the project.
Efficiency Q18: to what extent other strategies (or strategies should have been implemented
alternatives) to achieve the objectives and results provided at the same level of achievement,
But at a lower cost?
74. The strategy of interoperability continues to be, after the triangulation of information, the most appropriate
in the context of the birth record in Guinea-Bissau. The proximity it creates between the population and
Health and civil registration services is the basis for the support of professionals and beneficiaries Detsa
Strategy, which is unanimously well received by all stakeholders. Proximity to
education could be re-analyzed with primary and secondary activities, in the
Sensitization of young people (future fathers and mothers). Work with young people could become a
voluntary work in the city councils, being careful to avoid similar situations in other
Countries where volunteering exceeded the need for awareness of the fundamental right.
These two strategies will undoubtedly improve performance indicators and walk the
complete registration of all births in the country at a very small cost, and will become
possible for young people to remain in their environment. The fact that there are no maternal units
in all villages in the country, which has the effect of reducing the proximity between the population, the service
health and civil registration, with the corollary to minimize accessibility issues
geographical, financial and cultural and the availability of services for the population would be an incentive for
the use of young people. This was also stated in a SSI conversation with the conservative of the Gabu region

and with the technician of the Women's and Child Institute, “from the need to sensitize young people to
Cause of universal law to the registration of birth. ”
75. Communication carried out by religious and traditional leaders, at no additional costs for the project
It was a lesson to be repeated in other countries. For this in communication actions Unicef stressed
the support received.62 Television programs with deputies and parliamentarians were very important for
awareness and awareness of the population (which represents two advantages; in the votes of
voters and in the image of the nationalization that leads in itself).
Efficiency Q19: What were the most efficient and innovative strategies and interventions that contributed
To accelerate compliance with CCR objectives#7?
76. Information obtained from secondary sources and primary interviews indicate that strategies
implemented concern the adoption of a new civil registration law that clearly integrates the
health of health, as well as new mechanisms for the registration of births and deaths within the deadlines,
the development of records and their availability, and the supply of forms in all
maternities and vaccination centers. This strategy does not reduce the need for registration centers
civilians in all regions. The most effective strategy, which was unanimously recognized during the
Several interviews remains registration with motherhood since birth. For all actors
of the system interviewed, this approach has a high impact on the process of registering
Birth in the country. Statistics show that the birth registration rate increased by 23% in
2017, the reference year, to 46% in 2020, ie a qualitative leap of 23 points in the space of
three years of implementation and despite the context of COVID - 19. In addition to improving performance in
terms of birth registration, provides beneficiaries a sense of completeness, because
remove any concern they may have with the registration of a birth.
77. The strategy presented with the involvement of the coordination technical group was innovative and
allowed for more results, particularly for the decision level in changing changes
implementation (guarantee of service to vulnerable and marginalized populations), however, is
more laborious and raises concerns about sustainability, regarding the ability to
financing for meetings. However, innovative strategies included:
- The use of telephones in the registration centers for the sending of SMS (Civil Registry Office)
for the declaration of births occurred;
- The monitoring of civil registration agents with health workers during
Vaccination campaigns to register children;
- The installation of advanced RN posts in the child's friendly schools;
- The monitoring of civil registrars for the fields and refugee regions with
UNUR and WFP employees during food distribution to register children.
Preliminary conclusions
Efficiency 1: The project was able to mobilize the necessary financial and human resources, as well as the
quantity and quality of logistics, to achieve the expected results within the expected period of
interventions related to training, coordination of interventions, provision of records for
needs of birth and communication about the need and importance of the registration of
birth. The insufficient financing of the public sector, however, negatively affects the
Implementation of interoperability (paragraphs 62 to 65).

Final report
Efficiency 2: the availability of financial resources favored the operationalization of interoperability in
17 maternal units in the country and established a bridge between health and civil registration services. This
operationalization led to a paradigm change in community perceptions in relation to the
Birth record. The interoperability strategy remains the most appropriate to improve the
Birth record. The results suggest that operational birth records should be created
in all maternity units to cover the identified gaps in order to reduce the number of
Births that are not registered (paragraphs 65 to 68).
Efficiency 3: regarding the interoperability between civil registration and registration in sanitary structures and the mechanism
coordination of all actors in the registration system is in operation, but in some
sanitary structures due to human resources problems The coordination mechanism can be a
Unfortunately. But both approaches bring better results in real time and at the lowest cost,
that many of these actors are not included in the program budget (paragraphs 68 to 74).
Efficiency 4: The strategies used, especially for the support of the decision level, were quite efficient,
with a system appropriation and a very effective government's retro-food.
(Paragraphs 75 to 77)
6.5 Sustainability
Sustainability refers to the ability of the program or project to generate permanent changes in the
reality in which I act.
Sustain q20: to what extent UNICEF has incorporated measures to ensure that the funded activities
For the birth registration program continue in the future without the support of the agency?
78. To facilitate the continuation of activities if the support of UNICEF CESSE, a training program
was developed by UNICEF, with the elaboration of a procedures manual for the instructors
of the civil registration system. The transmission of knowledge by colleagues encourages the duplication of
knowledge and the adoption of new practices within the structure by these colleagues, who affirm their
Determination as actors in the health system to ensure their continuity;
79. In the context of the implementation of interoperability, a special emphasis was given to the sustainability of
Interventions. Thus, despite the technical assistance that led to the adoption of decrees that regulate
the organization and functioning of the Civil Registration System, UNICEF continued to defend with the
The implementation of the birth registration policy as well as the involvement of the state in the
financing and functioning of the civil registration.
80. The strengthening of interoperability among all actors of the civil registration sector (Health, Justice,
statistics, NGOs, education, social action, transport, etc.) and the stabilization of
coordination created, such as administrative coordination meetings at the regional level and the structure
concentrated action for the child's protection, these are measures that favor the country to continue
Birth registration activities in the future without the support of UNICEF. The decentralization of
technical group meetings has been one of the keys to the success of the project sustainability and
has allowed a strong involvement of all actors, with coordination and monitoring of the
implementation of the project. This strategy is focused on making changes with guidelines
clear to prioritize actions to be taken, at regional and local level, with a view to finding solutions
contextual for the identified problems
81. A data collection system for monitoring activities has been developed and is
currently in the responsibility of DGICRBN. This system will provide the monitoring of the RN and
for monthly analytical reports.

Sustain q21: what external (financial, human and logistics) and internal (social - resources - such as
change in mindset, motivation) of national programs supported by UNICEF demonstrated
that would allow the continuity of activities to increase the coverage of the RN, even if
Was there outside help?
82. In the regions, civil registration activities, during the implementation of the project were administered
locally particularly for the purchase of registration forms for the RN, and
sensitization making them continue without dependence on external assistance. Node
However, governmental financial submission made available to the civil registration are often
low and cannot meet all needs, especially where
civil registration have difficulty conducting registration campaigns and requires travel, given
the geographical conditions.
83. Despite their small dimensions, most rural areas have created conditions to record events
of civil registration. Although they have personal, their condition is often precarious, as they are usually
formed by volunteers without essential formation.
84. To be more sustainable, the birth record must be integrated into the institutional context of the sector
health structures, especially of vaccination and maternity services
It leads to a renewed commitment to the practice of service to register the birth.
Sustain q22: to what extent communities and institutional partners (which is expected to be
served by the birth registration program) have approaches and results
necessary for your continuous implementation?
85. In regions, registration procedures are performed locally, which is reflected in the quality of the
Filling of records, when training is insufficient. However, the heads of the
Supervision (DGICRN, among others) claim that they find less and less difficulty in
procedures during your supervision missions. The available manuals and the formations
techniques carried out in the regions represent a substantial improvement in the quality of maintenance of
Civil registration documents.
86. According to conservatives and civil registration officers, the collection of certificates also improved
due to the involvement of community centers and traditional leaders, who also use their
village notes to facilitate the registration of children without certificates and the delivery of
Certificates to parents who declared the birth.
87. Strategic campaigns are organized on market days or on festive days, to record the highest
possible number of children. Communities also organize awareness campaigns on
the birth registration and integrate the issue of birth registration in electoral campaigns. Us
Refugee Fields Campaigns are also carried out by partners.
88. The issues related to birth registration are on the political agenda at regional and local level. Like this

Final report
Sustain Q23: to what extent the activities of birth registration programs are integrated and
replicated/staggered by the government and other partners?
90. The approach adopted for the implementation of interoperability, as mentioned, is an approach
institutional that is strongly supported by the structures responsible for the country's civil registration. Therefore
The activities carried out from the birth record were directly integrated with state services.
Maternities have taken the role in the RN strategy and are implementing these activities
continuously. Maternity and vaccination services in health facilities evaluate the
prenatal registration and postnation assistance in their daily health care practices to
pregnant woman.
91. DGICRN included the acquisition of records on its planning. However, it remains very
dependent on technical and financial partners, since the distribution of funds to the civil registration
It is still limited. In a meeting held with the consultant team, the director of the Ministry of Women
and social action said:
“We are technically ready to do everything alone, but financial support is still
We lack. We are confident that we will reach more than 70% of children recorded in
next 3 years… ”
92. Maintenance of computer equipment was integrated into the regions budget. This budget
Regional is restricted and most computers are without antivirus and are out of date.
93. Regions with limited resources (logistics and financial) available
Monitoring and sectoral coordination missions of civil registration centers. So far is the
UNICEF, as part of its supervision activities, which evaluates all activities
carried out under the project. This monitoring needs to be absorbed by the municipalities,
so that they integrate in their activities the package of activities developed within the project
modernization of civil registration.
Sustain Q24: to what extent the national government has taken the lead and invested in registration systems
by birth?
94. The National Strategy for the Reform and Modernization of Civil Registry with its Action Plan
budgetary was validated in 2018 and officially presented for approval in 2020.
of this policy document reflects the government's commitment to promote the registration of birth
in the country, because it aims to improve the legal and institutional structure, ii) strengthen the

Formative evaluation of the main result for children on birth registration (RCE7) in Guinea-Bissau
Final report
96. The civil registration sector has seen the involvement of several partners in the last ten years (Union
European, UNICEF, Plan International, Portuguese Cooperation, UNDP, UNHCR) that support several
Projects. However, in UNICEF intervention areas, the government has hardly mobilized new
partnerships
97. Mobilization also refers to the implementation of interoperability, even on a lesser extent
with international partners. The partnership in the context of interoperability is only established with the
UNICEF. At the national level, the ministries involved in interoperability support unanimously
that efforts are being made to involve communities in the birth registration process.
This mobilization concerns particularly to community authorities, whose role in the management of life
Community in rural areas remains predominant, including women's associations.
98. However, this national mobilization has a limited range, as interviews with the parties
Interested report that a small proportion of the actors involved play an active role. Missing
Mobilization of the National Party in terms of mobilization of local entities.
Sustain Q26: to what extent the implementation of institutional and service mechanisms
(For example, coordination at regional, local and community, partnerships with NGOs) have become
possible to achieve and maintain (or not) the results?
99. In order to strengthen the coordination and monitoring of the implementation of activities, they were created
regional offices in all regions of the country to ensure the coordination of interventions
among the various stakeholders at the regional level. This institutional mechanism strengthens the
operational coordination of birth registration activities and information communication
at the end of each month for monthly goals with goals, but needs to be reinforced and
Supervised because constant delays in sending the reports occur.
Sustain Q27: How the activities of the birth registration program affected
Community the social environment (positive or negatively)?
6.5.1
100. Birth registration activities created a community of community mobilization in
around the importance of children's birth certificates and the commitment of women of
organize the birth record of your children. Similarly, the involvement of leaders
religious and traditional through the use of village notebooks strengthened their synergy with
civil registration officials, with whom they now work to identify children without
certificates.
101. The implementation of interoperability probably had more positive than negative effects
on the environment at the community level, about the social point of view. In all interviews
performed it was found that the registration of births in maternity was a factor of strengthening
social ties among community members. However, interviews and discussion groups
suggest that the issue of the father's identity is not yet resolved at the population level and that
There are conflicts. This is the case, for example, of single mothers, whose parents do not want to name the child,
where there was a divergence of opinions about the method of recording the names of the parents of the
child, with several cases where the midwife attributed the father's name without any verification. THE
Identity issue, therefore, remains a constant challenge in Guinea-Bissau and brings the seeds
of an implosion of social cohesion. The adoption of new mechanisms to clean the sector through the
National Civil Registry and Identification Strategy is therefore an opportunity to stabilize the
social environment of the community.

Final report
Sustain Q28: How the activities of the birth registration program were supported
by the private sector? And what was the role that the private sector played?
102. There were few partnerships made with the private sector. The partnership developed by DGICRN
with a local publisher/supplier made it possible to design a safe registration model with the
objective of providing children legal birth certificates that meet the national legislation and
International. Civil Registration Centers will briefly use this registration model now, which
guarantees the reliability and safety of birth certificates issued for children.
103. As part of the implementation of the interoperability mechanism between civil registration and health,
The partnership with private health structures has remained very weak. However, in the centers
urban, private health structures receive many births and can certainly contribute
to improve registration system coverage.
Sustain Q29: If the partnership has not occurred with the private sector to what extent it will be advisable
It is possible to approach it to a future financial support or programmatic support or as
Influential actor (law)? It will be possible to combine the three supports (financial, programmatic,
advocacy)?
104. With the exception of the partnership developed for the production of safe records, no other
Partnership is currently foreseen by the Ministry of Justice;
105. The partnership with mobile networks for the use of messages at reduced cost, and sometimes zero, has already been
Used in other projects and could be attributed as support in the birth record;
106. Other partnership ideas that could be attributed refer to the dissemination of messages in
televisions and radios, financed by the private sector (predominantly as law)
107. The partnership with the Ministry of Youth and Labor could be attributed, as a way to offer
stages for young people to act in the civil registration system (in this case would cover the program and
financial)
Preliminary conclusions
SUS 1: The sustainability of project achievements can be ensured by strengthening
skills of civil registrars to continually ensure registration in a timely manner, according to
national regulations, and the development of a set of mechanisms to ensure the
Continuity of the Civil Registration Service, including the availability of the Registration Procedures Manual;
the strengthening of health interoperability; and the stabilization of multisectoral coordination in
Coordination mechanisms existing at national, regional and local level (paragraphs 76-80).
SUS 2: The program contributed to the sustainability of the birth record in Guinea-Bissau, through
of the training organization, the establishment of a set of instructors and the creation of a
for the dialogue between the actors of the civil registration system. Training courses and the
procedures made available to municipalities promote the sustainability of
Registration (paragraphs 81-85).
SUS 3. The projects developed by UNICEF as part of the modernization of the civil registration in Guinea-
Bissau contributed to the sustainability and facilitation of the universal registration of birth through the
mass awareness, which led to the establishment of mechanisms to prevent or postpone cases of
children not registered at the community level, to equip civil registration centers, to establish a synergy
among all interested in the civil registration sector at different levels (national, regional, city hall,
local), (paragraphs 86 - 93).

Final report
SUS 4: awareness of the importance of civil registration between the decentralized authorities and the population
It can help support birth registration activities (paragraph 94).
SUS 5: However, low endowment for civil registration at central and local levels; the capacity of all
Communities to acquire safe records; the low capacity of communities to ensure maintenance
equipment (computer equipment, motorcycles) are obstacles to the sustainability of
activities promoted under the birth registration project with the support of UNICEF
(Paragraphs 95 and 96).
SUS 6: The private sector has been little involved in the program, but it could certainly be more
used, both in the promotion of campaigns, in the forms (as a law), in support of the insertion of
young people in the job market, in the use of mobile networks for awareness messages for the RN,
which should be more deeply analyzed. (Paragraphs 97 to 101)
SUS 7: Low public and local funding for civil registration is a major challenge for the sector and can
limit the sustainability of interventions and the implementation of the modernization of the civil registration in
coming years. It has an impact on the functioning of DGICRN and other public services
involved in this sector (paragraph 92 and 102 to 107).
6.6 Impact
The impact concerns the medium and long term effects on beneficiaries and society - positive
or not - directly or indirectly related to the project.

positive or negative in the beneficiaries of the program compared to other groups that
Have you benefited from the intervention? Take into account living and social behavior
108. The birth registration process is done without any distinction related to the area
Geographic of birth, ethnicity, level of education and occupation. Thus, girls and boys are treated
identically at birth, and it can be said based on informants and community members
interviewees who: "There are no significant differences in the registration between girls and boys ...". The principles
of gender do not interfere with the record of birth in this way, and one of the objectives of the project
It was that all civil registration services recorded all the births that occurred in Guinea-Bissau.
109. The issue of unequal treatment in the birth registration can only be considered taking
In case geography and distances to health centers, primarily on maternity hospitals. Although
efforts have been made to bring health services closer to the population, 40% of the population still
Lives more than five kilometers from a first contact health facility (MICS, 2018). In addition
of this, interoperability is only being tested in the units where there is maternity, which means
that there is a coverage gap to ensure geographical equity to the birth record.
110. Thanks to this RN project, the population became aware of the capital importance of a
birth certificate, especially if it is taken within the period required by law, which
It is at 30 days (6), although its gratuity is accepted until seven years (through an order
governmental). This change can be seen in the gradual evolution of the country's registration rates.
111. In addition, in order to reinforce equitable treatment, the new bill includes the possibility
mothers register their children, even if the father is absent at the time of the registration process
or there is no endeavor to have endorsed the child's fatherhood. It is important to note that in Guinea-Bissau,
It still remains, in some zones, the cultural context that grants responsibility to the father,

Final report
112. Since 2018, the results of the analyzes show that children's registration rates have grown
in all regions of the country, as shown in Figure 9, presented previously and below
presented (rapidpro data). The organization of community mobilization campaigns, during the
vaccination, different radio and television programs, preaching in church and the work of
health agents during which birth certificates have been issued for free have taken
continuous growth to birth registration rates, especially in 2021, although
Apparently there is an accumulation in 2018, because it integrates the last 7 years of data).

113. According to the results of the data routine analysis in the regions, data existing in the
Rapidpro, birth registration rates are higher in some regions, the region of the
capital of the country, where about 60 to 70% of the population resides. Qualitative results confirm the
the thesis that such is due the amount of women who reside in the capital.

115. The interventions took into account, the entire population regardless of vulnerability. As
several respondents mentioned “the right to dignity and legal identity is recognized for each
individual who lives or is born on Guinean soil ”.
Preliminary conclusions
Impact 1: The birth registration process is done without any distinction related to the area
Geographic of birth, ethnicity, level of education and occupation. Thus, girls and boys are treated of
identical way to birth (paragraph 106)
Impact 2: The integration of birth registration into the routine activities of maternity services
and immunization offers support for the effective involvement of the state. However this interoperability with
Health is limited to state structures which makes it difficult to participate in other partners in the process. Node
However, some NGOs are performing actions that are in accordance with interoperability (paragraphs:
107 and 108).
Impact 3: Comparative analyzes seem to show that birth registration rates are higher
In the area of the capital than in other areas, according to Rapidpro routine data. This is due to
Population concentration in the state capital (60%to 70%) (paragraph 109 to 110).
Impact 4: In relation to the social environment, interoperability contributes to the strengthening of ties
Community. However, this environment continues to present effects of cultural stigma, about the
Systematic attribution of the father's right to register the children. In this way mothers without partners find themselves with
cultural and social difficulties of registering your children. (Paragraph 111 - 113).
6.7 Gender and Human Rights, Equity
The issue of equity and gender is analyzed to take into account two elements: the social inclusion of the different
disfigured or vulnerable social categories and gender equality.
GDH Q32: To what extent is the principles of gender, human rights and equity
Properly integrated: in the design of the project; In the planning and implementation of the
birth registration programs?

Final report
116. During the conception of the implemented projects, the aspects of gender and equity were
integrated. All indicators chosen included the requirement of sex disaggregation, the
vulnerable categories (for example, the percentage of the population covered by periodic campaigns
communication and mobilization, the percentage of the population covered by integrated campaigns of
immunization, the number of officers and health agents formed and with resources to use the new
Procedures, the number of health agents to notify/declare births/deaths, etc.). THE
organization of the strategies presented helped reach all social groups, including groups
disadvantaged, which live in remote areas, with the help of community information centers
mobilized for this purpose. Similarly, the organization of registration activities in public places
(for example, market day) helped reach people from remote areas, as well as supply
of motorcycles to civil registration notaries to cover these areas, either to register children not
registered or to deliver the certificates to parents.
117. In planning activities as training workshops, quotas of women and men were defined.
Thus, as indicated in the project of the project's activities, the training sessions had as
objective regularly without distinction of gender, although the sector of the civil registration is
strongly dominated by men. In this regard, sensitization activities were organized
to raise awareness, including presidents of the House, about the need to involve
Women in Personnel Recruitment.
118. In the implementation of birth registration interventions, and more specifically in the
monitoring of activities, a collection system was developed focused on the disaggregation of
all indicators.
119. During the implementation of awareness activities, groups of women were involved
in campaigns mainly community health activists. In addition, the activities of
Civil registration were integrated into the healthcat for women (in particular, consultations
prenatal, campaign and routine immunization).
120. A manual was launched, (which was the basis for training and training sessions) that contains
basic information about the importance and benefits of birth registration for 240 technicians
health in the matter of registration birth, where 127 community health agents, 45 technicians

of the total participants in the 7 regions of the country. 105 leaders were also trained
traditional and religious and 01 queen in regions whose rates are very low. Participation and
involvement of these leaders, make communities and families more knowledge
About birth registration.63
121. During the implementation of interventions, the diversification of social mobilization strategies
(with mass campaigns through radio transmissions in local languages, use of posters,
involvement of community leaders and critics from the city, parliamentarians and journalists) helped
reach the entire population living in the most distant areas. Testimonies of community leaders and
of country indicate that through radio broadcasts, people were informed about the
procedures or registering births in time with community leaders.
GDH Q33: To what extent the interventions addressed the needs of the most vulnerable groups
in terms of access to registration services?
122. Interviews with members of vulnerable groups indicate that two types of expectations were
addressed: on the one hand, the issue of financial accessibility of birth certificates and the
geographical accessibility of civil registration services, and on the other hand, the knowledge of
procedures and information to be offered to benefit from certificates. In the first case, the

Communes that organized free application campaigns facilitated access to the certificate. In this
meaning, UNICEF has made available birth records to reduce the cost of procedures or
to make them free to the population. Similarly, the organization of outdoor campaigns and
the supply of motorcycles to civil registration agents to allow them to reach categories
Vulnerable in remote areas facilitated access to the birth certificates of several children. In
some locations, the organization of registration activities on market days also contributed
for that. Information campaigns on local radio stations in local languages gave power to
communities and facilitated the knowledge and information necessary for the
registration. This, in the opinion of several civil registrars, also implemented the records because, in
Many cases, parents living in remote areas tended not to remove certificates after
declaration.
123. The project not only served the most vulnerable groups, but supports the entire population. There is to be
emphasize the activities to orphanages and shelter houses of difficulties in difficulties, which were all
visited to ensure its integration.
GDH Q34: In the communities to what extent is interventions mitigated the barriers that
prevent girls' access to the registration of birth (social prejudice) and access to services
Basic social?
124. The integration of sensitization activities in health campaigns (vaccination and pre-queries
Christmas) offered women useful information so that they could know where births are
registered. In addition, the involvement of community centers helped reduce the difficulties of
Physical, geographical and financial accessibility. Interviews in different regions, with leaders
Community confirm this information.
125. There were, in all regions meetings with ASC on sensitization of we have as

GDH Q35: During the implementation of interventions, there were political, operational obstacles or
Administratives to effectively integrate the principles of gender, human rights and equity?
What was the level and scope of effort developed to overcome them?
126. As indicated in the project implementation report, gender disparities did not have
impact on the implementation of the project, because despite the civil recorders, registration officers and
supervisors at the regional level are mostly men, health officers and sanitary agents,
As well as young people were mostly women in order to parity in the gender.

128. Although the collection system does not have information on socioeconomic categories, the
available information is disaggregated according to the place of residence (Urbana vs. Rural) with
the possibility of having information on access to the nearest health unit and the school of
reference.
Preliminary conclusions
EGDH 1: The activities to promote the registration of births performed meet the needs of
children, including girls and boys, as well as women and men who work in the field of registration
civil (paragraphs 114 to 118).
EGDH 2: The inclusion of all rural and urban areas facilitated the access of vulnerable populations to
civil registration services. Community awareness (during vaccination campaigns, as well as
market days) increased awareness of cultural problems and social taboos. The use of
motorcycles by civil registration agents facilitated mobility for the most distant and difficult areas
access. The use of radio programs and young groups increased consciousness, especially
in the younger layer of the population. (Paragraphs 119 to 122).
EGDH 3: Establishing a monitoring mechanism with disaggregated data collection
helps ensure that the specific needs of girls and boys are considered and that measures
OpoTunons and cooperatives are taken to treat gender disparities (paragraphs 123-126).
7. Lessons learned
L1: the establishment of a national coordination structure, to coordinate all
interventions, with the participation of various ministries and civil society partners, made it possible to create
a dialogue space between the various actors of the civil registration system and to seek strategies
contextually suitable to increase the level of birth record. This coordination body
is also represented in several regions, under the highest local authority (for example, the governor
or the mayor), which provides a space for dialogue and the meeting of strategies
local. The advantage of these meetings is that they help unlock the obstacles arising from services
specific, support the identification of the causes of poor performance of the civil registration centers and seek
appropriate and contextualized solutions. Some regions have more coordination groups
operating and active that others, but the group at national level has managed and driven the groups
decentralized.
L2: The support and involvement of local authorities in promoting registration activities strengthens the
coordination of interventions among the main actors and allows conditions to be found for
manage the main bottlenecks in the provision of services, in order to ensure the continuity of services
of civil registration for the population. The inclusion of deputies, in terms of the appropriation of the bill encouraged
the program nationally.
L3: The adoption of an integrated approach (registration campaign, immunization programs, consultations
prenatal, implementation of child protection activities, children's education)
identification of people in greater vulnerability and improving the level of birth registration. THE
Integration of birth registration activities in the health activities package (immunization,
pre and postnatal consultations and the involvement of community health assistants) has helped strengthen
the registration of children, which reduces the number of children without registration of birth, as it has been a
Strong active in monitoring children at vaccination age. In fact, in practical terms, the

that is, for the whole country.
L6: The use of new technologies to promote birth registration, based on young people and their
Tools certainly helps improve registration levels.
8. FINAL CONCLUSIONS
By implementing interoperability as a new mechanism in the registration of births in the context
general civil registration reform in Guinea-Bissau, UNICEF sought to improve the registration rate of
births. This challenge was part of the premise that "if every child born in a health center
(70%) is registered and every child born at home who comes to the health center for immunization (a
additional 10-15%) is registered - so the birth registration within the legal deadline could be
increased and 80-90% of children could have the record of birth ". Thus, interoperability with
Health was developed in a concerted way to provoke lasting changes.
Relevance
PERT 1: RCC#7 interventions address the main problems of the birth registration system
in Guinea-Bissau, since UNICEF's support is based on an analysis of the needs identified both
national level as decentralized from initial diagnostic studies (paragraphs 1-5). The project
aims to support the country to achieve its objectives and priorities to improve registration rates
of births and seeks to face the main challenges related to the offer of services, the demand
and the political environment for the registration of births. Health interoperability is striking as
to its relevance. Although UNICEF's technical assistance played an important role, the
favorable political and legal contexts, including the commitment of human resources to the cause of the
recognition of universal law, supporting a synergy of coordinated actions are undeniable factors
for the success of this venture. (Pert 1, Pert2; Pert 3).
Coherence
Cohe1: To facilitate synergy in interventions, the creation of Cirmec was essential because it was able to gather
all actors of the National Civil Registration System and the alignment of UNICEF interventions with
of other partners and the government through the strategies adopted in the scope of the modernization of the system
Guinean civil registration. Jointly and concerted, the support of UNICEF is part of the
cooperation framework and ensures its consistency with DGICRN priorities, which coordinates all
Civil Registration Interventions in the country (Cohe 1 and Cohe 2).
Cohe2: Contextual factors were taken into account during the conception and implementation of the intervention
and the adjustments made in accordance to achieve the expected results. In addition, the risks
were analyzed during the implementation of the project, with the adoption of social mobilization strategies
adapted to the local Guinean context (use of local media, involvement of

Final report
religious and community leaders), as well as the organization of training for agents of
civil and health records. Also, during the health crisis linked to COVID-19, the continuity of services was
ensured through the mechanisms advocated by WHO (Cohe 3).
Effectiveness
EFFICE 1: The evaluation demonstrates that significant results were achieved during the period of the
project, to verify the existing birth registration percentages in the country, when the beginning of the
same. Interoperability contributed significantly to the increase in birth registration. To the
interventions in the birth registration area allowed to achieve the vast majority of results
in particular: i) the development and adoption of a political framework that guides interventions
of all actors in the area of civil registration in general and the registration of birth in particular, which
In fact all the main challenges of the sector; ii) the establishment of a coordination structure
multi-actors, the implementation of reformed procedures with interoperability protocols with
Health and justice, combining education and social action; iii) the equipment of several civil registration centers
and other related services (health and justice); IV) The social mobilization of communities in favor of
Birth registration; v) the formation of personnel of civil and health registration with the objective of improving
your ability to provide services in accordance with the standards. Interoperability with statistics was
also assured. However the immunization service component has been little used and needs
Additional support, since it is a very promising channel for the registration of children.
EFFICE 2: These interventions allowed to create a table for the coordination of civil registration activities
in general, to develop the capacity of civil registration actors and to ensure the quality of work
in the offices of the Civil Registration Centers. The impact of the COVID 19 crisis on the country, not guaranteed the
availability of secure records by DGICRNC and the socio-political context, negatively influenced
the programming of operational activities.
EFFICE 3: Although all strategies used, they had positive effects on the implementation of
project, those most promising are interoperability, coordination among all actors, the
social mobilization, the empowerment of communities for the appropriation in the use of advanced strategies
internally to communities, and the operation of quality in the registration centers (human resources
available and equipment available). However, although coordination is quite effective and
appropriate at the central level, with the interoperability of multiple factors we have to expand to all
regions and, including in private health centers.
EFICA 4: The main interventions implemented in the scope of UNICEF support contributed to
revitalize the civil registration sector, which for years has been affected by the socio -economic and political context
of the country. Despite the creation of DGICRN, the activities performed under the CCR#7 were included
higher level in the state (review of laws, development of national strategy, subject in the
interministerial meetings and national coordination, among others)
Efficiency
EFIC 1: The main interventions were directed to reduce bottlenecks (analyzed at
coordination), which makes it possible to face the main challenges of the sector. The formations performed
optimized the results of RCC7 and the communication centered on the active involvement of leaders
community (traditional and religious) was an encouragement of the implementation of interventions and represented
an increase in results.
EFIC 2: Thanks to the regular monitoring of activities with DGICRN, the Coordination Technician Group,
allied to activities with the regional authorities, the implementation was optimized to facilitate the obtaining
of resources. However, the decentralized coordination at the regional level was a limiting factor.

Formative evaluation of the main result for children on birth registration (RCE7) in Guinea-Bissau
Final report
EFIC 3: The interoperability between the civil registration and the sanitary registration and the coordination mechanism of
all actors in the registration system is working well but needs to be reinforced (so that
effectively improved). In some of the current health posts that have a registration of
birth there are several constraints, especially those related to the availability of
human resources that may be permanently in hospital services (all mornings) and
Health Centers (3 VX per week). With these reinforcements the two approaches will bring better
Real -time results.
EFIC 4: Financial and human resources, although strongly mobilized, of good quality and according to
with the needs, they remained insufficient to ensure wide geographical coverage in all
the regions of the country. The absence of state financing, in addition to the cost of operation of the services of
health, and the lack of involvement of other technical and financial partners did not allow full coverage
of needs.
Sustainability
DUR 1: The sustainability of project achievements can be ensured by strengthening
competences of civil registration agents to continually ensure registration in a timely
according to national regulations. The availability of the registration procedures manual; the
appropriation of training by the Ministry of Justice; the strengthening of interoperability with the
health; and the stabilization of multisectoral coordination in the existing coordination mechanisms at the
national and in some regions were strategies that certainly guarantee sustainability and appropriation
of the project.
Dur 2: The project developed by UNICEF, as part of the modernization of the civil registration in Guinea-
Bissau, contributed to the sustainability of the universal registration of birth through awareness
in mass, which led to the establishment of mechanisms to resolve and prevent cases of children
registered at the community level, to equip civil registration centers, to establish a synergy between all
interested in the civil registration sector at different levels (national, regional and community). The synergy and
awareness of the importance of civil registration between the authorities and the population certainly guarantee
the appropriation of the birth record.
DUR 3: However, low endowment for civil registration at central and local levels; the capacity of all
Communities to acquire safe records; the low capacity of communities to ensure maintenance
of the equipment (computer equipment, motorcycles) are obstacles to the continuity of
activities. The private sector has been little involved in the program. The low public financing and
place for civil registration is a major challenge for the sector and can limit the sustainability of interventions
and the implementation of the modernization of civil registration in the coming years.
Impact
Impact 1: The birth registration interventions carried out under this program resulted
mainly in positive changes in the level of knowledge and the change of attitudes by the population
as to the search for birth registration. This contributed to an increase in the registration rate of
birth.
Impact 2: Comparative analyzes show that birth registration rates are higher in the area
of the capital, due to the Guinean population focuses on urban areas.
Gender, human rights, equity
EGDH 1: The principle of human rights (children's rights, including access to an identity),
gender and equity was taken into account by the project on its planning and implementation through a
data collection mechanism that offers information about girls and women who benefit

Final report
interventions (birth certificates issued, birth registration fees, number of employees
formed). The activities to promote the registration of births made meet the needs of
the entire population.
EGDH 2: The scope of the national project facilitated the access of vulnerable populations (or
those living in rural and enclaves) to civil registration services, although they locate
if in the city areas of the regions. The involvement of community, religious and traditional leaders, the use
of community radios, the organization of campaigns for the issuance of certificates on market days
and vaccination campaigns, and the equipment of the civil registry offices with motorcycles, facilitated the
Populations access to birth registration.
EGDH 3: The establishment of a monitoring and analysis mechanism at the coordination level
national, with disaggregated data collection ensured that the specific needs of girls and
boys were included.
9. Commendations
The recommendations are presented subdivided as:
Strategic recommendations
• Continue to advocate with the key ministries (finance, budget) to mobilize
resources favorable to the implementation of the national strategy of civil registration and vital statistics.
With the mobilization of the resources necessary for the implementation of the planement activities in the
strategy will favor the union of the decision makers of political support and public funding
sustainable for civil registration - this recommendation will be in charge of the Ministry of Justice, with
a high priority level
• It is necessary to ensure the supply of secure records, for all regions and all partners
of the sector, which may be available in all regions of the country. For this it is necessary to establish a
sustainable mechanism capable of mobilizing funds and providing safe records - this
recommendation should be in charge of the Ministry of Justice, with a high priority level
• The monitoring of the implementation of activities advocated in the national strategy of the civil registration
and vital statistics are extremely important because it allows to ensure quality and propose
changes in timely, when necessary. The reinforcement and consolidation of
monitoring and regional coordination as the basis of the monitoring process, needs to have
continuous training with technical data review meetings and discussion of strategies
used, allied to quarterly supervisory visits, it is necessary to provide the structures of
monitoring with specific forms that contain with details of equity and gender, besides
planning the necessary interventions to ensure a monitoring to be
Anilsada during supervision visits - this recommendation should be in charge of the Ministry
justice with the support of UNICEF, with a high priority level
• Expand and consolidate the mechanism of interoperability with other sectors (justice, statistics,
Education, women and child institute, communication) from the lessons learned extracted
of pilot projects with education, youth and social action- this recommendation
must be executed and managed by the Ministry of Justice with an average priority level
Operational recommendations
• Support in hiring human resources and create technical conditions through sessions of
training with specific manuals and a planned communication system, for the effective
implementation of monitoring at regional level, under the coordination of the Ministry of Justice -
with logistical and technical support by UNICEF and partners with high priority level
