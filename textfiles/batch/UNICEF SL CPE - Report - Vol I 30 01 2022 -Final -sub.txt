Executive Summary
The Country Context
Sri Lanka has a population of 21.8 million with a under 18 years of child population of about 6.2 million. The
Gross Domestic Product per capita is USD 3,852. It has a high human development index with a life expectancy
of 75 years. The ethno-political conflict from about 1983 to 2009 resulted in the death of thousands and
devastation inflicting deeply felt consequences at the human, social, physical, and institutional level.
Despite sound health indicators, nutrition in children under five remains a major public health concern, with
high and persistent rates of undernutrition. Sri Lanka is unlikely to meet the SDG target on wasting. Access to
safe water is almost 85% with about 44% with pipe-borne water supply. There is near universal access to primary
education with gender parity. Learning outcome assessments find that there are large disparities according to
language, subjects and geographic locations. Data on violence against children in Sri Lanka is limited, and there
are no national data. Corporal punishment is widely practiced in schools and accepted by parents. Online child
sexual abuse is a concern. The child protection system has weaknesses. Information on children with disabilities
is very scarce. Social protection schemes in Sri Lanka are fragmented and does not focus on children. Gender
parity in Sri Lanka is high compared with other countries in the region.
The constitutional crisis (2018/19) resulted in Sri Lanka being downgraded to lower middle-income country
(2020); the new governments in 2019 and 2020 did not explicitly give priority to peace and reconciliation. The
Easter Sunday attack of 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions to livelihoods and the economy.
UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Programme
UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Programme for 2018-2022 is aligned with and constitutes UNICEF's contribution to
the UN Sustainable Development Framework and is guided by a theory of change that is based on investing in
the critical windows of early childhood and adolescence to contribute to increased cognitive capital which in turn
will support Sri Lanka’s sustainable development. There are three outcome areas reflecting three lifecycle stages:
Early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence; these are supported by two overarching outcomes in social
policy and programme effectiveness. The current country programme represented a strategic shift from more
emergency and service-delivery-focused implementation logic to a more upstream, policy-influencing and
advocacy-oriented approach.
The vision is to contribute to national efforts to accelerate the realization of child rights for all children in Sri
Lanka, while promoting strategic investments in children and adolescents to enhance Sri Lanka’s cognitive
capital. The Country Programme Document (CPD) identified three programming levels, viz., upstream (national);
midstream (provincial) and downstream (community).
The CPD has been designed with an indicative budget of USD 57,235,000, made up of USD 4,735,000 from
regular resources and USD 52,500,000 from other sources. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the programmes
have been adjusted to accommodate COVID-19 related work.
Purpose and Objectives of the Country Programme Evaluation
The CPE, covering the period 2018-2020, will provide information for the next country programme, assess
performance of results and the adoption of the lifecycle approach for effective delivery. The CPE examined the
Theories of Change and assessed results of a selected number of outputs.
The main participants of the evaluation were stakeholders, who were mapped and identified in consultation with
UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Office (UNICEF SLCO). Altogether 46 (M-22; F-24) and 56 (M-29; F-27) stakeholders
were identified for KIIs and the Perception Survey, respectively.
Methodology: The evaluation was confined to a limited number of outputs, as agreed, and adopted a
participatory and interactive approach; qualitative data were collected from interviews. A perception survey was
undertaken using a group of stakeholders, which provided quantitative data on relevance and effectiveness,
including stakeholder satisfaction of interventions. Forty-nine stakeholders (F-24; M-24) (or 88%) responded to
the survey, Desk review was conducted using reports and other published materials. Based on an Evaluation
Matrix developed, KII Guides were developed for different groups of stakeholders.
v
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all KIIs were conducted online with 51 external stakeholders (M-28; F-23).
Ethical norms and principles were followed during the interviews. This evaluation was guided by the minimum
standards laid down by UNICEF and UNEG. The qualitative information collected was analysed and triangulated
to derive trends and conclusions. Perception Survey data were analysed using SPSS software.
The evaluation team adopted mitigatory actions to overcome the key limitations, which included the short time
period available for the evaluation, meeting restrictions due to COVID-19, potential low response to the
Perception Survey, and limited number of key informants.
Relevance
Programme alignment: In Nutrition and in Child Protection, initiatives align well with national priorities. Sri
Lanka has “pathfinding” status with the Global Partnership to end Violence against Children, and the work
assessed is directly linked with Sri Lanka’s commitment as a pathfinder country and is a priority in GoSL. In
Education, outputs are aligned with the government policy at the time of designing; they also align with the
Peacebuilding Priority Plan of GoSL. The programme interventions are more relevant at the community (school
community) and require more attention towards the society leaders such as political leaders, parents and
caregivers and village leaders. The outputs become relevant only when there is integration in the society. The
Disaster Risk Reduction work is in line with UNICEF's Global Strategic Plan and has been found to complement
GoSL efforts in DRR. The Social Policy and Social Protection work broadly covers GoSL welfare services and
are very relevant especially for the low-income families and their children. Overall, the identified programme
serves the needs of children and young people.
Theory of Change: Analysis of Theories of Change reveal that there is a gap between outputs and very
high-level national outcome indicators. The evaluation notes the UNICEF policy of linking with national
indicators at the outcome level; however, the limited portfolio of work is unlikely to make any changes in national
indicators. These national statistics are more apt for service delivery mode with large funding. Furthermore, most
data for national level indicators are generated by GoSL and are generally not available in a timely manner. Also,
many of the policies, strategies and tools supported by UNICEF SLCO are yet to be fully operationalised; the
expected outcomes are unlikely to be demonstrated in the near future. Nonetheless, the evaluation notes the
relevance at output level; yet the interventions are spread and small and depend on the uptake by the
Government to truly become relevant.
The evaluation notes that the CPD has included some of the key priorities identified in the Situation Analysis of
2017. There have been good stakeholder consultations in the design of CPD.
Positioning of UNICEF SLCO: The evaluation notes UNICEF SLCO's strengths as a respected partner with
GoSL on child protection matters and as the only international agency with expertise in child protection. In
education also, UNICEF SLCO is well positioned within GoSL as having supported in many ways in the past. In
health and nutrition, there are a few UN agencies working on different aspects of nutrition of children and
mothers; the position of UNICEF SLCO is much less prominent. In Social Policy, GoSL considers agencies such
as UNDP, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Labour Organisation as stronger
partners than UNICEF SLCO.
Effectiveness
Reach and delivery of Results: In general, the programme effectiveness has been adversely affected due to
implementation delays caused by the change of Government (2018 and 2019), Easter Sunday attack (2019),
inadequate programme funding, and COVID-19 (2020 -). UNICEF SLCO implemented a variety of containment
measures for COVID-19 pandemic, but normalcy of implementation is yet to return.
In Nutrition, the interventions supported by UNICEF SLCO include formative research on infant and young child
feeding and maternal nutrition practices in Sri Lanka, and introduction of national protocols for management of
severe and acute malnutrition. The advocacy work led GoSL to allocate additional funding for production of
supplementary food for children <5 y and pregnant mothers. The effectiveness of the nutrition component is
hampered due to several reasons including non-implementation of the National Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Action
Plan, non-functional National Nutrition Secretariat, gaps between the Policy and grassroot level actions, and
due to delays in delivery. Engagement with Ministry of Health has been limited, and their technical needs should
reflect the national/local context rather than experiences from other parts of the world. The evaluation did not
vi
find evidence for the notion of the stakeholders that the priority given to nutrition is less than that given for
health, but because this notion was expressed regularly by external stakeholders, this needs further examination.
In Child Protection, UNICEF SLCO led the development of the National Plan of Action to End Violence Against
Children and the Alternative Care Policy. The momentum has since been lost and the platform for VAC is now
inactive. The delivery of the pilot on life skills programme is delayed due to COVID-19, and government
ownership has been limited. Similarly, the parenting skills pilot is very delayed and is currently still at module
finalization stage. Securing government ownership of pilots, towards achieving a scale up should the results be
successful, is not consistent largely due to funding issues of GoSL. The results are unlikely to significantly
contribute to outcome level changes. Whilst interagency coordination has been limited, frequent managerial
changes in GoSL agencies have also caused delays.
In Education, the programme supports an overall school curriculum that promotes social harmony. Whilst some
work on curriculum development is delayed, GoSL has decided that all revisions to the curriculum should be a
part of the ongoing education reforms, which are expected to be piloted partially in 2022. In positive disciplining,
work has progressed, and the package is expected to be rolled out in 2022. The social cohesion work piloted in
selected schools is not properly monitored due to COVID restrictions, and the E-platform is fully implemented
at only a few schools due to funding difficulties. The Music for Social Cohesion is an innovative strategy that
could be upscaled, but there is an uncertainty in upscaling due to funding difficulties by GoSL. The national
study on the issues of ragging and SGBV in Sri Lankan Universities by the University Grants Commission is also
incomplete to assess effectiveness. Inadequate coordination between the education and child protection
sections at UNICEF SLCO in delivering outputs on school violence is also seen by both GoSL and UNICEF SLCO
staff as an issue. Pre-COVID-19 implementation delays coupled with post-COVID closure of schools and
lockdowns have affected delivery. A proper assessment is not possible as the outputs need a coordinated effort
of all deliverables to achieve the outcomes. The National Action Plan on Education for Peace and Reconciliation
has not been implemented by Ministry of Education due to school closure since March 2020.
The Child-Centred DRR programme has been piloted in several districts prone to disasters together with district
child protection officials with a reach of about 3,500 children via the Children's Clubs. UNICEF SLCO has also
taken the lead to reinvigourate the school safety guidelines originally drafted in 2016, and the Ministry of
Education (MoE) has taken steps to formalise these guidelines within the school curriculum. Work relating to
the safety of children in transition (from school to home) is appreciated by the GoSL partners.
In Social Policy, the UNICEF SLCO-advocated National Monitoring Committee for monitoring child rights (CRC)
is dormant since 2019. It is also supporting the Department of Census and Statistics to introduce the
Multidimensional Poverty Index linking with SDG as a tool for measuring child poverty, and this work is ongoing.
UNICEF SLCO has supported citizen friendly budget consultation processes, which has been implemented in the
Eastern Province, and work on budget allocations for child sensitive initiatives. It has also provided an analysis
of the national budget to assess inclusion of vulnerable groups.
UNICEF SLCO, together with UNICEF ROSA technically and financially supported improving the national
evaluation capacity, which included developing a curriculum for a postgraduate diploma in evaluation at the
University of Sri Jayewardenepura which has been offered to about 100 GoSL and NGO staff, and training about
60 Young and Emerging Evaluators in short-term courses. However, the effectiveness of the initiatives has not
been assessed. The National Evaluation Bill, the development of which has been supported by UNICEF SLCO is
pending the approval within GoSL.
Despite providing advocacy on budget allocations, work on influencing increased budget allocation for children
has not borne fruition, and the situation is exacerbated by the economic melt-down due to COVID-19. The
concept of the Citizen's Budget, facilitated by UNICEF SLCO, has been embraced by the Eastern Provincial
Council, and the Northern Provincial Council will follow suit. On Social Policy, the engagement with the
Government agencies has been few and sporadic; stakeholders are of the view that a more concerted
engagement is needed to influence GoSL policy. The CRC/NMC became inactive since its last meeting in 2018
due to lack of political willingness and absence of a lead Ministry for coordination of its affairs.
Sustainability: It is premature to assess sustainability for initiatives that are still being rolled out; nonetheless,
in Nutrition, since the initiatives supported by UNICEF SLCO are already in the programmes of MoH, they are
likely to be continued, subject to availability of funds. In Child Protection, the outlook for sustainability of the
vii
national partnership on VAC is currently limited due to challenges in engaging government stakeholders. Some
early lessons show linkages to line ministries which have to be activated to develop a more streamlined system.
In Education, there is a likelihood of interventions being scaled up once the changes in the Government
agencies are stabilised. A worrisome situation is the reduction of funding for the Peace and Reconciliation Unit
of the Ministry of Education, which has not received GoSL funds for activities. In Social Policy, UNICEF SLCO
initiatives, some of which are also supported by other UN agencies, are embedded in the work programmes of
the relevant GoSL agencies and are likely to be continued with the support of donors.
Overall, GoSL commitments to sustainability and adoption of some of the measures advocated by UNICEF SLCO
that require increased investments by the Government are dependent on improving the economic situation in
the country. Nonetheless, some policy/strategy initiatives can be sustained with minimal investments.
Timeliness of Delivery: One of the main challenges faced by UNICEF SLCO is timely delivery of the programme.
There have been delays in implementing 2018-19 workplans due to delivery delays by both GoSL partners and
UNICEF SLCO; COVID-19 exacerbated the situation relating to 2020 workplans from about March, 2020. Overall,
most work in education and child protection have been delayed and are unlikely to be streamlined this year.
Monitoring and Reporting: Review of the Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation Plans for the three years
show that some data gathering activities were postponed from 2020 to 2021, but for the large part most have
been concluded or initiated, few seem to be dropped. The annual reporting differs somewhat from year to year
due to changes in organization-wide reporting formats (RAM). The evaluation notes that reporting structures
are complicated, and staff find reporting at outcome level challenging.
Country Office Architecture: UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Office is organised by thematic sections, with Zonal
Offices in the Northern and Eastern Provinces and an outpost office in Uva/Central Province. In the current cycle,
the lifecycle approach is used which is not in sync with office structure. Staff indicate that there too many
meetings; yet external stakeholders find inadequate internal coordination.
In the previous programme cycle, the UNICEF SLCO adopted a service delivery approach, and the staff capacity
and competence were adequate for that purpose. With upstream policy dialogue and advocacy, a different set
of skills for advocacy is needed in some thematic areas,
The Zonal Offices function as UNICEF SLCO representative offices and have developed very close rapport with
the relevant provincial administration. This arrangement facilitates identification of provincial needs, and to
provide a feed-back. Overall, Zonal Offices and the outpost office are recognised as very useful.
Funding: The evaluation notes inadequate funding as a major reason affecting programme effectiveness.
The Country Programme is premised on the availability of USD 57 million made up of USD 4.7 million from Core
Resources (RR) and USD 52.5 million from other resources (OR - donors). It is seen that UNICEF SLCO received
only about 22% of the originally envisaged budget or about 33% of the prorated budget (for 3 years). There is
a significant shortfall in funding as only 18% of the expected external funds (RR) have been realised as at Dec,
2020. As of October, 2021, USD 25,770,000 (or 45% of the original budget) has been received and a part of this
has been 're-phased' for 2022.
Knowledge products and Outreach: The evaluation noted the need for rigourous quality assurance of
knowledge products, especially publications, to meet the accepted standards to UNICEF. In regard to outreach,
some senior GoSL partners were unaware of UNICEF SLCO's programme or the focus areas in the current cycle.
Similarly, some partners were unaware of the results of work done – as a result, there was a show of disinterest
in the overall outcome indicators by the partners.
Partnerships: The evaluation noted that some of the Civil Society Organisations (CSO) engaged have long-
standing partnerships with UNICEF SLCO and have added value to UNICEF SLCO's work and provided valuable
feed-back on the programme. Some GoSL and NGO stakeholders expressed reservations on the choice of CSOs
as some of them lacked in-house capacity. Information sharing is an important element in the partnerships; 81%
were 'satisfied' with the way UNICEF SLCO is sharing information.
Engagement with the private sector is in a nascent stage and has moved slowly. Since 2018, USD 129,000 have
been collected, largely for COVID-19 response. Private sector engagement guidelines are being prepared. It is
evident that private sector can be attracted by offering custom-made programmatic packages to align with the
core business of the company. Although some staff are not convinced on engaging with the private sector due
viii
to potential reputational risks, there is a case for UNICEF SLCO to work with businesses to achieve results for
children.
The perceptions of the stakeholders on general effectiveness in a number of areas show an overall rating of
moderately satisfactory/satisfactory; however, about 20% show unsatisfactory rating for quality of work and
timeliness of delivery.
Programme assumption: The CPD is premised on a number of assumptions. However, some of important
assumptions (e.g. changes in social services and budgeting, data management by GoSL, support for UN
agencies) remain unaddressed.
Coherence
Much of the work is still in progress. The indications are that the current portfolio of work, when completed, is
likely to show coherence with national programmes as they fit well and complement GoSL initiatives, albeit with
limited effect. In regard to UN joint programming, the evaluation notes implementation has been very
compartmentalised in participating UN agencies and have been treated as distinct sub-project components by
them. The spirit of joint programming has not been demonstrated due to a number of challenges. Some of
these have been recognised, and the UN Country Office, which leads joint programming has taken steps to
improve the situation.
Equity and Gender: The evaluation notes that the application of United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy
and the UNICEF's Gender Action Plan across the programmes is uneven, largely due to funding constraints.
There are gender aspects in nutrition that could be addressed. In social cohesion and bullying in schools, there
is no specific reference to gender inequality; the University study on ragging does consider gender inequality. It
would appear that a 'gender lens' has not been consistently used in project implementation and reporting, partly
due to the limited understanding of gender equality aspects by the implementing partners.
Although UNICEF SLCO has acknowledged the need for focusing on mainstreaming gender and disability in all
outcomes, disability remains almost invisible in planning documents. Disaggregated data to show inequities and
gender differences are not very evident in the portfolio. About 20% of the stakeholders rated UNICEF SLCO's
work unsatisfactory in a number of gender-related areas.
Lifecycle Approach
Lifecycle approach was introduced to UNICEF SLCO during the current programme cycle. There is broad
agreement that the theory behind this approach, a child-centred/holistic way of delivering results, makes much
sense and is desirable. However, excepting health and nutrition, there is little support by UNICEF SLCO staff for
continuing the lifecycle approach in the next country programme. In health and nutrition, there is better
congruence with GoSL structures. The negative effects of implementation such as long and too many meetings,
lack of staff time, loss of specificity, need to use sector-based indicators, misalignment with GoSL structures, and
internal management difficulties are felt very strongly, while the positive outcomes are minimal. Any value added
is limited to very few instances.
Both the lifecycle meetings as well as the various working groups appear to mostly involve staff in Colombo
though they include at least one field-based staff. The “Matrix Management”, creating linkages and reporting
structures that reflect that one person’s work impacts other sectors, is still in its early phase.
Lessons learnt
The positive and negative lessons summarised below are from the analysis of evidence gathered during the CPE
and will be useful when developing the next programme cycle.
• The Outcome indicators, which use national indicators as a policy of UNICEF, are not realistic will not be
useful to show results from the CP. Further, in most cases the required data are not available. Investments
on supporting national fora and policies have not brought the desired results to fulfil indicators.
• Due to funding constraints, the programme appears over-ambitious and generate wrong signals to others.
• The CC-DRR work has been embraced by the provincial authorities due to effective transfer of knowledge
and experiences and replicability.
ix
• The disability and gender aspects are not mainstreamed adequately in programme planning, and the
understanding of these concepts by implementing CSOs is limited, providing a lesson for the next cycle.
• The UN Joint Programming assessed during the CPE does not demonstrate that the agencies have
understood the spirit of UN Joint Programming. The joint programmes have worked in isolation without
much coordination.
• Some of the implementing CSO partners who have had long-standing engagement with UNICEF SLCO have
added value to the programme; these lessons are useful for strategically selecting CSOs. There is also
potential for engaging new partners to bring new perspectives.
Recommendations
Programme Strategy and Design
1. The new programme should be based on clearly identified priorities and should be based on the
availability of funding. A package of actions may provide outcomes at local level. If full upstream
portfolio is adopted, suitable indicators to measure policy and advocacy rather than child
wellbeing should be used
2. In regard to equity and gender equality, UNICEF SLCO should focus on disaggregated data collection in
programmatic work, and support cyber space issues (gender), and addressing issues of children in special
situations (equity).
3. The Theories of Change in the new Programme Cycle should clearly articulate the convergence of
interventions to higher level results. The outcomes and outputs should be measurable with available data..
4. In the new programme, more attention to nutrition is needed. The nutrition regimes should be customised
to localities. CRC work should be the responsibility of Child Protection Section, Protection work on education
requires collaboration between Education and Child Protection sections. Several programmatic areas are
identified for consideration in the next cycle.
Programme Delivery
5. In the new programme cycle, discontinue the lifecycle approach in its current form and introduce other
methods to increase internal collaboration.
6. In the new programme cycle, reprofile/reskill the staff competences for upstream policy dialogue and
advocacy to enable high-level engagement with GoSL.
7. The Zonal Offices (Kilinochchi and Batticaloa) and the Outpost Office (Uva) should continue, but their scope
of work and staffing should be revisited once the new programme priorities and funding are determined in
the new cycle.
8. In partnerships, review the selection criteria for identifying CSO partners; jointly review the delivery of
previous UN Joint Programmes to introduce new mechanisms to improve delivery, and ensure regular
dialogue with GoSL partners particularly on policy matters. work.
9. Ensure that reporting in the Annual Reports and RAM is consistent and help in tracking progress; develop
tools to track progress on indicators and for early detection of delays; and assess the outcomes of building
the national evaluation capacity.
Sharing of Results and Knowledge
10. UNICEF SLCO should strive to periodically inform its implementing partners, including GoSL partners on the
country programme content and results.

1. Introduction
In accordance with the UNICEF Evaluation Policy, it is necessary to conduct a Country
Programme Evaluation (CPE) at least once every two programme cycles or once in a
programme cycle if monitoring and audit information points to a significant shift in the
programming context or a significant increase in the level of risk. The previous CPE for Sri
Lanka was for the 2002-2006 cycle.
This CPE commenced in September, 2021
1.1. UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Programme
UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Programme for 2018-2022 is aligned with and constitutes UNICEF's
contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Framework (UNSDF), 2018-2022. The UNSDF
brings together 13 UN agencies working in Sri Lanka, and reflects global, national, provincial
and UN priorities, including the SDGs.
The country programme for 2018-2022 is guided by a theory of change that is based on
investing in the critical windows of early childhood and1 adolescence to contribute to increased
cognitive capital which in turn will support Sri Lanka’s sustainable development. ‘Cognitive
capital’ represents the complete set of intellectual, socio-emotional and executive function
skills that allow for creativity, flexibility and ability to work collaboratively2.
Overall there is a primary orientation towards creating change for children of different age
groups rather than creating change by sectoral area. The Country Programme has three
outcome areas reflecting three lifecycle stages: Early childhood (0-5 years), middle childhood
(5-9 years), and adolescence (10-18 years). This ‘lifecycle approach’ is thought to promote
convergence across sectors and create a more child-oriented perspective. Under each
outcome, key sectoral contributions are merged towards creating a change in the lives of
children. To support these three outcomes, two complementary and overarching outcomes
were developed: Social policy and child rights monitoring; and Programme effectiveness
(ensuring that the country programme is efficiently implemented, monitored, and supported
to achieve results).
In addition to the new lifecycle orientation, the current country programme represented a
strategic shift from more emergency and service-delivery-focused implementation logic to a
more upstream approach with focus on advocacy and influencing policy, aligning with
UNICEF’s programming approaches in middle-income countries. In line with the UNICEF
Strategic Plan 2018-2022, the following intervention strategies were to be given priority across
all programming areas: Strengthening systems to improve service delivery particularly to the
most disadvantaged; leveraging resources for children; and supporting children and
adolescents as agents of change.
Three different levels of programming were envisaged: (1) upstream - national; (2) midstream
- sub-national (provincial and district) and (3) downstream - community (parents, caregivers,
immediate service providers, children and adolescents themselves)3. Interventions were to be

guided by a 'vision' of change as well as evidence generated from piloting, to advocate for
and inform the generation of strengthened policies, standards and guidelines; as well as
support the implementation of these measures “to benefit the most disadvantaged children,
parents and their communities”. Support to the roll out of national plans, policies and
legislation was considered “instrumental in strengthening child-friendly, gender-responsive and
quality service delivery at the subnational level”. The programme was to “demonstrate
affordable, integrated and innovative solutions to tackle inequalities (including gender
inequalities) at the provincial and district level, while national policy and budget advocacy will
ensure replication and sustainability”. To support social and economic policy development and
legal reforms, UNICEFs role would be critical in provision of high-quality technical assistance,
generating evidence on the situation of children and adolescents, and strengthening linkages
to global knowledge and best practices.
The CPD, whilst focusing on national efforts to upstream policy and advocacy, was expected
to continue its mid-stream and down-stream work in the four Provinces, Northern, Eastern,
Uva, and Central Provinces (see Fig. 2.1).
In early childhood, the country programme aimed to reduce neonatal mortality and
morbidity, address undernutrition, increase access to quality early learning and development
services, improve child protection services to identify, record and refer child abuse cases, and
support efforts to create national action on early identification of disabilities and intervention
services. Key strategies to achieve this included (i) support systems strengthening to improve
quality of neonatal care, including interventions such as promoting mainstreaming of the Early
Childhood Care and Development Programme, using the 1000 day approach to good nutrition,
“tackling malnutrition”, and family and community support; (ii) contribute to strengthening of
the CP system to prevent and respond to child abuse, neglect and violence through
interventions such as modeling of CP mechanisms, building capacity of actors, improving
functions and resources of the CP system in target districts, mitigating the unnecessary
institutionalization of young children; and (iii) support government authorities at national and
subnational levels to provide early learning and school readiness services, through
interventions such as strengthening capacity of parents, caregivers and preschool teachers;
identifying gaps in preschool curricula according to global standards and develop and pilot
new materials including for children with disabilities in targeted districts, and advocacy for
increase in public investments in early childhood development.
In middle childhood, the programme aimed at “ensuring that children, especially the most
deprived, benefit from healthy, nurturing, protective environments and live free from violence”.
Key strategic priorities include (i) increasing skilled human resources in school, strengthening
institutional care settings and increasing the capacity to address WASH, nutrition and health
issues towards improved quality of services – backed by guidance and technical advisory
support; (ii) support holistic and child-centred learning in primary schools, through working
with stakeholders to develop and apply policies, strategies and budgets that are equity-
focused and grounded in evidence; (iii) accelerate national action to address violence against
children, through interventions such as the establishment of a national coalition to generate
awareness, building resilience among children for prevention, and improving skills and
knowledge of parents and community members and generating demand for services.
In adolescence, the programme aimed at “ensuring that adolescents, especially the most
deprived, use high-quality basic social services in a safe, supportive and protective
2
environment and will be active agents of behavioral and social change”. Priority strategies
included (i) leveraging investments for adolescent-sensitive services and psychological
counseling in public health facilities, reproductive health and hygiene education in schools,
non-formal education and vocational training, and life skills education; (ii) support revision of
national legislative and policy frameworks, advocate for increased investment in the justice
system for timely quality services for children, and work with stakeholders to improve equitable
access to justice for children; and (iii) strengthen efforts to integrate peacebuilding and social
cohesion in schools through technical support for a new curriculum and support innovative
extracurricular platforms.
In Social Policy, the country programme aimed at “developing policies that address the
structural causes of inequities” to “advance the realization and create awareness of adolescent
and children’s rights”. Key strategies include (i) contribute to development of a national child
rights monitoring system operating across sectoral ministries at national and subnational
levels, establishing an independent monitoring and accountability system, and monitoring
multi-dimensional child poverty; (ii): building govt capacity to design, implement and monitor
cash transfer schemes to cover all children, and (iii) bolstering strategic partnerships with civil
society and academia for evidence generation and policy advice to improve evidence and
systems for equity-sensitive planning, budgeting and evaluating.
The purpose of the outcome area in programme effectiveness, is to ensure that the CP is
effectively designed, monitored, managed and evaluated and includes cross sectoral support
to several areas such as emergency preparedness and response, DRR, advocacy and
communication, and promoting engagement with local government and civil society
organizations.
The CPD provides a broad and exhaustive list of partners for each outcome area; without
specific information regarding contributions or roles.
The Sri Lanka country programme was designed with an indicative budget of USD 57,235,000,
made up of USD 4,735,000 from regular resources4 and USD 52,500,000 from other sources.
According to the UNICEF global website, for the organization as a whole OR amounted to
about two and half times RR in 2020 (USD 1.43 billion RR and USD 3.46 billion OR). In
comparison, the Sri Lanka CPD relied on sourcing other resources more than tenfold the
expected regular core resources.
The Programme Strategy Notes that contain the 'visions' of change for each of the five
outcomes above have been adjusted in 2020 following the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. While
outcomes were not changed, a new output was added under each of the four programming
outcomes to reflect interventions and results related to COVID-19. There were also
adjustments to reflect the constrained funding situation experienced since the start of the
country programme.
4 UNICEF terminology: RR (Core Resources for Results – Regular Resources) refer to funding that is received by
the organization without restrictions such as country or sector, from which country offices receive a certain
proportion each year. OR (Other Resources Regular) refer to contributions from donors that are earmarked
for specific purposes.

Stakeholders of the Country Programme
As a first step for inception of the evaluation, the Team undertook a stakeholder mapping in
consultation with UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Office. Two groups of stakeholders were identified,
viz., (a) internal, and (b) external. The internal stakeholders were further categorised into three
sub-groups, namely, UNICEF regional staff, UNICEF SL Country Office (Colombo) staff, and
UNICEF Sri Lanka Zonal Office staff. These stakeholders are closely involved with the
Programme. A summary is presented in Fig. 1.1.

1.2. Purpose and Objectives of the CPE
The purpose of the CPE is as follows:
• To inform programme design and support managerial decision-taking at country office
level in preparation of the next country programme.
• To foster organizational learning about what works and what has not worked,
especially in areas where the country programme components have not achieved the
4
results and how the lifecycle approach has impacted the effectiveness of delivering
results.
• To support accountability by providing an independent assessment of how selected
results were achieved (or not) and the factors that contributed to the achievement or
lack of, as UNICEF has an accountability to design and implement programmes at a
standard of excellence.
The objectives of the CPE are as follows:
(a) Provide an independent assessment of the relevance of the country programme,
focusing on specific predetermined programmatic areas - to local needs and context;
(b) Provide an independent assessment of results achieved - focusing on specific
programmatic areas - and explanatory factors for their achievement (effectiveness).
(c) Provide an independent assessment of the internal and external coherence of the
programmatic focus areas and whether UNICEF is well positioned to play a strategic
role to advance the (UNICEF and National) goals in the country.
(d) Provide an assessment of the life cycle approach as an effective tool for implementing
the country programme.
1.3. Main end users and use of the evaluation
The primary users for this evaluation will be UNICEF, with the Sri Lanka Country Programme
using the information for design of its next programme cycle, and UNICEF ROSA for
programme direction and oversight; the secondary users are Government counterparts
(Ministries and other agencies) who receive direct benefit from the programme; UN Agencies,
in particular those who have interest in joint programming; implementing CSOs; and donors.
The findings of the evaluation will be used by UNICEF SLCO to improve performance of the
programme, seek funding for implementing priority areas of work which could not be
addressed due to paucity of funds, and assist the development of the next programme cycle.
The GoSL and CSO/UN partners will be able to use this evaluation to review their partnership
strategies with UNICEF SLCO in order to improve performance and complement actions on
thematic areas where priority attention is needed.
1.4. Scope of the Evaluation
The scope of the evaluation is briefly outlined below:
(a) Geographical and chronological scope: The focus of the evaluation was for the
period 2018 to December, 20205. Information outside this period was sought only insofar
as to illuminate issues in the current programme. The evaluation was national with
particular focus on programme implementation provinces, namely Northern, Eastern,
Central and Uva Provinces.
(b) Theory of Change: The Results Framework (Annex 1.1) has been constructed on
three outcome areas, namely early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence. Each
of the outcomes is fulfilled through a portfolio of Results/activities. The outcome indicators
have been established for 2022 with annual progress indicators with a scoring system for
tracking progress. The Results Framework shows the relationship between outputs and

outcomes. The Results Framework and the Theory of Change of the Country Programme
were explored, with a more analytical examination of the Theories of Change for the
outcome areas ('Visions' of Change) that have been identified for the evaluation (see Table
3.1) for changes that have been adopted/implemented;
(c) Results Level: The CPE did not assess the full results framework, but evaluation design
focused on the outputs presented in Table 1.1.

Based on discussions with UNICEF ROSA, the evaluation examined other outputs under
Outcome 4, to the extent information is available. The Terms of Reference of the evaluation
is at Annex 1.2.
(d) Participants: As one of the important objectives of the evaluation is to seek
information for the next programme cycle, the main participants of the evaluation were
external stakeholders. In this connection, the evaluation team undertook a stakeholder
mapping exercise (cf. Section 1.6).
1.5. Approach
The evaluation adopted a participatory and interactive approach. Qualitative methods/
techniques in terms of their relevance to the characteristics or performance of the programme
were used to collect data/information. Qualitative data were selected from specific sources of
information including primary and secondary information related to the Country Programme.
The evaluation adopted the principles of gender equality, inclusion and non-discrimination
and followed the concept of SDG 'leave-no-one-behind (LNOB)'. The evaluation also ensured
that participants were provided an opportunity to voice their views openly. The evaluation
team accorded acknowledgment and respect for differences in culture and customs, religious
beliefs including avoiding prayer times for discussions, gender roles, age, and ethnicity.
A perception survey was undertaken using a group of stakeholders, which provided
quantitative data on relevance and effectiveness, including stakeholder satisfaction of
interventions.
6
The data collection methods and tools were customized to obtain answers to the evaluation
questions stipulated in the Terms of Reference under the given criteria (Effectiveness,
Relevance, Coherence, and the Life Cycle approach). Data collection was conducted in an
independent and objective manner and followed a participatory and ethically accepted
approach.
As the Country Programme is in the middle of the current cycle, the evaluation examined the
processes and progress towards achieving outputs and outcomes.
1.6. Evaluation Methodology and Tools
The evaluation used a mixed methods approach, which allowed triangulation of data from
different sources. The Evaluation Design Matrix (Annex 1.3) summarises and links the
evaluation criteria, key questions and sub-questions, indicators and sources of
information/data. The proposed methods are briefly described below:
Identification of Stakeholders for the Evaluation
UNICEF SLCO programme has used a rights-based approach during its design and
implementation6. Accordingly, it has identified the rights holders and their entitlements and
corresponding duty bearers and their obligations; furthermore, the programme has strived to
enhance the awareness of rights holders and the capacities of the duty bearers to discharge
their responsibilities.
The stakeholder mapping exercise (cf. Fig. 1.1) identified institutions in the central and
provincial administrations that are essential duty bearers for the realization of children’s rights
in the thematic areas of focus for the evaluation. Relevant UN and civil society organizations
working in the same thematic areas were included as key stakeholders, both at the central and
provincial levels. Their role from a human rights-based approach is in between; of providing
support to the duty bearer as well as foster awareness and demand among rights holders. In
coordination with UNICEF SLCO, it was determined during the inception phase that it would
not be possible to include rights holders in the evaluation. While this was considered a
significant drawback, it was necessitated by the very tight time schedule the evaluation was
facing, requiring tentative findings at a very early stage in order to feed into and coincide with
critical SLCO planning steps of the new country programme. For the same reasons, the duty
bearers are at the institutional level – the evaluation did not include parents, health staff or
teachers who do play a role as duty bearers for some of the focus areas of the evaluation (e.g.
child nutrition, violence against children). Annex 1.4 provides an analysis on rights-holders
and duty bearers7.
After several rounds of discussions, stakeholders for interviews as well as for the Perception
Survey (see later in this Section) were identified by UNICEF SLCO. Whilst the Country Office
was conscious of having a gender balance in selecting the stakeholders, it was constrained by
rigidly applying it as the stakeholders identified were based on their position in the
organisation. Table 1.2 presents a summary of stakeholders identified for the two
aforementioned purposes.
6 See: <https://sites.unicef.org/policyanalysis/rights/>
7 Disaggregated data on rights holders in terms of gender, age and disability were not available.
7
The participation of stakeholders in the evaluation was voluntary; they were informed of the
evaluation by the Representative of UNICEF SLCO and was followed up by the Team Leader to
make appointments for interviews. The choice of language for the interview was left to the
interviewee.
The methodology for evaluation was presented to the Country Management Team8 on 18
August 2021. This was also an opportunity to further discuss stakeholder identification and
their engagement with the evaluation given the ongoing SitAn to avoid duplication of
interviews. The Inception Report was presented to the Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) on 6
September 2021, which has been set up to advise the evaluation team9. During this meeting,
the methodology and the processes were discussed and agreed upon.
The main findings of the evaluation were presented to the Senior Management of UNICEF
SLCO in one-to-one meetings in December, 2021.

Examination of the Results Framework
The evaluation used the Results Framework for assessing performance. As indicated elsewhere,
the evaluation was confined to selected outputs (cf. Table 3.1); in each of the outputs, the
progress was assessed through reference to Reports (mainly RAM but where available special
reports) and their relevance, effectiveness and coherence were assessed through interviews
and the Perception Survey. An analysis of the component Theories of Change ('Visions' of
change as presented in PSN notes) were also undertaken simultaneously. No attempt was
made to revise the Theories of Change as it was not required in the ToR.
8 The Country Management Team (CMT) consisted of the UNICEF SLCO Representative, Deputy Representative,
Heads of Divisions including Communications, PME, Statistics & Monitoring Specialist, and representatives of
the UNICEF ROSA Evaluation Group.
9 The ERG was comprised of the Representative (Mr Christian Skoog) and the Deputy Representative (Ms Emma
Brigham), Statistics & Monitoring Specialist (Dr Sajith de Mel) of UNICEF SLCO, UNDP SL Representative (Mr
Robert Juhkam), Dr Vinya Ariyaratne (Sri Lanka), Representative of the World Food Programme (Mr Andrea
Berardo, Deputy Representative, WFPSL), and UNICEF ROSA staff (Dr Jim Ackers, Ms Amanda Bissex, Dr Zivai
Murira, Dr Dharshini Seneviratne, Dr Esther Kaggwa and Ms Barsha Pradan)

Desk Review
The review of existing secondary sources and data had a dual function for the evaluation:
(a). Internal performance monitoring documents such as annual reports and RAM
Outcome and Output ratings/descriptions were reviewed and analyzed to assess
performance against the targets in the CP results framework (Annex 1.5). Additional
external sources were also identified and used where possible, to shed further light on
the status of various indicators. This review also included an analysis of the theory of
change for each focus area, as presented in the PSN notes. This desk review was a key
component of the evaluation question on effectiveness (to what extent targets were
achieved and documented and whether they contributed to change for children) and
was further elaborated and triangulated by the interviews and perception survey.
(b). Studies, evaluations and other research or evidence were reviewed in each thematic
focus area and applied throughout the evaluation where relevant, particularly for
evaluation questions related to relevance (whether programmes were adequate or
appropriate to respond to needs). A list of documents was provided by SLCO; to which
the evaluation team added further evidence.
A full list of Key documents consulted, and other bibliography are in Annex 1.6.
Key Informant Interviews and tools
Semi-structured interviews and small group meetings were conducted with those identified in
Annex 1.7. For this purpose, interview guides were developed by the evaluation team and
reviewed by UNICEF ROSA (Annex 1.8). As the evaluation progressed, additional informants
were identified, in consultation with UNICEF, depending on the need for additional information
and evidence. Fifty-one stakeholders, made up of 23 females and 28 males participated in the
KIIs.
Due to other exigencies with work, four informants10 identified by UNICEF SLCO could not be
interviewed, in spite of repeated attempts by both UNICEF SLCO and the Team Leader.
Due to the prevailing lock-down and travel restrictions imposed by the Government of Sri
Lanka, all KIIs were conducted online.
Perception Survey
An online Perception Survey (PS) was carried out from 1 to 20 September, 2021 with
stakeholders identified in the mapping exercise (Annex 1.9). The PS solicited views of the
stakeholders on relevance, effectiveness, operational aspects, communications and sharing
knowledge, and stakeholder satisfaction on UNICEF SLCO programming and implementation
(the questionnaire developed for the Perception Survey is in Annex 1.10). Of the 56
stakeholders identified, 49 (or 88%), comprised of 24 females and 25 males responded to the
Perception Survey. The report of the Perception Survey is in Annex 1.11.
Data Management
The reliability of the quality of data/information collected was ensured by using well-designed
Interview Guides to capture the required information and that same or similar responses would
have been gathered if administered under similar conditions.
10 Two officials from GoSL and two staff members from UN Agencies.
9
The evaluation collected both qualitative and quantitative data. Descriptive qualitative data
collected from KIIs were analysed and triangulated to derive trends and conclusions.
Information was cross checked with sources other than the original source to seek verifications.
This analysis was also used to identify any limitations experienced by the Programme during
implementation stage.
The data gathered in the Perception Survey was analysed using statistical software SPSS. The
descriptive statistics were separately reported and supplemented data and information from
desk research and KIIs.
Key actions in the Evaluation
The key actions taken for the Country Programme Evaluation are outlined below:
• Initial discussion with UNICEF ROSA to develop a common understanding of the Terms
of Reference of the CPE, and to agree on the scope of the evaluation and limitations
(several rounds of discussions starting on 20 July 2021 through August, 2021);
• Stakeholder mapping in consultation with UNICEF ROSA and UNICEF SLCO (mid-
August, 2021);
• Development of Interview Guides and Perception Survey Questionnaire for review and
approval by UNICEF ROSA (September, 2021).
• Presentation of the methodology to the Country Management Team (CMT) (18 August,
2021)
• Presentation of the inception process to the Evaluation Reference Group (6 September,
2021);
• Submission of the final Inception Report (24 September, 2021);
Ethical standards
Ethical norms and principles were followed during the interviews. The evaluation team took
measures to maintain a free and an independent evaluation process upholding evaluation
ethics, in order to maintain the integrity and honesty. The evaluation followed the ethical
guidelines of UNICEF11 and UNEG12 during the evaluation.
Integrity was maintained by respecting the involved stakeholders and adopting standard
ethical principles and professional standards during the evaluation. Additionally, the
evaluation team ensured that there was no conflict of interest. Accountability was ensured by
the team's background experience in ethics, quality assurance at different stages of the
evaluation, and proper data and information management. The evaluation did not engage
children; therefore ethical clearance was not deemed necessary. The evaluation team consisted
of two males and two females with both national and international experience thereby
ensuring diversity and representation. The consultations during the evaluation were carried
out in an impartial and an objective manner based on the guides prepared for the purpose; all
stakeholders were clearly informed of the purpose of the evaluation, and their responses were
voluntary. No audio recordings of conversations were made. The team ensured that the

information collected both through interviews and by the online questionnaire survey was kept
confidential and not disclosed to third parties.
The evaluation adopted an approach to ensure that its results would benefit all stakeholders
by having a clear purpose and using a systematic assessment process. Do no harm principle
was always considered. Carbon neutrality was maintained by avoiding travel, somewhat
necessitated by COVID-19 restrictions and by adopting online/remote interviews.

2. Country Context
Sri Lanka is an island located in the Indian Ocean with a population of 21.8 million13 with child
population of about 6.2 million. The Gross Domestic Product per capita is USD 3,85214. Sri
Lanka is also in the high human development category, positioned at 72 out of 189 countries,
and is the highest in South Asia15. Yet, about a quarter of the population lives just above the
official poverty line and is extremely vulnerable to economic shocks.
Sri Lanka experienced a serious
ethno-political conflict from
about 1983 to 2009 between
government forces and
separatists in the North and
the East, resulting in the death
of thousands and devastation
inflicting deeply felt
consequences at the human,
social, physical, and
institutional level. There are
lingering issues with post-
traumatic stress disorders
within the affected
communities. The situation
was exacerbated by youth-led
sporadic violence in the South
and in some other parts of Sri
Lanka.
Sri Lanka is well poised for
successful implementation and
achievement of the SDGs
based on her performance
under the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs),
Fig. 2.1 – Map of Sri Lanka with Provinces where UNICEF works especially with regard to
health, education, and poverty.
Sri Lanka's performance
towards becoming a resilient society, including the high coverage of safe water supply and
sanitation facilities, near universal electrification, education achievements, and increasing the
share of population living in permanent houses is impressive. The principles of sustainable
development are reflected in Sri Lanka's development plans such as the Public Investment
Programme (2017-2020)16, which provides inter-linked and mutually supportive goals for the

implementation of social protection schemes for all necessary segments in the country and
the climate resilient 'Blue Green Budget' of 2018.
As in other parts of South Asia, Sri Lanka has been experiencing extreme climate events in the
recent times. There are extremes of excess and scarcity of water, causing widespread damage
to agriculture, including, livestock. Extreme rainfall has been frequently observed in certain
districts (e.g., Badulla, Kandy, Matale, Nuwara Eliya, Kegalle and Ratnapura) causing landslides
and severe flash floods.
Social indicators
Sri Lanka has a long tradition of strong investment in education, health and poverty alleviation,
and as a result achieved many of its MDG targets ahead of time. Life expectancy is high, at 77
years (2021).
Maternal and childhood mortality rates are among the lowest in the region, due in large part
to a widely distributed hospital network. The rates are reducing at a slow pace, estimated at
about 30% over the past 15 years17. Most of deaths among children under five in Sri Lanka
occur within the first month of life: The neonatal mortality rate is 7 out of 1000 live births, while
under five mortality is 11 out of 1000 live births18. There are significant geographic differences;
districts with the highest mortality are Kilinochchi (44 out of 1000) and Trincomalee (26 out of
1000), in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, respectively.
Despite sound health indicators in Sri Lanka, nutrition in children under five remains a major
public health concern, with high and persistent rates of undernutrition. Among children under
five, 15% suffer from wasting (low weight-for-height), an indicator of acute malnutrition19.
Acute weight loss is considered as ‘very high’ as per the WHO benchmarks and is widespread
across the country. Currently, Sri Lanka ranks number 2 in the South Asia Region and placed
number 7 among countries with the highest prevalence of wasting. In spite of relatively
favourable indicators on breastfeeding practices in Sri Lanka, two out of five children aged 6-
23 months do not consume a minimal acceptable diet in terms of both food diversity and meal
frequency20. Fig. 2.2 shows that wasting has not improved over the last three decades in spite
of heavy investments by GoSL and donors. The available statistics show that there are
geographical variations in wasting, with Monaragala district showing 25.4%, Hambantota
(21.8%) and Mullaitivu (21.6%). Thus, Sri Lanka is not on track to meet the SDG target on
wasting to maintain the prevalence of wasting below 5% by 202521.
The prevalence of stunting (low height-for-age) among children under five years is 17.3% and
is much higher in economically backward more disadvantaged populations such as the
plantations sector (e.g. in Nuwara Eliya and Kandy, stunting is 32.3% and 26.0%, respectively)22.
These are notable as child stunting is mostly an irreversible outcome of inadequate nutrition,
particularly in the first 1,000 days of a child’s life cycle.

Stunting Wasting Severe Wasting Overweight
Low birth weight (LBW < 2500 g) affects one in six new-borns (15.7%), already placing them
at a disadvantage for optimum growth including physical and cognitive development. Low
birth weight is an indicator of a multifaceted public health problem that includes long-term
maternal malnutrition, ill-health and poor health and nutrition care in pregnancy. The statistics
also show that while 9.1% of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) have low Body Mass
Index (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), 45.3 percent are overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/m2). Maternal
anaemia, particularly during pregnancy, contributes to negative birth outcomes, such as low
birth weight. The prevalence of anaemia (Hb<11 g/dL) among pregnant women is 31.8%23.
Access to safe water is almost 85% with about 44% with pipe-borne water supply. Another
40% have access to hand pump tube wells or protected wells. About 15% of the population is
unable to access a safe water source within 200 meters of their residence24. Water resources
are heavily impacted by the effects of climate change.
There is near universal access to primary education with gender parity, though national data
mask significant disparities in access, quality and management at all levels of education.
Learning outcome assessments find that there are large disparities according to language,
subjects and geographic locations. Lower levels of achievement in lower grades often correlate
with poverty and other child rights deprivations and are most prevalent in the estate sector,
Northern and Eastern region. There is a mismatch between education, labour market needs
and the aspirations of adolescents, with a critical gap in transversal skills. Enrolment in
preschools is about 56% (it varies significantly across districts), and consistent quality
standards are lacking25.
There is very limited data on violence against children in Sri Lanka, though reporting is
increasing: Government services registered about 12,000 cases in 2015, compared with 2000
cases in 2014. A 2018 study found that physical violence was the most common form (45%),

followed by emotional violence (28%) and sexual abuse (9%)26. The most common perpetrators
were families and teachers, except for sexual abuse where neighbours were more common.
Corporal punishment is widely practiced in schools and accepted by parents and is not yet
unlawful in most settings. Except for some small studies, there is a lack of data on this form of
violence. A recent regional UNICEF study on online violence identified online child sexual
abuse to be a concern in Sri Lanka. There are also reports of bullying being taken online. Almost
half (47%) of the children surveyed had been victims of at least one form of physical or
psychological bullying at school27. The child protection system lacks the framework, capacity
and resources to prevent and respond to abuse, neglect and exploitation.
Information on children with disabilities is very scarce: the Programme Strategy Notes state
that they do not seem to have adequate access to mainstream education, health and
rehabilitation services and that there is a lack of early identification and interventions across
the country.
Social protection schemes in Sri Lanka are fragmented, with multiple schemes managed by
different governmental agencies and ministries, at both national and provincial levels. Among
the social assistance programmes, the largest is Samurdhi, however this programme is not
effectively addressing the needs of children in terms of catalytic support to reduce child
poverty. While targeting the poorest, targeting errors exclude a high proportion of the
intended recipients, one study estimates that up to 6 out of 10 households who qualify in
reality end up excluded.28 For those four households that receive the Samurdhi, the transfer
value is low.
The most recent Concluding Observations of the CRC Committee highlighted five areas of
concern in Sri Lanka: Violence; sexual exploitation and abuse; economic exploitation;
administration of juvenile justice; and reconciliation, truth, and justice.
Some of the key national policies relevant to this evaluation are noted below:
• Policy Statement of the Government - 2015
• National Policy Framework -Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour-2019
• National Child Protection Policy 2019
• National Child Protection Authority Act- No.50
• National Policy and a Comprehensive Framework of Actions on Education for Social
Cohesion and Peace (Curriculum development; teacher training; co-curricular
activities)
• Sri Lanka Peacebuilding Priority Plan
• Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation
• National Nutrition Policy of Sri Lanka and subsequent Government Circulars
• Samurdhi Act and the subsequent revisions
• Sri Lanka Sustainable Development Indicators
In addition, major educational reforms are currently ongoing, which has a bearing on some
aspects of the evaluation.

Equity and Gender
The Constitution of Sri Lanka specifically prohibits sex-based discrimination and ensures
everyone’s equality before the law29. The Women’s Charter adopted by GoSL (1993)
guarantees equality and equal protection of the law for women. There are other numerous
policy documents relating to prevention of violence against women.
Although women have gained the right to vote and political participation, representation of
women in the national parliament has never exceeded 6% and has been even lower in the local
councils. The unemployment rates of women are twice as compared with men at all age levels,
and there is a large number of women in unpaid family labour30. Sexual and gender-based
violence against women and girls often go unreported due to social and cultural norms and
fear of reprisals. Despite amendments to the Penal Code31 and the Prevention of Domestic
Violence Act,32 the incidence of rape, sexual abuse and domestic violence continues to be high.
With achievements particularly in health and education, gender parity in Sri Lanka is high
compared with other countries in the region. In 2019 the country ranked 90 out of 162 on the
gender inequality index.
The adoption of the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) in the aftermath of the armed
conflict was a landmark for new gender dimensions and to recognize the women's contribution
to the peace process33. Also, the country has ratified international instruments such as
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)34. The
Policy Framework and the National Plan of Action on SGBV 2016-202035 upholds human rights
and gender equity and equality and adopt a three-pronged approach of prevention of SGBV,
intervention in situations of SGBV, and advocate for enforcement of related policies and laws.
The National Policy on Disability for Sri Lanka (2003) relates to the provisions in the
Constitution of Sri Lanka and the to the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and
has identified 26 policy areas.
Important contextual changes during the current programme cycle
(a) Changes in the Government
The Presidential elections held on 16 November 2019 saw the election of a new President. The
policies of the new President are reflected the election manifesto of the President36. The new
policy does not explicitly mention peace and reconciliation, and transitional justice as key
areas. Following the Presidential elections, Parliamentary elections were held on 5 August 2020
following which a new Government came into power. These changes resulted in changing key

portfolios of the Ministries and the Boards of Management of statutory Boards and
Corporations. These changes affected implementation of UNICEF SLCO programmes.
The new government later decided to withdraw the commitment under UN Human Rights
Council’s resolution 30/1 to promote reconciliation and accountability, which the previous
government had co-sponsored. Some of the peace building administrative structures
established by the previous Government (e.g. Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation
Mechanisms; Office for National Unity and Reconciliation) were either disbanded or became
non-functional.
(b) Economic outlook
Sri Lanka was elevated from low income to lower middle-income category in 1997. The
economic growth since then helped Sri Lanka to become an upper middle-income country in
2019. However, within one year, the World Bank downgraded Sri Lanka from upper middle
income to lower middle-income category (2020)37 due to the uncertainty created in the
economic system in the first half of 2019 emanating from the constitutional crisis of October-
December 2018, and the Easter Sunday attack in April, 2019 and the resultant religious
disturbances which impacted on growth. The Easter Sunday attack caused economic
downturn, particularly by greatly reduced tourist income.
(c) COVID-19 pandemic
The Sri Lankan authorities reacted quickly to the emergence of COVID-19 by setting in place
travel bans, lockdowns (initially a strict curfew) and workplace closure by March 2019. While
there was a gradual return to normalcy by around May, subsequent pandemic waves caused
restrictions to be reimposed regionally or nationally. The most recent national lockdown was
lifted 1 October, 2021. The economy contracted by 3.6 per cent in 2020, which is the worst
performance on record – in the second quarter alone it contracted by as much as 16 per cent38.
The COVID-19 containment measures are likely to have had a severe impact on livelihoods, as
more than 66% of the labour force work is in the informal economy. During the pandemic,
UNICEF SLCO partnered with UNDP to implement a telephone survey to monitor how families
were affected by the crisis, providing insights into income fluctuation, nutrition, food security
and access to basic services39. Five rounds were completed, each reaching a nationally
representative sample of about 2,000 households. The first three rounds, in May-July 2020,
found that the initial lockdown period had had a profound negative impact on income (almost
half of the respondents in round three were also part of round one and two): In April, 39 per
cent reported a complete halt in income, and 32% experienced a reduction in income. By June,
18% were still not earning income, while 45% reported reduced income. About one in eight
(12%) had lost their job by June, and one out of three had had to borrow to make ends meet.
Rounds four and five were held in October-December 2020 and July-August 2021 and gave
insights into the longer-term impact of COVID-19 on households. Forty per cent reported
losing their job at some point due to COVID-19, and 80 per cent of these had become
employed again. However, 68 per cent of households reported reduced income in July/August

2021, compared to 32% in April 2020. At the same time as such a high proportion saw their
incomes drop, 82 per cent reported an increase in the cost of living. In 2021, almost half of the
households had pawned belongings, compared to 21% in April 2020.
To mitigate the economic impact on households, the Government implemented several
livelihood support programmes. Some assistance programmes were channeled through
existing welfare schemes such as Samurdhi, as a temporary allowance during April and May
across all districts in the country, at a cost of about USD 240 million40. Despite these and other
efforts, the World Bank estimates an increase in the USD 3.2 poverty line from 9.2 per cent in
2019 to 11.7 per cent in 2020, and notes that the poorest experienced the largest earning
shocks. Prior to COVID-19, the poverty rate had reduced from 16.2% in 2012/1341.
The COVID-19 pandemic affected health and nutrition service delivery. The UNICEF/UNDP
telephone survey showed that by early May 2020, 30 per cent of families had reduced their
food consumption. One year later, in August 2021, food consumption was reduced in 43% of
households. In the May 2020 survey, more than half (51%) postponed and 15% were unable
to access to pre- and postnatal care. An alarming 45% of children with moderate or severe
malnutrition did not receive nutrition services. In earlier planning documents, inequitable
access to key preventive and curative health and nutrition services was noted as a key concern;
this was further compounded by COVID-19 containment measures. By August 2021, access to
healthcare appeared much improved; 89% reported being able to consult a doctor or
accessing prenatal/antenatal/postnatal care. Less than one in ten (8%) of those needing access
to health service, reported that they could not access it. COVID-related travel restrictions was
the primary reason, followed by delays in receiving service due to COVID42.
The government response to the COVID-19 pandemic caused schools to be closed across the
country, affecting over 5.5 million students. Initially the closure lasted from March to August
2020, but due to increases in COVID-19 cases all schools in the country were closed again43.
In the ensuing one and a half years, the Ministry of Education has offered web-based learning.
UNICEF SLCO supported hardcopy learning packages for children in Grades 1 and 2 to
complement the web-based option in mostly hard to reach geographic locations (covering
328,000 students). The education system made a fairly swift change to adapt to the situation;
however the impact of remote schooling on enrolment and learning outcomes is not yet
known.
Following the curfew imposed due to COVID-19, there was a dramatic rise in the proportion
of violence against children cases reported to the 1929 child helpline44. In the three weeks
from 16 March to 7 April, 2020, the proportion of such cases among all child protection
complaints rose from 10 to 40 per cent (121 out of 292 cases). The national hotline on domestic
violence recorded 463 cases in March and April 2020 compared to 123 cases in February and
March 202045. Some areas of government child protection work were taken online, including
digital case management.

3. Findings of the Evaluation
3.1 Introduction
The Country Programme Evaluation (CPE) is aimed at understanding the current situation on
the Country Programme's progress and strategic alignment vis-a-vis the Theory of Change
and the Results Framework. The evaluation will also inform the CO on the design of the next
programme cycle, and also on key organisational learnings and aspects that are needed to
support the delivery of the CP.
The findings are categorised into four sections based on the evaluation criteria, as follows:
(a) Relevance of the Country Programme;
(b) Effectiveness of the Country Programme;
(c) Coherence of the Country Programme implementation; and
(d) Adoption of the Life Cycle Approach to deliver the programme.
The key areas of inquiry against evaluation criteria are summarised below:
• Extent to which the programme addressed the needs of children
• Programme's adaptation to COVID-19 and other changes
Relevance
• Critical interventions that have been missed
• UNICEF SLCO's comparative strengths and advantages
• Reach the most disadvantaged
• Programme delivery and its contributions to outcomes
• Major factors contributing to achievement/non-achievement of
Effectiveness outcomes
• Unintended outcomes
• Sustainability of the programme
• Timeliness of delivery
• How do the interventions fit within the national framework
Coherence • Equity and gender equality
• Partnerships with others
• Extent to which LCA has been implemented
• Adequacy or otherwise of LCA towards achieving outcomes
Life Cycle Approach

3.2 Relevance of the Country Programme
The analysis of relevance relies on information available in the national policies and
strategies, UNICEF SLCO Situation Analysis of 2017 (SitAn, 2017), the Country Programme
Document, and information from Key Informant Interviews.
(a) Programme components
In Nutrition, early child (0-5 y) undernutrition remains a major concern in Sri Lanka followed
by high prevalence of undernutrition in pregnant women which contributes to
intergenerational undernutrition in children. The National Nutrition Policy of 201047, identifies
optimum nutrition for children under 5 years and pregnant mothers as a key priority area of
the government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) (Policy Statement 5.1). In line with this policy, UNICEF
SLCO's current country programme (CP) proposed to address maternal and child
undernutrition through strengthening the capacity to deliver nutrition services focusing
primarily on interventions to prevent stunting, wasting and other forms of malnutrition in
children under two years, upgrading/scaling up district nutrition monitoring and surveillance
system, and advocating the government for increased public financing for quality care to
pregnant mothers and children during the first 1000 days. The available data (cf. Section 2.1)
show that, in spite of concerted efforts, stunting and wasting do not show substantial
improvement, and more concerted work is needed. These interventions therefore directly
address GoSL priorities, as well as SDGs.
The UNSDF48 identifies the need for a strong focus on improving the nutritional status of
children and women of childbearing age (under Driver 3: Human security and socio-economic
resilience) and relates to Indicator 4.2.1.
Child Protection: While there is little data on violence against children, the issue is
recognized as a priority by the Government. As noted in the 2017 SitAn, there has not been
any recent national survey that could provide an estimate of prevalence, and the only data
available are from administrative sources – widely considered to under-represent the true
extent of the issue. In 2016, Sri Lanka became among the first countries to seek “pathfinding”
status with the newly established Global Partnership to end Violence against Children. The key
criteria for becoming a pathfinder country are a formal, public commitment to comprehensive
action to end violence against children. The pathfinder status commits the country to
accelerated action to achieve SDG 16.2. Following such status, governments are to develop a
multi-stakeholder group, collect and analyze data on violence against children, and develop
an evidence-based national action plan. Output 2.2 is directly linked with Sri Lanka’s
commitment as a pathfinder country; as one of the key interventions is to support the
establishment of this national multi-stakeholder group.
Output 2.2 also relates directly to the relevant GoSL policies49. Although there are some gaps
in legal instruments, the legal coverage regarding violence against children is considered
47 National Nutrition Policy of Sri Lanka (2010) Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition (GoSL)
48 UNSDF (2018-2022) for Sri Lanka
49 There are a number of relevant policies and action plans such as the National Child Protection Policy (2013); the
National Child protection Act-No.50 of 1998; National Action plan for Children 2016-2020; National Policy on
Early Childhood Care and Development etc.

good, with implementation being the main challenge50. For example, corporal punishment in
schools is prohibited, however it is practiced and widely accepted by parents. The Government
of Sri Lanka has repeatedly expressed its commitment to prohibiting corporal punishment of
children in all settings (including at home, in alternative care settings, day care, penal
institutions), most recently during the Universal Periodic Review in 2017. Taking into account
the above, Output 2.2. is highly relevant to the national agenda on ending violence.
Furthermore, the output is in line with the UNSDF 2018-2022, perhaps particularly Driver 1 on
evidence-based policy. As noted above, the output is also directly linked with SDG 16, as one
of the SDG targets (16.2) is to end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence
against and torture of children. The Global Partnership and Fund to End Violence Against
Children was formed in 2016 to spearhead achievements under 16.2, by creating a platform
for members to connect to raise awareness, catalyze leadership commitments, mobilize new
resources, and promote evidence-based solutions.
Education: Since the cessation of civil conflict in 2009, successive governments adopted
approaches addressing reconciliation and rehabilitation. The Lessons Learned and
Reconciliation Commission of the then Government of Sri Lanka (LLRC)51 identified education
as a key area for attention to bring about peace and reconciliation. The Government at the
time of the development of the current UNICEF SLCO Programme Cycle identified education
in a more focused manner as explicitly stated in its peacebuilding strategies. The
Peacebuilding Priority Plan agreed between the United Nations and the Government of Sri
Lanka identifies "support a review of the education system to ensure it is conducive to promoting
reconciliation and cohesion" as a strategic priority under Focus Area # 3; the output identified
is "education system, including governance, policies and curricula, strengthened to promote
reconciliation and social cohesion". The underlying rationale is that the education sector can
play a critical role in fostering a culture of peace starting from childhood for the first time to a
generation of children growing outside the shadow of conflict52. The output 3.3 directly
addresses the national need for peace and reconciliation. Furthermore, this output is in
synergy with the policy framework of the Ministry of Education53.
With the change of Government in 2019, there is a new policy framework in place54. The priority
accorded to peace building is not explicit in this policy framework, which is perhaps reflected
in the attention paid to integrating social cohesion within the realm of education and the
allocation of funds for that purpose. In spite of this drawback, social cohesion remains a priority
in the current educational reforms process55.
It is recognised that reconciliation and peace building perspectives require the engagement
of different levels of the society, viz., political leadership, society leaders from different
ethnicities, religious faiths, academia, local leaders, CSOs, and the community. The programme
interventions are more focused at the community (school community) and to a lesser degree

at the society leaders. The interventions of reaching school children, parents and the school
community are strategically effective as they reach a larger population; however, the desired
change depends on the interface with other layers of the society, in particular the political
leadership. The outputs become relevant only when there is integration in the society.
The output also relates to the Convention of the Rights of the Child and falls within the aegis
of the UNESCO framework of Global Citizenship. Articles 28 and 29 states that children's needs
relating to a rights-based strategy for social cohesion. Building the personalities of children
through co-curricular activities introduced through this component is relevant in the context
of peace building.
The output is in line with the Driver 3 of the UNSDF56. Overall, the output is of high relevance
in the operating context in the country.
Disaster Risk Reduction: Following the Tsunami of December 2004 in Sri Lanka and the
experiences gained from conflict-related displacement of children, Save the Children in Sri
Lanka highlighted the need for children friendly and children-sensitive DRR and facilitating
children's participation in promoting DRR57.
UNICEF's Global Strategic Plan shows that DRR efforts can be improved by increasing attention
to climate change impacts and focusing on the vulnerabilities and needs of different age
groups. Furthermore, children are able to make changes in the attitudes of elders and have
been thought as a vehicle to disseminate information on DRR to their parents. Following a
study commissioned by UNICEF SLCO58, the Child-Centred DRR has been introduced to the
current programme cycle as a priority. It is a flexible rights-based approach combining child-
focused (for children) and child-led (by children) activities, geared towards bringing about
change in their community, and amongst local and national duty bearers.
Disaster Risk Reduction is a priority in UNSDF (Driver 4) where assistance to the Government
has been identified for building capacity for disaster risk reduction and resilience, climate
change adaptation and sustainable management and conservation of natural resources.
The output is also in line with the recommendations of the South Asian (SAARC) Child-centred
DRR Framework59, and also aligns with the provisions in the Sri Lanka Disaster Management
Act No.13 of 2005.
UNICEF SLCO supported the development of the National Action Plan for CC-DRR, which has
been endorsed by GoSL and it is a part of the national development plan.
In Social Policy and Social Protection, it is to be noted that GoSL's social policies and social
protection priorities have long embraced pro-poor interventions. In the National Policy Framework,
Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour60, GoSL promotes policies on productive citizenry and a vibrant
human resource together with a people-centric economic development, including inter alia,
childcare, elderly care, and women's affairs. Similarly, the Public Investment Programme (2017-

2020)61 includes implementing specific social protection schemes for all deserving segments of the
society to improve their living conditions and empowering them to contribute to the development
of the country.
The Poverty Headcount rate reduced from about 37% in 2002 to 11% in 2016. The projected
rate for 2019 is 9.1%62. Despite these trends, , the World Bank noted that inequality in some
segments such as children, disadvantaged women, elders and disabled remains a major issue,
in spite of implementing nearly 35 poverty reduction welfare programmes63. The government
has focused attention on these groups targeting at inclusive growth. It is reported that
although 11% of the households are below the poverty line, only16% of the households in the
country have received Samurdhi cash transfers64; there are number of reasons for this anomaly,
but an important shortcoming is on data and registry of beneficiaries. The situation is
exacerbated by COVID-19 pandemic where an additional 500,000 people have been added to the
poverty headcount, which is projected to be 11% in 202065.
With regard to child poverty, GoSL strives to address the underlying issues of malnutrition
among children, poor quality of early childhood development and education, violence and
abuse against children, and health, nutrition and education of vulnerable children by adopting
strategies which include policy advocacy process to mobilize adequate resources.
The social protection interventions supported and implemented by UNICEF SLCO broadly
cover areas such as social assistance and welfare services, technical support and capacity
development for cash transfer programmes to address child poverty and generating evidence
of child poverty and vulnerability including multidimensional data collection, data base
management and maintenance of social and beneficiary registries. Thus, the social protection
interventions supported and implemented by UNICEF SLCO under the current program cycle
are very relevant and productive especially for the low-income families and their children.
UNICEF SLCO’s social protection approach66 is based on social protection objectives of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).
The social protection interventions are targeted to ensure that the national and sub-national
governments and the civil society strive to advance and monitor child rights for most deprived
children as a priority need.
Overall assessment: The interventions introduced are relevant to each life cycle stage and
complement GoSL policies and strategies to serve the needs of the children and adolescents.
As indicated in the preceding sections, the interventions are also in line with SDG goals, in
particular # 1 (Poverty), # 2 (hunger), # 3 (health and well-being, # 4 (education), # 5 (gender
equality, # 6 (clean water and sanitation), # 13 (climate action), # 16 (peace), and # 17
(partnerships).
The programme also addresses, subject to limitations of resources, the needs of children and
adolescents in the different life cycle stages, which is the core business of UNICEF.

(b) An analysis of the Theories of Change
The Country Programme is guided by a Theory of Change based on investing in the critical
windows of early childhood and adolescence to contribute to increased cognitive capital
which in turn will support Sri Lanka’s sustainable development.
The Programme Strategy Notes of UNICEF SLCO provide 'visions of change' in each outcome
area. The following narrative provides an analysis of 'Visions of Change'.
Early Childhood
The initiatives are targeted to provide benefits to children <5 years from access to quality
healthcare and nutrition, protection and development opportunities in their home, care and
preschool environments, with the following outcome indicators:
• Percentage of children under five who are stunted
• Neonatal Mortality Rate
• Number of children (0-5 years) living in residential care
Brief observations on this ToC are given below:
• The stated outcome is of high order and is an ambitious one, and the indicators are
national indicators. This outcome results from a multitude of initiatives from different
players including GoSL in the arena of health, nutrition and education. The evaluation
acknowledges the UNICEF policy of using national indicators; yet the UNICEF SLCO
initiatives are inadequate to contribute to significant changes to the outcome
indicators.
• Additionally, there are difficulties with measuring Indicators. For example, national data
for stunting is available only for 2016. MoH has data on stunting for the following years,
but there is a discrepancy in the data.
• Some baselines are not indicated in the Results Matrix. The baseline for children in
residential care is given for '0-18 years'.
The progress reports do not report on outcome indicators as they are 'not available'.
This is indicative of the difficulties in using national data.
Given the progress stated in RAM 2020, it is unlikely that the outcome Indicators will be
achieved (already rated constrained in the Report). The reality of achieving the outcome
indicators by implementing the suite of actions also need to be carefully analysed; the
evaluation is of the view that the CP actions in Early Childhood are unlikely to make a
significant impact on the indicators.
Despite having achieved many of the targets associated with the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) Sri Lanka did not attain the nutrition target by 2015. Sri Lanka's stunting and
wasting are both off-course67.
The situation is exacerbated by limited funding available for the CP. Additionally, achievement
of indicators is also conditional on GoSL contributions towards programme implementation.

European Union
25
As noted in the revised PSN, a major risk is GoSL economic situation which has come to
realisation; in the circumstances, GoSL is unlikely to fulfil its commitments relating to the
realisation of outputs.
Of the outputs, adopting WHO standards for SAM protocols has been achieved; it would
appear that the target might have been too modest, as it was achieved already in 2019. Since
there is a year and a half left of the CP, the CO could revise the target and aim beyond mere
existence to use of the protocols (or evidence of the protocols making a difference in actual
treatment).
The potential for the largely upstream UNICEF investments in nutrition to significantly
influence the stunting prevalence during the course of the CP seems limited. In very concrete
terms, there is no direct link from government-approved protocols and the outreach strategy
to changes in stunting68. Neither of the outputs aspire for actual use or implementation of the
protocols or strategy, not even on a local scale. In the results framework, there are no
demonstrable strong links with partners doing more downstream work to reduce
undernutrition, which could have boosted the effect (use) of new standards and protocols. As
seen above, measurement of the national stunting prevalence for the 2022 end line might be
a challenge. Considering the progress in extending access to treatment in the Northern and
Eastern provinces, one option might be to measure changes in nutrition indicators in these
geographic areas only (though perhaps wasting more than stunting, as the time period may
not be long enough to pick up changes in stunting).
Middle childhood
The changes expected are that young girls and boys would realise their rights to protection
from violence to good health, and to appropriate cognitive and physical development. The
indicators are as follows:
• Percentage of children (5-9 y) who are stunted
• Percentage of children (5-9 y69) who have experienced violent disciplinary practices by
an adult member of the household during the last month
• Percentage of students who obtained 70 and above marks in Grade 5 exam
The main observations are as follows:
• The indicators are of high order, and the initiatives implemented by UNICEF SLCO are
spread rather thinly to contribute to this outcome.
• As with Outcome # 1, the Reports do not provide indicator progress due to paucity of
national data.
There is no baseline for the outcome indicator on VAC by a household member, and an
end line KAP as planned will have minimal information value vis-à-vis the country
programme. Using administrative data as a proxy (with obvious limitations, including that of
increased/decreased reporting blurring the real incidence rate) could be an alternative, though
there does not seem to be any such administrative data at the national level combining the
different departments’ reporting systems – or no significant progress on that up until 2020, as
68 UNICEF SLCO has an ongoing formative research programme which will be followed up with an evidence-based
BCC strategy.
69 The age group in the CPD is 5-14, while in the PSN it is 5-9 years.
26
seen from the analysis. That the limited piloting of parenting and life skills programmes will
influence the national incidence rate of VAC in the household in 5 years is perhaps optimistic
and creates a need for national data in an area that is generally poor in terms of data
availability. This would mean that baseline/end line surveys are necessary, despite UNICEF
SLCO’s investment being on a very limited scale and perhaps not warranting national surveys
to track effect of input. Such surveys, if undertaken, would in reality be more useful for situation
monitoring than CPD monitoring, and ideally not be implemented by UNICEF SLCO on its own
as a monitoring tool, but in partnership with others and more as an end in itself (engaging
different government departments, agreeing on shared definitions and testing indicators, and
so on towards better data collection on VAC in administrative reporting systems).
It is possible that there could be a local reduction in VAC in the geographic areas where UNICEF
SLCO is piloting the life skills and/or parenting programmes, and at least for the PATHS pilot,
there appears to be pre-intervention data collected.
The direct relevance of the last indicator (Percentage of students who obtained 70 and above
marks in Grade 5 exam) to this outcome appear to be an outlier as interventions are limited to
a very specific geographic area. Furthermore, performance at the Grade 5 examination is
perhaps not the ideal as the predictive validity of the scholarship examination has come under
scrutiny, given its large focus on rote learning and memorisation70.
Adolescence
This Outcome seeks to provide a more equity-focused and gender-responsive approach to
integrated adolescent development and participation of all adolescents in Sri Lanka, including
the most deprived. As in previous analyses, the indicators are high order, and the influence of
UNICEF SLCO are unlikely to make a substantial change on the indicators, as given below:
• Teenage pregnancy rate by age
• Average time taken for legal trial related to children cases reduced to 1 year
• Net enrolment rates in secondary education for children (15-16 years)
The main observations are as follows:
➢ On legal trials, whilst there has been success in reviewing some 17,000 plus files to ascertain
whether there are indictable offences, there has been no progress afterwards to make any
headway on indicator # 2.
➢ The focus on education has been for social cohesion, but the indicator embraces a
much broader perspective. There is also a mismatch in reporting; for example, the
Annual Report for 202071 highlights the education component as "the nurturing of
concern for people and community – civic values – in young people is integral to
achieving social cohesion, or the sense of connectedness, among the different groups in
our society".
Social Policy
70 Please see for a fuller analysis: Abayasekara, Ashani (2019) Sri Lanka’s Grade Five Scholarship Examination: An
Evaluation of its Effectiveness and Relevance: Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka
71 UNICEF Sri Lanka Annual Report 2020.
27
The expectation is that the interventions will support strengthening policies and systems so
that children, particularly the most marginalized children and adolescents, progressively
benefit from effective, equitable and inclusive social services and social protection system. The
indicators used are given below:
• Per capita social spending on basic services (education and health)
• Number of children covered by social-protection systems
The measurement of this outcome is also affected by paucity of data, and lack of clarity on the
indicator specifications. Outcome indicators are not reported (the baseline given is 2015, prior
to the current programme cycle). At the output level, there are variances in indicators. For
example, the output indicator in the Country Programme Document, public spending on social
protection from domestic resources as a proportion of national budget is changed in reporting
to: public spending on health and education because social protection programme
expenditures are not publicly reported on a regular basis by GoSL. To add to the confusion, it
has to be noted that the social protection sector in Sri Lanka is not clearly defined and the
ownership is devolved. In the absence of data, UNICEF SLCO has reported on health and
education expenditure.
Similarly on the output indicator, social protection systems/programmes include emergency
prevention, preparedness and response, the baseline lists this as 'partly achieved' (the
Government uses the Samurdhi program for cash transfers in case of emergencies). In 2019
the CO reported that this was completed. Discussions were ongoing on the use of social
protection systems to respond to shocks, but the main focus had been on an overall reform of
the social protection system.
Focus on Policy and Strategy formulation
The current programme cycle focusses on policy and strategy formulation (or upstream work).
In the Sri Lankan context, where policy implementation is the prerogative of GoSL, it is difficult
to relate outcomes to policy changes during a given timescale. This would affect achievement
of indicators, both at Outcome level as well as Output level.
Table 3.2 summarises some of key policies and strategies facilitated by UNICEF SLCO in the
current programme cycle.

In conclusion, it is evident that there is a gap between outputs and very high-level outcome
variables, all at national level. As would be seen from Table 3.2, many of the policies and tools
are yet to be fully operationalised; the expected outcomes are unlikely to be demonstrated in
the near future. A more meaningful indicators would be perhaps district/local level, given the
limited programme implementation. It has to be noted that achievement of national outcome
indicators would require substantial effort from GoSL, which has not been demonstrated in
the current cycle due to a variety of reasons.
Nonetheless, the evaluation notes the relevance at output level; yet the interventions are
spread and small and depend on the uptake by the Government to truly become relevant.

frameworks in social expenditure
As shown in Table 3.5, UNICEF SLCO has been able to include only some of the needs identified
in SitAn due to funding constraints. However, external stakeholders were unclear on the
prioritization process between SitAn and actual programme design based on funding etc. This
lack of clarity was also evident to a certain degree amongst the internal staff who felt that the
availability of external donor funds influenced the prioritization process73.
(d) Stakeholder engagement in identifying the country needs:
UNICEF SLCO actively engaged with the main Ministries (MoE, MoH, MoF & MoWCA) and their
agencies, both at the national and at the provincial levels to develop the programme74. In
addition, there has been consultation with the academia, I/NGOs, think-tanks and children. In
nutrition, the dialogue with the Ministry of Education to obtain their views relating to nutrition
of children is inadequate. The MSAPN would have been an ideal forum to reinforce
programmatic areas identified by UNICEF SLCO. In Child Protection, the programme has been
developed through extensive dialogue with stakeholders at both provincial and national levels.
There are no indications of lacking collaboration in the planning phase. In the sphere of
Disaster Risk Reduction, CC-DRR package is a result of collaboration between DPCCS, MoE,
DMC and the provincial DRR agencies.

Steering Committee (Source: KII with GoSL staff)
30
In Education, the national level engagements were aimed at more policy-oriented actions
such as supporting curriculum reinforcement for life competencies and citizen education,
enhancing the capacity of teachers to use new modules on social cohesion and peace
education etc. These have been followed up with extensive dialogue with provincial education
authorities to identify the actions to be implemented in selected educational zones.
Engagement with Provincial Staff: Whilst there have been extensive dialogues with
authorities from the provinces where UNICEF SLCO works, the approach to identify the
provincial needs and priorities have to be based on provincial priorities which have been
developed using well-thought-out criteria such as ethnicity, poverty etc. UNICEF SLCO's
provincial planning therefore needs to start at matching the needs at Provincial level first,
rather than the current approach of identifying district needs. UNICEF SLCO should be able to
match the Provincial needs with its own priorities so that the societal balances of development
work envisaged by the Provincial Council will not be disturbed.
• 67% of the respondents opined that the current UNICEF SLCO
programme has taken into consideration both national and provincial
priorities.
• 57% thought that the current UNICEF SLCO programme is based on
results and learnings from the previous programme.
Perception Survey
The majority of the informants corroborated the findings of the Perception Survey presented
in the box above.
(e) Programme adaptation to external shocks
Adaptation of UNICEF SLCO programme to external shocks during the current programme
cycle is discussed under three categories, as follows:
• Extreme climatic events
• Easter Sunday attack (21 April, 2019)
• COVID-19 pandemic (since March, 2020)
Extreme climatic events
UNICEF SLCO is a key member of the Humanitarian Country Team of the UN Resident
Coordinator to coordinate delivery of humanitarian assistance on protection, education,
WASH, food security, and nutrition in the aftermath of disasters. Accordingly, UNICEF SLCO
pre-positioned itself by providing to DMC the immediate disaster preparatory needs such as
water pumps, water purification equipment, emergency shelter materials, and nutrition
supplements for immediate distribution in the aftermath of floods and cyclones.
Aside from launching the CC-DRR programmes as a part of the current programme cycle,
UNICEF SLCO supported DMC by providing relief to disaster-affected families and children
during cyclone Burevi (2021 in the Northern Province) and monsoon floods in 2020 and 2021.
It also supported the DMC and the Disaster Preparedness and Response Division of the
Ministry of Health an online training on the management of safety centres for southwest
monsoon (2021) amidst COVID-19, bringing in strong child protection in emergencies
guidance for the first time in camp management training in Sri Lanka. Additionally, UNICEF
31
SLCO coordinated with the partner agencies to develop a handbook for safety centre
managers.
The technical and material assistance provided are relevant and appreciated by the
stakeholders.
Easter Sunday attack (April, 2019)
The Easter Sunday attack on 21 April, 2019 left 270 people dead and about 500 injured. UNICEF
SLCO reported 46 children dead and 25 injured. Several children were left with only one parent.
This attack caused serious setbacks to the peace and reconciliation efforts that were being
implemented in the country. In particular, UNICEF SLCO's joint programme on peacebuilding
suffered due to implementation delays, and some of the gains from social cohesion work were
adversely affected. In the immediate aftermath of bombing, UNICEF SLCO responded as
follows:
• The hospitals in the epicentres of the attacks (Negombo, Colombo, and Batticaloa) had
a huge influx of patients. UNICEF SLCO provided urgent equipment required to
manage critical patients;
• Procuring special medical equipment and essential materials to treat injured children;
• Supporting programmes to provide mental health and psychosocial support;
• Supporting the MoWCA to coordinate data collection to ensure that children and
adolescents are prioritized in this response; and
• Supporting the DPCCS to find alternative care facilities for children separated from
parents and to reunite the families75;
Whilst implementation of the normal programme activities suffered a setback, particularly in
the Eastern Province, UNICEF SLCO responded by adapting the relevant components of the
Peacebuilding Project to target about 20,000 school communities, principally children, with
awareness programmes on peaceful co-existence, tolerance, and long-term peace76.
UNICEF SLCO was able to source additional funds, mainly from Japan, to cover costs related
to these measures. UNICEF SLCO efforts are both relevant and timely and are appreciated by
the stakeholders.
COVID-19 pandemic (since March, 2020)
When the COVID-19 attained pandemic status in Sri Lanka in February/March, 2020, the
government response was swift: Schools were closed across the country and a very strict
curfew was imposed. Up until October 2021, there have been repeated lockdowns due to
surges in COVID-19 cases, with schools for the most part remaining closed. Immediate
concerns included the impact of the lockdowns on livelihood, as about 70% of the labour force
work in the informal economy77; access to education for children; access to basic health and
protection services; as well as issues related more directly to the pandemic: Infection
prevention control measures and COVID-19 knowledge, awareness and practices.

Programme response
Key UNICEF Sri Lanka programme responses to the pandemic and its containment measures
included, inter alia,
• Household telephone survey with UNDP at regular intervals to keep informed of the
socio-economic impact felt at the family level.
• Development and implementation of risk communication strategies with other
development partners and MoH; as the pandemic gained momentum, misinformation
began to spread fueling discrimination and stigma. UNICEF SLCO launched
interventions to promote facts over fear, and bringing trustworthy guidance to parents,
caregivers and educators;
• Procurement and delivery of supplies for infection prevention control, including WASH
facilities for handwashing.
• Support to MoE to develop learning packages for Grades 1 and 2, to complement the
web-based learning platforms, reaching over half a million children. The package
contained print-based materials, to be distributed to students in schools that were
predominantly in hard-to-reach geographic locations.
• Development of technical guidance notes, standard operating procedures and similar
guidance documents together with government counterparts for national rollout on
issues such as WASH and IPC measures in households and schools, standard operating
procedures for digital case management in child protection, guidelines for
management of children’s homes during COVID-19, guidelines for provision of
maternal and newborn care services, and a pocketbook for community health staff on
restarting health services.
• Following advocacy by the Child Protection Working Group, the Government declared
child protection services essential, meaning that Child Protection officers were able to
resume work from the second week of the first curfew, leaving almost no gap in service
delivery. Tips on positive parenting were made available online, and a psychosocial
support network was established centrally and in the Eastern and Northern regions.
• UNICEF SLCO also mobilized external resources from the World Bank and Asian
Development Bank and took on the procurement and delivery of USD 24 million worth
of medical supplies in collaboration with WHO.
COVID-19 mitigation measures have complemented GoSL efforts; the medical supplies are
timely and very much appreciated by GoSL stakeholders.
Programme and operational effectiveness
In order to ensure available capacity to support a timely COVID-19 response, the programme
management team deferred non-essential programme work78. On the operational side, the
country office switched from regular operating procedures to the Business Continuity Plan, a
transition that was eased by recent experiences doing the same during other emergencies in
the country79.
78 UNICEF Sri Lanka Annual Report, 2020.
79 Real-time assessment of the UNICEF South Asia response to COVID-19, UNICEF ROSA 2020.
33
Key programme documents were reviewed and updated, to better reflect the changing context
and also to align better with national priorities and resources available for the remaining years
of the programme. The Programme Strategy Notes, which outline the priorities within each
sectoral area, were amended and some new outputs were added to facilitate monitoring and
reporting on COVID-related activities. Planned studies and evaluations for 2020 were carried
forward to 2021.
The size of the World Bank and ADB funding relative to the country programme must not be
underestimated. It amounts to almost half of the total budget for the five-year country
programme (a budget that so far has not been realized and annual actual spending has been
far lower), placing a strain on the capacity and resources of a smaller country office.
During the early months of the pandemic, when PPE equipment was in short supply globally,
UNICEF SLCO used the opportunity to connect garment industry partners with UNICEF Supply
Division. Facilitating this dialogue between high level political leadership in Sri Lanka, private
sector entities and UNICEF Supply Division, the country office succeeded in enabling the
reopening of several factories (and restoring income opportunities for the mainly female staff),
for local manufacturing of PPE in line with international standards. Several contracts were
made with UNICEF Supply Division for meeting needs globally, in addition to local contracts
to fill domestic needs.
(f) Comparative Strength of UNICEF SLCO
This section provides a brief narrative on the comparative strength of UNICEF SLCO in its
programmatic areas of operation, and other actors who are active in Sri Lanka and who are
contributing to the programmatic areas. UNICEF SLCO's strengths are summarised below80:
• UNICEF SLCO is considered a respected partner with GoSL on child protection matters
and is recognised as the only international agency with dedicated expertise;
• UNICEF SLCO is also considered a key agency to address children's wellbeing;
• It has contributed towards generating knowledge products required for evidence-
based policy formulation;
• In the past, UNICEF SLCO provided support, both financially and technically, to improve
delivery of services relating to children and mothers.
In child protection, UNICEF SLCO's standing within GoSL is well recognised and is seen to
place UNICEF in a unique position in terms of advocacy81. UNFPA also has several programmes
on sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV)82. In education also, UNICEF SLCO is well
positioned within GoSL as having supported in many ways including infrastructure
development, introduction of WASH facilities, general education improvements including
ECCD83; however, in regard to social cohesion vis-à-vis education, UNDP also has interventions
relating to peace building but their focus on education is minimal84. In health and nutrition,
there are a number of UN agencies such as WFP, UNFPA, WHO and FAO who work on different
aspects of nutrition of children and mothers. As a result of reduced activities in the recent
times, the relevant GoSL stakeholders are of the view that the position of UNICEF SLCO much

less prominent than in other programmatic areas85. Various aspects of Social Policy are
addressed by different UN agencies (e.g. UNDP, WFP, ILO), and the prominent player is UNDP
which enjoys prominence within GoSL as a lead partner, together with others such as the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank86. Of these agencies, only UNICEF SLCO focusses on
child poverty.
There are also a number of International NGOs operating in child protection with substantial
donor funding.
• 71% were of the view that UNICEF SLCO is best placed to support
their work.
• 21% were unsure whether UNICEF SLCO is the best agency for their
work;
• 92% were of the view that UNICEF SLCO is well equipped in their
thematic areas.
Perception Survey
(g) Geographic coverage
In addition to the national work, UNICEF SLCO is implementing programmes in the Northern,
Eastern, Central and Uva Provinces (cf. Fig. 2.1).
In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, stakeholders are of the view that whilst there are
ongoing programmes, the coverage within the Provinces is inadequate. For example, the
provincial authorities have identified backward educational zones which require attention87.
Likewise, coverage in health and nutrition is inadequate, In the Central and Uva Provinces,
UNICEF SLCO's work is limited to education whereas child nutrition is a priority area requiring
early attention. Authorities also wish to expand the CC-DRR work to all districts which are
prone to disasters. In relation to child protection and health and nutrition, stakeholders are of
the view that UNICEF SLCO work should be expanded and upscaled in other districts.
The evaluation was constrained by limited stakeholder consultation in provinces other than
those where UNICEF SLCO is active due to deadlines. Also, the current reduced funding limits
UNICEF SLCO's geographic expansion, which is not well understood by GoSL stakeholders. The
GoSL stakeholders view on UNICEF SLCO's expansion to other areas in the country is based on
the assumption that UNICEF SLCO is still on a service delivery mode, and they are yet to come
to terms with the transition made by UNICEF SLCO. However, given the current nature of work
in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, there is a case for replicating some of the good
examples in other parts of the country.
(h) Areas needing more attention
The evaluation examined the critical areas of interventions identified by the stakeholders based
on national and/or provincial priorities which are not reflected in the current programme cycle

3.3 Effectiveness of the Country Programme
The effectiveness of the country programme was assessed using (i) the desk review of existing
data and information from the Results Assessment Module (RAM), annual reports as well as
external secondary sources (please see Annex 1.5 for a summary), (ii) key informant interviews,
and (iii) perception survey.
The assessment focused mainly on the identified outputs (1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 4.4). The Results
Framework largely used national indicators at the outcome level, and the data and information

on national indicators are generated by GoSL. In many cases, updated indicator status was not
available as GoSL has not undertaken the relevant surveys to generate data. This is a limitation
in assessing effectiveness at the outcome level.
(a) Reach and Delivery of the Results
Nutrition
Achievements: The nutrition programme is addressed from a systems perspective. The
interventions supported by UNICEF SLCO are ongoing; the formative research on infant and
young child feeding and maternal nutrition practices in Sri Lanka is expected to be completed
in 2021 and will provide much-needed information to develop a well-informed national infant
and young child feeding strategy with a comprehensive behavioural change communication
component. Other achievements include: introduction of national protocols for management
of SAM, and advocacy work leading to GoSL to allocate additional funding for production of
supplementary food (Thriposha) for children <5 y and pregnant mothers. The real-time District
Nutrition Monitoring System (DNMS) has been

the Government.
UNICEF SLCO also advocated Ready-to-use An Academic

malnutrition (SAM).
Assessment of Effectiveness: The effectiveness of the nutrition component is
hampered due to a number of reasons, viz.,
• Lack of GoSL interest in the Multi-Sectoral Action Plan for Nutrition (MSAPN); the
MSAPN was facilitated by UNICEF SLCO to coordinate the work of GoSL and donors
89 Information sourced from Annual Reports and RAM.

37
and other interested parties. Its previous work led to improvement in ranking of the
priority districts based on their performance against critical nutrition indicators as well
as in identification of the most vulnerable districts for targeted nutrition interventions.
Furthermore, the National Nutrition Secretariat, originally established in the President's
Office, was expected to ensure the multi sectoral involvement of all relevant
stakeholders in nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive issues. This agency is also not
functional. As a result, there is duplication of work, particularly by donors, at grassroots
level91. In this regard, the Nutrition Steering Committee on Nutrition of MoH is
expected to make some efforts towards coordination, but the Committee does not
receive workplans of the actors92.
• As with many other GoSL programmes, there is a gap between the Policy and grassroot
level actions needed. Introduction of customised nutrition packages appropriate in the
context of the region/community/individual (e.g. plantations, urban shanty areas, rural,
undernourished children under 5 y) which take into consideration the behavioural
context of communities will have better results.
• Overall, there are delays in delivery due to COVID-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions;
consequently, some results are yet to be seen.
GoSL stakeholders have expressed concern that in spite of interventions by GoSL and donors,
it is unable to demonstrate effectiveness in terms of some of the key progress indicators (e.g.
reduction in stunting). Consultations during this evaluation also noted the following which
have a bearing on effectiveness of its interventions93:
• UNICEF SLCO engagement with MoH is largely with the Family Health Bureau, whereas
the Nutrition Division and other Divisions have important roles to play.
• There is a notion amongst GoSL and Civil Society stakeholders that as health and
nutrition themes are amalgamated at UNICEF SLCO, the importance given to nutrition
is less than desired in spite of the priority needs in nutrition in the country. The
evaluation did not find any concrete evidence for this imbalance in its limited
examination; however, it is worth examining this internally as the external perceptions
are important. One reason may be the shortage of funds for nutrition programmes.
• Whilst appreciating the technical support of UNICEF SLCO, a number of senior officials
expressed the view that GoSL would more favourably respond to UNICEF SLCO's
technical advice if such advice is customised and contextualized considering the
conditions in Sri Lanka, rather than basing on practices carried out elsewhere in the
World.
• Given UNICEF SLCO's focus on upstream work, it is best placed to periodically review
GoSL's relevant policies with a view to examine why some policies or elements thereof
are functioning well or not functioning to provide a feedback to GoSL94.
• The capacity of GoSL public health personnel in nutrition management needs further
development to ensure that the advice proffered at the grassroots level is consistent

and reflect the GoSL policy. Currently, UNICEF SLCO is providing training and capacity
development, which are found to be timely and useful by GoSL.

Child Protection
Achievements: The target to help establish a functional national partnership under the
formal leadership of MoWCA was achieved, with UNICEF SLCO driving the process through
two years of activity resulting in a roadmap and the National Plan of Action to End Violence
Against Children (2018-2023). This role is widely acknowledged and supported by
stakeholders. The partnership was very active for two years (2017-2019), but the momentum
has since been lost and it is now inactive. Views on the reasons for this vary; from UNICEF SLCO
losing interest and failing to hand over the stewardship; changes in GoSL and Ministry
leadership; to disappointment that the pathfinder role did not lead to the expected increase
in funding95. The latter issue has caused partnerships in other pathfinding countries with a
similar fate. The next step for this initiative would be to advocate with different Ministries and
Departments for the implementation of the Action Plan, however the partnership is no longer
a viable platform for this. Alternative multi-sectoral committees are being explored by the
Country Office.

UNICEF SLCO also supported the Attorney

Assessment of Effectiveness: The consultations during the evaluation noted that
delivery of the life skills programme is delayed. A programme originating in Hong Kong
(PATHS) has been contextualized and translated for use in Sri Lanka and is being piloted in the
Northern Province (Mannar). It was delayed before COVID-19, but the prolonged closure of
schools has added to the delay although as an interim solution, it has been delivered online.

Department towards achieving a scale up should the results be
successful, seems to be uneven, largely due to
fund constraints and coordination issues in GoSL agencies. There are challenges in terms of
engaging local government and line ministries at the local level, and also lack of clarity on how
such buy-in will go to the national level and thus pave the way for scaling up. Lack of
government ownership was also an issue for the national partnership; hence this is a broader
issue affecting the Output as a whole. Strategic partnerships, with the Ministry of Education in
the case of bullying, are key to upscaling.
Aside from the difficulty of demonstrating change in the national indicators, an important need
is to establish a functional partnership amongst the key players to ensure implementation of
the action plan. As there is only a short time available in this cycle, it seems unlikely that these
interventions will have enough time to contribute to a reduction in violence on a national scale.
The capacity in the three agencies under the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MoWCA),
namely, the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), Department of Probation and
Childcare Services (DPCCS) and the National Secretariat for Early Childhood Development is
somewhat limited due to frequent turnover of staff and inadequate training99. Indeed, the
National Secretariat for Early Childhood Development was dormant for some time but has
recently resumed limited activities. Additionally, frequent political changes have meant that
relationships have to be continually rebuilt. Inadequate coordination between agencies
responsible for child protection together with unclear mandates have affected implementation
of child protection initiatives in the country. Similar situation is seen in the provinces also.
Added to this constraint is the weak coordination amongst GoSL agencies with other ministries
and agencies which work on child protection issues, resulting on an overall lack of coordination
in child protection work. This situation has been highlighted in the Situation Analysis of UNICEF
SLCO (2017) as well.
Stakeholder perceptions on Child Protection work
Majority of the respondents have rated UNICEF SLCO's protection support as satisfactory or
moderately satisfactory (Fig. 3.2). Justice services stand out from the rest, as one third (34%)
of respondents rated this support as unsatisfactory. During consultations, views on technical
support from UNICEF SLCO in child protection are mixed, with the majority finding it adequate
or strong. In terms of openness and transparency around plans and activities, several note that
this could be much better in the working groups, stating that “we would discuss ideas and then

Education
Achievements: Output 3.3 (Social Cohesion) is expected to support the delivery of an
overall school curriculum that promotes social harmony and addresses “interpersonal
violence” or bullying in schools. Whilst some work on curriculum development is delayed (e.g.
Civic Education Curriculum), GoSL has decided that all revisions to the curriculum should be a
part of the ongoing education reforms, which are expected to be piloted in one primary and
one secondary schools in each zone (204 schools) in 2022 and rolled out to selected grades in
2023 with full scale rollout in 2024. Training of resource persons at the Teacher Training
Colleges is on hold due to COVID-19 pandemic101. Another contribution from this output is
the ongoing capacity development of MoE staff to prevent and resolve conflict and promote
civic engagement.

national mechanism has been developed to replicate the programme; however, the capacity
of GoSL to replicate the programme is currently limited due to financial difficulties of GoSL in
procuring equipment102.
In Positive Disciplining, work is based on the premise that improvement of social and emotional
skills reduces bullying and peer victimization. It is being implemented in all UNICEF SLCO's
operational provinces with a reach of about 225 schools. In 2021, UNICEF SLCO, together with
MoE, provincial educational authorities and teachers, has reviewed the existing positive
disciplining manuals for teachers and case studies developed by the provincial resource teams
in North, East, Central and Uva provinces103.

UNICEF SLCO also facilitated providing psychosocial background support to the children’s
committees and media clubs in schools. As a part of this task, about 3,000 psychosocial
counsellors attached to different organizations were brought together for online counselling
training from time to time.
The national study on the issues of ragging and SGBV in Sri Lankan Universities has been
inordinately delayed; this is largely due to the change of senior management of the University
Grants Commission (UGC) following the change of Government in 2019. The report,
commissioned by UGC in 2018, has been finalized during the second half of 2021, and work
on developing policy guidelines to promote violence-free environments and the module on
co-existence and peace for the new university entrants is ongoing at the time of the
evaluation106.
The evaluation also noted inadequate coordination between the education and child
protection groups at UNICEF SLCO in delivering outputs on school violence and children's
safety107. Whilst work in schools is within the domain of the Education group, there could have
been value addition to technical aspects of school violence from the Child Protection Group.

Assessment of Effectiveness: (Output 3.3) Pre-COVID-19 implementation delays
coupled with post-COVID closure of schools and lockdowns have affected delivery. School
closure led to alarming inequities in learning opportunities for children. UNICEF SLCO
supported GoSL in supporting remote learning. The full range of activities planned have not
been implemented as evidenced in the delivery of outputs, and the provincial reach is also
limited. Some of the challenges highlighted in an evaluation related to this output yet
remains110. Due to various reasons, delivery of many components is pending 111. Work on the
Civic Education Curriculum and positive disciplining has been delayed. A proper assessment is
not possible as Output 3.3 needs a coordinated effort of all deliverables to achieve the
outcomes.

According to MoE, the National Action Plan on Education for Peace and Reconciliation could
not be implemented due to school closure since March 2020112.
Some of the delays are beyond the control of UNICEF SLCO. COVID-19 pandemic affected
almost all operations of schools since about March 2020; in some other cases, the change of
Government in 2019 and consequent changes in the Government departments/agencies and
policies113 required some of the agencies to revisit UNICEF SLCO inputs (e.g. University Grants
Commission; Educational Reforms).
In positive disciplining, the effectiveness could have been assessed if there was a baseline
study and the introduction of common modules with provision for adaptation across the
Provinces and sectors of living. A more stringent review of implementation would have
provided some directions to improve effectiveness114.
(Output 3.4) – Implementation of this output started only in 2020. Yet it brought in active
collaboration between DPCCS, DMC and MoE, and reached the most vulnerable adolescents
in 64 Grama Niladhari Divisions in seven districts, in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also
engaged with several Children's Clubs. The consultations of this evaluation reveal that the work
is well received in the provincial administrations, who are keen to upscale it. However, due to
COVID-19, it has not been possible to have community focus on DRR activities as they are pre-
occupied with economic revival. Although DMC is positive about CC-DRR work, it has not
participated in the joint committee with DPCCS, which is a limitation in integration of activities
in the different departments.

Social Policy and Social Protection
The evaluation notes that the Social Policy and Social Protection theme is comparatively new
in the country office, having been added in the current Programme Cycle. In 2018, the
programme began exploring priority areas for its portfolio development. As a nascent
programme, funding was limited. Work relating to CRC has been entrusted to this Division
without additional financial resources as CRC is not considered a sectoral issue115.
115 KII with UNICEF SLCO staff
46
The Programme has been developed on the premise that well-targeted and evidence-based
social protection supports the realization of children’s rights, alleviate income poverty thereby
assisting families to ensure that children are adequately nourished; are able to benefit from
education; and receive appropriate health care116.
During programme formulation, UNICEF SLCO identified the constraints in the implementation
of social policy component as limited institutional capacity of GoSL agencies to protect
children's rights, limited capacity and intersectoral coordination for data collection, analysis
and use, inefficient planning and coordination amongst development partners due to absence
of a national development plan, and fragmented social protection systems117.
Achievements:
Monitoring child rights of deprived children (Output 4.1):
The support is intended to contribute to developing and strengthening a national,
independent child rights monitoring system, which will operate across sectoral Ministries.
Coordination Mechanism: In the current program cycle UNICEF SLCO launched advocacy
initiatives for operationalizing a coordination mechanism at national level to oversee
implementation of international recommendations on child rights. Based on the National
Children’s Charter for implementation of the recommendations of CRC, GoSL established a
National Monitoring Committee (NMC), which has not met since the change of Government
in 2019118. However, there is evidence of coordination at the provincial level, largely effected
through local-level CSO partners119.
Advocacy for Child rights: The National Human Rights Commission was expected to
function as an independent body to promote and protect human rights, including child rights.
NHRC has not been successful in delivering its mandate towards protecting child rights. This
has created a lacuna in the effective monitoring and oversight of child rights and
implementation of commitments under the
CRC120.

National Evaluation Capacity Development (Output 4.2):
As a part of UNICEF SLCO's global strategy of improving the national evaluation capacity,
UNICEF SLCO supported the development of the Sri Lanka National Evaluation Policy (NEP),
the first country in South Asia. The Department of Project Management and Monitoring is in
the process of developing the strategic framework in 2020 to implement the National
Evaluation Policy126. This is a long-felt need supported by UNICEF SLCO.
An important investment related to the Policy is the development of the capacity of evaluators.

officials, and to train a cadre of young and emerging evaluators (YEE). An abridged module on
Monitoring & Evaluation has been developed for public sector officials.
About 100 persons, largely GoSL officials and to a lesser degree evaluators from the NGO
sector have been trained in the Diploma Programme. Sixty-two YEEs have been trained at two
2-day workshops.
UNICEF SLCO also supported the establishment of the Sri Lanka Parliamentarians' Forum on
Evaluation in 2017.

community liked the idea very much.
UNICEF SLCO also supported citizen friendly
budget consultation processes, and work on Eastern Provincial Council staff member
budget allocations for child sensitive initiatives.
As a result, the Eastern Provincial Council produced the first-ever citizen’s budget in Sri Lanka
in 2020. The Finance Commission noted that the citizen budget is in simple language and
understood by the communities which would help imparting a sense of community ownership.
The Finance Commission was present at the launch and committed itself to include the
preparation of citizen budgets in all Provincial Councils from 2020127.
UNICEF SLCO developed five Budget Briefs to examine the adequacy and equity of resource
allocations to critical social sectors; these were launched in 2019 as information sources and
advocacy tools to be used by GoSL128. The budget of 2021 has been analysed129 to ascertain
whether poverty eradication measures recognized in GoSL priorities are reflected in the budget
and found that the budget has indeed recognized the vulnerability of many workers including
those who suffered during the COVID-19 crisis losing livelihoods.
Government’s capacity to provide social protection services to the most deprived children
(Output 4.4)
Government Cash Transfer Programmes Covering Child Poverty Reduction: Samurdhi is the
biggest poor relief programme of GoSL. It has not been explicitly designed to address the
needs of children. There is no single registry on total number vulnerable families/people
entitled to social security benefits. It supports about 33 per cent of the households which
represents a population that is much higher than the current poverty levels. Data show that
targeting has worsened over time with a lesser proportion of poor households benefiting each
year. The programme thus suffers from both inclusion – including ineligible groups – and

exclusion – excluding eligible people130. Transfer values are low and the vast majority of
children – including over half of the poorest children – are excluded from Samurdhi131.
Social protection system for emergency prevention, preparedness, and response132: Social
protection programmes include emergency prevention, preparedness, and response as a key
element. UNCEF worked downstream in areas affected by natural disasters (floods or drought,
landslides) where service delivery is a significant challenge for access to basic facilities. In this
regard, UNICEF SLCO's work on Child-Centered Disaster Risk Reduction (CCDRR) to address
issues relating to high vulnerability of children affected by disasters has helped communities
in disaster-prone areas. Whilst the DPCCS and NCPA are well integrated into this programme,
DMC is yet to demonstrate its full engagement.
Overall, UNICEF SLCO's work has shown a higher poverty levels in the country than the GoSL
statistics indicate. There has been no agreement by GoSL on the approach adopted by UNICEF
SLCO in determining poverty levels, and this is a point of disagreement between the parties133.
Assessment of Effectiveness; The consultations for this evaluation revealed that the
Provincial Councils have embraced the concept of citizen budgets supported by UNICEF SLCO
to ensure that there is better citizen understanding of how public finances are managed and
used, and to encourage increasing inclusive civic participation. The Eastern Provincial Council
has prepared citizen budgets for 2019 and 2020134. A similar exercise is underway in the
Northern Provincial Council to produce a citizen budget for 2022.
In regard to public spending, UNICEF SLCO initiatives were expected to influence GoSL by their
work with the Department of National Planning to either increase or maintain government
spending on Education [2.06% of GDP-2015] and Public Health [1.62% of GDP-2015] by 2022.
These initiatives do not appear to have the desired effect as the available statistics of the
Central Bank show that the Government spending on education and public health has not
improved (Fig. 3.5). The evaluation noted one instance where the allocation for child protection
has increased, based on pressure brought out by NCPA.

Sri Lanka has been moving from a status of relatively high safety net spending to one with
limited resource allocation for critical safety nets at the time of the design of the CP136. The
situation is exacerbated by deteriorating financial situation of GoSL following COVID-19
pandemic.
Overall, the consultations for the evaluation noted the following:
• On Social Policy and Social Protection, the engagement with the relevant Government
agencies has been few and sporadic, and the relationship with the National Planning
Department has been challenging137. Stakeholders are of the view that a more
concerted engagement is needed to influence GoSL policy, particularly in the COVID-
19 climate where GoSL funding is very limited138.
• UNICEF SLCO has undertaken a review of public expenditure on nutrition and has
presented the results to H E the President; however, the NPD is yet to respond139.
• UNICEF SLCO's work on transparency and participation in budget development,
accountability and oversight was not explicit in Government agenda in the GoSL Policy
Document at the time of programme design.
• UNICEF SLCO is best placed to provide leadership to the development of a child
sensitive social protection policy for GoSL.
In child rights advocacy, The GoSL priority for child rights monitoring has been affected due
to the overall waning of priority accorded to Human Rights, Reconciliation, Transitional
Justice140.

The NMC did not function as expected and became inactive since the change of Government
in 2019. The consultation of this evaluation revealed that the failure of NMC was due to lack
of continued political willingness and absence of a lead Ministry for coordination of its affairs.
In national evaluation capacity development, the effectiveness of the initiatives can only be
examined by evaluating the post-training work of the trainees, and improvements to the
overall evaluation work of GoSL, as it is the main beneficiary of this support.
Stakeholder perceptions of Social Policy work
As shown in Fig. 3.6, majority show moderate satisfaction with UNICEF SLCO work. However,
about a third of the respondents have rated UNICEF SLCO's work in increasing investments for
children, both at national and provincial level, as unsatisfactory.

(b) Sustainability
It is premature to assess sustainability for initiatives that are still being rolled out; however
some notes can be made.
In Nutrition, the consultation for this evaluation noted that the initiatives supported by
UNICEF SLCO are already in the programmes of MoH, and are likely to be continued, subject
to availability of funds.
In Child Protection, the outlook for sustainability of the National Partnership is currently
limited. The National Partnership to End Violence that was established with UNICEF SLCO
support is no longer considered a viable platform by stakeholders. Sustainability of the two
pilots depends on their implementation and success in proactively engaging government
stakeholders, which has been limited. Some early lessons that have been made on securing
government engagement and linkages to line ministries are evident; these lessons need to be
put to use in order to develop more streamlined coordination processes so that scaling up is
not dependent on ad hoc relationships.
52
In Education, there is a likelihood of interventions being scaled up once the changes in the
Government agencies are stabilised. A worrisome situation is the reduction of funding for the
Peace and Reconciliation Unit of the Ministry of Education, which is exclusively dependent on
donor funds for any activities as GoSL provides only the salaries of officials.
Sustainability also depends on contextualizing the introduced initiatives, which require
additional follow-up inputs from UNICEF SLCO. For example, social cohesion through music
education was found to be effective, subject to the improvements to the module, which is yet
to be completed141.
In Social Policy, UNICEF SLCO initiatives, some of which are also supported by other UN
agencies, are embedded in the work programmes of the relevant GoSL agencies and are likely
to be continued with the support of donors as some of the policy-related studies are expected
to be funded by the donors142.
Overall, GoSL commitments to sustainability and adoption of some of the measures advocated
by UNICEF SLCO (e.g. increased public expenditure on health and nutrition, child protection
and education) are dependent on improving the economic situation in the country. For
example, the Appropriation Bill for 2022 indicates a reduction for public spending compared
to the level in 2021143. Notwithstanding this situation, a better sense of sustainability was
observed amongst provincial GoSL staff; there was evidence of replication of good practices.
Allocation of funds for replication, and expansion of activities are largely due to the authority
of the provinces to allocate funds from its own budgets.
(c) Timeliness of Delivery
One of the main challenges faced by UNICEF SLCO is timely delivery of the programme.
Analysis of the performance of 2018-19 workplans indicate delays in delivery due to delays by
resource persons, and implementation delays by Partners. COVID-19 exacerbated the situation
from about March, 2020. Most work in education have been inordinately delayed as the
schools remain closed for most of the time since about March, 2020. Where community
participation was essential, such work too has been affected due to restrictions on gatherings
and meetings due to COVID-19. As a result, most work in education and child protection have
been delayed and are unlikely to be streamlined this year; however UNICEF SLCO is exploring
avenues to expedite work.
141 The evaluation of the Project Promoting Social Cohesion Through Music Education: A pilot project in the Eastern
province, Sri Lanka noted that "If the project is to be handed over to state authorities for replication, it needs
to be designed and implemented in a way that it can be easily ‘adopted’ – that is it needs to be low cost and
involve activities and logistical arrangements that are within the capacity of local educational institutions to
implement without significant external funding or assistance" (Evaluation Report, March, 2019)

• Overall, 27% of the respondents were very unsatisfied with timeliness of
delivery by UNICEF SLCO;
• The lowest score for satisfaction amongst the six parameters was for timeliness
of delivery.
• Amongst partners, 31% of GoSL officials were unhappy with the timeliness of
delivery.
Perception Survey
(d) Reporting and Monitoring
The Results Framework provides the guidance for monitoring and reporting. Aligned with the
annual or biannual workplans, the Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation Plan (IMEP) maps out
all planned assessments, studies and evaluations. Review of the IMEPs for the three years show
that some data gathering activities were postponed from 2020 to 2021, but for the large part
most have been concluded or initiated, few seem to be dropped.
The annual reporting differs somewhat from year to year due to changes in organization-wide
reporting formats (RAM). There is some repetition from year to year in narrative statements,
making the entries for different years harder to compare as the documents are substantially
different for each year under review. In terms of accessibility, the 2020 RAM format was
particularly difficult.
The evaluation notes that reporting structures are complicated, and staff find reporting at
outcome level challenging. This is further complicated by the lifecycle approach, which requires
a reflection on the merged effect of several sectors at each lifecycle stage.
Indicators
The Results Framework uses UNICEF's standardized indicators at outcome level to enable
UNICEF SLCO results to be connected to global indicators, which provides the alignment
between global, regional and country priorities. Whilst countries can generate their own
indicators, the process is cumbersome as it involves several layers of approvals. In regard to
the outcome indicators in the Results Framework, the evaluation notes the following:
• The outcome indicators are broad long-term indicators of GoSL (e.g. % children <5 y
who are stunted; net enrolment rates in secondary education; number of children
covered by social protection systems);
• Usually, data for such outcome indicators are generated by GoSL; often at longer time
intervals (for example health and nutrition indicators are derived from DHS). Such data
may or may not be available during the lifetime of the programme cycle, or may come
in the middle of the programme period, making their usefulness for performance
assessment limited;
• During the programme cycle, several indicators have been dropped or changed
without this change being clearly noted in the relevant documents; and the PSNs were
also provided in their current (rolling) form without any possibility to see what was
updated and when.
• Given the limited coverage of work by UNICEF SLCO, there is possibility of developing
local level indicators (e.g. district) where UNICEF SLCO has been working and explore
the possibility of achieving those local indicators through the interventions.
54
• The UNICEF SLCO staff show an element of indifference to their own outcome
indicators because they are 'very far' to achieve.
The key performance indicators are regularly reviewed by the CMT, but follow-up actions to
address the shortcomings are not evident.
Consultations during the evaluation indicate that using provincial indicators, which are more
meaningful and interesting to staff, may be one way of attracting their attention and to ensure
that thematic units work towards them. Whilst using provincial indicators (at least in the
provinces UNICEF SLCO works) may not be feasible given the global protocols adopted by
UNICEF SLCO, these may be more meaningful for monitoring and reporting internally and to
ensure a more realistic monitoring regime. As is seen in Annex 3.1, it is unlikely that UNICEF
SLCO will be able to report on some of the Indicators at the end of the current programme
cycle (e.g. data from DHS survey).
On output indicators, UNICEF SLCO has developed criteria for scoring the level of achievement.
The evaluation noted that the interpretation of these criteria (and subsequent scoring) is not
consistent amongst the programme staff.
• Regular review of work conducted should be done at least quarterly with the
Ministry higher officials to track the speed and comprehensiveness of the work;
• The government officials did not produce many results with indicators though
UNICEF SLCO is providing a lot of resources. An effective monitoring system
need to be introduced to make things better, even to Partner CSO also.
• I think UNICEF needs to improve its M&E Systems to capture the impact of
programs. Further, UNICEF SLCO also needs to improve the quality of its
interventions by providing more technical assistance for partners though a
consistent system
Quotes from the Perception Survey
(e) Current Country Office Structure and Capacity for Delivery
UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Office is organised by thematic divisions. The Social Policy and Social
Protection, Education, and Child Protection are stand-alone divisions; Health and Nutrition and
WASH are clustered under Child Survival and Development. In addition, programme
implementation is supported by field offices. There are two types of field presence: the Zonal
Offices (or UNICEF SLCO representational offices) in Kilinochchi (serving the Northern
Province) and in Batticaloa (serving the Eastern Province). An outposted officer based in the
Uva Provincial Council overlooks the work in Central and Uva Provinces, with a limited portfolio
of work. Fig. 3.7 shows the organogram relating to the programme.
The current country programme uses the lifecycle approach, where activities are organised to
provide support to children based on their age group. The approach identifies specific
priorities and plans for each age group. However, the UNICEF SLCO office structure is not
organised to address issues according to age; the office has a traditional sectoral structure of
thematic units. In a small office such as UNICEF SLCO, the required technical diversity may not
be available. As an alternative, the Office has set up several Groups which are expected to meet
often so that inputs to life stages could be discussed and agreed upon. Such groups are
55
expected to bring about coordination and linkages between thematic areas to provide
integrated solutions to an issue. A full analysis of the SLCO experience applying a lifecycle
approach to programming is in section 3.5.
Despite the efforts to increase cross-sectoral collaboration internally mainly through numerous
meetings, external stakeholders are of the view that internal coordination within UNICEF SLCO
is inadequate and not demonstrated in its engagements with the external stakeholders. The
consultations of this evaluation also
noted that the internal coordination is

Country Office capacity
In the previous programme cycle, the CO adopted a service delivery approach. It is the view of
the stakeholders that staff capacity and competence for service delivery were adequate for
that purpose. However, with the change of approach to upstream policy dialogue and
advocacy which in itself is a challenging task, there is a felt need for a different skill sets to
communicate with the high-level officials144. The consultations for this evaluation noted the
concerns expressed by both external and internal stakeholders on the need to analyse and
profile the capacity needed for policy dialogue and influencing the upper echelons of the
Government. The inability to influence GoSL on some of the key pending policy matters is
attributed to the absence of a persuasive and cogent voice from UNICEF SLCO.
The Zonal Presence of UNICEF in Sri Lanka
UNICEF SLCO first established Zonal Offices in 1996 to address humanitarian issues relating to
the conflict in the original North-eastern Province. With the demerger of Northern and Eastern
Provinces, UNICEF SLCO established offices in the provinces to facilitate work on conflict-
related issues. The Zonal Offices were expanded after the Tsunami of December 2004 to
facilitate relief work in the coastal provinces of Sri
Lanka. After the Tsunami recovery phase, some zonal
offices were closed.
UNICEF Staff visit us regularly to
look at our work and support us Currently, there are two Zonal Offices, viz., Northern
with planning and implementation – Province (in Kilinochchi) and Eastern Province (in
it is an encouragement. Batticaloa). These offices concentrate on post-conflict
Provincial Govt. Official resettlement, rehabilitation, and reconciliation work in
the Northern and Eastern Provinces with key staff as
follows:
• Kilinochchi Office – has Child Protection, Education and CSD staff
• Batticaloa Office – has Education and Child Protection staff
The Chief of Office, with the overall responsibility towards day-to-day work and liaison with
the Provincial Councils, reports to the Representative, and thematic staff report to the
respective thematic heads in the Colombo Office.
The Zonal Offices function as UNICEF SLCO representative offices and have developed very
close rapport with the relevant provincial councils and other provincial departments and
agencies. The consultations for this evaluation revealed the close rapport with provincial
administration, and the mutual trust and dependency displayed by both parties. It is also clear
that this close collaboration has enabled the Zonal Offices (as well as the outpost office) to
identify provincial needs and priorities through regular discussions, workshops etc., which are
then matched with UNICEF SLCO priorities to be included in the annual workplans. However,
there is a need to revisit the modus operandi for this process (see Section on Consistency with
Provincial Plans).
The technical staff in the zonal offices function as the intermediary between UNICEF SLCO and
the provincial departments and provide much-needed technical and logistical support to the
departments. Their inputs are very much appreciated by the departments and agencies.

UNICEF SLCO also has an outposted officer accommodated in the Uva Provincial Council office
in Badulla with the responsibility for the Central Province as well. The Outposted Officer's main
responsibility is to ensure the implementation of the education component in the two
provinces; he reports to the Deputy Representative in the Colombo Office.
The Central/Uva outpost office has a very large geographic area to cover with long travel times
due to the terrain; currently the portfolio is limited to education, but the stakeholders are of
the view that child nutrition is a priority, particularly in the plantation sector. This outfit will
have to be suitably strengthened if the programme portfolio is increased in the future, as one
officer is unable to cover the large geographic area effectively.
(f) Capacity of the Government Partners
The consultations during the evaluation revealed that the capacity in the relevant departments
and agencies of GoSL at both central and provincial levels is, in general, adequate to fulfil the
obligations. Since the partnership with UNICEF SLCO has been long-standing, GoSL officials
acknowledge the UNICEF SLCO support to develop capacity of the GoSL staff at various levels,
which is continuing. The evaluation noted the high-level of understanding of programmatic
issues by the Provincial officials, and the use of RBM for monitoring and reporting.
An observation by several stakeholders is that there is minimal coordination and linkages
between government agencies in the relevant interventions, which the evaluation confirms.
The evaluation noted the enthusiasm of GoSL partners to acquire new knowledge and
experiences. An example is the Child Friendly Cities concept, which has triggered enthusiasm
amongst provincial administrators as an initiative worthy of replicating. The provincial councils
have acquired adequate expertise to launch this concept to duplicate efforts of the Batticaloa
Municipal Council, which pioneered the establishment of Child Friendly City of Batticaloa.
Likewise, the CC-DRR concept is well understood by provincial authorities.
In the current cycle, UNICEF SLCO has supported the development of evaluation capacity, both
in GoSL as well as in the NGO sector. A noteworthy contribution is the training of 'Young and
Emerging Evaluators'; it is expected that the planning, monitoring and evaluation capacity of
national cadres has improved. However, the evaluation noted some limitations in GoSL officials
on project and programme cycle management.
(g) Funding
The Sri Lanka country programme document (CPD) has an indicative budget of USD 4,735,000
from Core Resources for Results (RR) and USD 52,500,000 from Other Resources Regular (OR).
The total budget is USD 57,235,000 and the indicative allocations are in Fig. 3.8 (a). The
allocation provides 29% for early childhood, 19% for middle childhood, 25% for adolescence,
and 14% for social policy145.
The evaluation did not examine budgets and expenditures as it was not covered in the ToR.
The limited analysis provided in the following section is warranted in light of the evaluation

In the original 5 year indicative budget of USD 57.2 Mln, the Country Office expected USD
52.5 Mln (or 92%) from OR (external sources). As at October, 2021, the Country Office has
received a total of USD 25.7 Mln (or 45% of the original 5 year planning amount) made
up of USD 3.6 Mln RR (or 77% of the 5 year planning amount) and USD 22.1 Mln OR (or 42%
of the original OR planning amount). Part of these receipts has been 're-phased' to 2021 and
2022, the last year of the current programme.
As of 31 December 2020, the Country Office has spent USD 12.4 Mln (or 22% of the original
budget) made up of USD 2.7 Mln RR funds (or 57% of the original RR budget) and USD 9.7
Mln OR funds (or 18% of the original OR budget).
The shortfall of funding as of October, 2021 (about USD 20 million) is reflected in curtailed
activities of UNICEF SLCO. Fig. 3.9 (a) and (b) show the actual allocations for four outputs (1.1,
2.2, 3.3, 4.4) for 2018-19 and 2020 workplans, respectively146. The analyses show that in 2018-
19 workplan, all outputs suffered due to funding difficulties. A similar trend is observed in the
2020 work-plan as well, except for education, which received donor funds as budgeted.
Overall, the realisation of funds for the four outputs under reference was 39% in the 2018-19
workplan and 56% in the 2020 workplan.
As would be seen from Fig. 3.9 (a) and (b), the Child Protection output suffered most as a result
of the inability to raise OR funds. In 2018-19 about 15% of OR funds were raised, and this
dropped to 10% in 2020. The funding limitations appear to have affected particularly the pilot
programmes. For the life skills programme, funds were initially only secured for contextualizing
the materials, causing further planning into dissemination to be delayed.
The funding pattern corresponds to donor contributions and is indicative of donor influence
on the implemented programme.
146 Output 3.4 (DRR) was not considered for this analysis as the Output was introduced only in the 2020 work-
plan.

(h) Knowledge Products and Outreach
UNICEF SLCO has moved from service delivery to upstream policy and advocacy. An essential
pre-requisite in this transition is UNICEF SLCO's ability to provide credible knowledge products
(e.g. technical publications). The main partner, GoSL will have to rely on such products for
informed decision-making. This is an area UNICEF SLCO will need to pay attention to as
60
consultations during the evaluation noted the reservations expressed by some partners on the
technical rigour of some of the UNICEF SLCO technical publications.
UNICEF SLCO uses two modalities for developing technical publications; they are either directly
contracted or are contracted by the partners using UNICEF funds. The evaluation is of the view
that irrespective of the modality of the publication process, there has to be rigourous quality
assurance of the final product to meet the accepted standards of UNICEF.
Although not thoroughly examined, the evaluation came across issues on outreach of UNICEF
SLCO's programme and work. Some senior GoSL partners were unaware of UNICEF SLCO's
programme or the focus areas in the current cycle, although GoSL is expected to partner
UNICEF SLCO on work in such focus areas. Similarly, the evaluation came across several
instances where partners were unaware of the results of work done – as a result, there was a
show of disinterest in the overall outcome indicators and the expectations of results. In the
area of child protection, several point to the evidence generation of UNICEF SLCO being lower
than expected.
• 55% of the respondents were familiar with UNICEF SLCO's current
programme.
• "UNICEF SLCO does not provide details fully; Better transparency from UNICEF
will improve the effectiveness."
Perception Survey
(i) Partnerships
This section examines UNICEF SLCO's partnerships for programme delivery. Broadly, the
partnerships can be classified into three categories, as follows:
• Partnerships with GoSL and CSOs for implementation;
• Private sector partnerships
• Joint Programmes with UN Agencies
Brief comments on findings on these partnerships are provided below:
Partnerships with GoSL and CSOs for implementation
The main modalities used by UNICEF SLCO for implementation are (a) through Government
agencies (including provincial agencies), and (b) through identified CSOs. The CSO
engagement differs depending on the programme. Work on nutrition and DRR is largely
through the relevant government agencies at national and provincial level. The engagement
of CSOs is more prominent in child protection and education spheres.
The evaluation noted that some of the CSOs engaged have long-standing partnerships with
UNICEF SLCO and have added value to UNICEF SLCO's work as the CSOs are closer to the
community. Their engagement facilitated UNICEF SLCO's work; often they provided valuable
feed-back on the programme.

capacity of CSOs and
An implementing CSO (Provincial) communications and outreach.
Whilst there are advantages of using
long-standing CSOs for implementation, UNICEF SLCO will benefit from seeking the services
of new CSOs who are capable of bringing new perspectives. The consultations revealed that
UNICEF SLCO has engaged with new CSOs during this cycle, who have brought in their own
strengths to the table.
A number of GoSL and NGO stakeholders expressed reservations on the choice of provincial
level CSO implementers as some of them lacked in-house capacity for the work programme
and contracted Government officials for their work147. A number of stakeholders were of the
view CSOs should be used only when there are no other alternatives for implementation, and
not as a matter of routine.
• "The CSOs do not understand problems; they are not properly
briefed about the work - they do their own work."
• "The CSOs are not competent to provide the services; sometimes
our teachers are better."
• "There is too much involvement of the NGOs in programme
implementation."
Quotes by non-implementing stakeholders; Perception Survey
Information sharing is an important element in the partnerships. According to the Perception
Survey, 81% of the partners (out of 49) showed some degree of satisfaction with 12% rating
their view as 'very satisfactory'. Nineteen per cent are 'not satisfied' with the way UNICEF SLCO
is sharing information (see below).
• "We do not receive reports of work done or the results or any feed-
back".
• "We are not provided with information on how UNICEF SLCO has
performed in doing the work; we only do our work, but we do not hear
of any higher level results from UNICEF SLCO ".

Private sector partnerships
In UNICEF SLCO, private sector engagement is relatively new. Firstly it started a donation
window in its website to accept public donations. Since then, with the recruitment of the
Resource Mobilization and Partnerships Officer, more concerted efforts have been made to
engage the private sector to assist UNICEF SLCO in implementing its programme. These
included creating platforms for funding emergency situations arising from disasters and public

disorder. In the current cycle, a sum of USD 212,208148 has been received, made up of
individual contributions of USD 10,884 and USD 201,324 from the private sector (for COVID-
19 response in the Northern Province) (Table 3.5). However, UNICEF SLCO has not prepared
reports on the use of these funds to the donor149. One prospective funding fell through due
to lack of reporting by UNICEF SLCO on a previous contribution made by the company150.
UNICEF SLCO is currently preparing the Guidelines for private sector engagement – this has
been in a draft mode for several months and is yet to be approved.
In the last several years, some headway has been made in securing private sector assistance
(e.g., better parenting programme, hand-washing campaign following COVID-19 pandemic).

2018 753.28 753.28
Total 10,884.06 201,323.77 212,207.83
Although still in the nascent stage, UNICEF SLCO may revisit its private sector engagement
strategy from the results made thus far. It is evident that private sector can be attracted by
offering custom-made programmatic packages to align with the core business of the
company, and this requires much work from the programme.
Some staff are not convinced on the need for private sector engagement, particularly because
of the inherent reputational risks associated with businesses151. Aside from being a source of
funding, there is a strong case for UNICEF SLCO to work with the private sector to achieve
results for children, by ensuring that businesses are aware and increasingly adopt measures in
line with the Children’s Rights and Business Principles (CRBP).
Overall, the private sector engagement has moved slowly in the country office due to low
enthusiasm and slow progress in finalsing the Guidelines. several reasons within the country
office. Once the guidelines are in place, the strategy for engagement needs to be carefully
thought out after due consultations with the private sector, beginning with, say, the Chambers
of Commerce. While the evaluation has not looked into existing engagements on children’s
rights and business principles, the garment industry and the plantation sector are areas with
potential – the latter is linked with low scores on several key indicators.
148 Of this, approximately USD 168,000 has been received from the London Stock Exchange Group.

(j) Satisfaction of implementing partners
The Perception Survey shows that 95% of the implementers have some degree of satisfaction
about their partnership with UNICEF SLCO (30% 'very satisfied'; 28% satisfied, and 37%
moderately satisfied). The reasons for their satisfaction are noteworthy (see box).
• "Collaborative, participatory planning with technical support."
• "Efficient implementation support and flexibility."
• "Fidelity/transparency, staff commitment and friendly and accessible
service."
Basis for Satisfaction: Quotes by implementing stakeholders (Perception Survey)
Perceptions of the stakeholders on the Effectiveness of the UNICEF SLCO
Programme
Fig. 3.10 (a) summarises the perceptions of the stakeholders on general effectiveness in a
number of areas. Overall rating of moderately satisfactory/satisfactory is noted in all areas;
however, about 20% show unsatisfactory rating for quality of work and timeliness of delivery.
A further analysis was carried out to examine the perceptions of the Government and
CSO/NGO community. The CSOs/NGOs consistently rated higher satisfaction of UNICEF SLCO
programme [Fig. 3.10 (b]. It is noted that most of these, if not all, NGOs have been contracted
work by UNICEF SLCO during this programme cycle.

Ways of improving effectiveness (Perception Survey)
(k) Programme Assumptions
In general, the programme assumed that there will be political will to achieve changes in social
services and that there will be a change in budgeting processes for integrated social protection
services for children and adolescents152. These assumptions have been made considering the
country situation at the time of programme design (2016/17) and were considered realistic at
that time. It also assumed that legislation and national plans will strengthen service delivery
for children and adolescents. Both these assumptions have not been fulfilled completely and
are challenges for the next programme cycle. The budgeting process and allocation for
children are affected due to poor economic situation in the country, which will remain so for
some time.
In Early childhood, funding of ECD services will be affected due to overall poor economic
situation in the country. GoSL commitment to multi-stakeholder coordination has not been
fulfilled in spite of repeated attempts by UNICEF SLCO. These constraints are likely to remain
during the remainder of the current programme cycle.
In Middle childhood, data management by GoSL and provincial administrations remains a
challenge to demonstrate progress towards achieving SGD goals. The political will to establish
child protection coordination mechanisms and the commitment to the Global Partnership to
End Violence against Children have not been fully demonstrated. UNICEF SLCO's convening
152 PSN Notes Overview (June, 2017)
65
power on establishing common fora has been questioned by some of the implementing
partners.
In Adolescence, resource allocation will remain a challenge in the current context of economic
downturn. The human resources in the health sector are greatly stressed due to COVID-19
management, and may not be available freely for UNICEF SLCO work, as envisaged. As noted
in the evaluation, the coordination between the Ministries of Health and Ministry of Education
has not reached the desired level. The expectation that the Ministry of Justice remains open to
reform is showing positive signs, but the changes are likely to take time.
In Programme effectiveness, the risk of diminishing support to UN organizations remains,
which will affect fundings.
Overall, a number of key assumptions in the Country Programme have not materialised largely
due to the economic situation in the country and the external events such as Easter Sunday
attack and COVID-19 pandemic. Some of these will remain as challenges to the new country
programme.
(l) Unintended outcomes
The evaluation focused on selected outputs only; no significant unintended outcomes were
observed.
(m) Overall assessment
Based on the assessment in RAM153, the achievements are summarised in Table 3.6.
Table 3.6 - Reported progress in 2020 (orange: constrained, green: on track)
Outcome Output
Outcome 1 Early Childhood 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4
Outcome 2 Middle Childhood 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4
Outcome 3 Adolescence 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4
Outcome 4 Social Policy 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4
Note: Yellow highlighted outputs are the selected ones for the evaluation.
The evaluation notes that RAM records Outcome # 3 as 'on track' in spite of the fact that three
out of four outputs are constrained. The reasons for this assessment are unclear.
The constraints are largely due to COVID-19 pandemic, Easter Sunday attack, and funding
difficulties.
The evaluation notes that UNICEF SLCO interventions are rather dispersed and diluted to make
an overall impression to the changes that are envisaged in children. This is largely due to
limited funding of the programme, a situation which is likely to continue. A better option is to
introduce more strategic interventions using the limited funds available to ensure that the
interventions bring some of the expected changes.
Although UNICEF SLCO has adopted the Lifecycle approach, its engagement with GoSL is
sectoral. The reasons for this are well understood as government works in sectors, often
153 RAM, 2020
66
without adequate coordination. One way of improving the overall effectiveness to use
UNICEF's philosophy more proactively to reach beyond the sectoral approach to embrace
children's health, safety, and wellbeing to show children as the nation's wealth154. This would
trigger better integration within GoSL.
3.4 Coherence
(a) UNICEF SLCO Interventions
The current CP focusses on upstream policy and advocacy related work which are normally
long-term in nature to show results. The advocacy work in Social Policy will continue; the
initiative to influence GoSL for cash transfers to the poor to ensure inclusive child rights
remains in abeyance, due largely to macro-economic challenges, the high debt burden, large
refinancing needs, and weak external buffers faced by the Government 155 . Despite
contributions such as budget analysis and other advocacy work, UNICEF SLCO's initiatives to
influence increase of GoSL allocations to the education and health have not met with
success156. The UNICEF SLCO led initiative on citizen budgets has been taken up well by
Provincial Councils.
In Nutrition, the national protocols for the management of SAM were finalised and is being
adopted by the Government. MSAPN is not fully functional, and the formative research to
support IYCF strategy is delayed due to COVID-19 and is ongoing.
In Child Protection, the initiatives of UNICEF SLCO fall within the national policies. However,
the national coordination mechanism for child protection work is not functional; progress
towards home-visiting and parent education is limited, and the roll-out of peer-to-peer
violence work, and PATHS has been put in abeyance (due to COVID-19).
In Education, UNICEF SLCO's inputs towards curriculum development will be used in the
upcoming educational reforms work, which includes comprehensive review and updating of
the curricula. The pilot work on learning and co-curricular activities developed and tested for
social cohesion have not been scaled up or repeated due to school closure following COVID-
19. Work on community engagement on skills development is yet to be launched.
(b) Joint Programmes with UN Agencies
The UN Joint programming is expected to help achieve system-wide coherence that support
national priorities. It is also a tool for improved coordination amongst development
programmes. Joint programmes are also expected to identify and build on complementarities
of partner agencies (in particular UN agencies)157.

157 United Nations Development Group (2014) Guidance Note on Joint Programmes
67
Joint programmes are launched on the premise that each agency commits adequate resources
and time to work together; there is clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities of
each partner based on their comparative advantages; there is adequate capacity to ensure
shared geographical presence, human resources and the capacity to scale up; ability to
integrate responses from different agencies; and implementation capacity at the national and
provincial levels.
In terms of the UNDG Guidelines, the Joint Programmes are expected to be led by the UN
Country Team (UNCT) with strong coordination led by the Resident Coordinator involving all
of the UNCT team leadership. However, in practice, UNICEF SLCO was the 'Lead Agency' of a
recently concluded joint programme158.
UNICEF SLCO has conducted several joint programmes with other UN Agencies, notably WHO,
WFP, UN-Habitat, and UNDP during the current programme cycle. The evaluation notes that
in these joint programmes, implementation has been very compartmentalised and have been
treated as distinct sub-project components by the implementing agencies. The spirit of joint
programming has not been demonstrated during the implementation period. The evaluation
notes the following challenges and shortcomings on the situation for which all participating
UN agencies are responsible:
• Inadequate participation of the agencies during design and planning of the joint
programmes. This has been due to short time available for the development of the
proposal and the funding window. Often, there has been very little time to jointly
review important components of the proposal such as the Results Framework and
implementation modalities.
• Inadequate commitment and responsibility by participating UN agencies to ensure
delivery as agreed. As a result, UNICEF SLCO has struggled to operationalise the joint
programme to the expected level and quality.
• Limited staff time availability for development of the proposal, and for work afterwards
due to conflicting programmatic priorities;
• Flawed understanding of the spirit of joint programming amongst some key staff in
the UN agencies;
• Not synchronizing the pace of work at the agencies due to staffing issues (for e.g.
UNICEF SLCO uses its own core staff for sub-projects whereas other agencies may
recruit project-based staff) or different priorities in the agencies;
• Inadequate synergy of activities at the field level. The stakeholders reported duplication
of work by UN agencies, often requiring the same set of beneficiaries to attend
separate but related meetings. The stakeholders were also interested in joint UN
programming, particularly in areas of common interest (e.g., health and nutrition) so
that the delivery would be holistic and the time of GoSL agencies could be optimised.
• Absence of a 'project manager' with the overall responsibility of ensuring project
implementation as per agreed schedules and providing a consolidated results-based
report, rather than collating participating agency notes as a report.
158 PBF-funded Project, Promoting Reconciliation in Sri Lanka
68
Some of these shortcomings have been highlighted in evaluations of joint projects159.
The evaluation notes that UNICEF SLCO is mindful of the challenges and shortcomings and
has taken corrective action in future joint programmes. Equally, other agencies interviewed
have also taken action in their own organisations to improve joint programming. For example,
UNDP has invested much time with other UN agencies, including UNICEF SLCO, to design a
new project on Access to Justice so that the ownership of the project lies with all agencies.
There is both formal and informal discussions during the project preparation phase, which
bodes well for more integrated implementation of such projects.
The evaluation also notes that the systems at the Regional Coordinator's Office, which is tasked
with providing coordination support, have been strengthened, with better engagement of
UNCT to support joint programming.
A challenge that remains to be addressed is the field level coordination of activities in joint
programmes. The provincial Government stakeholders have noted the lack of coordination in
UN work at the field level. The degree of field presence of different UN agencies varies with
some agencies using CSOs. When CSOs implement activities, they are unable to coordinate
inter-agency work as CSO's mandate is very limited. This is a complex issue that needs careful
thought.
(c) Equity and Gender Equality
UNICEF programmes are expected to apply its equity and gender strategies across
programmes.
Addressing Disabilities
The concepts such as “leave no one behind” and “reaching the most vulnerable” are UNICEF's
approaches to address disabilities. The United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy160 post-
dates the development of the Country Programme. There are a few interventions in different
lifecycle stages addressing disabilities; whilst the programme staff are mindful of the need,
paucity of funds for mainstream work has not allowed the development of comprehensive
disability-specific components. The attention to disabilities in some components (e.g. WASH
and DRR) is more prominent than in the others. The need for developing special educational
programmes for disabled is a need of GoSL, although its own attention is not explicitly
demonstrated. Addressing issues of disability is multi-sectoral with each lifecycle stage having
specific needs.
Gender Equality
UNICEF’s commitment to an equal future for all girls and boys recognizes that promoting
gender equality and the empowerment of women is not only crucial, but necessary.
The programme focus is on gender-based violence and identifying and addressing the
bottlenecks in achieving gender equality in both regular and emergency settings, in line with
the road map for promoting gender equality in the draft UNICEF Gender Action Plan, 2018-
159 See evaluation reports the Projects, Catalytic Support to Peace building in Sri Lanka (Sept, 2019) and Promoting
Reconciliation in Sri Lanka (November, 2020).
160 UN Disability Inclusion Strategy (2018)
69
2021 161 , 162 . Additionally, strengthening of national and sub-national data systems,
disaggregated to show inequities and gender differences, particularly in relation to monitoring
of progress towards Sustainable Development Goal indicators, is considered important for
social policy and child-rights monitoring programmes. Analysis of results is expected to
highlight the specific needs of both girls and boys.
The CPD notes that while gender parity was achieved in many indicators for children,
“disparities emerge during adolescence and adulthood”. Subsequent annual reports note that
in education, there are wide gender disparities in learning outcomes as children become
adolescents.
Gender in the Situation Analysis163 and CPD
The Situation Analysis preceding the country programme identified several areas of concern,
including inter alia:
• Gender norms that reinforce systemic social discrimination against girls and women
pose a threat to children’s rights.
• Despite successes in improving girls and young women’s participation, the education
system reproduces gender stereotypes.
• The internalization of gendered stereotypes influences girls’ choices in terms of
vocational training and higher education.
• The low level of participation of girls and women in the labour force suggests broad
societal discrimination.
• Stakeholders reported increased violence as a consequence of conflict and disaster,
and that internally displaced women and children, women-headed households, and
women and children in estate sector were particularly vulnerable.
The situation analysis recommended that violence against girls and women (physical, sexual
and social) must be systematically addressed at all levels.
Gender in programme implementation
Review of documents and consultation for this evaluation note that application of UNICEF's
Gender Action Plan across the programmes is uneven.
In the nutrition status of children under 5 years, there is no significant gender difference in the
prevalence of undernutrition in terms of stunting and wasting, with slightly higher prevalence
observe in male children164. Birth weight of an infant is a crucial indicator of mother’s and
infant’s nutrition status and is therefore a determinant of healthy future generation. Although
the proportion of pregnant mothers with low BMI on or before 12 weeks of gestation has
reduced over time, the low birth weight remained almost static from 2015-2020 at about 12%
among registered infants (Fig. 3.11)165. These features point to a gender issue in nutrition.

In social cohesion and bullying in schools, there is no specific reference to gender inequality
and social exclusion especially with reference to those of non-binary gender identities and
other excluded groups such as children with disabilities, and 'poor social class'166.
In projects, it would appear that a 'gender lens' has not been consistently used during
implementation and reporting167. This is also partly attributed to the limited understanding of
gender equality programming and monitoring of the implementing partners, and their lack of
appreciation on the need for monitoring and reviewing of projects using the inclusive gender
lens.
The annual reports have limited information about relevant achievements. One exception is
the study on ragging and SGBV in the Universities; however, this study has been much delayed
due to GoSL administrative changes, and it is too early to comment on the outcomes. The
measurement of multi-dimensional child poverty is expected to include gender dimensions.
In terms of responding to the needs set out in the situation analysis, the coverage is uneven,
looking at the focus areas for the evaluation as above. There are other achievements outside
the focus areas, including:
• To prevent gender-based violence in both regular and emergency settings, UNICEF SLCO
supported capacity development of child protection staff (CRPOs, CPOs and Probation
Officers) to integrate a gender perspective into their work, which contributed to increased
reporting of GBV cases. There is evidence of knowledge transfer by trained staff to
adolescents in selected areas; however there is no assessment whether knowledge
dissemination served to change power relations and identified gender issues at household
and community level.
• UNICEF SLCO provided technical support to MoE to improve menstrual hygiene
management (MHM) and develop gender sensitive plans for school sanitation systems
together with provision of safe disposal system for sanitary napkins. Efforts have also been
166 See: Report on the Terminal Evaluation of the Project, Peacebuilding in Sri Lanka (2021); UNICEF
167 Ibid
71
made to provide gender responsive WASH facilities in schools and health institutions.
MHM required stronger investments in positive changes in children and the communities
they live in and address negative social norms and harmful practices such as restricting
toilet use for women during menstruation. This includes sensitization of adolescent boys
through their participation in awareness campaigns.
The first annual report of the country programme noted as a lesson learned that more focus
should be placed in coming years on mainstreaming gender and disability in all outcomes. The
reviewed reports and consultations do not bring out any significant shift in the approach to
these issues.
Although UNICEF Gender Guidelines require disaggregated data to show inequities and
gender differences, this is not evident in programme implementation. The shortcoming of not
providing disaggregated data by UNICEF SLCO is also highlighted in an ongoing study by
UNICEF ROSA168. In the Perception Survey 31% of the respondents have expressed their
dissatisfaction on the non-availability of sex-disaggregated data.
COVID-19 and Gender
A recent study has shown the likelihood of COVID-19 exacerbating existing inequalities such
as disparities in income due to lockdowns and economic downturns, differences in boys’ and
girls’ access to technology, potentially impacting on access to resources169. The travel
restrictions, limitations and lockdowns have added to existing burdens and risk factors for
violence and abuse, by increased loss of livelihood combined with closed schools and seclusion
of families. Beyond the above study, discussions around these issues and the potential need
to tweak interventions to fit with changed parameters appear limited.
Stakeholder perceptions of Gender Equity in UNICEF programming
As shown in Fig. 3.13, most respondents rated UNICEF work on gender equity as moderately
satisfactory/satisfactory. However, areas of concern where over 20% have rated UNICEF's work
unsatisfactory are: policies to protect gender parity, contribution to gender budgeting,
creating awareness on social change, sex-disaggregated data collection, and UNICEF
facilitating an enabling environment for gender equity in programming in partners.

3.5 Adoption of the Lifecycle Approach
This section focuses on the lifecycle approach that was introduced with the 2018-2022 Country
Programme.
Rationale and vision
Traditionally, UNICEF Sri Lanka country programme has been designed around sectoral pillars,
with separate targets based on sectoral needs, capacity, and partnerships. With the 2018-2022
CP, UNICEF SLCO decided to change from a sectoral design to a lifecycle-based approach. Key
achievements of the country programme were phrased around three lifecycle stages: early
childhood, middle childhood and adolescence, where different sectors would come together
to deliver results for children at each stage of life.
The main rationale was the desire to create a more child-oriented focus, reflecting children’s
reality of multiple, overlapping rights deprivations rather than a sector-specific view. In a
traditional, sector-based country programme, sections are often targeting the same children,
but each only looking at their own thematic domain. The CPD notes that lessons learned from
the previous country programme highlighted “the need to invest in an integrated, child-centred
approach that maximizes synergies and results for the most disadvantaged”170. Consultations
with former and current staff confirmed this; there was a felt need to recognize that in practice
different thematic sections target the same children, and to focus more on services coming
together to serve children, particularly as the country programme also included a shift towards
a system-strengthening focus. The country programme was also transitioning to working with
170 UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Programme Document 2018-2022.
73
less resources171 after the conflict and immediate post-conflict years, and the lifecycle
approach was thought to be potentially a more effective way of working. There was also a
recognition of the need to ensure better, more strategic and systematic collaboration between
sections, as “an integrated outcome forces sections to come together”.
In designing the country programme, country office management maintained regular contact
with other offices in the region who were at the same planning stage. There was an initial
process led by UNICEF ROSA to facilitate country-to-country learning during the CPD planning
process, but beyond that continued sharing and learning was made possible by informal and
more personal networks. The CO also had close contact particularly with Bangladesh, a CO
that was one year into its lifecycle-based country programme and thus had valuable
experience to share. Important lessons were learned from this, including the difficulty with
creating lifecycle-based outputs. As a result, the Sri Lanka CO did not attempt this, but instead
kept standard, sectoral outputs, and only phrased the outcomes using a lifecycle model (the
actual indicators for the outcomes are still sectoral). In practice, the results at outcome level
are highly narrative, a conglomerate of outcome indicators from several sectors. This structure
allowed more flexibility towards aligning with internal reporting on UNICEF's own strategic
plan as well as with government structures which were known to be largely sectoral.
According to the stakeholders consulted, there was broad support among staff for this
approach during the design phase of the country programme; the basis for implementation
was good. The planning also seems to have been careful in ensuring that lessons learned by
others were taken into consideration, likely making the transition less tumultuous than what it
could have been.
Implementation and challenges
The country office maintained its operational structure, hence it continued to be divided into
thematic sections, each led by a section chief. The lifecycle orientation is largely implemented
through outcome working groups, one for each of the three lifecycle stages. Each group is led
by an “outcome lead”, chief of one of the sections being part of the programme delivery for
that age group (early childhood: Child survival and development; middle childhood: Education;
adolescence: Child protection). The outcome leads are responsible for monthly coordination
meetings where all relevant sections participate.
Some sections have found the approach more operationable than others. This is generally
where there is some concurrence with government structures, or where the construct of the
issues/deprivations is related to age. The evaluation found that this is the case particularly for
health, where many interventions and indicators focus on children <5 y and where GoSL also
has a multi-sectoral working approach.
The numerous challenges in implementation/operationalization of the lifecycle approach
voiced during the evaluation are summarized below. Views expressed are primarily those of
current and former staff, though some external informants who were aware of the approach
implemented in UNICEF SLCO also added to the analysis on some points. The outcome group
meetings are felt somewhat artificial – coming at a set time and not necessarily when there is
171 Sri Lanka became a Lower Middle-Income Country in 1997 – thus opportunities for donor funding reduced.
74
a need. The organization of these meetings was at times described like forced collaboration
out of synchronization with the real needs at hand172.
In practice the approach has required spreading already limited human resources very thin.
Many sectors are relevant for all lifecycle stages, and thus requires the limited programme staff
to take part in several different outcome level groups; some stating “it doubled our work”.
Each sectoral area is in itself affected by other sectors – for example, nutrition is in itself a
multi-sectoral issue. When child protection and early childhood is added to that mix, the
outlook becomes even broader, and there is a felt loss of specificity that contrasts with the
desire for technical, specific, and targeted programming for better results.
Some issues do not have a natural home in any of the lifecycle stages and including them
arbitrarily here or there can affect impact negatively: For example, placing climate change
in middle childhood when adolescents are perhaps the ones who can really raise their voice.
Similarly with participation being pegged to adolescence, when it is also very much a middle
childhood issue. Child-centered DRR is in principle cross-cutting but was placed under middle
childhood as that was where WASH outputs were most prominent.
Some sectors are highly specialized, in addition to having no meaningful relation with
lifecycle stages. Child protection and WASH are good examples of this, where each lifecycle
stage is equally affected, and it becomes artificial and confusing to divide the work to fit age
groups. The issue of staff time becomes even more critical, as the need to participate in several
outcome groups can affect several technical areas/programme staff within the same section
(for example drinking water and sanitation in WASH, or violence against children and
alternative care in child protection).
The Government is the main counterpart of UNICEF SLCO and follows a largely sectoral
structure. Hence, annual workplans that require government signature had to be made by
sector. Government budget lines are also by sector, which has limited the added value of this
approach vis-à-vis Government. The envisaged increase in collaboration across ministries was
found to be difficult to facilitate.
Donors are looking to fund thematic issues, not age groups, and the approach has not had
any added value for resource mobilization.
With each thematic area split into several life stages in Vision, the internal management
information system, it has become more difficult for section chiefs to use this tool for
implementation monitoring. The lifecycle approach has also caused complications with
regard to accounting.
Indicators at both output and outcome levels are sector-based, but the outcome result
statement requires a narrative story that weaves these indicators together. This is challenging,
and a largely desk-based exercise, to show how results come together to create change
for a certain age group.
Within UNICEF SLCO, there is a push to use standardized indicators, and conditions for
developing new indicators at country level are very strict. Standardized indicators align with
172 In spite of the array of internal meetings, the external stakeholders felt that there is lack of coordination within
UNICE SLCO
75
UNICEFs Strategic Plan and SDGs, which are all sector-based. There is a mismatch between
the lifecycle approach and internal reporting standards.
Effect of the lifecycle approach on internal collaboration and coherence, and results
achievement
One of the key underlying drivers of the lifecycle approach is its promise of increasing internal
cooperation. Views on whether this has occurred during the current programme cycle are
mixed, the majority questioned whether the old, more natural way of collaborating was more
efficient than the mandatory meeting structures that came with the lifecycle approach. There
are few indications of any real difference in “getting the job done” – none felt that their
approach to work had changed. Some also pointed out that having an outcome lead from a
particular section can limit the space for other sectors to actively participate. This could
undermine internal collaboration, while on the surface appear as a more collaborative
approach. In terms of coherence among sections, most support the view that the necessary
collaboration does occur, on an on-need basis, regardless of the lifecycle approach. Field
offices do not appear to be well integrated into the lifecycle approach and the staff were not
particularly enthusiastic about the approach, and it does not seem to have increased central
office – field office collaboration.
In terms of coherence with national priorities, the potential
It is the issue that brings us for the lifecycle approach to have an effect is limited by the
together – not the fact that GoSL structures are largely sectoral. An exception is
compulsory meetings. health, as noted above; however, the evaluation did not
uncover evidence of this playing a part to increase
UNICEF SLCO Staff member
coherence. Many government partners interviewed for the
evaluation were unaware of UNICEF's lifecycle approach. All
other partners interviewed, whether UN agencies or I/NGOs, worked according to a sectoral
approach. Some were aware of UNICEFs lifecycle approach, but it did not seem to be of any
consequence to their collaboration; it was often seen as an internal process within UNICEF
SLCO.
In general, the approach is not seen to have affected results achievement significantly. There
is a very limited number of positive, concrete outcomes (one example that was mentioned was
broadening of the government focus from ECE to the more holistic ECD, though that is still
within one sectoral area of programming). While outcome leads have accountability for results
achievement, they have limited control or influence over other sections contributing to the
same outcome. The operational structure does not match the programme structure, and this
mismatch was voiced during the evaluation173. Some also stated that the “lifecycle does not fit
at all for the country programme”, referring to the emphasis placed on upstream/leveraging
processes (which are largely controlled by a sector-oriented government) versus a more
service-delivery oriented country programme (where UNICEF SLCO holds more control over
results).
Overall Analysis on the Lifecycle Approach
There is still broad agreement that the theory behind this approach, a child-centered/holistic
way of delivering results, makes much sense and is desirable (also among some external
173 KII with UNICEF staff.
76
partners, though the definition of lifecycle is not necessarily the same as that of SLCO). Staff
feel it is a 'beautiful idea', that 'makes analytically a lot of sense', and that “this is how we would
like the world to be”.
However, there is little support from staff for continuing the lifecycle approach in the next
country programme: The negative effects of implementation are felt very strongly, while the
positive outcomes are minimal. Any value added is limited to very few instances.
Not much advice was offered in terms of how it could be improved/amended to work better.
The only proposal was to have informal lifecycle groups, where staff from different sections
could meet as needed, on an ad hoc basis and not mandatory as they are now. However, some
also warn that there are already too many internal cross-cutting working groups, which
overburdens sections in a small office. Both the lifecycle meetings as well as the various
working groups appear to mostly involve staff in Colombo and less so the field offices. With
relation to internal cooperation, it could be noted that UNICEF is globally implementing the
“Matrix Management”, creating linkages and reporting structures that reflect that one person’s
work impacts other sectors, field offices and so on – beyond the traditional reporting structure.
Sri Lanka started implementing this in 2020 and was among the first to test it in the region. It
is still in its early phase, having reached its full shape in early 2021.
77
4. Conclusions
This section summarises the main findings of the CPE and are presented according to the main
evaluation criteria174.
Relevance
The overall relevance of the programme in relation to nutrition, child protection, education
Disaster Risk Reduction and Social Policy and Social Protection is high, with clear alignment to
the stated policies, programmes and strategies of GoSL and other international covenants.
These have been, by and large, identified as priority programme areas in the Situation Analysis
of 2017; however, the work programme has been limited due to fund limitations. The CPE also
noted extensive stakeholder engagement in designing the programme.
Analysis of the Theories of Change indicated a gap between outputs and very high-level
outcome variables, all at national level. Furthermore, since the CP has several initiatives aimed
at developing policies and strategies which are yet to be fully operationalised, the expected
outcome indicators are unlikely to be demonstrated in the near future. National indicators are
more apt for service delivery (rather than upstream) and large funded situations. A more
meaningful indicators are needed at the outcome level, particularly as data are not available
on many national indicators. Nonetheless, the evaluation noted the relevance at output level;
yet the interventions are spread and small and the results depend on the uptake by the
Government to become relevant.
The CP actions support the realisation of Sri Lanka's Sustainable Development Goals, with
particular reference to early childhood and social policy.
UNICEF SLCO is positioned as an important partner in child protection and education with
UNICEF being the main organisation for child protection. In health and nutrition, there are
other competing UN Agencies able to invest more with GoSL. Although UNICEF is well known
for children's nutrition, this position is not well demonstrated in GoSL quarters.
During the current programme cycle, the CP faced three main external shocks, the change of
Government, Easter Sunday attack, followed by COVID-19 pandemic. All three events
contributed to major economic downturns and on people's lives. UNICEF SLCO took mitigatory
actions, within the available resources to overcome some of these; nonetheless, the latter two
events significantly affected programme delivery.
The consultations also identified a number of areas which could be considered for increased
efforts.
UNICEF SLCO is currently engaged in Northern and Eastern Provinces, and in Uva and Central
Provinces with a very limited portfolio.
174 Relevance, Effectiveness, Coherence and Lifecycle approach
78
Effectiveness
The CPE assessment focussed on selected outputs. Overall, COVID-19 affected programme
delivery particularly in child protection and education work. Effectiveness of nutrition
programmes was hampered due to lack of coordination due to GoSL's lack of interest in the
National Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Action Plan. The need for more focussed approach of
providing customised packages depending on the nutritional situation of smaller geographic
regions is indicated. Overall, GoSL is unable to show adequate progress in some of the key
child nutrition indicators in spite of long-term interventions by donors and GoSL.
In Child Protection, effectiveness of interventions is hampered by loss of interest in the
national partnership, inadequate coordination among government agencies as well as
organizations, and delays in implementation. The PATHS programme was launched in a district
in the Northern Province, but its piloting has been delayed owing to COVID-19 related issues.
It is difficult to assess whether UNICEF SLCO's limited interventions could make a difference in
national indicators on reduction of VAC.
In Education, work on social cohesion is appreciated by MoE; however, an impact can only be
assessed when the overall curriculum revisions are completed and adopted by MoE in 2023/24.
Work on positive disciplining has progressed in 2021, and the resource package is expected
to be rolled out in 2022. Work on ragging and SGBV in the Universities is inordinately delayed
due to changes in management at the University Grant Commission.
The Child-Centred Disaster Risk Reduction Programme, although in nascent stage, is well
received by the GoSL authorities as well as provincial administration. Although there is scope
for better coordination amongst GoSL agencies, there are positive developments in the
provinces by allocating funds for CC-DRR work. Similarly, School Safety Guidelines have been
incorporated into the school system.
Work on Social Policy and Social Protection is affected due to a number of reasons. The
National Monitoring Committee to monitor child rights was established but is dysfunctional.
The work on Multi-dimensional Poverty Index is ongoing; work on the National Evaluation
Policy and supporting the development of evaluation capacity within the country have
progressed. Interventions on influencing GoSL budget allocations to address child poverty
reduction are yet to be fully recognised; additional allocations for poorer children is perhaps
not focussed by GoSL in the current economic crisis. Similarly, public spending on education
and health too has not increased due to the same reason. Citizen' budget has been
implemented in the Eastern Province and is appreciated by the provincial authorities. It is likely
to be replicated in the Northern Province.
In general, implementation is affected by delays in delivery, during the pre-COVID-19 period
(2018-19 workplan) exacerbated by COVID-19 pandemic. This is likely to continue in the
current workplan period as well.
The programme results, even under better performance, is unlikely to show impacts in the
current situation of using key national indicators in the Theories of Change. These indicators
are long-term and UNICEF SLCO's interventions are unlikely to be fully reflected in changing
the indicators.
In regard to the Country Office Structure and capacity, the CPE notes that the country office
capacity is more aligned to the service delivery mode, applied by UNICEF SLCO in its previous
79
programme cycle. The transition to upstream policy dialogue and advocacy requires a different
set of skills, which is not evident in some of the thematic areas. Whilst the sectoral approach
has been the traditional approach of engaging with GoSL, reaching beyond the sectoral
approach to embrace children's health, safety, and wellbeing to show children as the nation's
wealth has not been communicated well to GoSL.
In spite of numerous working groups and meetings within UNICEF SLCO, internal collaboration
amongst the Sections is seen weak by external stakeholders, both GoSL senior managers and
Civil Society.
The two Zonal Offices of Northern and Eastern Provinces as well as the outposted office in Uva
work very closely with the provincial administration in identifying provincial priorities and
working as a conduit between the UNICEF SLCO and the provincial administration. They are
considered trusted partners and appreciated for their contributions by the provincial
authorities.
A major constraint for effective implementation of the programme has been funding. The CP
was launched with an indicative budget of USD 57,235,000 made up of USD 4,735,000 CR and
USD 52,500,000 OR funding with the largest allocation (29%) for early childhood. At the end
of the third year, the country office received about 45% of the original budget. The shortfall in
funding (≈ USD 20 million) is reflected in the curtailed implementation of the programme.
Since much of this work has used OR funding, the programme is largely driven by donor funds.
On knowledge products and outreach, GoSL values to knowledge products; nonetheless,
the CPE found the need for rigorous quality assurance of technical publications to ensure that
they conform to the accepted UNICEF standards. Improving partners' knowledge on the
UNICEF SLCO programmes is another area which could contribute to improving effectiveness.
UNICEF SLCO relies on partnerships for programme delivery. GoSL agencies are the main
implementing partners, and their capacity was found to be adequate to fulfil their tasks. The
long-standing partnerships with GoSL agencies have contributed towards the development of
capacity of GoSL agencies. In general, CSOs have positively contributed towards implementing
programmes, and have often provided feedback from the field, aside from contributing with
their own expertise. There are a few CSOs who lack in-house capacity to deliver the
programme, indicating the need for a more strategic approach in selecting CSO partners. The
engagement with the Private Sector is at early stage, and their contribution thus far towards
programme delivery is small. The effectiveness of private sector engagement needs specific
approaches to engage them in line with business practices, branding, and choice of
interventions which fit their business model. UNICEF SLCO is in the process of finalising
Guidelines to engage with the private sector; UNICEF already has guidelines on due diligence,
and these are good entry points to strategise private sector engagement in the future.
A number of key assumptions in the Country Programme have not materialised and will
remain challenges to the new country programme. These include: active support from GoSL,
proper data management, establishing coordination mechanisms, restricted GoSL allocations
due to economic difficulties, and funding for UN agencies.
Overall, effectiveness is hampered largely by shortage of funds, limited engagement by GoSL,
and the country office structure which is not congruent with the Lifecycle approach. These are
important considerations for the next programme cycle.
80
Coherence
The current country programme focusses on more upstream policy and advocacy work,
which take time to show results, especially in the Sri Lankan context where translation of policy
to action is often weak. The work in Social Policy, though relevant, has not shown the expected
fit, primarily as a result of external adverse situations such as the deteriorating economic
situation in the country, as already noted by UNICEF SLCO in its PSN notes.
Equity and Gender -In disability, application of the disability principles across the programme
is minimal. In nutrition status of children under 5 y, there is no significant gender difference in
the prevalence of undernutrition in terms of stunting and wasting. In social cohesion and
bullying, there is no specific reference to gender inequality. UNICEF SLCO has not consistently
used a 'gender lens' or in implementing projects due to limited understanding of gender
equality in programming and monitoring of projects. UNICEF SLCO supported MoE on
menstrual hygiene management in schools. UNICEF SLCO also did not consistently collect sex-
disaggregated data in programme implementation.
Joint programming with other UN Agencies has not been coherent. The CPE examined two
such joint programmes, and their implementation has been far from expectations, primarily
due to low level of coordination between agencies, lack of overall leadership for accountability,
and non-synchronisation of pace of work by the respective agencies. These joint programmes
have not demonstrated the spirit of UN Joint Programming.
Lifecycle Approach
The Lifecycle Approach has not taken root in UNICEF SLCO and has not been effective. There
is a misalignment with the operational structure of the Sri Lanka office and GoSL sector
structures. Staff face many challenges with regard to LCA; however as poor internal
coordination is noted by many partners, it will be important to develop alternative means or
refining the current approaches to improve performance. Adoption of lifecycle approach has
overstretched staff, is creating confusion amongst them or arbitrary delineations, caused
problematic results measurements, too much meeting time and so on. The Zonal Offices have
not embraced this approach, which would appear to be a blind spot for internal coherence. It
is also noted that in a small office like UNICEF SLCO with funding and staff limitations, every
issue cannot be represented at every lifecycle stage. Whilst Lifecycle approach is deemed
inoperable in the next programme cycle, the need for a more coherent inter-thematic
coordination mechanism(s) is strongly indicated.
Concluding analysis
The outcomes of the evaluation provide important insights into the country programme.
The current programme is quite ambitious with an expectation of 92% of the funds from
external donors. These funds have not realised to the expected level causing the programme
to limit its operations and interventions. The Country Office faced challenges in implementing
the funded activities because of external shocks, the change of the Government during this
programme cycle, Easter Sunday attack, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
81
A more limited programme based on funding availability would have provided an opportunity
to demonstrate its effectiveness more positively. The limitations in the current programme do
not provide adequate impetus to make changes in the national indicators of child wellbeing.
The evaluation also noted a number of areas which could be considered for increased effort,
and the Country Office could consider these together with the findings of the ongoing SitAn
in formulating the new country programme.
The current approach to work in the policy arena, whilst very pertinent, has brought out
challenges due to government's pace of work in policies. Currently, there is a mix of policy and
service delivery interventions and future programming strategies require cognisance of the
ever-present challenges. Additionally, the working structure in the Country Office is not
congruent with the Government structures to demonstrate the full effects of the Country Office
work.
82
5. Lessons learnt
The positive and negative lessons summarised below are generated from the analysis of
evidence gathered during the CPE and information obtained from the desk review. They should
be read together with the recommendations when developing the next programme cycle.
1. The Theories of Change are not realistic, not quite contextual, and are not positioned
to show changes that are needed. In formulating Theories of Change for the next
programme cycle, UNICE SLCO can use learnings from the current ToCs to determine more
meaningful indicators to demonstrate results. The current programme cycle will show at
the end of its term that interventions on policy formulation and strategic plans have not
contributed to the indicators to the level expected because policies, strategies and action
plans are implemented by GoSL where UNICEF SLCO has minimal influence. These
experiences should be considered when formulating the next ToCs.
2. Over-ambitious programme. UNICEF SLCO undertakes a situation analysis before each
programme cycle; however, in the current cycle, UNICEF SLCO has not been able to
undertake some of the priority areas due to funding constraints. Specifically, the
prioritization process that occurs between the SitAn needs and the CPD commitments is
not clear to external stakeholders and even internally. Over-ambitious programmes and
limited implementation due to fund constraints generate wrong signals in GoSL and NGO
partners. Lessons from the current programme design would be useful for the next
programme design, as well as for UNICEF ROSA as a matter of guidance in programme
design in other countries.
3. The Child-Centred Disaster Risk Reduction work has been embraced by the provincial
authorities. Although the CPE found certain shortcomings in GoSL inter-agency
coordination, this work has created enthusiasm all-round. The CPE found the approaches
adopted by UNICEF SLCO to transfer the CC-DDR knowledge with frequent meetings and
first-hand sharing of knowledge has been effective, particularly with GoSL, and would
provide lessons for adoption in other programmes as well.
4. Applying 'disability lens' and 'gender lens' in programme implementation. UNICEF
SLCO has not consistently used the disability and gender lenses for programme
implementation, partly due to inadequate understanding by implementing partners. These
experiences would help UNICEF SLCO to focus on key aspects of application of equity and
gender equality criteria in project implementation, including developing the capacity of
implementing partners.
5. The UN Joint Programming assessed during the CPE does not demonstrate that the
agencies have understood the spirit of UN Joint Programming. Any future inter agency
UN programmes and projects can take lessons from the previous programmes to
strengthen joint planning and joint ownership to better implement the projects and to
enable harnessing of strengths in individual agencies to maximise results. These lessons
are also applicable to other UN agencies who are involved in joint programming to
improve design and implementation of joint programmes in the future.
6. Some of the implementing CSO partners who have had long-standing engagement
with UNICEF SLCO have added value to the programme and new CSOs have brought
in fresh outlokk. They are in sync with UNICEF philosophies because of their long-term
partnerships and have proven to be useful sources safeguarding children’s lives as trusted
83
partners on the ground and providing feedback from the provinces, Such attributes may
be used in the future to strategically select CSOs for implementation. On the other hand,
there are new CSOs engaged by UNICEF SLCO who have brought fresh insights to
programme implementation. Both these perspectives provide lessons for selecting CSOs.
84
6. Recommendations
The following recommendations are presented, based on the analysis of data and information
generated during the CPE for consideration in the new programme cycle. Many of the
recommendations were developed during consultations with the stakeholders where
consensus was built. The recommendations were presented to the UNCEF SLCO Senior
Management for validation.
Programme Strategy and Design
Recommendation 1: Given limitations of funding, the new programme cycle
should focus on actions that will demonstrate programme effectiveness with
enhanced participation of GoSL actors. As the interventions in the current cycle are
spread thinly across a broad spectrum of themes, effectiveness is not well/easily
demonstrated above the level of individual interventions. In this regard, the following
actions are proposed for the 2023-2027 programme:
• The new programme should be based on clearly identified priorities selected after
analyzing the situation of children and women, considering the work of other
donors/agencies, and the comparative advantage and position of UNICEF SLCO in Sri
Lanka. The planned programme should also be subjected to robust affordability
analysis considering the funding prospects.
• Apply a package of interventions from multiple sectors as a pilot in a smaller
geographic area (e.g. Grama Niladhari Divisions) to demonstrate results for children.
UNICEF SLCO will have more control over the actions, and therefore the results can be
attributed to actions as models for GoSL ownership. UNICEF SLCO will likely have to
establish the baselines and end-lines for the relevant geographic areas (or generate
supplementary data to what is already available at the local level). This approach could
be particularly relevant should the field presence be downscaled, to retain in a few
selected areas direct programmatic reach and connection with communities to assess
what works and not.
• Whilst the current country programme has begun to focus on upstream work, the
actual implementation is a mix of upstream and service delivery. An option for the next
country programme is to embrace a full upstream portfolio with indicators that
measure policy and advocacy rather than child wellbeing.
• In identifying provincial level priority areas of work, UNICEF SLCO should ensure to
consult the Provincial Council in order to understand the overall provincial priorities
for wellbeing of children as well as those of the Divisional Secretariat Divisions and
ensure that ethnic and religious balances envisaged by the Provincial Councils are not
disturbed in providing assistance.
Action: UNICEF SLCO with GoSL support
Recommendation 2: In regard to equity and gender equality, UNICEF SLCO
should focus on actions to comply with the minimum standards in UNICEF ROSA
strategy and those highlighted in 2017 SitAn, subject to availability of funding.
85
• In Gender, disaggregated data collection in programmatic work, and support
technology innovation to address online and cyber space issues are priorities.
• In Equity, addressing issues of children in special situations (e.g. disabled, orphaned)
is considered a felt need.
Action: UNICEF SLCO
Recommendation 3: In the new country programme, develop Theories of Change
and Result Frameworks where:
• the ToC details how the planned interventions converge to create higher level results,
avoiding the tendency in the current ToCs to list a number of activities as separate
entities under each result. This will reduce the gap seen in the current CP between
interventions at output level and very high level, ambitious national results. It will also
improve the internal consistency and elasticity of the new programme; and
• the Outcomes and Outputs are measurable considering the availability of data.
The CPE does not recommend any changes to ToCs in the current cycle as there are only
14 months left, but it recognises that many of the Outcomes are national targets that may
not either be met or reported on due to paucity of data. Given the experiences of the
current programme, it is recommended that lower-level indicators be established in the
new programme for improved internal programme review and accountability.
Recommendation 4: In the new programme, UNICEF SLCO may consider the
following changes to thematic focus areas and interventions:
• Provide more attention to nutrition and formulate area-based/community-based
nutrition regimes developed specifically considering the situation of the geographic
areas under consideration, which are likely to be sustainable because of GoSL's
agreement;
• Before the launch of the new programme, the responsibility for CRC work should be
transferred to the Child Protection Section from the Social Policy Section;
• Protection work in Education has to be undertaken collaboratively with Child Protection
Division;
• In the new country programme, consider areas needing further attention and new areas
of work for UNICEF SLCO as suggested by stakeholders during the CPE, which are
presented in the End Note of this Chapter. A Situation Analysis is currently ongoing
with broad stakeholder participation. The SitAn 2021 will present a broad assessment
of the situation of children and women and form the basis for prioritization of key areas
of work for the next cycle, likely also giving due consideration to post-COVID-19
developments. The suggestions in the End Note are provided as a supplement to the
SitAn.
In the new programme, the proposed activities should be fully discussed with the GoSL
partners, including provincial administration, before workplans are prepared.
Action (3 & 4): UNICEF SLCO with GoSL support
86
Programme Delivery
Recommendation 5: Before the launch of the new programme, discontinue the
lifecycle approach in its current form. UNICEF SLCO may consider other options as
follows:
• Map the current cross-cutting working groups to better understand their roles and
responsibilities, time required and the value addition by having these structures, and
reform them as needed to ensure internal collaboration.
• Introduce informal, non-mandatory working groups, that would facilitate increased
internal collaboration.
Recommendation 6: Before the launch of the new programme, reprofile/reskill
the staff competences for upstream policy dialogue and advocacy to enable high-
level engagement with GoSL. Staff competency for service delivery mode is felt adequate
but there is a need for reskilling some staff for upstream policy dialogue and engagement
with GoSL.
Recommendation 7: The Zonal Offices (Kilinochchi and Batticaloa) and the
Outpost Office (Uva) should continue until the completion of the current programme
cycle. However, their scope of work, staffing, and operations should be revisited once the
new programme priorities and funding opportunities are determined in the new cycle. The
outpost office in Uva will have to upgraded if the new programme in that Province is
expanded to other thematic areas.
Action (5, 6, & 7): UNICEF SLCO
Recommendation 8: The current partnerships and internal arrangements should
be critically reviewed to optimise delivery of the CP. In this regard, the following are
suggested:
• Review the selection criteria for identifying implementing CSO partners to ensure that
they have the requisite competencies and local-level experience to implement the
programme, and who are congruent with UNICEF values and are able to bring added
value to the programme;
• Review, together with other partner UN agencies, the delivery of completed UN Joint
Programmes implemented by UNICEF SLCO with a view to introduce tools and
mechanisms to improve delivery of Joint Programmes to truly reflect the spirit of joint
programming and modalities of UN New Way of Working. It is to be noted that the
UNSDF 2018-22 which parallels the current UNICEF SLCO programme cycle, would
benefit from joint work to demonstrate the inter-linkages between the SDGs and cross-
cutting issues of human rights, gender, social protection, social cohesion and youth. .
• Ensure regular dialogue with GoSL partners to strengthen partnerships, particularly
when dealing with policy and strategic matters. Engagement with the Ministry of
Health (for health and nutrition) has to be strengthened by engaging with all relevant
divisions in the Ministry; given the comparative strength of other UN agencies and
international organisations in social policy/protection, UNICEF SLCO may consider
partnering with such organisations in working with the National Planning Department.
87
Action: UNICEF SLCO (and UNCO/UNDP/WHO/UN Habitat for Joint Programming)
Recommendation 9: Improve the reporting and monitoring practices in RAM
(and elsewhere) towards better consistency and ease in tracking progress.
• Ensure narrative reporting in the Country Office Annual Reports and reporting in RAM
is consistent, repeatedly reporting on the relevant indicator, including where there is a
reversal of progress or where achievements noted in reports of earlier years have been
rendered less valuable for the Outcome by new developments in the country or other
external events.
• Considering the complexity of the monitoring and reporting system and particularly
the accessibility of RAM, it is recommended that UNICEF SLCO keep developing the
current internal tracking tools for progress on indicators, possibly also including
milestones for early detection of implementation delays (if not available already). This
should be an active tool for thematic sections in addition to Planning.
• UNICEF SLCO should examine the overall results of the national evaluation capacity
building supported by it.
Action: UNICEF SLCO & UNICEF ROSA
Sharing of Results and Knowledge
Recommendation 10: UNICEF SLCO should strive to periodically inform its
implementing partners, including GoSL partners on the country programme content
and results. Such an approach will bring transparency to the work and provide a sense of
satisfaction, confidence, and trust to the implementing partners.
Action: UNICEF SLCO
