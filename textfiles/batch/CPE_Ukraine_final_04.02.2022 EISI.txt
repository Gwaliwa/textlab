Due to the unprecedented situation and the scale and nature of the crisis, UNICEF Ukraine
CO is no longer able to finalise their Evaluation Management Response. Given the urgency
and scale of needs, and considering the complexity of the crisis, UNICEF Evaluation
Director has lifted the requirement for the Ukraine Country Office to provide
Management Responses within 60 days as required by the Evaluation Policy. The Country
Office can file Management Responses once there are improvements in the operating
environment.

Executive summary
This report presents the findings of the evaluation of the UNICEF Ukraine Country Programme (CP) for the
period January 2018 to June 2021. It focuses on the impact, relevance, and coherence of the CP and the work
of the Country Office (CO) and its partners in fulfilling UNICEF’s six core Outcomes.
The evaluation is part of the Multi-Country Programme Evaluation, commissioned by UNICEF’s Europe and
Central Asia Regional Office, covering UNICEF programmes in Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine.
The evaluation aims to support the planning process for the next programming period.
Overview of the Country Programme 2018–2022
Between 2018 and 2021 UNICEF Ukraine supported the ambitious and wide-ranging reform agenda of the
Government elected in 2019. This support prioritized the best interests of children and protection of the
rights of children and adolescents during the period of instability in Eastern Ukraine.
The CP’s overarching goal is to reduce equity gaps and contribute to the progressive realization of the rights
of all children in Ukraine. The CP had six mutually reinforcing main Outcomes:
o Evidence-driven, integrated and equitable social protection policies, efficient financial allocations
and family-friendly local service provision are in place to address the social exclusion of children in
Ukraine.
o The most vulnerable children in Ukraine benefit from more-child-friendly and family-oriented
social welfare and justice systems.
o All children and adolescents in Ukraine, especially those disadvantaged and affected by the conflict,
have access to inclusive and quality school education and early learning.
o All children and pregnant women in Ukraine, including those living in situations of humanitarian
crisis, utilize improved quality and affordable mother and child health-care services.
o All children in conflict-affected settings have access to safe drinking water and reduced exposure to
any environmental risks.
o The rights of children in Ukraine are effectively monitored and clear mechanisms for accountability
are established through a child-rights monitoring system.
In addition, the CP introduced several outputs and planned activities in 2020, to ensure a swift and sensitive
response to the emerging urgent needs of children during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Purpose of the evaluation and its audiences
This strategic evaluation covers the whole CP and complements sectoral evaluations and specialized studies
carried out in the past five years. The evaluation aims to strengthen UNICEF’s accountability to national
stakeholders by evaluating its contribution to results at scale for children, particularly those most
vulnerable. The evaluation also assesses the implementation of the change strategies applied, thereby
assisting the development of the next UNICEF Country Programme Document (CPD).
The primary users of this CP evaluation are the UNICEF Country and Regional Offices. Secondary users are
the Government of Ukraine, UN agencies, development partners with a presence in Ukraine, and civil society
organizations (CSOs).
Evaluation context
Since 2014, Ukraine has experienced acute political, security, and economic challenges. The ongoing armed
conflict in Eastern Ukraine has been a major crisis for national security, as well as for the safety of children
and families in the country. It also affects access to public services, including water and sanitation. In
addition, Ukraine has been one of Europe’s most severely affected countries by the COVID-19 pandemic. In
the third year of the programme, the pandemic crisis posed another major challenge to the UNICEF CO and
to the CPD and the interventions envisaged had to be adjusted to react rapidly to the new needs of children,
parents and relevant institutions in the country.
4
Before 2017, Ukraine had embarked on a set of far-reaching reforms in all areas previously addressed by
UNICEF. The political and institutional instability, particularly in 2019, disrupted these significant and
sustained efforts in conducting reforms. The COVID-19 pandemic added complexity to the context, leaving
the most vulnerable of Ukraine’s 8 million children in dire need of urgent, strategic support. Supporting
these children was often complicated by geographic barriers, as the children may be displaced due to
conflict, live in conflict areas, in rural areas, or in institutions for children with disabilities.
Evaluation methodology
The Terms of Reference of the evaluation proposed a theory-based approach, based on the CP Theory of
Change developed by the UNICEF CO in Ukraine. The evaluation questions are structured around the OECD
DAC1 criteria of relevance, coherence and impact. To provide lessons learned on UNICEF practices and
strategies in achieving impact for children at scale, a more in-depth impact assessment has been undertaken
for three selected areas: (1) immunization, (2) youth empowerment and participation, and (3) justice for
children. Other evaluation methods utilized for the evaluation include a stakeholder analysis and a social
network analysis.
Data collection methods were mainly qualitative, including a wide-ranging document review and 30 key
informant interviews at national and local levels. The key informants included workers at UNICEF,
government entities at multiple levels, UN and other development agencies, and CSOs (UNICEF’s
implementing partners). In addition, UNICEF CO staff completed a questionnaire for the social network
analysis.
The evaluation methodology fully considered ethical considerations and the obligations of evaluators.
Interview respondents were assured confidentiality, with appropriate safeguards in place for all
participants in focus groups, including young people. Child rights, equity and gender were key issues
throughout the evaluation.
Key findings
Relevance
The CP and activities implemented by UNICEF Ukraine were aligned to national and local priorities. UNICEF
Ukraine took into consideration the needs of vulnerable children, as planned and indicated in the CP. It
focused primarily on children in conflict areas, children with disabilities, children without parental care,
children in contact with the law, and displaced or most-at-risk adolescents.
UNICEF Ukraine reacted rapidly to the COVID-19 crisis and successfully mobilized support for the national
government’s response to crisis-related demands. This resulted in effective funding for many regions
despite the difficulty of creating a regionally-equitable plan during the COVID-19 outbreak. The
effectiveness of the UNICEF Ukraine COVID-19 response was, however, affected by a large funding gap at
the time of drafting the COVID-19 response plan, resulting in the unequal availability of funds for different
regions.
Gender equality was not fully mainstreamed into UNICEF implementation work, as limited gender analysis
was available. However, UNICEF Ukraine collected gender-disaggregated data for some areas of its work
and has begun to systematize the collection of analysis of such data.
Coherence
UNICEF Ukraine aligned its programmatic activities with Agenda 2030 and with the Government of Ukraine
– United Nations Partnership Framework (UNPF).
In this context, UNICEF Ukraine built partnerships at the national level with line ministries, the
Ombudsperson’s Office and governmental institutions to advocate for systemic changes in the country. In
some areas, such as its partnership with the Ministry of Justice, UNICEF had a well-defined vision and
understanding of partnership strategies. In other areas, such as health reform, UNICEF’s role was less

clearly articulated. Nonetheless, partnerships with regional health and social care institutions were
important to UNICEF for the rapid collection of information from the field and for an effective response to
the most urgent gaps. In partnerships at regional level with city and regional authorities UNICEF is valued
for its role in bringing stakeholders together for cross-sectoral and multi-disciplinary cooperation.
Partnership with traditional and social media – complemented by innovative approaches such as online
competitions, video diaries, and engagement with bloggers – has played a crucial role in the effective
delivery of organizational global priorities and in addressing the growing need for trustworthy sources of
information during the COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF’s partnership with the private sector is more recent
and is sustained through institutional business engagements. Both UNICEF staff and their counterparts
assess UNICEF’s partnership with UN agencies as requiring further improvement.
UNICEF is acknowledged by its partners as the main player in monitoring the implementation of the
Convention of the Rights of the Child, with a clear strategy for systemic change through support for
evidence-based decision making, legislation and policy developments, and technical assistance.
Impact
UNICEF Ukraine has achieved positive results for certain vulnerable groups, such as children in conflict
areas, children living with HIV, children living in institutions, child victims of violence and Roma children.
The evaluation found that CP activities could have been better designed and implemented to meet the needs
of children in rural areas and children with disabilities and generate results for these categories. UNICEF
provided immunization and helped health facilities to maintain their services during the COVID-19 crisis. It
also helped Public Health Centres to build up an efficient COVID-19 related data management system.
UNICEF Ukraine furthered the national educational reform by improving the evidence base for decision-
making, developing a positive learning environment, and supporting both teacher training and provision of
educational supplies. At the same time, UNICEF contributed to deinstitutionalization reform by drafting a
financial framework on the ‘money follows the child’ principle and conducting an alternative care system
assessment aligned with the government’s National Plan of Action on Deinstitutionalization Reform.
Three important bottlenecks limited the CP implementation. The first is the use of state and international
resources for the humanitarian response, with limited fiscal and political space available for social-sector
reforms. The second is a lack of coherence between ongoing reforms on decentralization, on the one side
and between health, social services and education on the other. In addition, UNICEF Ukraine has had to
continuously mitigate risks related to political instability, the conflict in the east of the country and the
COVID-19 crisis.
Conclusions
UNICEF Ukraine has significant capacity to enable multi-institutional cooperation and bring various
stakeholders together to achieve synergies. However, the CO would achieve greater impact with a more
comprehensive and systematic strategic approach in this regard. This is particularly important in areas that
require inter-sectoral coordination. There is room for improvement in UNICEF Ukraine’s partnerships with
other UN agencies but also with the European Union’s (EU’s) Delegation in Ukraine. There is also potential
for stronger resource mobilization from Ukraine’s private sector.
UNICEF Ukraine’s results were achieved at scale when it
• partnered with key stakeholders to develop national strategies and policies;
• built the capacity of stakeholders at national, regional and local levels;
• implemented far-reaching behavioural change campaigns.
UNICEF Ukraine also obtained results at scale when investments and interventions were continued over a
period of time that allowed that data to be analysed and turned into models for governmental
implementation. Support for governmental capacity building for the planning, oversight and delivery of
services also aided the effectiveness of UNICEF work.
6
Barriers to obtaining results at scale appeared in several areas. First, several risks and bottlenecks were
identified in the planning stage and documented as such in the CPD. However, the CPD did not include a full-
fledged risk mitigation strategy or a strategy to counteract the negative effects of decoupled sectoral and
decentralization reforms. There is also room for improvement in alignment between the UNICEF CPD and
Agenda 2030: this could increase the engagement of relevant ministries and other key stakeholders, and,
ultimately, improve children’s rights in Ukraine.
UNICEF Ukraine has made an important contribution to improving overall monitoring of the extent to which
children’s rights are observed in Ukraine, but also to the collection of in-depth evidence and data, for
example through the regular surveys on immunization. However, it is, at this time, difficult to analyse the
results of this contribution at scale.
Lessons learned
Strengthening the capacity of both national and local government staff in Ukraine helps ensure the
implementation of reforms and/or new policies – particularly in the context of decentralization.
Strengthening capacity at local and regional levels could counteract the negative effects of changes at the
central political level, thereby ensuring continuity of services to children in times of crisis.
Partnering with key donors and international institutions in the country is vital to create synergy and
generate results at scale and at system levels, particularly as significant financial resources are necessary
to address the existing needs of children. Continuous systematic and strategic advocacy would enable
UNICEF to react quickly to changes in policies or situations.
“Exit strategies” should be included in project models or intervention designs. This will ensure that
necessary preconditions – including legislation, financial resources and capacity – are in place for the
investments made and for their results to be sustained.
Recommendations
Recommendation 1. Engagement of key stakeholders to ensure synergy. UNICEF Ukraine should
pursue strategic partnerships in a more systematic manner with both the government and key stakeholders
in the country, including other international organizations and other UN agencies, to strengthen the
protection of children’s rights. In this regard, UNICEF Ukraine should create a country-wide coalition
involving all stakeholders that support children’s rights, including the EU Delegation in the country and the
private sector, to consult and coordinate interventions in the interests of children, at both managerial and
technical level.
Recommendation 2: Continuous action to obtain sustainable results. UNICEF Ukraine should prioritize
actions that need to be continued to achieve results at scale, including the implementation of national
strategies and legislative frameworks; innovative actions; child rights monitoring activities; and platforms
that enable the voice of children and youth to be heard.
Recommendation 3: Institutionalizing the models framework. To enhance the sustainability of its
interventions, UNICEF Ukraine should develop exit and transition action plans as early as possible in the
process to enable a smooth transfer of responsibilities to national and local authorities, as well as the scale-
up of the models piloted.
Recommendation 4. Implementation of effective change strategies and more focused programming.
To obtain maximum results with the resources available, UNICEF Ukraine should select priority areas for
the next CP where an effective combination of strategies can be applied, particularly strategic partnership,
resource leveraging and capacity building. For each area covered, UNICEF Ukraine should identify at least
the main specific risks and bottlenecks and integrate mitigation measures into the design of its actions. At
the same time, UNICEF Ukraine should assess in greater depth the extent to which certain vulnerable groups
and boys/girls have specific needs and take these into account in the design of interventions, building more
on Agenda 2030 and grounding the results in Ukraine’s targets and indicators for the achievement of the
Sustainable Development Goals.
7
Recommendation 5. Strategy-based advocacy, evidence generation and best practices. Advocacy and
evidence generation should be undertaken systematically. UNICEF Ukraine should develop an advocacy
strategy that covers all stakeholders, considers their interests and power, and defines the most appropriate
advocacy strategy to be taken with each stakeholder. One strategy should be the promotion of best practices
and innovative approaches that have been implemented successfully by UNICEF Ukraine.
Recommendation 6. Evidence and progress. UNICEF Ukraine should develop monitoring procedures to
enhance the availability of evidence, particularly for medium- and long-term changes triggered by its
interventions. The indicator system in the new Country Programme Performance Framework needs to be
improved to enable adequate regular monitoring that would identify gaps in terms of the targets initially
set, trigger corrective actions and show UNICEF’s contribution to wider changes at national or regional
level.

1. Introduction
This report presents the findings of the evaluation of the UNICEF Ukraine Country Programme (CP)
2018-2022. The evaluation was commissioned by UNICEF’s Europe and Central Asia Regional Office
(ECARO) as part of the Multi-Country Programme Evaluation (MCPE), which covers CP evaluations
in Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine and includes a synthesis report.
The evaluation was carried out between February and September 2021 and covers the entire UNICEF
portfolio during the first three and a half years of the five-year programme. In addition, the evaluation
considers previous activities that continued and contributed to UNICEF impact during that time, taking into
account UNICEF’s global strategic plan 2018-2022. This strategic evaluation complements the many
sectoral evaluations and specialized studies that have been carried out by UNICEF and external experts
during this period. The evaluation report also complements the Situational Analysis (SitAn) carried out in
2021 in Ukraine and is intended to inform, together with the SitAn, the decisions for UNICEF Ukraine’s next
CP.
The CP 2018–2022 in Ukraine2 had an initial budget of US$5.21 million from regular resources and
US$36.27 million from other resources and aimed to reach every child and young person across the country
through national-level policy change and service improvements at all levels (national, provincial and
district). The CP is structured around six core Outcomes, formulated by sector: Outcome 1 – Social Inclusion
and Macro Policies for Children; Outcome 2 – Child Protection in All Settings; Outcome 3 – All Children
Learn; Outcome 4 – Early Years of Healthy Life and Beyond; Outcome 5 – Water and Sustainable
Environment. An additional sixth Outcome focuses on data and the monitoring of child rights and the
situation of children.
In line with UNICEF’s types of interventions, many of UNICEF’s partners have been government ministries,
agencies and departments at national level, but a number of programmes have also been implemented at
regional or local level, including in the conflict area in eastern Ukraine. The evaluation assesses the CP’s
collaboration not just with government structures but also with UN agencies and other development
partners, as well as with the civil society organisations (CSOs) that participate in CP implementation as
implementing agencies or by working with UNICEF on advocacy.
This introduction to the report describes the aims, objectives and scope of the evaluation, the context within
which UNICEF has been operating, and the overall organization and content of the CP itself. Chapter 2
explains the methodology of the evaluation, including ethical issues. Chapter 3 presents the key findings of
the evaluation, organized according to its main criteria – relevance, coherence and impact – and the
evaluation questions in the Terms of Reference (ToR). Based on these findings, Chapter 4 presents
conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations, with a focus on three selected impact areas that are
analysed in greater depth: immunization, youth empowerment and participation, and justice for children.
1.1. Brief description of the context and current situation
Ukraine is the second largest of Europe’s 43 countries by landmass (i.e., 603,700 square kilometres)
with access to the Black and Azov seas. Its demographic evolution has been negative since 1993, and
its population was around 44 million in 2020.3 An estimated 70 per cent of Ukrainians live in urban
areas with Kyiv, the capital, being the largest city, with three million inhabitants.4

There were 7,533,930 children under the age of 18 in Ukraine as of 1 January 2020 (boys 3,880,226; girls
3,653,664). This means that just 18.05 per cent of Ukrainians were children, a slight increase from the
beginning of 2012, when the figure stood at 17.47 per cent.5
Ukraine has been an independent state since 1991 and is rated as a lower-middle income economy with
GDP per capita reaching US$3,118.4 as of 2020.6 The country’s post-soviet industry is being steadily
replaced by modern agriculture and, to a growing extent, a post-industrial service sector, especially for IT
and visual production.
Between 2017 and 2021, Ukraine continued to experience the acute political, security, and economic
challenges that began in 2014. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected in April 2019 and the Servant
of the People Party won the parliamentary elections in July of that year. The Government, which was re-
appointed in March 2020, has committed to an ambitious and wide-ranging reform agenda.7
While Ukrainians acknowledge the implementation of reforms8, they continue to feel that more needs to be
done to improve governance and a lack of trust in public institutions remains a fundamental concern. In this
context, it is important to note that, following the disbanding of the Ministry of Family and Youth in 2010,
no Ministry has a specific mandate to implement state policy on children. As a result, the children’s agenda
has not been prominent on the Government’s radar, leaving UNICEF significant room to act in line with its
mandate.
The situation of children and families in the conflict-affected Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in eastern
Ukraine continues to cause concerns. The armed conflict began in 2014 and, after six years, this situation
continues to take a significant toll on the population. The ’contact line’ that separates areas under and
outside Government control, leaves communities in the non-government-controlled area (NGCA) facing
many challenges.9 As a result of political agreements with the de facto authorities in the NGCA, a ceasefire
was declared in 2019 and the fighting was reduced. However, 3.4 million people are still in need of
humanitarian assistance – 60 per cent of them women and children2. This situation influenced the focus of
the CP and UNICEF’s intervention in the country, but the current CP also makes the transition from
humanitarian aid to a more sustainable approach that aims for development in conflict territories and
across the entire country.
In 2017, about half of Ukrainians lived below the national poverty line (47.3 per cent)10, with the highest
levels of monetary poverty seen among children, especially those in rural areas. Labour migration – as a
mitigation strategy for poor families – also has a negative impact on children who are separated from one
or both parents. In 2019, the absolute poverty rate of families with children was 47.3 per cent, compared to
34.3 per cent for families without children. In absolute terms, 3,470,222 Ukrainian children were living
below the national poverty line (UAH 3,661 or around US$100 per person per month) in 2019. In total, 13.6
per cent of households with children were extremely poor, compared to 8.0 per cent of households without
children.11
As the most recent UNICEF Voluntary National Review (VNR) report indicates, in Ukraine, women face
multi-dimensional poverty problems, and women and children are prevalent in the vulnerable groups that
determine specific poverty profiles. Women also depend to a greater extent on the availability of social
guarantees and services because, according to existing social stereotypes, they are responsible for the
organization of household life and care for children and unemployed family members.

Although Ukraine’s population has nearly total literacy and is ranked 10th in the world for its level of
tertiary education enrolment (mostly of a modest quality12), there is inequality in access to education.
Despite Ukraine’s high rate of school attendance, certain groups of children experience lower rates of
attendance or participation: children with disabilities, Roma children, young people living and working on
the streets, and (more recently) displaced children in conflict areas.13
With regards to health, although its HIV infection rates are decreasing, Ukraine continues to have one of the
highest numbers of people living with HIV of any country in Europe: more than 250,000 people as of early
2020.14 Of those registered as living with HIV in Ukraine in 2014, 24 per cent were in Donetsk and Luhansk
oblasts when hostilities broke out. These oblasts also have the highest number of people diagnosed with
AIDS in the country.15
Maternal mortality in Ukraine is growing and is significantly higher than the European Union (EU) average.
However, infant and child mortality have decreased. Under-one mortality fell from 8.8 deaths per 1,000 live
births in 2013 to 7.1 per 1,000 in 2019, and under-five mortality fell from 10.2 per 1,000 to 8.4 over the
same period.16 Children with disabilities remain a group whose lives are often blighted at birth, with
frequent and unjustifiable separation from their parents to attend specific health facilities.
There are different challenges to the realization of children’s rights in terms of the urban/rural divide,
region, gender and ethnicity, with children in rural areas, for example, facing higher poverty levels and
lower quality of services.17 The regional differences in equity are linked to the conflict that has erupted in
the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with a particularly severe impact on children’s well-being in these areas.
The global COVID-19 pandemic affected Ukraine in several ways. Quarantine measures introduced by the
government forced the closure of pre-school institutions and the shift of secondary and higher education to
remote, online provision. Children from institutions, including those with disabilities, were sent back home
without prior verification of their family conditions.18 Such quarantine restrictions created challenges both
for teachers, who not always ready for the new modes of education, and for families with children, who
struggled to ensure the availability of the equipment and internet access needed for remote learning,
especially for children living in remote areas.
Although the economic impact of the pandemic has been less severe than expected, Ukraine remains one of
the countries in Europe most severely affected in health terms. By the end of 2020, Ukraine had adopted a
National COVID-19 Vaccination Roadmap, and a vaccination campaign began in February 2021.19
1.2. Country Programme components and goals
UNICEF’s CP 2018-2022 in Ukraine is structured around six main sectoral Outcomes (Social
Inclusion; Child Protection; Education, Health and Nutrition; Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH),
and Child Rights Monitoring) (please see details on each sectoral Outcome and related outputs in
Annex 1, and the CP ToC in Annex 8). This evaluation covers the six main Outcomes.
Outcome 1 – Social Inclusion and Macro Policies for Children – focuses on advancing equity for children
and improving social welfare and protection policies. Under this Outcome UNICEF Ukraine has generated
evidence to advocate for stronger reforms of the social protection system, including implementation of the

National Poverty Reduction Strategy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this Outcome has been a catalyst for
the provision of timely evidence to guide high-level policy consultations and decision-making for a better
response to the needs of children, including an assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on child poverty and
inequality. The UNICEF Country Office (CO) used evidence-based advocacy and strategic partnerships to
leverage resources for the better provision of social services for children at local level. Child and youth
participation mechanisms enabled local stakeholders to design and implement child-focused plans in 24
municipalities.
Outcome 2 – Child Protection in All Settings – continued UNICEF Ukraine’s evidence-based advocacy for
child welfare and social protection reforms. Key interventions under this outcome have focused on
‘gatekeeping’ through community-based child and family support services, including early intervention for
children with disabilities and developmental delays, children subjected to or witnessing violence, the
prevention of separation of children from their families and the promotion of deinstitutionalization. UNICEF
has supported the Government in its implementation of the National Strategy on Reforming Justice for
Children through technical assistance, expertise and innovative programmes and models, the development
of unified standards of training for professionals and institutionalization of the restorative justice
programme for juveniles in conflict with the law. UNICEF Ukraine has also ensured the smooth coordination
among actors involved by the Inter-Agency Coordination Council on Justice for Children. UNICEF has often
had to adapt to the changes in the Government and subsequent changes in the priorities of line ministries,
as well as to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 lockdown.
Outcome 3 – All Children Learn – UNICEF has provided technical assistance and financial resources to
Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) to strengthen evidence-based quality pre-school
education, following the endorsement of the Basic Component of pre-school education and the launch of the
Early Childhood Environment Rating Scales pilot assessment.20 In the context of the global pandemic,
UNICEF Ukraine has supported the Government in ensuring the continuity of access to quality education
and safe school operations for all children, including those with disabilities. Based on the successful
modelling of the Child-friendly and Safe School model, UNICEF and MoES have implemented the model in
50 education facilities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Building on its two-year programme on conflict
resolution skills, UNICEF and MoES have developed a peer-to-peer mediation toolkit, a video tutorial on
solving conflicts and conducted online workshops on ‘Solving conflicts in digital space’. UNICEF has
implemented innovative mechanisms and platforms to engage young people on a variety of civic matters,
including enhanced use of U-Report, one of the first monitoring tools to assess youth opinions on
pandemic.21
Outcome 4 – Early Years of Healthy Life and Beyond – has aimed to close critical gaps in maternal and
child health, with a particular focus on re-establishing universal immunization coverage and achieving the
elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. However, the pandemic outbreak reinforced the need
for reformed health care, including reforms of Ukraine’s primary healthcare system. UNICEF, the World
Health Organization (WHO) and other partners have been in the first line of support to Ukraine’s Ministry
of Health (MoH) to ensure an adequate National COVID-19 Response Plan, as well as a National Vaccine
Deployment Plan, with supply, cold-chain equipment (CCE) and logistics, as well as activities to generate
demand. A blended approach has been used on immunization to address vaccination coverage that is lower
than planned, while responding to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This approach has combined advocacy
and public dialogue on immunization in the context of the country’s health reform, as well as policy support,
capacity development and communication messages.
Outcome 5 – Water and Sustainable Environment – has aimed to ensure that children and their families
in conflict areas have equitable access to sustainably managed water and sanitation services and improved
hygiene behaviours in communities, schools and health facilities. During CP implementation, UNICEF's
work has focused on mitigating the impact of the pandemic, targeting frontline workers and supporting the
most vulnerable populations. In particular, special attention has been paid to health care centres, social

institutions, households and, to a lesser extent, educational institutions. UNICEF’s humanitarian activities
in NGCA and along the Line of Contact (0-5 km) in the government-controlled area (GCA) continued during
COVID-19. The pandemic provided an opportunity for UNICEF to work in western Ukraine, supporting
Roma households with hygiene products and nearby health/social centres through measures for Infection
Prevention and Control (IPC). The Government is facilitating financial investments by several international
organizations and donors on water infrastructure in the region.
Outcome 6 – Independent Child Rights Monitoring (CRM) for Results and Accountability – is a cross-
cutting endeavour to address severe gaps in the availability, disaggregation, analysis and use of data on the
situation of children in Ukraine. UNICEF Ukraine has been building capacity for the Government, the State
Statistics Service of Ukraine (SSSU), the Ombudsperson system, and NGOs on the collection of disaggregated
data for child rights monitoring and has supported the development of a comprehensive CRM monitoring
system. UNICEF assisted the SSSU in collecting child-related statistics to serve as a basis for vulnerability
analysis at sub-national level, with a focus on COVID-19 impact. UNICEF has also advocated for the
development of a methodology for data collection on gender. As a result, more than 50 child-related
indicators have been incorporated into the SSSU data collection methodology. Furthermore, as a result of
UNICEF's support and advocacy, the State Strategy for Regional Development for 2021-2027 includes child-
sensitive targets and indicators. UNICEF has supported the production of the Government’s first VNR on
progress towards the SDGs in 2020 – a contribution to SDG monitoring at the national level.
The CO conducted a Situation Analysis (SitAn) in 2015 to support the preparation of the CP in 2017. When
the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak generated a new set of child-related challenges, the CO added specific key
interventions to the existing and relevant Outcome and Outputs.
The CP integrates gender-responsive programming, child rights mainstreaming, and assistance to the most
vulnerable including those affected by the conflict as cross-cutting topics. The CO has assessed risks and
developed mitigation strategies for each of these topics, planned monitoring and evaluation actions, and
has aligned the CP with the relevant United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF)
outcomes.
1.3. Purpose of the evaluation
The objective of the Multi-Country Programme Evaluation (MCPE) is to conduct a formative multi-
country evaluation that serves two purposes: accountability and learning. The MCPE assesses the
relevance, coherence and impact achieved throughout implementation of the Country Programmes
(CPs) in the four countries (Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine) to identify good practices,
and draw lessons and forward-looking recommendations that can inform the 2023-2027 CP
planning processes that have either commenced or will commence shortly in all four countries.
In line with its Terms of Reference (ToR), the purpose of the MCPE is threefold:
- to strengthen accountability of UNICEF to national stakeholders by evaluating UNICEF’s
contribution to the results for children at scale, especially for the most vulnerable in Bulgaria,
Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine
- to support the development of the next UNICEF Country Programme (CP) in each country by
understanding and evaluating the implementation of the change strategies, through which the CP
has been delivered to better understand the added value of UNICEF in each country context
- to draw lessons from the previous CP implementation in order to make the best use of UNICEF’s
change strategies in each country covered by the evaluation and in the region as a whole, while
considering current circumstances.
To produce the information and data that enable the assessment of progress on these three purposes, the
evaluation, assesses:
17
- the linkages between international, regional, national and institutional strategies to bring about
overall improvement in the status of children, with a view to clarifying the roles and responsibilities
of national stakeholders and how UNICEF interventions can add value and contribute to policy
development for systemic improvements
- the extent to which interventions focus on and deliver results for the most vulnerable categories of
children, in each of the four countries
- the performance monitoring systems in place at national and UNICEF level, the quality of indicators,
and the capacity of those indicators to measure and communicate results, including the
measurement of horizontal issues (gender, participation, equity, most vulnerable).
The evaluation is built on evidence collected from interventions implemented in the four countries over the
last 3.5 years (under the current CPs), but also, to a more limited extent, in earlier years. Specific activities
carried out to ease the negative consequences of the current pandemic crisis on children are taken into
account to the extent that they are part of the results chains in the areas selected.
The scope of this Country Programme Evaluation is therefore, as follows.22
- Temporal scope: 2018 to June 2021, covering the current CP (2018-2022) to date. However, when
relevant to the observed impact, the temporal scope of the evaluation is extended to the previous
years and to the previous CP.
- Geographical scope: All areas in Ukraine where UNICEF works, including eastern Ukraine.
- Portfolio scope: All portfolio components, including cross-cutting issues such as gender, and inter-
sectoral support involving gender and communication.
- Organizational scope: The CO and wider provision of technical support and oversight from UNICEF’s
Europe and Central Asia Regional Office (ECARO) and, when relevant, UNICEF’s headquarters.
- Excluded from the scope of the evaluation: The evaluation does not provide a detailed assessment
of all CP components. However, a more in-depth impact assessment has been undertaken for three
selected areas to provide lessons learned and UNICEF practices and strategies in achieving impact
for children at scale: immunization, adolescent engagement and participation, and justice for
children.
The primary users of this Country Programme Evaluation are intended to be the UNICEF CO and ECARO.
Secondary users of the evaluation are the Government of Ukraine, UN agencies and development partners
with a presence in Ukraine. The evaluation report aims to build on the agreements made between all of
these parties and to assist the prioritization and establishment of strategies for the future, as they move
together into the next planning and programme cycle.
2. Methodology
2.1. Evaluation framework: criteria and questions
The evaluation framework is composed of the programme Theory of Change (ToC) (see Annex 8)
and the Evaluation Matrix developed during the Inception Phase (see Annex 4). Together, they
constitute the core analytical framework against which data were gathered and analysed. All
evaluation questions were assigned to one of three specific evaluation criteria: relevance, coherence
and impact. Sustainability and effectiveness were indirectly analysed under the impact criterion.
The evaluation matrix and questions guided both specific data collection and the analytical methodologies
applied. The evaluation used a mixed-methods approach that combined the analysis of existing data from
22 According to the ToR.
18
preliminary qualitative and quantitative programme and context documentation; and primary qualitative
information collected through interviews with key informants. The evaluation matrix guided the
consultations with the CO on the focus and process of the evaluation for both data collection and analysis.
Child rights, equity and gender were key issues throughout.
The evaluation matrix is built on an overall approach that links evaluation criteria. Analyses and findings
on ‘relevance’ and ‘Coherence’ (carried out for the entire CP) are taken into account by the assessment of
‘impact’ as, on the one side, UNICEF’s interventions cannot have an impact if they are not relevant and, on
the other side, UNICEF’s impact (its contribution to an observed change) might also be determined by other
interventions, implemented by, for example, other donors and international organizations, or the
Government itself. UNICEF’s added value in this context, as addressed under ‘coherence’ is of particular
importance.
The evaluation of impact is undertaken for the entire CP to the extent possible, based on the available data.
However, a more in-depth impact assessment has been undertaken for three selected areas: immunization,
adolescent and youth participation, and justice for children, to provide lessons learned on UNICEF practices
and strategies in achieving impact for children at scale. The three areas were selected with the CO on the
basis of a set of criteria, including: (1) observable results at scale, triggered also by national government
prioritization and investments; (2) the confidence of the UNICEF CO that its interventions and efforts made
a significant contribution to the observed change, or, on the contrary, (3) that its contribution was below
expectations. It needs to be underlined that the causality analysis contributes to findings and conclusions
in terms of the contributions to change as examples of the achievement of results at scale (or as examples
of contributions that were less than expected).
The evaluation utilized a formative approach to look back and assess the relevance, coherence and impact
achieved throughout implementation of the CP in Ukraine to identify good practices and draw lessons and
forward-looking recommendations that can inform the 2023-2027 CP planning process, which commenced
in the last quarter of 2021.
The evaluation also utilized a stakeholder analysis and social network analysis to evaluate UNICEF Ukraine
CO’s coherence, added value and cooperation with stakeholders to enhance the results pursued (see Annex
9 for a description of the methodology applied and analysis results).
The evaluation involved three phases: (1) inception, (2) data collection, (3) analysis and reporting.
Throughout the process, and particularly during the inception and reporting stage, the CO and the
Evaluation Reference group (ERG) were consulted on the methodology, including the selection of impact
areas, and results.
2.2. Data collection and analysis methods
The evaluation team engaged with UNICEF ECARO, UNICEF Ukraine, government authorities, public
institutions, civil society partners and other development agencies to ensure that the evaluation
responds to the needs and priorities of the users. The evaluation used the following methods of data
collection: (1) document review (see Annex 7 for a list of sources used); (2) key stakeholder
interviews, and (3) a survey for the social network analysis to support the assessment of the
coherence of the CP and UNICEF partnerships.
Semi-structured interviews were the main tools used with national partners, reflecting the upstream nature
of the CP and the status of the respondents. Primary data were collected from a variety of stakeholders,
including government officials, UNICEF staff, CSOs and development partners (see the list of interviewed
stakeholders in Annex 5). In total, 30 individual interviews were conducted remotely as a result of COVID-
19 restrictions. The interviews were conducted by the international and national consultants, working in
pairs or individually and were guided by checklists to support the consistency of data collection across the
team and varied stakeholders. However, the questions for each interview were tailored as appropriate to
valorize the position and knowledge of the interviewee.
19
The selection of the key informants followed a dedicated sampling strategy, which was agreed with ECARO
and CO at the end of the inception stage. The aim of the strategy was to cover the CP in a general manner,
and the three selected impact areas in particular, and to include different types of key informants (UNICEF
staff, representatives of the Government, representatives of UNICEF agencies and other development
agencies, representatives of academia, services providers and implementing partners) as interviewees for
each area. Following from the programme design and focus of its activities, it was decided to spend the
majority of the time with stakeholders at national level, and much less time in the regions, because so many
of the planned results are at policy level.
In line with the ToR for the evaluation, children and adolescents were not interviewed or consulted directly
in another way. The evaluation team decided instead to rely on sectoral evaluations and studies that have
presented the perspectives of these groups more thoroughly than would have been possible during this
evaluation. The evaluation team did, however, meet representatives of intermediary groups that work
closely with vulnerable children.
Three participatory online workshops were organized with CO staff. These had three aims: (1) to familiarize
the evaluation team with the CP and identify and select the impact areas to be assessed in greater depth;
(2) to present the inception report (IR), discuss key issues to be addressed by the evaluation and plan data
collection in cooperation with the CO; and (3) present and validate the findings and discuss preliminary
recommendations.
The recommendations were developed by the evaluation team on the basis of the draft findings, and the
later analysis of the data, findings and conclusions. The final wording of the recommendations was
developed in consultation with the CO, which provided feedback, comments and questions throughout the
final report drafting process. As a result, two additional outputs were developed by the evaluation team
together with the CO: a matrix for the coherent presentation of the evaluation’s findings, conclusions and
recommendations; and a Brief summarizing the evaluation process and results. Three meetings with the CO
were organized in the final stage of the evaluation process, to validate findings, conclusions and
recommendations. Specific recommendations for the three impact areas analysed in-depth were also
developed as a result of the discussions in these three meetings. The CP evaluation report was also
presented to the Evaluation Reference Group.
2.3. Ethical issues and consideration of child rights, equity and gender
The evaluation team adhered to United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) ethical guidelines and its
code of conduct. This means that the evaluation team upheld the appropriate obligations of
evaluators, including maintaining the independence, impartiality, credibility and accountability of
the individual team members and the evaluation process as a whole.
The evaluation team was not subject to any conflicts of interest and its members confirmed that they were
able to carry out the evaluation without any undue interference. Throughout data collection, analysis and
reporting, evaluators aimed to ensure the integrity of the evaluation by respecting the ethical standards of
UNICEF, as presented in the ‘UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation and Data
Collection and Analysis’ (April 2015). In particular, special attention was paid to the issues of harms and
benefits, informed consent, privacy and confidentiality, payment and compensation, and conflicts of
interest.
The evaluation team ensured the consent of all key informants to be interviewed; the experts conducting
interviews gave formal assurances that the comments made during the interviews would be anonymous.
As a result, none of the statements mentioned in this report are attributable to individuals or particular
government departments.
20
2.4. Limitations
The main challenge facing the evaluation arose from the spread and complexity of UNICEF’s
objectives and its strategies in Ukraine during a period of political instability and in a country
affected by conflict. Overall, the changes that UNICEF seeks to make are mostly long-term and
countrywide and, in general, 3.5 years (the period covered by the present evaluation for the CP
2018-2022) is not long enough to allow for impact for children at scale.
In terms of the three areas evaluated in-depth, the evaluation considered interventions that were being
implemented before the current CP to enable the assessment of results at scale, particularly for
immunization but also for child and youth participation. In addition, the evaluated period overlapped with
the COVID-19 pandemic (since March 2020). In this context the sustainability of UNICEF’s impact, as
assessed in this report, is at risk and the evaluation team is unable to confidently or clearly predict to what
extent the strategies of upstream policy work will ultimately benefit children in Ukraine, or whether the
benefits already achieved will be sustained, given the social and economic crisis generated by the pandemic.
In almost all areas, UNICEF has promoted the further alignment of government policies with international
best practices and standards. This kind of change depends on high-level decisions and it was not always
possible for the evaluation team to meet state officials at this level to determine their perceptions of
UNICEF’s contribution. However, the officials that the evaluation team did meet were open, exceeding
expectations.
The evaluation ToR emphasized its strategic nature and the evaluation team focused on the main overall
and long-term questions as it saw them; it was not able to analyse each of the different programme
components in detail, nor did it set out to speak with the programme’s planned or actual end-beneficiaries.
Nonetheless, a summary has been made of results at outcome and output level, based on programme
documentation and interviews with government officials and other respondents in Kyiv and in Ukraine’s
regions.
Assessing UNICEF’s contribution to results at outcome level was another difficult area. The evaluation has
devoted considerable attention to the question of causality: in other words, who or what is responsible for
changes at different levels of policymaking or the implementation of new policy, and UNICEF’s precise
contribution in this regard. Apportioning the amount of influence of each main player was not easy, but the
evaluation attempted to do this, as will be seen in examples of UNICEF’s work provided in this report in
relation to impact.
The evaluation team faced a few limitations related to the design and evaluation phase of the CP.
- The documentation of the ToC for some programme areas was not systematic – an issue that was
addressed by the development, testing and validation of an indicative ToC to serve as a framework
for the evaluation. However, in the case of Process Tracing, not all of the desired evidence was
present, although the evaluation team used all available data, including primary data collected
through interviews.
- As the data collection phase took place in July and August 2021, during the holiday season, not all
key informants were available or reachable at the time of evaluation. However, a sufficiently high
number of interviews were conducted to ensure that the findings are solid.
The evaluation of UNICEF impact was based on its Result Assessment Module (RAM), triangulated with all
other sources that were available: evaluation reports, studies, surveys, statistical data. The evaluation also
noted several key points related to UNICEF’s system of indicators and the capacity of these indicators to
reflect the changes attributable to UNICEF and/or UNICEF actions implemented under the current CP
(2018-2022).
21
- Some indicators (particularly for outcome) are not monitored (i.e., values are not inserted in RAM
2020). Even if the target for the indicator is set for 2022, their values are to be collected and reported
annually, otherwise the monitoring process does not reach its objective.
- Frequent changes in indicators may be useful to reflect what was achieved in one year, or over the
course of two years, but hamper the development of a clear image of what the CO has achieved (or
not) during the entire CP period, in line with the targets initially set.
- It is unclear whether data are collected and reported in line with the indicator’s label (e.g., annually,
or cumulatively).
- The coverage of indicators differs from outcome to outcome and from output to output, such as a
larger or smaller number of indicators, although the differences between two outcomes or outputs
are not significant (i.e., a similar number of activities and funds are invested). In some cases, while
implemented activities are relevant, the indicators do not reflect the outputs they produce (e.g.,
some areas under Outcome 3 on Education)
- The targets set through outcome and output related statements are often highly ambitious, and
difficult to achieve in three to five years, although respect for children’s rights is a matter of
maximum urgency.
2.5. Management of the evaluation
In addition to UNICEF evaluation managers at ECARO, the evaluation team maintained close contact with
the CO representatives and staff and UNICEF Regional Advisors. The interviews with ECARO advisors were
a great help to the evaluation team in the development of its analysis.
The team presented its findings to an Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) consisting of representatives from
the Government, UN agencies, donors, and public agencies. The meeting was well attended and provided an
opportunity for all parties to comment on the current UNICEF CP and to raise issues to be addressed in the
future.

3. Main evaluation findings
3.1. Relevance
3.1.1. To what extent has UNICEF responded to the (changing) needs of the most vulnerable
children throughout the programme implementation
UNICEF Ukraine carried out interventions responding to the (changing) needs of the most
vulnerable children, adolescents and their families in the entire country. There has been a special
focus on the conflict areas in eastern Ukraine, but also – to a lesser extent – on children with
disabilities, children growing up without parental care, children in contact with the law, and the
displaced or most-at-risk adolescent boys and girls in other areas of the country.
The relevance of the UNICEF CP is supported by extensive research and good use of data. UNICEF’s
implementation strategy effectively reflects the needs identified at the planning stage (such as access to
adequate social protection systems, quality and inclusive education, childhood immunization. and early
development and care services), as well as evolving needs in the areas of health care, education, justice,
social protection, and in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
The Ukraine CP is highly relevant to the needs of vulnerable children and families that are listed in the
national legislation. The identification of vulnerable children and their needs has been periodically
identified and assessed (including consultations with national stakeholders) to produce assessments,
studies, reviews, monitoring reports and other documents prepared and published mainly by UNICEF. The
key documents are:
2019:
o Evidence-based analysis of psychosocial adaptability of adolescents in the conflict zone
o ‘Health behaviour of school-aged children’ (HBSC)
o Monitoring Report “Sustainable Development Goals for the Children of Ukraine”
o Promotion of Healthy Adolescent Development in Ukraine (four reports)
o Sustainable Development Goal 8 in Ukraine, Monitoring Report
o The State of the Worlds’ Children Report
2020:
o Assessment of programmes on responsible motherhood for and practices of work with pregnant
women and mothers with children in penitentiary institution
o COVID-19 Exacerbates Inequality in Ukraine
o Fighting COVID-19 in Ukraine: Initial estimates of the impact on poverty
o The SDGs 2020 Monitoring Report provides data on Ukraine’s SDG national indicators for 2015-2019

UNICEF’s implementation strategy effectively reflects the needs identified at planning stage and the
evolution of these needs in healthcare, education, justice, social protection and WASH. There are five main
UNICEF goals that connect the relevance of the CP implementation in Ukraine to national, local and
individual needs and expectations as specified in reviewed documents (laws, strategies, action plans).
Goal 1: Every child survives and thrives. UNICEF’s support for immunization covers all groups of
children. Beyond immunization, UNICEF has planned activities to respond to the needs of children living
with HIV or children with rare diseases i.e., its work on the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of
HIV (EMTCT), access to HIV and TB health services, and advocacy for changes to policies and guidelines.
Overall, UNICEF promotes national healthcare reform in the health sector. In addition, UNICEF supports the
national reform of school meals under the initiative of the First Lady23 to ensure that all children have access
to healthy food. While this particular initiative does not target vulnerable children specifically, those living
in poverty benefit from it the most.
Goal 2: Every child learns. UNICEF focuses on inclusive education for children with disabilities and
ensures their integration within the regular education and socialization processes. It also provides capacity
development for professionals on how to support such children, which is relevant to Ukraine’s National
Inclusivity Strategy and education reform agenda. The promotion of new learning technologies has been
included in UNICEF’s work to address government expectations on digitalization, as well as on the
production of evidence for the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).24 UNICEF has also
responded to Ukraine’s humanitarian and COVID-related crises in the educational sphere, and especially in
eastern Ukraine’s GCA through the provision of direct information to students, teachers and parents and
improvements in the learning environment for children.
Goal 3: Every child is protected from violence and exploitation. This goal is relevant for government
reforms on deinstitutionalization, social services and justice for children (J4C) where UNICEF has supported
and provided technical assistance to national institutions and counterparts, local authorities and
individuals. In this way, UNICEF has contributed to the adjustment of national legislation, the development
of national strategies and the introduction of best practices at the local level (Barnahus in Vinnitsa and
Mykolaiv cities). UNICEF has also supported local partners in providing services and advocacy for children
facing violence and adolescents in conflict with the law, and has conducted the monitoring of violations of
child rights at local level, including in alternative child care institutions.
Goal 4: Every child lives in a safe and clean environment. The UNICEF WASH programme ensures the
provision of safe water to families living in the conflict-affected areas of eastern Ukraine (NGCA and GCA),
supports the repair of water and heating systems, and has introduced an e-voucher programme for children.
This programme uses a bottom-up approach and supports the implementation of national strategies related
to sustainability and water supplies.
Goal 5: Every child has an equitable chance in life. This goal is relevant to decentralization reform
(including the CFCI in this context), the SDG-related national agenda, the country’s poverty strategy, the
monitoring of the Realization of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in Ukraine (in terms of the
recommendations of both official and shadow reports), youth participation (such as its inclusion in the VNR
report), and social protection. UNICEF continues to be a key player in monitoring the implementation of the
Convention of the Rights of the Child, with a clear strategy and advocacy for systemic changes in legislation
and policy developments that generate equal opportunities in children’s lives, particularly for those
children who are the most vulnerable.
Since 2018, UNICEF Ukraine has carried out interventions responding to the (changing) needs of the most
vulnerable children, adolescents and their families across the entire country, with a special focus on the
23 ‘Olena Zelenska enlists UNICEF support for 2021 in areas of work related to children and youth’, Official website of the
President of Ukraine, Kyiv 21 January 2021 (www.president.gov.ua/en/news/olena-zelenska-zaruchilasya-pidtrimkoyu-yunisef-
na-2021-rik-66109).

conflict areas in eastern Ukraine. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, however, UNICEF has revised its
strategies to adapt to the changed needs of vulnerable children. The revisions have included support to
improve the learning environment for children with disabilities; to prevent domestic violence during
lockdown; and to disseminate information directly to families with children about available vaccination or
access to public services.
The CP has demonstrated its relevance to national and local priorities, but also its geographic relevance, as
it has allocated the majority of its resources in the conflict-affected areas of eastern Ukraine. UNICEF is one
of the very few organizations working or vulnerable youth and children and their engagement in a
comprehensive way in eastern Ukraine, including the provision of humanitarian aid for children in the
NGCA. However, less coverage and development has been planned for vulnerable children in need in other
regions or in rural areas (i.e., Roma children in western Ukraine) – a point also raised by key informants.
3.1.2. To what extent has UNICEF consistently integrated the equity and gender equality in all
aspects of programming and implementation, including policy and advocacy?
UNICEF has integrated equity and gender equality into most aspects of programming and implementation,
including policy and advocacy, but gender is not yet fully mainstreamed into its implementation work.
Dedicated gender-sensitive approaches are being implemented in three evaluated impact areas:
immunization (reaching out to mothers with information materials), J4C (strengthening the capacity of
women in prison with children), and youth participation, including their involvement in the development
of the VNR and U-Reporting (with U-Report being an online youth volunteer platform).
UNICEF has a strong focus on equity in its programming documents. For example, the Strategic Note “Leave
no children behind”, represents one of UNICEF’s guiding principles in Ukraine, and there is a strong sense
of universalism, as all children (regardless of their socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity or location), are
expected to be able to attend school and have access to health services. This is particularly important
considering the equity gap in Ukraine that affects access to quality education and healthcare services for
children from rural areas, as well as their social status and the risks they experience.25
Gender, however, is not fully mainstreamed into UNICEF’s implementation work, as limited gender analysis
is available. In addition, the previous CP did not formulate specific outputs related to equity or gender
equality and this remains the case in the current CP. While UNICEF Ukraine has undertaken gender analysis
and collects gender-disaggregated data for some areas of its work, the focus on gender is not yet systematic.
UNICEF does incorporate gender into its evidence generation and advocacy. It provides constant support
for research, briefs and assessments that incorporate a gender equality lens while developing
methodologies and collecting data and uses the recommendations and evidence of these reports during the
planning and implementation of CP activities in several areas of work, and for further advocacy and
partnership. In the J4C area, for example, gender equality has been included in the National J4C Strategy
supported by UNICEF and in other documents developed to advance J4C reform.
Gender – and particular gender-based violence (GBV) – has been incorporated into the training curriculum
for police officers, prosecutors and advocates. U-Reports have been dedicated to GBV and other-gender
related topics, and the gender-based data of U-Reporters are available.26 The gender equality principle is
also implemented through gender-related actions under the CFCI and in the area of youth participation. For
25 The equity gap still exists in Ukraine, and is increasing. For example, there is inequality in access to education. Despite Ukraine’s
high rate of school attendance, certain groups experience disproportionately lower attendance or participation rates: children with
disabilities, Roma children, young people living and working on the streets, and (more recently) children who have been displaced.
With regards to health, although HIV infection rates are decreasing, they remain higher among children from marginalized
communities or children living on the streets. In addition, children with disabilities remain a group of children whose lives are often
blighted at birth with frequent and unjustifiable separation from their parents in health services. The SitAn analysis presented in
2015 identified equity as an overarching issue for children in Ukraine. The challenges to the realization of children’s rights differ in
terms of the urban/rural divide, region and gender and ethnicity. Children in rural areas encounter higher poverty levels and lower
quality of services. Concerning regional differences in equity: the conflict that has erupted in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions has
had a particularly negative impact on the well-being of the children who live there.

the latter, a degree of gender transformation was achieved by including activities targeting gender equality
in the labour market in activities for the National Youth Strategy.
The evidence collected for the evaluation indicates, therefore, that there is a high degree of perception and
awareness on gender equality in UNICEF Ukraine and the Country Programme Document (CPD) and actions
are implemented to respond, to some extent, to the challenge of gender equality. In some cases, UNICEF
Ukraine has contributed to a more gender-transformative27 policy in the country, through measures
included in strategic documents and improved statistics on children. More importantly, UNICEF Ukraine
has advocated for the development of a methodology for gender data collection at national level. As a result,
more than 50 child-related indicators have been incorporated into the SSSU data collection methodology,
and these are also divided by sex.
3.1.3. To what extent has UNICEF been able to respond to changes in national needs and rights
of the beneficiaries, especially of the most vulnerable, and in national priorities during
programme implementation?
The UNICEF CP has contributed to the implementation of national strategies addressing the needs of the
most vulnerable children in Ukraine. During programme implementation, UNICEF has participated actively
in the development of new policies, strategic documents and programmes to improve the situation of all
children in the country, including those who are the most vulnerable. In this regard, UNICEF has ensured
its evidence-based relevance to changes in national needs and priorities and to uphold the rights of the most
vulnerable children.
Based on the evidence collected, the evaluation has confirmed that the UNICEF CP’s planning and
implementation have been consistent with Ukraine’s national priorities.
Table 1 shows how the results of the CP match with national objectives and priorities as identified in
national strategic documents. As most national strategies cover wider timeframes, the reform process is
ongoing and efforts in 2020 and 2021 focused on tackling the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences,
and no major shifts in national priorities have been identified. UNICEF’s interventions, therefore, continue
to be relevant in this regard.
27 A gender-transformative policy aims to address the causes of gender-based inequalities and works to transform harmful
gender roles, norms and power relations.

The majority of informants indicated that the UNICEF CP had addressed the national SDG agenda
and government priorities, and that UNICEF had helped the Government to gather data for its
SDG report with a focus on children, and had supported the implementation of its results. At the
same time, some counterparts emphasized that they are not fully aware of the details of the
UNICEF CP, but had, nonetheless, been involved in annual planning or regular meetings on
planning and the review of ongoing activities.
Ukraine has been implementing decentralization reforms since 2014, and responsibility for child
and youth policies and services has moved to the local authorities. The CFCI in Ukraine has
continued to be a strong instrument for child-friendly planning and budgeting at municipality and
local level to meet local needs and priorities while also contributing to the local-level
implementation of national policies on youth and social services. The CFCI’s coverage has
expanded to 35 municipalities, and it now covers more than 10 per cent of Ukraine’s population.
As one key informant stated: “I think that UNICEF itself doesn’t fully realize the importance of the
CFCI for municipalities and their young inhabitants”. UNICEF’s advocacy efforts and technical
assistance on CFCI have created interest among more local authorities to develop children and
youth programmes and services at the local and community level.
The collected evidence shows that the UNICEF CP is fully aligned with government priorities,
especially in the three impact areas examined in more depth. In the immunization area, for
example, the opinion was expressed that the current UNICEF CP is aligned with government
priorities, but its implementation requires some improvement and broader discussion with
national counterparts. In the justice sector, UNICEF has contributed to J4C reform to ensure its
ownership and sustainability, promoting best international practices at the local level. In the
youth participation area, the national government has emphasized (and evidence has
demonstrated) that UNICEF programming and planning fully align with government priorities,
national strategies and needs.
The evaluation recognizes, therefore, UNICEF’s added value in supporting the Government’s
agenda and national priorities at all levels. It also identifies UNICEF’s role as a key player in
providing oversight and protection of the rights of all children, and in particular those who are in
the greatest need.
3.1.4. To what extent has UNICEF been able to respond to the shifts caused by crisis or
major socio-economic and political changes?
The documents reviewed and the interviews with key stakeholders indicated that the
major challenges in Ukraine since 2018 have been the COVID-19 pandemic, political
instability and the ongoing armed conflict. UNICEF has maintained its relevance in a
context of rapidly changing needs, including the needs created by the pandemic, and has
continued to revise national strategies to generate impact for all children. UNICEF has also
adapted its programme implementation to maintain its relevance and ensure effective
implementation during a period of political changes. UNICEF Ukraine has also responded
to both the humanitarian and development needs of the most vulnerable children in the
conflict areas in eastern Ukraine.
The ECARO Real Time Assessment of UNICEF’s Ongoing Response to COVID-19 in Europe and
Central Asia states that the effectiveness of the UNICEF Ukraine COVID-19 response has been
challenged by a large funding gap at the time of drafting the response plan. As a result, UNICEF
had limited funds at its disposal in its 2020 budget for regular activities, and there was inequitable
availability of funds for different regions, with most funding earmarked for eastern Ukraine.
However, UNICEF Ukraine mobilized quickly to meet the challenges of COVID-19 and its effects,
supporting the Government to ensure the basic safety of frontline workers (including social and
healthcare workers), to ensure a safe and learning environment for students whether in school
30
or at home, to develop and distribute information materials and support national information
campaigns, and to support the provision of protective equipment and disinfectants, etc.
The evaluation finds that some stakeholders have, to a limited extent, been aware of changes in
UNICEF’s strategies and activities as a result of COVID-19. There is evidence, confirmed by
respondents, that UNICEF continued its implementation of planned activities and immediately
transferred everything online, including events, meetings, education, research, and more. At the
beginning of the pandemic, UNICEF supported Zoom platforms for government bodies, including
the J4C Coordination Council and the Ministry of Social Policy. UNICEF was particularly visible in
the healthcare sphere, with its awareness-raising and communication campaigns. UNICEF
maintained an online video platform to conduct regular meetings with key experts, where priority
topics related to COVID-19 were discussed.
UNICEF provides constant support to Ukraine’s national and local governments and continues to
do so if there are permanent changes in the country’s political agenda and leadership. It was
noticed that national and local governments have changed during the reporting period, with the
introduction of different visions and perspectives on the policy prioritization of children’s rights
in such areas as deinstitutionalization reform for orphans and children deprived of parental
care.28
In the political sphere, the newly appointed Government sometimes undergoes changes that may
influence the implementation of reforms related to health, decentralization, social services and
deinstitutionalization. It was mentioned during interviews that all of these ongoing government-
led reforms are not fully interlinked and coordinated at the level of implementation and that
children’s rights are taken into consideration to only a limited extent.
The continuous changes in government have delayed CP activities as UNICEF has needed extra
time to provide orientation and conduct briefing meetings with new government officials on the
planned strategies. For example, the Heads of the J4C Coordination Council have changed three
times. The changes in the political management of the MoH have resulted in changing priorities,
with the topic of childhood becoming a lower priority.
There is also a regression in deinstitutionalization reform. Instead of promoting alternative care
for children, the new Government is promoting the institutionalization of children and the
strengthening of the boarding school system. As one interviewee noted: ”There should be a
constant and comprehensive monitoring system of children’s rights with a focus on orphans staying
in boarding schools. At the same time, NGOs should have the formal rights to be a part of this
monitoring exercise and provide independent oversight as they have access to children’s
institutions”.
The ongoing armed conflict in eastern Ukraine continues to be a major crisis for national security,
as well as for the safety of children and families in the area, while also having an impact on access
to public services, including water and sanitation. The absence of programmes for youth at local
level and the poor infrastructure in eastern Ukraine requires significant resources from the State
and donors. But according to the data available, UNICEF is one of the very few organizations
working for youth empowerment and engagement in this part of the country.
It should be noted that UNICEF Ukraine has continued to operate its field office and strengthen
its presence in the conflict areas. This has made it possible to constantly monitor children's rights
in these areas and adjust programming to meet their needs. UNICEF also mounted a proper and
timely response to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social services and the
heightened needs of vulnerable families with children for hygiene and cleaning items, regular
vaccination, and health services. UNICEF has continued to highlight the situation of children
trapped in the volatile six-year conflict in eastern Ukraine, building its international media

outreach on attacks on schools, lack of access to water and the dangers of landmines in the conflict
zone. UNICEF has also adopted a more tailored approach to its communication to keep the
attention of the media, donor community and governments on the impact of the conflict on
children.
3.2. Coherence
3.2.1. To what extent has UNICEF’s Country Programme kept true to its
mandate and aligned with UNICEF’s global and regional strategies as well
as the United Nations Partnership Framework (UNPF) and the SDGs in
any given country?
UNICEF’s programme interventions in Ukraine are in direct alignment with UNICEF’s
regional and global priorities, the relevant SDG indicators, and United Nations Partnership
Framework (UNPF) 2018–2022.
The evaluation finds that the CP developed by UNICEF Ukraine is not only aligned with the SDG
agenda 2030, but also takes into consideration the earlier shortcomings in terms of achieving the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by Ukraine. These include dramatic gaps in critical
services for children, such as the collapse of immunization coverage against DPT3, and low levels
of immunization against measles and polio.29
The desk research presented in Annex 7 identified recurrent references to contributions towards
the achievement of relevant SDGs in the Strategic Note document, CPD 2018-2022, and the
Results Assessment Module (RAM) and Country Office Annual Reports (COARs) for 2018-2020.
The analysis of the outputs established for the six outcomes of the CPD 2018-2022 (presented in
Table 2) found that all outputs are aligned with the results areas at the global goals and the
regional priorities of UNICEF. Table 2 shows that all of the outputs of UNICEF Ukraine’s CPD link
to all outcomes of the United Nations Partnership Framework 2018–2022 and that each output
contributes to one or several SDGs.
It needs to be underlined that UNICEF prepares regular national monitoring reports/publications
on the implementation of SDGs in the relevant areas in the country in partnership with the
Ministry of Economic Development and Trade of Ukraine, the Ministry of Social Policy in Ukraine,
the State Statistics Service of Ukraine, and the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office.

3.2.2. To what extent did UNICEF manage to build effective and sustainable
partnerships in working towards addressing the pre-defined bottlenecks,
advocating for evidence for equity and contributing to the results at scale?
UNICEF Ukraine invests significant efforts in building partnership with key ministries and
institutions to ensure advocacy for legislative changes and reforms. To support the
enforcement of new or reformed legislation, UNICEF maintains partnerships at the regional
and local levels, implements projects with cities and regional authorities, and builds the
capacity of CSOs and regional institutions for health and social care. UNICEF Ukraine brings
stakeholders together to achieve synergies and aligns its efforts with other UN agencies and
international stakeholders. However, these partnerships are challenged by political
instability in Ukraine, a lack of strategic vision for partnerships in some areas by UNICEF, and
veiled competition for resources among UN agencies and international organizations.
UNICEF Ukraine has managed to build strategic partnerships with key stakeholders from the relevant
ministries, institutions at national and regional level, UN agencies and international organizations
and funds, civil society, academia, and the private sector. Based on the evidence collected, the
evaluation finds that some partnerships with major key players have been developed recently, such
as a partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO) on youth engagement or have been
generated by the need to react rapidly and concertedly to the COVID-19 crisis.
The stakeholder analysis carried out for the evaluation reveals that UNICEF Ukraine utilizes seven
main types of partnerships.
1) Partnerships at national level with line Ministries, the Ombudsperson’s Office, and
governmental institutions enable UNICEF to advocate for systemic changes in Ukraine. The
CO maintains regular communication at the managerial level and through participation in
regular meetings of established stakeholder groups and councils, as well as through official
correspondence in line with the requirements of various guidelines related to planning and
reporting processes. The Social Network Analysis presented in Annex 9 demonstrates that 30
per cent of respondents indicated governmental bodies as being UNICEF’s most important
partners. However, political instability and frequent changes of ministers have created
challenges for sustaining partnerships. As a mitigation measure, UNICEF CO staff mentioned
the establishment of contacts with technical specialists within the relevant ministries who
tend to keep their positions and maintain institutional memory. The CO also uses Memoranda
of Understanding (MoUs) for formal agreement on the scope and areas of mutual work.
UNICEF strives to keep its neutrality regardless of the political situation in the country and
focuses on results for children. In some areas UNICEF has a well-defined vision and
understanding of partnership strategies, e.g., with the Ministry of Justice. In other areas,
however, such as Ukraine’s health reforms, UNICEF’s role is less clear, and this affects its
partnership with the MoH.
2) Partnerships at regional level with cities and regional authorities focus on the
implementation of projects, such as CFCI. UNICEF Ukraine creates interventions to target
specific regional needs, as seen in relation to its support for WASH and education in the
conflict-affected Donetsk and Lugansk regions. UNICEF plays a vital role in raising regional
capacity for joint initiatives that require cross-sectoral and multi-disciplinary cooperation,
like the Barnahus model of child-friendly centres for abuse victims, or the Interdepartmental
Coordinating Council for Juvenile Justice. Such partnerships help to put into practice the
35
reforms and legislative improvements achieved at national level. The importance of these
partners is confirmed by the results of the Social Network Analysis (Annex 9) where 23 per
cent and 21 per cent of respondents indicated national agencies and institutes and
municipalities as the most important partners.
3) Partnerships with governmental regional health and social care institutions enable
UNICEF to quickly collect information from the field and respond to the most urgent gaps.
For these partnerships UNICEF focuses on developing the capacity of regional workers and
building networks. UNICEF has created a network of activists-supporters for routine
vaccination and has built their capacity to promote immunization.
4) Partnerships with implementing partners from civil society and academia enable UNICEF
to conduct research, develop capacity, implement activities and provide services. The main
aims of such partnerships include the provision of methodologies, capacity-building
instruments, pilot projects, and expert support. Several partners mentioned relationships
with UNICEF Ukraine that have lasted more than ten years and that are built on trust and
mutual understanding. As one stakeholder noted: “They hear us and make required
amendments so that the methodology works”. Based on the quantitative data available, new
partners in this category have started to become involved in UNICEF activities under the
current CPD, while cooperation with other partners came to an end in 2016-2017. This
evolution may be the result of UNICEF’s planned transition from humanitarian support to
development.
5) Partnerships with other UN Agencies are assessed by both UNICEF staff and their
counterparts as an area that requires improvement, with some exceptions. The situation in
Ukraine remains complex and there are growing numbers of UN staff and resources, meaning
that intense efforts are required to ensure coherent and coordinated interventions.31
However, despite the principles of ‘delivering as one’ declared by the Government of Ukraine
(see the United Nations Partnership Framework 2018–2022), the stakeholders admit that, in
reality, agencies tend to compete for funding and opportunities. Based on the interviews
carried out, the evaluation identified one exceptional example of fruitful cooperation, when
the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) started an initiative to provide social services
to families affected by domestic violence and then handed it over to UNICEF. This example
could be complemented by UNICEF’s successful collaboration with the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs (OCHA) on the organization of convoys to NGCA32, and inspire more effective
advocacy.33
6) Continuous partnerships with traditional media, like TV channels, and engagement
with communication platforms such as Viber, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, help
UNICEF Ukraine to ensure the widest possible coverage of different audiences. These
partnerships are complemented by innovative approaches, such as online competitions,
video diaries, and engagement with bloggers, to play a crucial role the effective delivery of
organizational global priorities, and the distribution of Risk Communication and Community
Engagement materials. They have also addressed the growing need for trustworthy source34
during COVID-19 pandemic.

7) Partnerships with the private sector are more recent and are sustained through
institutional business engagements. In this area, UNICEF has worked with the American
Chamber of Commerce, the European Business Association, the Ukrainian Professional
Export Association and the IT Association to support advocacy, address gaps in child rights
and leverage resources and public opinion to support UNICEF’s objectives.35
Most partners among government, academia, and service providers assess the cooperation with
UNICEF as positive, rating it at 9 or 10 out of 10. The stakeholders confirm their involvement in the
planning of the CP and refer to regular meetings and discussions of current or urgent issues. Some
also indicate that UNICEF is flexible and amends its strategies and approaches when facing
bottlenecks.
At the same time, some stakeholders expect improved cooperation and partnership with UNICEF.
Some mentioned difficulties in getting in contact with UNICEF: as one interviewee mentioned –
“finding a relevant person for contacts and getting a response was sometimes a real puzzle”. Others
referred to a reduced pace of cooperation as a result of UNICEF shifting its focus from one topic to
another and, in this context, the limited capacity of staff. In some cases, cooperation and partnership
were hampered by a temporary lack of UNICEF staff or by the longer period needed for new members
of staff to gain ownership in the area covered.
3.2.3. What are the comparative advantages of UNICEF in relation to other actors
in the country, including development partners, the private sector and the
non-governmental sector and to what extent were they necessary and
sufficient for contributing to the results at scale to be achieved?
UNICEF Ukraine has used its comparative advantage of being a well-recognized monitor of the
fulfilment of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to act at strategic level when developing and
contributing to strategies and national policies. UNICEF Ukraine has used its comparative advantage
of technical expertise to build the capacity of stakeholders at national, regional and local levels and
introduce innovative projects and models. As an acknowledged advocate for research and evidence
collection in the interest of children, UNICEF Ukraine has brought together key stakeholders to
implement behavioural change campaigns and leverage resources.
The evaluation identified different perceptions of UNICEF’s comparative advantage among its key
four groups of stakeholders. They all agreed, however, that UNICEF’s strongest feature has been its
flexibility and the quick adjustment of its strategies at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
1) From the perspective of governmental institutions (ministries and the Ombudsperson’s
Office), UNICEF is the main player in monitoring the fulfilment of the Convention on the
Rights of the Child. It is seen as having a clear strategy and as advocating for systemic change
through support for evidence-based decision making, legislation and policy developments, as
well as technical assistance. In this context, they also recognize UNICEF’s advocacy efforts
through information and awareness raising campaigns.
The achieved results based on this comparative advantage relate to the development and
adoption of national strategic and legislative documents:
- Cabinet of Ministers’ Decree on organization of Youth Councils in the regions36
35 Ibid.
36 (https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1198-2018-%D0%BF#Text).
37
- the National Strategy on Youth till 2030 endorsed by the President in March 202137
- a number of legislative and budgetary provisions related to the realization of the CFCI38
- the draft Law on Child-Friendly Justice submitted to the Parliament in June 202139
- a number of legislative provisions related to the Barnahus model and its implementation
- the laws related to cybersecurity40 and bullying41.
However, UNICEF does not seem to be the partner of choice for the MoH in relation to the
procurement of medicines and vaccines. The Ministry withdrew the procurement of some
medicines and vaccines from UNICEF and handed this role to the Crown Agents, referring to a lower
commission rate, easier access to information and more flexibility. On a positive note, the Ministry
confirms the achievements of UNICEF Ukraine in the areas of communication and awareness raising
related to routine vaccination and behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2) From the perspective of regional authorities and institutions, UNICEF is the best source for
knowledge and information for capacity development. Partners in various cities
appreciate the availability of UNICEF’s high-level expertise and the international experience
and practice it can share from the wider Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region in combination
with innovative methods. These stakeholders appreciate UNICEF initiatives and recognize its
support in their implementation.
The achieved results based on this comparative advantage relate to capacity building and
piloting:
- support to the development of a number of training courses, curricula for universities,
methodological databases42, and training for a large number of people in various spheres
- the creation of a network of routine vaccination supporters in all regions of Ukraine who
build awareness among parents and service providers
- the implementation of the Barnahus model (introduced in Vinnitsa and Mykolaiv, and
under negotiation in Kyiv)
- the facilitation of the implementation of the CFCI, with over 160 cities having applied to
obtain the status.43
-
3) From the perspective of CSOs and implementing partners, UNICEF is an advocate for
research and evidence collection and a strong UN Agency with a clear focus on children
that is recognized by other stakeholders. UNICEF is considered to be a partner that is able
to trigger multi-institutional cooperation and bring various stakeholders together to achieve
synergies. CSOs value UNICEF’s comprehensive approach, which they often lack themselves.
The achieved results based on this comparative advantage relate to multi-disciplinary
approaches and data-collecting instruments:

Justice,44 which brings together relevant ministries, institutions, CSOs and development
organizations
- the creation of the U-Report instrument by UNICEF, which is now regularly used by CSOs,
institutions and organizations, and promotes evidence-based advocacy.
4) From the perspective of UN Agencies and development organizations, UNICEF is valued for
its clear focus on children and is seen as a recognized brand that helps to achieve
significant results through information and awareness-raising campaigns and
fundraising with governments and the private sector.
At the same time, if compared with other development organizations, some stakeholders mentioned
complex bureaucratic procedures that require heavy documentation.
3.2.4. How has UNICEF’s approach to strategic partnerships changed over time, if
at all?
There is no evidence of substantial changes in the approach to strategic partnerships during
the implementation of the current CP by UNICEF Ukraine CO, with one exception: a
strengthened partnership with the private sector.
The evaluation found no clear evidence of any substantial changes or amendments to UNICEF
Ukraine’s partnership approach over recent years. However, the collected evidence shows that the
number of partnerships with the private sector has increased since the start of the COVID-19
pandemic. This information is confirmed by the Results Assessment Module (RAM) 2020, which
notes that the CO’s income from the private sector in 2020 exceeded US$2 million (including
US$765,000 in kind). This included support for the early response to COVID-19 in health (the
donation of sanitizers and drinking water), as well as education disinfectors for schools, sign
language translation of the distance learning course, and more.
In addition to new partnerships triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation noticed a new
and highly significant partnership with the Office of the First Lady of Ukraine, which aims to heighten
attention on the rights of the most vulnerable children. At the same time, a new partnership with the
Ministry of Digital Transformation was established to pilot digital education products. While these
partnerships are still at the development stage, they indicate a lesson learned by UNICEF in terms of
the need to team up with key stakeholders to create synergies and results at scale in a particular area,
e.g., with ILO in the area of youth engagement.
3.3. Impact
3.3.1. Did UNICEF Ukraine contribute to the results at scale? If yes, how and why
did it make a difference and for whom? If no, why not?
To answer this evaluation question, we initially assess programme implementation against the
indicators established within the CP framework and on the basis of other relevant statistical data, as
44 Website of the Council at the Ministry of Justice (https://minjust.gov.ua/inccojj AND Facebook
https://m.facebook.com/inccojj?_rdr).
39
presented in recent analyses, including SitAn 2021 but also COARs, SDG, VNR and CRC reports (see
Annex 1). We then analyse UNICEF’s contribution to the observed progress in Ukraine in the sector
covered by each outcome and the conditions and factors that influenced UNICEF’s interventions
between 2018 and 2020/2021. Three in-depth case studies are included in this section that cover the
three selected areas mentioned in the methodology section in Chapter 1: immunization, youth
empowerment and participation, and justice for children.
The types of impact analysed at CP level are: (1) better access to services/direct improvement of the
situation of children, (2) behavioural and attitudinal change; (3) institutional change (including
institutional capacity raised); (4) changes in policy (including strategies, plans, laws, legislation); (5)
improvement of financing for children.
3.3.1.1. Evaluation of UNICEF impact under each Outcome of the Country
Programme
UNICEF Ukraine contributes to the results at scale for children, achieving several results
expected under the CP outcomes, particularly in health, education, child protection, and
access to water. Results at scale are obtained in cases where activities have been implemented
for a longer period of time and have met a major share of existing needs, as well as in cases
where evidence-based advocacy was carried out and technical assistance was provided to
improve strategic, policy and legislative frameworks.
A positive impact for children was achieved where policies were piloted and scaled up at national
level (as in the case of the Barnahus model or the Safe Schools concept) or universal services have
been delivered (e.g., the Baby box programme), in partnership with national and local authorities,
other international organizations and national NGOs. UNICEF Ukraine made a substantial
contribution in terms of improving the availability of data for evidence-based policy on children’s
rights. The achievement of results at scale is influenced by the quality of cooperation and
partnerships, UNICEF’s access to a valuable accumulation of knowledge, its brand recognition in
Ukraine, and its ability to intervene in the conflict area, as a UN agency.
UNICEF’s contribution to observed progress on the access of children and pregnant women to
health care services, including in situations of humanitarian crisis and limited access to WASH
Some overall improvements were seen at the national level in the health area regarding mother and
child health. In 2020, however, developments slowed down as state resources were redirected to the
management of the pandemic crisis. In fact, reforms at the level of primary health care continued
until the first trimester of 2020, when its second phase (i.e., broadening the primary health care
package, expanding into secondary and tertiary health services, and improving service quality,
efficacy, equity and access) was postponed.
In relation to mother and child health (MCH), as per the SitAn 2021, maternal mortality in Ukraine is
growing and is significantly higher than the EU average (despite the implementation of the State
Programme on Reproductive Health that is reported to have had a positive impact on the reduction
of maternal deaths). On a positive note, there have been general falls in infant and child mortality in
Ukraine, except in the Zakarpattya Oblast.
Figure 2 presents an example of the drivers of an intended change, i.e., decreased infant and child
mortality, and UNICEF’s contribution to this change. The list of drivers is not exhaustive, as the purpose
40
is to show how needs assessments (in particular, the identification of drivers and causality chains in
these assessments) may help the articulation of the ToC in the CP.

In the area of health, therefore, UNICEF has contributed to progress in Ukraine in a number of ways.
As detailed in Annex 1, UNICEF has provided important support to health facilities and health
workers to maintain services (including essential immunization during the COVID-19 crisis); to
Public Health Centres to build up an efficient COVID-19-related data management system; and
support to pregnant women, adolescents and children living with HIV on antiretrovirals (ARVs) to
ensure that they have access to the medication they need (including in the conflict areas). UNICEF
Ukraine has also engaged in high-level advocacy for the adoption of mandatory Universal Salt
Iodization legislation, generating evidence from a national survey on the iodine status of women of
reproductive age for this purpose. Impact in terms of policy and institutional capacity was supported
through tools such as the EMTCT database developed in all 25 regions and the implementation of the
e-MTCT roadmap, with indirect but positive results for children.45
In this area, results at scale are obtained in cases where activities have been implemented for a longer
period of time and have covered the majority of existing needs. Immunization interventions, for
example, have had an impact through the uninterrupted supply of vaccines (including in the NGCAs)
and the technical assistance provided (see the case study in Box 1 and Annex 2). Similarly, the
provision of the necessary ARVs and other HIV treatment commodities in the NGCAs of Donetsk and
Luhansk has had a notable impact for people living with HIV, including children. At the same time, a
45 Ukraine has made progress on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, with the rate decreasing from 7
per cent in 2005 to 2.2 per cent in 2017 (as per COAR 2018) and to 1.6 per cent in 2019 (as per SitAn 2021).
41
very high number of Community Health Workers have been supported through training or similar
capacity-building activities to maintain essential maternal, new-born and child health services before
and after the start of COVID-19 crisis.
Box 1. Case study - Immunization
The evaluation team conducted a detailed Process Tracing Analysis to assess the contribution of
UNICEF Ukraine to immunization. The complete assessment and results are presented in Annex 2.
The evaluation finds that UNICEF has made a major contribution to the availability and accessibility
of vaccines in Ukraine. Since 2015, when the country decided to shift from the local to international
procurement of vaccines, Ukraine has had enough vaccines to provide immunization coverage for all
age groups. The growth of the child immunization rate (in accordance with the National Preventive
Vaccine Calendar) has been achieved through a shift to the triennial planning of vaccine
procurement; the provision of conditions to meet demand from health care facilities for
immunobiological preparations for vaccination in full; the revision of the National Preventive Vaccine
Calendar; and the cancellation of re-vaccinations against tuberculosis at seven years of age (to reduce
the number of injections for a child during preventive immunization). With UNICEF assistance,
Ukraine optimized the immunization schedule in line with World Health Organization and UNICEF
recommendations.
The evaluation finds that UNICEF contributed to long-term and strategic behaviour change through
its communication and behaviour change campaigns, and through capacity development for
healthcare institutions and health professionals on the importance of vaccination, vaccines supplies,
distribution and storage.
Based on the secondary evidence collected and reports reviewed, the capacity building of health
workers helped to increase demand for vaccines, with health workers being the main source
of information for parents on vaccination. A campaign carried out in 2020 reached a combined total
of over 7.9 million people across Ukraine. Survey results46 showed that the approach, which featured
science-based messaging from an authoritative health messenger, increased both knowledge about
new COVID-19 safety measures and confidence in the safety of continuing routine vaccination. While
the ‘emotional’ approach showed no statistically significant effect on attitudes toward vaccination,
parents’ attitudes towards vaccination improved as a result of UNICEF’s interventions.
Despite the challenges related to COVID-19, UNICEF provided continuous support to the Ministry of
Health (MoH) in the implementation of health reforms through the creation of effective dialogue and
capacity building platforms to raise the awareness of health professionals on health management and
public health. UNICEF led multiple discussion platforms among those leading on public health
opinion, including government officials, on effective healthcare services for children in the context of
health reform, vaccination and the COVID-19 pandemic.
There is not enough evidence, however, to clearly indicate the extent to which UNICEF provided the
requested technical assistance to the MoH on international procurement. Similarly, insufficient
evidence was identified as to why the Government transferred procurement to another international
organization. While there might be a connection between the former and the latter, the available
evidence is insufficient to prove UNICEF’s contribution as regards capacity development of the MoH
46 Surveys to identify the effects of pro-immunization campaigns were carried out by the UNICEF Ukraine CO. See, for
example: ‘Building Confidence to Continue Routine Immunization During COVID-19: UNICEF Ukraine Insights for Impact
Project with Facebook’, blog post, UNICEF Ukraine, Kyiv, 10 June 2021 (www.unicef.org/ukraine/en/stories/building-
confidence-continue-routine-immunization-during-covid-19).
42
and its institutions or the quality of the strategic partnership with the Government on the
procurement of vaccines.
The evaluation indicates that UNICEF contributed to a lesser extent to the capacity building of newly
established Central Procurement Agency (CPA) of the MoH. In partnership with other international
organizations UNICEF aimed to develop the CPA’s human resources policy and good governance but
stopped supporting this institution when vaccine procurement was transferred from UNICEF to
another international organization. This also indicates that an exit strategy to transfer skills and
practices in public procurement to the State has not been prepared and discussed with partners.
The Voluntary National Review (VNR) report proved that progress was observed in terms of positive
perceptions on vaccination – a finding that was also confirmed by a study conducted for the Ukraine
Health Index (2019). Health Index research shows that 80.4 per cent of people had a positive or
rather positive attitude towards vaccination in 2019, compared to 70.9 per cent in 2016, while the
percentage who had highly negative views had almost halved.
Two main risks have, however, been identified by the evaluation.
- The COVID-19 pandemic has affected access to healthcare services in general, and to routine
immunization in particular. The pandemic has caused delays in supplying the Meningococcal C
conjugated (MCC) vaccine for new-borns and, as a result, around 50,000 children have not been
vaccinated at the correct time since 2020.
- Political changes have impacted the efficiency of procurement processes and resulted in
frequent changes to the policy development agenda. The health reform agenda has not changed
significantly, but the constant changes in the management of the MoH, a lack of institutional
memory and the rapid turnover of key staff have led to some gaps in UNICEF programme
implementation. UNICEF has tried to mitigate this risk through the orientation its work to the
oblast and local levels.
Strategic, policy and legislative initiatives initiated in the health area by UNICEF under this CP seem
to have been stopped or delayed as a result, primarily, of the COVID-crisis. For example, less progress
was registered in the area of “Evidence-Based Data, Development of Policy and Strategy and Design
of MCH Service”, although UNICEF contributed to the overall reform of the introduction by the MoH
of a new model of care delivery for mothers and children and advocated for their inclusion into the
package of care financed by the State. In addition, national trainers were trained in 2020 in this area
and there was support for national legislation and normative frameworks related to nutrition and
healthy lifestyles in schools.
Despite several interventions in the area of “adolescent health”47, implementing policies and/or
strategies for the integration of key HIV/AIDS interventions into child-centred service points have
only partially materialized. Limited improvements were also registered on “health workers
providing home-visiting services with adequate skills related to early detection and intervention for
children with developmental risk, delay or disabilities” and a “costed implementation plan for
maternal, new-born and child health care available in selected districts”.
Some overall progress was registered on access to drinking water in NGCAs and along the Line of
Contact as the Government has increased investments in the water sector since 2019 in cooperation
47 These interventions include support to the establishment of the National Adolescent Health Advisory Group and to
drafting the law on the minimal age of consent for adolescents to receive health services, as well as an online course on
adolescent health for primary health doctors.
43
with development partners.48 Nonetheless, in eastern Ukraine access to sanitation continues to be
limited and the hygiene situation deteriorated in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. A 2020 survey
by REACH indicated that 23 per cent of people in the GCA do not report protecting themselves from
COVID-19 by washing their hands.
UNICEF’s contribution is aligned to the overall developments under WASH. The CO applied several
strategies with success (including work on infrastructure) to provide a large proportion of the
population in the conflict area with access to water, hygiene kits or key hygiene items. This set of
interventions also demonstrates the greatest results at scale for under this outcome. As underlined
by the WASH Evaluation Report (June 2021), the e-voucher system put in place by UNICEF was
“effective at giving households the ability to buy their own hygiene products or other items”.
UNICEF also contributed to WASH through evidence-based advocacy (at international level, e.g., 58
reports on incidents/attacks and their consequences), communication (e.g., a Children’s Cinema
Festival across the conflict-affected regions and reaching more than 51,000 children with
edutainment on hygiene practices) and through building partnerships towards a common goal.
UNICEF also contributed indirectly to better quality water in conflict areas by procuring the
necessary chemicals for water treatment companies and by initiating assessments on the hazardous
potential use of water treatment chemicals with the objective of developing a transition strategy for
the water companies.
Further steps are to be taken to contribute at scale to institutional or policy level impact. Although
the WASH evaluation report confirms that emergency interventions were reduced and that UNICEF
started to work closely with water companies to ensure access to water in conflict areas, it also finds
that action at national level, i.e., the River Basin Management Plan, the environmental strategy, and
communication and advocacy with the relevant ministries, needs a more systematic approach. Also
at institutional level, less progress is registered on the consistent application in government facilities
and other public spaces of the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) protocols developed with
UNICEF support or the implementation of Menstrual Hygiene Management within schools’
programmes.
As access to water is prioritized, UNICEF’s contribution in terms of sanitation is limited to the support
(sewage pumps and fittings as well as treatment equipment) provided to wastewater treatment
plants and the rehabilitation of water networks on water safety, heating systems, sewage networks
and toilets in 94 educational and 19 health facilities.
UNICEF’s contribution to observed progress on children’s access to equal opportunity-based
learning, adapted to the needs of the most disadvantaged
The evaluation registered important developments in the field of inclusive, quality education during
the timeframe of the CP from a strategic and programmatic point of view. These include the 2018
adoption of the “New Ukrainian School’’ approach including the “Safe-schools” concept; the adoption
of a central budget subvention to support inclusive education in municipalities and increased salaries
for teachers who work with children with disabilities in 2019; and the endorsement of the Basic
Component of pre-school education together with the launch of the Early childhood education rating
system (ECERS) pilot phase and of the new Law on Complete General Secondary Education in 2020.49
In the area of healthy nutrition in school, the Action plan to implement the National Strategy for Safe
and Healthy Education in the New Ukrainian School for 2021 was adopted in 2020.
48 In 2018, nearly 30 per cent of people living close to the contact line experienced frequent water shortages, either daily
or weekly. This decreased to 28 per cent according to a 2019 WASH cluster study (for households using centralized
potable water as their main source).
49 COARs 2018-2020; SitAn 2021.
44
Access to early childhood education (ECE) has improved since 2018 but considerable efforts are still
needed to ensure an adequate coverage at this level. In terms of access to general education, the
number of children in school rose from 3.783 million in 2015/16 to 4.138 million in 2019/20 across
the country, a rise of 9.4 per cent. However, the enrolment rate is unclear as a result of differences in
data provided by SSSU and MoES, and there are major difficulties in the conflict area as a result of
attacks on education facilities and limited data.
UNICEF has made important contributions at strategic level to national achievements in several
ways. It has supported improvements in the evidence base for decision-making, for example, through
teacher training and support for the development of a positive learning environment, as well as the
provision of supplies.
While many interventions are focused on conflict areas, the interventions at strategic level have
nationwide effects. Under the current CP, UNICEF has provided technical or financial support to the
MoES to develop or update and review important policy documents, i.e. the Basic Component of
preschool education; the Concept of the preschool education with a focus on safe, quality and
inclusive preschool education for disadvantaged children; the draft National Strategy of Inclusive
Education 2020-2030; the endorsement of WHO’s International Classification of Functioning,
Disability and Health (ICF); and the implementation of the Programme for International Student
Assessment (PISA) through the establishment of an interagency coordinating process.
UNICEF has invested a great deal of effort in the production of evidence to facilitate policy- and
decision-making. After the “Safe Schools concept” was modelled in 14 education facilities in eastern
Ukraine with the involvement of local authorities, the MoES integrated this model into all 25 in-
service teacher training centres to scale it up. The Government has continued to endorse the Safe and
Child-Friendly Schools (SCFS) model to integrate the principles of a child-friendly, safe and protective
learning environment, particularly in the conflict-affected areas of Eastern Ukraine. The Out of School
Children’s Report, the Ukraine SCORE Index developed by UNICEF with SeeD, and the National
Assessment of Schools’ preparedness to provide education during the global pandemic and the
launch of ECERS have provided evidence used by the Government at national level (in most cases),
or in the conflict areas.
Given the importance of teachers’ qualifications to determine the quality of education, UNICEF scaled
up the Life Skills Education (LSE) programme in the context of the New Ukrainian School reform
agenda through in-service teacher training and the development of a new online module. More than
21,000 teachers across the country had completed the LSE course by the end of 2020, and 25 in-
service teacher training centres took up the elements of the safe school concept.
Limited progress was registered in terms of children benefiting from alternative approaches to ECE,
despite the implementation of other actions at this educational level, e.g., the capacity building of pre-
school personnel and of parents on quality pre-schooling, and a plan to support the introduction of
alternative child-friendly modalities of pre-school education services in selected municipalities
across Ukraine, developed by UNICEF and the MoES.
At the levels of primary and secondary education, UNICEF provided many children in conflict areas
with education supplies, support for early childhood development (ECD), learning kits, sports
equipment and more. However, only a limited number of children in humanitarian situations have
accessed formal or non-formal basic education and completed the full cycle of compulsory inclusive
education.
45
Case study – Children and youth empowerment and participation in Ukraine
A detailed Process Tracing analysis was carried out to assess the contribution of UNICEF Ukraine in
the area of children and youth empowerment and participation. The complete assessment and results
are presented in Annex 2.
The evaluation found that UNICEF has made an important contribution in this area through:
- improvements of the national youth policy in Ukraine, triggered by the undeniable
improvements in the quality of the policy framework, including the strategy, action plan and
law on youth
- increased capacity to take youth into consideration in local policies and by local authorities,
as a result of the expanding implementation of the Child and Youth Friendly City Initiative
(CFCI) and the great interest generated by the initiative among municipalities and local
institutions
- the creation of conditions for participation of young people, using face-to-face and online
tolls, including – but not limited to – U-Report and UPSHIFT
- support for the resilience and participation of young people in social cohesion building in
eastern Ukraine.
The success of UNICEF Ukraine in using the U-Report, Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs), UPSHIFT
and in the implementation of CFCI had already been recognized by UNICEF global and regional teams
and has been presented in a number of UNICEF’s global publications.
UNICEF has implemented several initiatives on eastern Ukraine. The data collected indicate that it
is one of the very few organizations that supports young people in eastern Ukraine and
independent reports show that its activities are effective. Building on its two-year programme
on conflict resolution skills, UNICEF and the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) have
developed peer-to-peer mediation toolkit and a video tutorial on solving conflicts and have promoted
these resources among 1,000 educators in the conflict-affected area.
Studies have found that collaborative and executive skills, in combination with support for parents
and teachers – both covering children and young people in Eastern Ukraine through UNICEF-
supported projects – have made a significant contribution to building resilience among adolescents
exposed to violence in their microsystem, i.e., at school or at home. In addition, adolescents that are
resilient to conflict exposure are more likely to be characterized by supportive relationships with
their peers, an emotional connection to their school, inter-dependent values, collaborative problem-
solving skills and a greater tolerance of diversity.50
A separate study on this area has concluded that UNICEF initiatives have “positively contributed to
the psychological well-being of school-age children in the areas affected by war: by reducing the levels
of negative behaviour of children in schools and reducing the levels of distress through psychological
work.” It also finds that “UNICEF interventions also contributed positively to reducing the isolation of
IDP families and children and increasing the sense of normality and community living of those affected
by the war.” 51
In 2019 alone, 27 youth-led advocacy campaigns and 56 youth-led community-mobilization projects
were implemented in eastern Ukraine in the framework of the UPSHIFT initiative. However, there is
no independent evidence, other than the reports provided and drafted by UNICEF, on the
effectiveness of UPSHIFT in empowering and engaging young people in that part of the country.

Nonetheless, interviews with independent observers from academia underline that UNICEF has a
strong team and projects in the region and that it is the most important organization working on the
participatory approach and the involvement of youth in eastern Ukraine.
UNICEF initiatives have involved many adolescents and young girls and boys directly. However,
based on the available evidence the evaluation is only partially confident that UNICEF ultimately
contributed in a substantial manner to the empowerment, engagement and participation to
young people in Ukraine (at national level), in line with the Theory of Change (ToC) considered
for this evaluation (as presented in Annex 2).
Evidence at national scale does not show important or significantly increased levels of young people’s
engagement and participation in civil society actions and decision making in Ukraine. A 2020 Save
the Children research project with children aged 3 to 17 found that girls and boys feel that adults do
not listen to them or value their concerns. The study suggested there are pervasive attitudes in
Ukraine that children’s opinions are not important and that adults know better than children. This
contributes to limited opportunities for children’s views to be taken into consideration during
decision making. This frustrates children and adolescents, who feel they have valuable insights to
offer.52
Although there have been undeniable improvements in Ukraine’s youth policy, the budget of the
youth programme accounts for only 2 per cent of the budget of the Ministry of Youth and Sports and
this reduces the chances of a well-implemented policy. Youth participation structures remain
weak, youth participation is limited, and there is not enough evidence to show that many
vulnerable young people have more chances to participate. One area that needs to be
strengthened in relation to UNICEF’s initiative for adolescents and youth participation (other than in
eastern Ukraine) is the availability of enough tools and methods to encourage the participation of
vulnerable and marginalized children.
The impact of youth empowerment and engagement initiatives at the level of local and
national authorities remains unclear. Although youth- and child-responsive plans have been
developed in several municipalities, there is no consistent evidence about the
implementation of the activities planned or, therefore, about the long-term commitment of the
local authorities. This is relevant in the context of the widespread risk of tokenism. Data collected
from interviewees and results of the U-Report show that tokenism (youth engagement in a
‘decorative’ and ‘manipulative’ way) continues to be an important bottleneck for meaningful youth
participation.
There is, therefore, a need for sustained advocacy, taking advantage of the window of opportunity
generated by the reform of the youth policy in 2021, to promote regulations on youth consultation at
local level, and to promote student and youth councils at school and community level. Such an
approach needs to be supported by the Government and development agencies and should be
provided with the necessary tools to empower and engage young people, drawing on the model of
the initiative already initiated.
UNICEF’s contribution to observed progress concerning an integrated and family-oriented child
protection system and increased access of all children and youth, particularly the most
vulnerable, to protective community-based services

Overall progress in the child protection area has been more limited than progress seen in relation to
education and mother and child health. While UNICEF has made several contributions to this area,
only some of them have triggered or have the potential to trigger results at scale.
At strategic level, UNICEF has contributed to deinstitutionalization reform through the financial
framework drafted on the ‘money follows the child’ principle and contributed to the area of J4C (see
below and Annex 2). Several initiatives of evidence-generation, including piloting of the Barnahus
model were carried out, including a 2018 knowledge, attitudes and practices study that documented
widespread beliefs that reinforce the culture of violence, a 2019 alternative care system assessment
that fed into the National Plan of Action on Deinstitutionalization (DI) Reform approved by the
Government and on-going DI reform. Recommendations have contributed to a new guide and state
procedure on the enrolment of children in residential care to introduce additional ‘gatekeeping’
measures. Together with other UN agencies, UNICEF has developed a paper on challenges and
recommendations for the birth registration of children born in the NGCA. In the area of violence
against children, communication for behavioural change has been a far-reaching strategy. This has
included the “Talk against violence” programme, a multi-media-based movement that aims to foster
a dialogue on domestic violence, including violence against children and gender-based violence, and
that has reached more than 7.5 million people.
Results at scale are observed in areas where a large number of children are reached by and benefit
from UNICEF’s interventions, particularly in the conflict area, where the Barnahus model has been
piloted. A total of 123,500 children and caregivers have been provided with psychosocial support,
and UNICEF has provided online consultations nationwide to 30,000 children and caregivers through
the child helpline. In addition, close to 3,000 women, girls and boys have been provided with risk
mitigation, prevention or response interventions to address gender-based violence (in the context of
the COVID-19 pandemic), and 3,000 of the 40,000 social workers who work with children in Ukraine
have received training.
As a result of slow progress at national level, as described above, a more limited impact has been
achieved in relation to the availability of “an alternative care policy in line with the 2009 Guidelines
for the Alternative Care of Children”, despite numerous contributions from UNICEF. These have
included the ongoing monitoring of the alternative child care system jointly with the Office of the
Ombudsperson, the Ministry of Social Policy and the Ukrainian Child Rights Network; the
development of the Handbook on quality standards for alternative care and the Implementation
Handbook on international standards for child protection and alternative care, and the recent
initiatives of piloting the transformation of three baby-homes in two regions of eastern Ukraine.
Case study – Justice for children (J4C)
A detailed Process Tracing analysis was carried out to assess the contribution of UNICEF Ukraine to
justice for children (J4C). The complete assessment and results are presented in Annex 2.
As emphasized by one of the key stakeholders interviewed, “UNICEF has been a driving factor in J4C
reform in Ukraine”. The evidence allows the evaluation to be highly confident about UNICEF’s
contribution to improved cooperation among stakeholders in the area of J4C, by co-chairing
the Inter-Agency Coordination Council on J4C and the sub-group on J4C under the Justice Sector
Donor Coordination Working Group (Government-Donor instrument).53 In the same vein, UNICEF
has supported the Government in reviewing or drafting the National Strategy for Reforming
53 The Group brings together the Ministries of Justice, Social Policy, Health, Education, Police, Office of the General
Prosecutor and other sub-national, development, CSO partners and academia.
48
the Juvenile Justice System (already adopted) and the legal framework for J4C, through
technical assistance, external expertise and evidence-based advocacy.
The evaluation found, however, that the collected evidence is not sufficient to draw a firm conclusion
on UNICEF’s contribution in terms of improved capacity, particularly from a policy and institutional
point of view or improved practices at the level of the judicial system. The 2021 Situation Analysis
(SitAn) argues that there is still a need for further advancements in the legal framework and the
development of professional skills in the area of child-friendly justice procedures, and that
procedures currently applicable to children in contact with the law do not comply with the Guidelines
on Child-friendly Justice of the Council of Europe. This is also, however, because J4C reform is still in
a relatively early stage. The Law on J4C has not yet been approved but would introduce child-friendly
practices such as restorative actions, mediation, integrated services for children in contact with the
law, alternatives to incarceration, and trainings for professionals in child-friendly procedures.54 In
addition, the institutionalization of the Restorative Programme is also recent.
Despite the recognized positive effects of pilot projects, their scale up is at an initial stage, and,
therefore, their effects at scale at national level remain limited. There are positive prospects in this
regard, as the resources needed to organize Barnahus centres across the entire country have been
approved. In addition, services provided to children in contact with the law have improved as their
focus on child-friendly approaches expands. The data collected from interviews show that the
adoption of Unified Standards for the Training of Specialist in the Field of Justice for Children and
further, the provision of trainings for prosecutors, advocates and police officers within Juvenile
Departments, have led to the improvement of their skills regarding the application of child-friendly
procedures, including mediation.
Based on the analysis conducted by the evaluation team, the strengths that facilitated and supported
the observed improvements were: (1) UNICEF’s credibility among duty bearers and civil society
organizations; (2) the commitment of public bodies to the development of J4C reform in Ukraine,
including the initiation of pilot projects and the provision of state funding for their implementation;
(3) the active role of training bodies and educational institutions in improving education and training
programmes for professionals within the judicial system working with children. The analysis
identified hindering factors in this area, such as: (1) lack of administrative data and (2) political
instability, which has resulted in delays in finalizing and adopting legislative documents.
UNICEF’s contribution to observed progress concerning child inclusion and social policies,
through integrated social protection policies, efficient financial allocations and equitable local
service provision
The evaluation also identified little progress in the area of social protection – an area that is strongly
influenced by Ukraine’s decentralization process and its consequences for the availability of
adequate services for the population, including children.
Overall, despite a relatively high level of government spending on social safety nets (which accounted
for 4.9 per cent of GDP as per the COARs for 2018/201955), and despite some measures taken in 2020
(i.e., extending subsidy programmes as well as the duration of payments and providing one-off
payments to vulnerable groups) the country’s performance in reducing poverty and protecting the
vulnerable, as measured by coverage of the poorest and adequacy of benefits, remained limited in
54 The Law was submitted to the Ukraine Parliament for revisions in mid-2021.
55 Based on SitAn 2021: “Public expenditure on social protection and social services has stood at around 9 per cent of GDP
with a downward trend in 2018 and 2019, and in a context of a longer-term decline as a share of GDP.”
49
2020, as in the previous two years (COARs 2018-2020). Overarching developments were registered
in 2020 and 2021, but their impact on children has not yet been documented.
The decentralization process has led to significant changes for social services and there are concerns
that it has, in the short and medium term, reduced the availability of social services on the ground, or
the capacity of service providers.56 Many specialists in children’s services have left their work,57 and
the capacity of the personnel within the system has decreased significantly, as some services have
been re-established with personnel who have less experience and training, or have not been re-
staffed.
UNICEF has contributed to social protection in several ways. At a strategic and policy level, UNICEF
Ukraine promoted two universal child-focused policies in 2018 that led to a 2 per cent increase in the
social protection budget (the ‘Baby box’ and the partial reimbursement of the costs for all families
and/or caregivers who officially employ nannies for children below six years old). UNICEF has also
promoted the reform of integrated social protection. However, while the methodology proposed by
UNICEF was officially endorsed by the Government, its effects are not yet visible on the ground.
Aiming to strengthen integrated social protection, UNICEF has worked with partners to strengthen
the capacity of municipalities and the knowledge of the Government through a package of
interventions on the social planning, budgeting and monitoring of social services, case management
practices and inter-sectoral cooperation, as noted in the COAR 2019. Evidence generation was one of
UNICEF areas of interventions. In 2019, for example, a Child Poverty Report was produced, followed
by the 2020 publication of a rapid assessment of the state budget for 2021. The latter focused on
education, social protection and health and provided strong insights into current trends on budget
allocations, as well as a comparison of the impact of COVID-19 on budgeting for social sectors.
In terms of institutional change, UNICEF organized integrated social protection trainings attended by
more than 200 officials and professionals from several municipalities. Officials from 12 conflict-
affected municipalities in Eastern Ukraine attended a special session of integrated social protection
training adapted for the prevailing conditions. UNICEF advocacy also resulted in the allocation of EU
funding for training municipalities in 2018.
In terms of its contribution to access to services, UNICEF and UNOPS have continued to implement
the universal ‘Baby box’ programme. Since its launch, more than 270,000 new-born children and
mothers have received this box, which contains essential hygiene supplies, developmental toys,
clothes and UNICEF-developed educational materials. All in all, through the advocacy and strong
cooperation with key stakeholders, more than 400,000 children have enjoyed better social service
provision at local level according to the 2020 RAM. Notable successes have included the community
mobilization campaign organized for the Ministry of Social Policy (MOSP) that reached 1.3 million
people on social media, as well as the updating of the Ministry’s web platform with contacts for local
social services and its online promotion in 2020.
UNICEF’s contribution to observed progress concerning an adequate child rights monitoring
system in place in Ukraine
Challenges in terms of availability of good quality data are documented and confirmed in several
sources, including SitAn 2021 and programme documents. Little progress has been registered in this
area and UNICEF has made a substantial contribution to the improvement of available data and to
56 Analytical Report on the Results of the Desk Review

evidence-based policy making, as underlined by all primary and secondary data available for this
evaluation.
UNICEF had made an important contribution in this area through the development of the ‘shadow’
report on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in Ukraine. For the first
time, the national report has included information on children affected by the armed conflict in
eastern Ukraine, including those from internally displaced families. Reports have helped to address
a number of critical gaps across child rights and have supported advocacy efforts, according to the
COAR 2018. In 2020, the Government of Ukraine produced the first SDG VNR with UNICEF support.
SDG monitoring has also been significantly improved with UNICEF support. UNICEF has built the
capacity of the dedicated SDG department under the State Statistics Service of Ukraine (SSSU), and
two SDG monitoring reports were produced and published: “SDGs Ukraine” – a 2020 Monitoring
Report with disaggregated data on more than 400 indicators; and “SDGs Ukraine” – a 2020 Factsheet
covering 183 national SDG indicators.
UNICEF has built capacity at national level (i.e., Government, SSSU, Ombudsperson system, NGOs) on
disaggregated data collection for CRM and has supported the development of a comprehensive CRM
monitoring system. Child-related data have been collected by SSSU with UNICEF’s assistance and
submitted to UNICEF’s Regional Office to inform the TransMonEE database, according to the RAM
2020.
UNICEF has advocated successfully for the development of a methodology for gender data collection,
with 50 child-related indicators incorporated into the SSSU data collection methodology and has
contributed to the State Strategy for Regional Development for 2021-2027 from the perspective of
child sensitive targets/indicators. UNICEF and the Office of the Ombudsperson have also developed
and implemented a CRM methodology for child rights monitoring at sub-national level, according to
the RAM 2020.
3.3.1.2. Conditions and factors that influence the impact of UNICEF’s Country
Programme
The data collected for the evaluation indicate several bottlenecks that hinder the impact of UNICEF’s
CP in Ukraine (as presented in section 3.3.2). However, the evaluation also identified factors that
have a positive influence on the impact of UNICEF Ukraine.
- The quality of cooperation and partnerships, based in particular on internal factors
that are specific to the UNICEF CO:
o UNICEF’s emphasis on building effective partnerships with central authorities and
the long-term, consistent and perseverant interventions supported in each area of its
work
o UNICEF’s emphasis on building effective partnerships with local public authorities
(LPAs) for the implementation of modelling and pilot projects
o The use of UNICEF’s comparative advantages to mobilize partners.
- UNICEF’s access to a valuable accumulation of knowledge and its use of strong
international expertise
- UNICEF’s brand recognition in Ukraine, which supports:
o effective partnerships and cooperation with public authorities
o the effectiveness of communication campaigns.
- UNICEF’s nature, as a UN Agency, that allows the CO to work in Ukraine’s conflict-
affected area with both a humanitarian and a developmental aim, without antagonizing local
and international stakeholders.
51
3.3.2. Did UNICEF identify and reassess bottlenecks throughout programme
implementation?
UNICEF identified risks and bottlenecks in the programming phase and reassessed them
regularly during CP implementation. While the risks and bottlenecks identified during
programming and the initial mitigation measures were formulated in rather broad terms,
UNICEF Ukraine developed a wide set of activities during implementation to alleviate their
impact on the results expected.
Bottlenecks created by limited financial resources limited the correlation between decentralization
and other reforms in health, social services and education. The risks related to the COVID-19 crisis,
political instability and the conflict in eastern Ukraine were mitigated mainly through: support for
national coordination and capacity development; advocacy to strengthen legal and policy
frameworks; modelling and pilot projects implemented in partnership with LPAs; high-level political
dialogue to protect the rights of children; and capacity building for those involved in service delivery
at local level.
A set of general bottlenecks and risks are included in the CP documents, as identified by the
SitAn 2017. The critical identified risks are:
- political instability
- the conflict in eastern Ukraine
- the Government’s inconsistent and insufficient commitment and ability to advance systemic
reforms
- economic hardships
- deficiencies in policies and legislation and their implementation
- weak and often unmotivated public administrations
- high reliance on external funding
- a lack of national data that has limited UNICEF’s ability to identify and address the main
bottlenecks.
The more specific bottlenecks identified include:
- the insufficient realization of children’s rights in the healthcare and immunization systems
- lack of reintegration services and the unsatisfactory quality of family-substitute services
(specifically foster care, family-type homes for children) and unreformed institutions
- the lack of a strategic comprehensive picture of how the rights of children with disabilities
and special needs are addressed (i.e., the development of an inclusive education system)
- an underdeveloped network of services to support biological families, particularly for
families with vulnerable children.
Risk mitigation measures planned in the CP documents are also formulated in rather broad terms:
- effective financial management and accountability of human resources
- well-defined contingency plans, ensuring flexibility in the operational response
- effective coordination and collaboration at the national level.
The interviews allowed the evaluation team to identify the most important bottlenecks and risks that
have affected CP implementation in practice. There are two key bottlenecks: (1) the use of using state
and international resources for the humanitarian response, with limited fiscal and political space for
social-sector reforms; and (2) the lack of a correlation between ongoing reforms on decentralization,
and reforms to health, social services and education. The team also identified three main risks that
52
seem to have affected UNICEF’s work: (1) the risks related to COVID-19; (2) political instability; and
(3) the risks related to a deteriorating conflict in eastern Ukraine.
In terms of UNICEF ability to respond to these bottleneck and risks, based on interviews carried out58
the evaluation finds that the projects and activities implemented by UNICEF Ukraine are in line with
the mitigation measures planned in the CP documents, although the initial planning was, as
mentioned above, formulated in a rather vague manner. However, the CP was revised when the
COVID-19 outbreak began, and new activities related to the pandemic were incorporated. UNICEF
had to revise its internal operations and digitalize internal/external procedures, processes and
programme activities. As indicated by interviewees, UNICEF introduced corporate flexibility,
designed to facilitate emergency operations with adjusted risk management that contributed to the
delivery of the results achieved.
In response to the COVID-19 risk and its secondary impacts, UNICEF has undertaken several actions
and overall, its response has been perceived to be very positive by stakeholders in the country.
Among its many response activities, UNICEF designed and implemented a national Risk
Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) strategy using corporate digital channels,
which played a crucial role in the effective delivery of organizational global priorities. In the early
days of the COVID-19 lockdown, UNICEF developed and presented to the Minister of Social Policy a
policy brief with recommendations on socio-economic risk mitigation measures, which emphasized
the importance of keeping families with children at the front of Ukraine’s response to the pandemic.
To mitigate the risks related to political instability UNICEF conducted activities on advocacy,
policy development, capacity building, partnership and pursued high-level dialogue. While the
Government remains committed to far-reaching reforms, these have not yet been coherently
designed and implemented. As a result, some services for children at local level have been abolished
without proper justification and without being replaced by other services. In this context, UNICEF
has become widely involved in the reform process, through consultations and work with
stakeholders on different levels to minimize the consequences of ongoing reforms on the well-being
of children. In 2021, for example, UNICEF prioritized its advocacy efforts to ensure access to public
services for vulnerable children.
UNICEF carries out four main types of activities in this area.
1) Support for national coordination and capacity development, as seen in:
• the Inter-Agency Coordination Council on J4C
• trainings on immunization (family doctors, medical staff from primary care institutions,
national stakeholders etc.); youth participation (youth leaders, youth NGOs, CFCI
representatives, etc.); and on J4C (police officers, lawyers, prosecutors, judges, etc.).
• comprehensive programming in eastern Ukraine where UNICEF continues to build the
capacity of local authorities to implement child-friendly budgeting, a child-friendly justice
system and an inclusive and violence-free learning environment for all; to ensure
uninterrupted water supply and sanitation services; to enhance essential health services
and quality health care at primary health care level; and to target the most vulnerable.
2) Specific advocacy to strengthen legal and policy frameworks
UNICEF supports a large number of strategic documents targeting children that were developed in
2020 and 2021 (with some still under development). Because UNICEF is involved in virtually all
strategic planning processes of importance for children in Ukraine, its involvement as a constant
58 A risk mitigation strategy was not provided to the evaluation team.
53
presence advocating for the rights of the most vulnerable children, helps to ensure a national legal
and policy framework to protect the rights of these children.
3) The implementation of modelling and pilot projects in partnership with Local Public
Authorities (LPAs) to test new methods and tools to support better cooperation.
The Barnahus model is one of the most successful examples: it has been implemented in cooperation
with local authorities and NGOs and has already been endorsed for scale up nationwide by the
Government. The CFCI in Ukraine has continued to be a strong instrument for child-friendly planning
and budgeting at municipality level, and its coverage has expanded to 35 municipalities (with more
than 100 municipalities interested in achieving child-friendly status). As indicted during interviews,
UNICEF has contributed to the capacity development of targeted municipalities on child and youth
participation, supporting youth initiatives and providing technical support for other local initiatives
to ensure the rights of the most vulnerable children.
4) Ensuring high-level political dialogue for protecting the rights of children.
UNICEF signed a MoU with the Office of the First Lady with a focus on five areas: (1) nutrition and
school feeding; (2) gender equality; (3) inclusive spaces; (4) healthy lifestyle and (5) awareness on
child rights. The MoU will be implemented through an Action Plan that is being developed via
bilateral consultations with UNICEF. The MoU paves the way for stronger advocacy at the highest
level of governance.
In the case of the side effects of the decentralization process related to the limited capacity of
local services and the loss of professionals at local level, no clear UNICEF strategy was
identified. However, the evaluation considers several partial strategies to have had some
success:
• the provision of online trainings at national and local levels for the roll-out and replication
of trainings where needed (as in the case of digital tools such as Learning Passport,
‘UPSHIFT Online’, U-Report, the national volunteering platform and the online training
programme on conflict resolution)
• the use of innovative approaches to capacity building on vaccination and the response to
the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 54 online sessions and interviews conducted live on
FB, YouTube and Zoom (simultaneously), reaching over 200,000 health workers and
other users
• the use of innovative training tools and methods to ensure that training is available for all
networks of professionals (as in the case of the training for lawyers-mediators)
• the use of local models of work to ensure local ownership and financial sustainability
(CFCI, Barnahus)
Responding to the risk related to a deteriorating conflict in eastern Ukraine, most of informants
and the evidence collected emphasized that the stabilization of the conflict transferred it to a ‘chronic
and protracted’ level, and, therefore, to regular business of UNICEF in eastern Ukraine. UNICEF
continues to highlight and monitor the situation of children trapped in this volatile six-year conflict,
aims to keep attention on the impact of the conflict on children high on the agenda, and provides
humanitarian assistance to conflict-affected children. Despite positive signs from the new
Government towards resolving the conflict, the situation in eastern Ukraine has remained unstable
and challenging.
54
3.3.3. Did different groups, including children and the most marginalized, benefit
in different ways from the Country Programme? Are the results likely to be
maintained over time?
The data and information collected show that the UNICEF CP in Ukraine and its
implementation considered, in general, the needs of the most marginalized children.
However, some groups of vulnerable children benefited less from the work of UNICEF, such as
children in rural areas, children with disabilities, and children with specific health issues. In
this context, better data disaggregation is needed to inform the CO’s actions and allow for a
better approach to the needs of the most vulnerable children.
Many actions by UNICEF Ukraine have targeted vulnerable children directly, and their contribution
to the improved situation of these children is presented in the previous section. Important results
have been generated, in the large part, by the special focus on the specific target group in terms of:
- children living with HIV
- children with special educational needs
- institutionalized children
- child victims of violence (in Vinnitsia region)
- Roma children (in Zakarpattya region).
The evaluation has identified a limited number of cases where vulnerable groups of children were
not taken into account by UNICEF’s interventions. For example, the lack of focus on vulnerable groups
in activities for the participation of children and young people (under the CFCI) means that this
generates more limited results for vulnerable children. In contrast, activities on J4C focus only on
vulnerable children. The evaluation did not identify any important areas where the situation of
vulnerable children targeted directly by UNICEF interventions did not improve, at least temporarily.
Children in rural areas and children with disabilities, however, have been less covered and, therefore,
fewer results have been generated for these children. The lack of disaggregated data or emphasis on
these groups are among the reasons for their more limited consideration and, therefore the impact
of UNICEF’s work is less visible for them.
There is a general agreement among stakeholders that the achieved results of UNICEF’s CP are
sustainable, although they face significant risks generated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related
economic and social impact for the most vulnerable. Other important risks for the sustainability of
the CP’s results were emphasized for UNICEF activities on immunization where no exit strategy and
plan to transfer the public procurement of vaccines from UNICEF to the Government has been
developed, leading to a halt in the provision of technical assistance to the MoH on both public
procurement and capacity building of the newly established CPA.
In general, UNICEF ensures its programme sustainability by:
1) advocating changes to legislation and policies (J4C legal framework, National Youth Strategy
and Law, Human Rights Strategy, etc.)
2) ensuring capacity building of staff that can extend and continue their work after the project
ends (curriculum for police, trainings for police, prosecutors, advocates, mediators, judges,
exchange of good practice)
3) ensuring that the best international practices are implemented and attain local ownership
(Barnahus)
55
4) raising awareness (CFCI, U-Report, evidence-based monitoring) based, among other
elements, on the conduct of behavioural research, and the analysis of the findings to identify
bottlenecks and key behaviours
5) defining measurable objectives that are aligned with Government priorities and partnering
extensively with national and local governments as well as a wide range of other
stakeholders, including NGOs and other implementing partners.
Considering the approach based on the five presented pillars, the evaluation considers that some key
UNICEF interventions, as reflected in policy and legislative frameworks, will have a positive
sustainable impact on vulnerable children and youth. Evidence in this regard will be available when
implementation of these new strategies and policies is more advanced.
The informants also underlined that some UNICEF initiatives were successful but not sustainable
because, in some areas, UNICEF did not develop a transition plan for the Government (as in the case
of Baby boxes and the procurement of vaccines and ARVs) and did not have an exit strategy. The risks
to CP sustainability include the contradictive initiatives of the Government that may undermine the
importance of CP achievements. As a result of low political will, for example, investment in policy and
strategic plans for deinstitutionalization has been slow and residential care remains the predominant
care option (boarding schools, orphanages, baby homes, etc.). This has resulted in weaknesses in
coordination across stakeholders, the lack of a multisectoral approach and ownership, and the lack
of a correlation between deinstitutionalization and decentralization reforms.
The evaluation team also observed a strong connection between the bottlenecks related to a lack of
connections between decentralization and other ongoing reforms and the general capacity of duty
bearers to provide services for children. Several stakeholders stated that any capacity building
activity is “doomed to be the work of Sisyphus” because better competences increase the motivation
for the emigration of professionals who work with children, as they increase their chances for
successful integration into another labour market.
Concerning the impact of COVID-19, the extent of this risk for the future remains to be measured.
However, the consistent work of UNICEF in close cooperation with the Government to respond to the
COVID-19 crisis allows for cautious optimism on the sustainability of the obtained results beyond
2021.
3.3.4. Which strategies or group of strategies were effective in producing results
at scale?
The summary of the strategies used by UNICEF Ukraine, presented in Annex 1, shows that the
CO utilized the entire range of strategies, as described in UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018-2022
and that all of them proved to be effective, especially when combined.
The change strategies used most frequently by UNICEF in Ukraine are as follows.
- Winning support for the cause of children from decision-makers and the wider public
using communication campaigns on immunization, WASH, protection in the context of
COVID-19, child protection and violence against children.
- Using the power of evidence to drive change for children by providing evaluation and
research in policy making and by advocating for improvements in the state statistical system
so that more data about child well-being can be used for better adapted policy plans and
measures. As mentioned, UNICEF is involved in virtually all strategic planning processes that
are important for children in Ukraine, and strategic documents have been developed in 2020
and 2021 (or are still under development) with UNICEF support.
56
- Developing and leveraging resources and partnerships for children, especially by
influencing domestic planning, financing and the delivery of services for children, using, as a
rule, two main tools:
o technical assistance support to key institutions (and duty bearers)
o the help and cooperation of implementing partners.
- Fostering innovation in programming and advocacy for children by promoting
modelling or pilot projects, most often in partnership with LPAs and local implementing
partners. The CFCI and Barnahus services in partner municipalities are among the successful
examples. Pilot projects have been implemented in the case of alternative care centres, child-
friendly schools and restorative justice and represent one of the most important strategies in
eastern Ukraine’s NGCAs.
The case studies conducted using process tracing allow for a limited analysis of the effectiveness of
strategies and combination of strategies used. The analysis is limited by the fact that the strategies
and the combination of strategies found in the case studies have similar levels of success. However,
two main lessons can be learned from the three cases.
- Innovative approaches, based on modelling and piloting projects, can be scaled up
successfully if and when they receive intensive support for institutional development.
Experience in J4C and adolescent participation shows that piloting at local level can ensure
fairly rapid results in the communities where they are implemented. But in all cases, there is
a need for more strategies to be implemented for successful scale up.
- The adoption of strategic and legal provisions is key for change and, in some areas, advocacy
is an indispensable step to drive such change. However, this evidence-based advocacy is not
yet generating change for children at scale directly, because most of the existing bottlenecks
are not legal, but are institutional and relate to practice.
- The development and leverage of resources and partnerships for institutional change in the
interest of the child is a key strategy for effective contributions by UNICEF. This is particularly
relevant considering the risks related to the loss of institutional capacity.
- The strategy of winning support for the cause of children from decision-makers and the wider
public needs to be applied, using separate tools to target both decision-makers and specialists
and the wider public. Generating the demand for quality services for children, adolescents
and young people, caregivers and the general public is a key step in changing social norms
and generating sustainable impact for children.
Last but not least, the evaluation finds that UNICEF has transitioned most of its support in recent
years from humanitarian aid to support for development, even in the conflict-affected areas in
eastern Ukraine. The partnership with LPAs has been instrumental in this transition and UNICEF
Ukraine has become one of the very few organizations working in eastern Ukraine to encourage
inclusive education and child and youth participation and to provide support for social and
psychological assistance beyond the immediate humanitarian needs.
4. Conclusions and forward-looking recommendations
4.1. Conclusions
UNICEF Ukraine’s Country Programme (CP) 2018-2022 has been implemented under
challenging circumstances. Going beyond the delivery of humanitarian aid in the conflict
57
areas of eastern Ukraine, UNICEF has initiated development actions that cover other parts of
the country.
Ukraine itself had embarked on a set of far-reaching reforms prior to 2017 in every area addressed
by UNICEF but also in inter-connected and horizontal areas such as decentralization. This reform
process implies significant and sustained efforts over a long period of time and has been affected by
almost ubiquitous political and institutional instability, particularly in 2019. In the third year of the
CP, the COVID-19 pandemic crisis posed another major challenge for the UNICEF CO and its CP and
the interventions envisaged had to be adjusted to react rapidly to the new needs of children, parents
and relevant institutions across the country. This added complexity to a context in which the most
vulnerable of Ukraine’s 8 million children, including children in conflict areas and those who have
been displaced, children in rural areas living in poverty, children in institutions care and children
with disabilities are in dire need of support. Adequate strategies and policies need to reach them –
and reach them fast.
Overall, and particularly in this complex context and considering the relatively short timeframe since
2018, this evaluation finds that UNICEF Ukraine has made important progress in furthering the rights
and well-being of children and adolescents in the country. However, this context remains sensitive
and unpredictable, and UNICEF Ukraine needs to take this into consideration when planning for the
future. The recommendations of this evaluation should contribute in this regard.
The evaluation finds that UNICEF is widely recognized as the main player in monitoring and pursuing
the fulfilment of the Convention of the Rights of the Child, as a UN Agency with a clear focus on
children, and with a comprehensive strategy. UNICEF’s unique position and brand are supported by
other comparative advantages – the most important being its technical knowledge, available in-house
or provided through other channels such as local partners or by tapping into UNICEF’s international
expertise.
The orientation of UNICEF Ukraine towards systemic change is also recognized, as well as, in this
context, the importance it places on evidence-based advocacy and technical assistance, aiming for
key and impactful changes in legislation and policy development and implementation. Stakeholders
also highly appreciate UNICEF Ukraine’s flexibility and the quick adjustment of its strategies, as well
as its openness to apply innovative methods for child rights and well-being (particularly with the
start of COVID-19 pandemic).
However, while UNICEF brand is very well known among stakeholders, they are less aware of
UNICEF’s plans, approaches, portfolio and results beyond their immediate areas of interest. The
increased visibility of UNICEF Ukraine would consolidate its role as a player that is uniquely
positioned to act in the interest of children in the country and may facilitate the greater roll-out of
the models and practices implemented so far.
In this context, the evaluation found that UNICEF interventions address children’s needs directly,
particularly in eastern Ukraine. UNICEF Ukraine remained well-informed on the changing needs of
children in the country and eastern Ukraine through numerous assessments, studies, reviews and
monitoring reports. This allowed for the necessary flexibility and adaptation of interventions,
particularly for UNICEF’s proactive participation in the COVID-19 pandemic response and recovery.
UNICEF planned activities for vulnerable groups of children in other parts of the country, including
children with disabilities, children growing up without parental care, children in conflict with the
law, displaced or most-at-risk adolescents, children living in poverty and/or rural areas, and children
living with HIV/AIDS. Overall, however, the needs of children outside Ukraine’s conflict areas are
covered to a lesser extent because of the need to prioritize resource allocation for children whose
needs are more urgent (due to situation in the conflict areas).
58
UNICEF Ukraine developed and implemented its CP in alignment with the SDG agenda 2030, but also
taking into consideration the gaps that remain in achieving the earlier Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), such as the very limited immunization coverage against DPT3, and the low levels
against measles and polio. At the same time, while the UNICEF CP is aligned with national priorities
and works intensively with the responsible governmental actors, UNICEF is also, in some cases,
pursuing priorities that are beyond (but not in contradiction with) the national agenda, e.g., as
regards the importance of pre-school education.
It is particularly challenging to obtain results at scale over a shorter period where the changes that
are needed require significant resources, as seen in the area of sanitation. As a result, not all of
UNICEF’s interventions have generated results at scale. For example, UNICEF has made a large
contribution to the availability and accessibility of vaccines in Ukraine. Perceptions on vaccination
and vaccination rates have improved considerably and UNICEF’s interventions, including wide-
reaching campaigns, capacity building of health workers and support to the Ministry of Health (MoH)
have made an important contribution to these developments at national level.
The evaluation also finds, however, that while UNICEF has provided continuous support to the MOH
to respond to the COVID-19 crisis and to implement health reforms through the creation of effective
dialogue and capacity building platforms, the available evidence indicates a more limited success in
terms of the capacity development of the MoH and the Central Procurement Agency (CPA) and the
strategic partnership with the Government in this specific area. The exit strategy to transfer skills
and practices in public procurement to the State has not been prepared and discussed with partners.
On a positive note, UNCEF’s provision of the necessary antiretroviral drugs and other HIV treatment
commodities in the non-governmental controlled areas (NGCA) of Donetsk and Luhansk has had a
notable impact for people living with HIV, including children.
In the area of children and youth empowerment and participation, UNICEF Ukraine’s success in using
the U-Report, VNRs and UPSHIFT, as well as its implementation of the CFCI, are recognized by
national stakeholders, as well as by UNICEF global and regional teams. UNICEF is one of the very few
organizations that supports young people in eastern Ukraine and independent reports and data
collected for this evaluation show that this support is effective.
While UNICEF made an important contribution in this area at strategic and policy level (nationally
and locally), in leveraging resources from public sources, and involving a large number of adolescents
and young girls and boys directly, the evaluation could not identify results at scale at national level
in terms of their empowerment, engagement and participation. Pervasive attitudes persist in
Ukraine, such as the views that children’s opinions are not important and that adults know better
than children. Although there have been undeniable improvements in Ukraine’s youth policy, it is still
unclear whether youth- and child-responsive plans developed in several municipalities are being
implemented. Taking into consideration the fact that the youth programme accounts for only 2 per
cent of the budget of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the evaluation concludes that there are specific
risks to the sustainability of UNICEF’s interventions in this sphere.
UNICEF has driven reforms on justice for children (J4C) in Ukraine and has contributed to one
important success in this area: a fall in the number of children offenders held under protection in
specialized facilities (juvenile prisons). However, evidence on ultimate results at scale is not always
present or unequivocal.
UNICEF has also made a major contribution to improved cooperation among stakeholders inJ4C, by
co-chairing the Inter-Agency Coordination Council on J4C and the sub-group on J4C under the Justice
Sector Donor Coordination Working Group. It has also contributed to the drafting of the National
Strategy for Reforming the Juvenile Justice System (already adopted) and the legal framework for
59
J4C, and has carried out capacity building activities for a wide variety of actors in the system who act
in direct contact with children.
The piloting of the Barnahus Model and its take up by the Government is an important indication of
UNICEF’s contribution to J4C. However, this reform is relatively recent, and changes still need to
become visible in terms of improved practices at the level of the judicial system, and the adoption
and effective implementation of legislation, strategy and tools, including the Barnahus model.
In addition to the gaps identified in terms of evidence to support UNICEF’s contributions to changes
at national level, the evaluation identified a series of gaps in the CP performance framework.
The analyses carried out indicate that, while UNICEF Ukraine uses a wide set of strategies that are in
line with the UNICEF Strategic Plan, 2018-2021, it is their combination that may trigger results at
scale, which would be obtained when:
- UNICEF acts at a strategic level, by developing and contributing to the development of
strategies, national policies and related legislation, as seen for the National Youth Strategy
and the National Strategy for Reforming the Juvenile Justice System but also with the ‘baby
box’ and the second universal service introduced with UNICEF support, i.e., the partial
reimbursement of the costs for all families and/or caregivers who officially employ nannies
for children below six years old
- UNICEF partners with key stakeholders in the area covered to leverage resources (of all
types) and create synergy as a precondition for impact
- UNICEF builds the capacity of stakeholders at all levels (national, regional and local) as seen
in the case of social workers to increase the immunization rate; and with police officers,
prosecutors, advocates-mediators and other professionals working on J4C, as well as youth
workers
- UNICEF acts at target-group level through far-reaching behavioural change campaigns as
seen in the ‘Talk against violence’” programme, a multi-media-based movement to foster
dialogue on domestic violence (including violence against children and gender-based
violence), that has reached more than 7.5 million people
- UNICEF reaches out directly to a large proportion of the target group, particularly children
themselves but also parents, health workers, educators and teachers, as seen in: the piloting
of the Barnahus model in eastern Ukraine, with 123,500 children and caregivers provided
with psychosocial support; UNICEF’s provision of online consultations nationwide to 30,000
children and caregivers through the child helpline; the provision of almost 3,000 women, girls
and boys with risk mitigation, prevention or response interventions to address gender-based
violence; and the training of 3,000 of Ukraine’s 40,000 social workers who work with children
- UNICEF ensures that investments and interventions are continued over a longer period of
time to enhance and consolidate results (for example in the immunization area), rather than
acting over shorter timeframes that do not allow for the measurement and identification of
impact
- UNICEF’s modelling projects are taken up by the Government and/or the Government makes
funds available for this purpose (only a few innovative interventions implemented so far by
UNICEF Ukraine have been fully scaled-up at national level.
This combination of strategies is possible when the relevant government institutions and decision-
makers provide the necessary support. Here, continuous and strategic advocacy is essential, based
on in-depth knowledge and evidence on children’s needs and the prioritization of effective actions.
Applying this combination of strategies, as UNICEF Ukraine does to a certain extent (although not yet
in a very systematic manner) helps UNICEF to continue reforms during periods of political and
institutional change but may also create new entry points beyond those that already exist (e.g., taking
60
into consideration and supporting the Government in line with the EU standards the country aspires
to achieve).
This evaluation has identified several cases of successful advocacy, including on the issue of water in
eastern Ukraine, where the Government understood the need to step in and lead the process. UNICEF
Ukraine has also made an important contribution to improvements in the overall monitoring of the
extent to which children’s rights are observed in the country (i.e., through the development of the
‘shadow’ report on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in Ukraine and
the SDG Voluntary National Reviews), but also in terms of collecting in-depth evidence and data, for
example through regular surveys on immunization. All of UNICEF’s activities have considered the
differences between children and the needs of the most marginalized to a large extent and many of
the results presented above are benefiting primarily the most vulnerable children. Nonetheless, the
evaluation has identified groups of vulnerable and marginalized children that are less covered, such
as children in rural areas, children with disabilities and children with specific health issues. For
example, one critique of the UNICEF initiative for adolescents and youth participation (with the
exception of this initiative in eastern Ukraine) is that it does not include enough tools and methods
to encourage the participation of the most vulnerable and marginalized children beyond the UPSHIFT
approach. This may be explained by the fact that marginalized groups and their specific needs are
not clearly identified in the CP (in areas where actions do not already target specific vulnerable
categories). There is also a lack of data that would allow the CO to take a more tailored approach to
the needs of the most vulnerable children.
Stakeholders see UNICEF’s results as largely sustainable, although they are confronted with
significant risks generated by the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and social consequences for
the most vulnerable. Although UNICEF takes measures to ensure the sustainability of its actions,
there is room for improvement in terms of convincing the Government to scale up models, tools and
approaches, and on the development of concrete exit or transition plans for the Government to
continue activities such as the baby box programme, the procurement of vaccines and antiretrovirals
(ARVs), and support for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
The evaluation finds that the impact of UNICEF Ukraine is hindered by important horizontal
bottlenecks and risks. There are two key bottlenecks: (1) the use of state and international resources
for the humanitarian response while having only limited fiscal and political space for social-sector
reforms; and (2) the lack of a correlation between ongoing reforms on decentralization, and those on
health, social services and education. There are three main risks that seem to have affected UNICEF’s
work: (1) the risks related to COVID-19; (2) political instability; and (3) the risks related to the
deteriorating conflict in the east.
UNICEF has identified and reassessed horizontal bottlenecks throughout the implementation of the
CP and has implemented strategies to cope with them. To mitigate the risk of political instability, for
example, UNICEF has conducted activities on advocacy, policy development, capacity building,
partnership and high-level dialogue. In addition, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been
the focus of the CO since 2020, with results that have been highly appreciated by all of the
stakeholders consulted for this evaluation. New approaches and innovative solutions have been
introduced for data collection and communication (i.e., youth volunteer’s platform, online U-
Reporting). The ability to meet online was made easy, as well as cost- and time-effective, by the
introduction of more virtual tools and platforms and location-independent methods to create virtual
meetings, events and discussions.
However, while some risks and bottlenecks are identified in the planning stage, and are documented
in the CP as such, these are formulated in rather broad terms. A fully-fledged risk-mitigation strategy
61
is missing or is not documented, and this is also true in terms of a strategy to counteract the negative
impact of decoupled sectoral and decentralization reforms.
UNICEF Ukraine builds partnerships at national level with line ministries, the Ombudsperson’s Office
and governmental institutions to advocate for systemic changes across the country. It has well-
defined visions and understanding of partnership strategies in some areas, such as with the Ministry
of Justice. In other areas, such as health reform, UNICEF’s role is less clearly articulated. Nonetheless,
partnerships with regional health and social care institutions are important for UNICEF, enabling it
to quickly collect information from the field and respond to the most urgent gaps. In partnerships at
regional level with city and regional authorities, UNICEF is valued for its role in bringing stakeholders
together for cross-sectoral and multi-disciplinary cooperation.
Partnerships with traditional and social media – complemented by innovative approaches such as
online competitions, video diaries, and engagement with bloggers – have played a crucial role in the
effective delivery of organizational global priorities and in addressing the growing need for
trustworthy sources during the COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF’s partnership with the private sector is
more recent and is sustained through institutional business engagements. Both UNICEF staff and
their counterparts assess UNICEF’s partnership with UN agencies as requiring improvement, with
some exceptions. New partnerships of strategic importance have also been also developed with, for
example, the Office of the First Lady of Ukraine, to further children’s rights in five areas: nutrition
and school feeding; gender equality; inclusive spaces; healthy lifestyles; and awareness of child
rights.
A large majority of partners among government, academia and service providers assess cooperation
with UNICEF as being highly satisfactory. One exception can be seen in the area of health, where
stakeholders perceive room for improvement in terms of UNICEF’s availability, support and
involvement with stakeholders as a result of its limited staff capacity or temporary lack of staff, its
focus on operational activities as opposed to strategic involvement, or in cases where UNICEF’s focus
has shifted from one area or topic to another.
While there is recognition of UNICEF’s capacity to trigger multi-institutional cooperation and to bring
various stakeholders together to achieve synergies, the CO’s impact would benefit from a more
comprehensive strategic approach in this regard, by creating, where possible, country-wide
coalitions of donors and international organizations, including all of the big players in Ukraine. This
is particularly important in areas where inter-sectoral coordination is necessary, e.g., coordination
between public health reform, and inclusive education, deinstitutionalization and (as seen during the
COVID-19 crisis) existing inter-ministerial coordination structures have been dismantled, or the
position of the chair no longer exists.
The evidence collected for the evaluation indicates a high degree of awareness on gender equality in
UNICEF Ukraine. Its CP and its implemented actions respond, to some extent, to the gender equality
challenge. However, the analyses carried out in the planning phase on specific gender challenges in
all of the areas addressed by UNICEF are less systematic and, consequently, the CP has incorporated
gender equality only to some extent in its provisions; no specific output is formulated on this topic,
but the performance framework contains gender disaggregated data, where possible.
UNICEF Ukraine takes the gender equality principle into account in several areas of CP
implementation, while developing methodologies and collecting data, and within the strategic
documents developed. Nonetheless, the approach is not systematic in this phase, and, as a result,
UNICEF Ukraine remains more gender responsive (acknowledging and considering the specific and
differing needs of women and men) and less gender transformative, addressing to a more limited
extent the causes of gender-based inequalities and working to transform harmful gender roles,
norms and power relations.
62
4.2. Lessons learned
A number of lessons learned have emerged from the evaluation process. These need to be seen
in the wider context of the CP, i.e., UNICEF’s actions have focused on humanitarian aid but also
on development at national level, in a large country with complex needs, with some progress
registered in the reform of health, education and social protection systems, but with new
challenges posed by decentralization reforms and the COVID-19 pandemic.
One of the lessons identified by the evaluation is that, particularly from an impact and sustainability
perspective, it is essential to strengthen the capacity of both national and local government staff to
ensure the implementation of reforms and/or new policies. This has proved to be particularly
important in Ukraine’s context of decentralization (for example, of social services), as most regional
and local staff have lacked the instruments and individual and institutional capacity to act in line with
the new strategic and legislative framework. A focus on strengthening capacity at local and regional
level could counteract the negative effects of changes at the political level and of crises such as the
COVID-19 pandemic and ensure the continuity of services to children.
Another lesson learned is that, although eastern regions remain affected by the conflict, children in
other parts of the country, particularly in poorer and remote rural areas, have significant needs
related to WASH, access to health and social care, quality education and so on. UNICEF Ukraine should
support the Government to meet these needs.
Advocacy efforts are often based on context and opportunity, including in areas not prioritized by
the Government (such as early childhood development and care, and mother and child health).
However, continuous, more systematic and strategic advocacy would enable UNICEF to react quickly
to changes in government, and to possible situations in which previous positive decisions are
reversed (such as the universal child grant). At the same time, it is vital to partner with key donors /
international institutions in Ukraine – such as the World Health Organization (WHO), World Bank
and International Labour Organization (ILO) – to create synergies and generate results at scale and
at system level, particularly as significant financial resources are necessary to meet the existing needs
of children.
Experience in areas where modelling projects have been developed and implemented, but also in
areas that have received many years of support from UNICEF – such as WASH and immunization –
indicate the need for the preparation of exit strategies, either together with the intervention itself or
as soon as possible during implementation. This is important to ensure that the resources invested
are leveraged by national authorities and the necessary preconditions – including legislation,
financial resources and capacity – are in place for the investments made and for their results to be
sustained.
4.3. Recommendations
At the time of the Ukraine crisis, Ukraine CPE report had been finalized and CO had
conducted numerous meetings discussing evaluation recommendations and possible
actions. However, due to the unprecedented situation and the scale and nature of the
crisis, UNICEF Ukraine CO is no longer able to finalise their Evaluation Management
Response. Given the urgency and scale of needs, and considering the complexity of the
crisis, UNICEF Evaluation Director has lifted the requirement for the Ukraine Country
Office to provide Management Responses within 60 days as required by the Evaluation
Policy. The Country Office can file Management Responses once there are improvements
in the operating environment.
63
The recommendations of this evaluation apply to the overall strategy, thematic focus and
balance of the CP. The aim is to propose the appropriate continuation and development of
UNICEF’s work in Ukraine, based on the partnerships, teamwork and results of the Country
Programme 2018 – 2022, taking into account the challenges encountered. The
recommendations have been discussed extensively with the CO team and have been
prioritized on the basis of applicable areas (programming/strategic or
implementation/operational) and urgency (short-, medium- or long-term).
Recommendation 1. Strategic. Long term. During the implementation of the new Country
Programme
Engagement of key stakeholders to ensure synergy. UNICEF Ukraine should pursue strategic
partnerships in a more systematic manner with both the Government and key stakeholders in the
country, including other international organizations and other UN agencies, to strengthen the
protection of children’s rights. UNICEF Ukraine should create a country-wide coalition that involves
all stakeholders supporting children’s rights, to consult and coordinate interventions in their
interests, at both managerial and technical level (through the Commission on Child Rights,
coordination boards, working groups, decision-making platforms and advisory committees on the
rights of children). The Delegation of the European Union in the country should become an important
member of this coalition, in order to align reform and policy efforts to European standards.
Strengthening partnerships will further enhance inter-sectoral coordination of the implementation
of policies for children in Ukraine.
Private sector engagement. With a view to increasing resource mobilization, UNICEF Ukraine
should strengthen partnership with the private sector by developing an improved private
fundraising strategy, based on an evaluation of previous efforts. This partnership should be
thoroughly documented, communicated and promoted to encourage more businesses to invest in
child rights protection.
Recommendation 2: Strategic. Long term. During the implementation of the new Country
Programme
Continuous action to obtain sustainable results. UNICEF Ukraine should facilitate actions that
need to be continued for results at scale, such as the implementation of national strategies and
legislative frameworks; innovative actions; further training of staff involved in policy development,
implementation and service delivery (such as social workers or medical staff); child rights
monitoring activities; and platforms that enable the voice of children and youth to be heard.
Recommendation 3: Strategic. Long term. During the implementation of the new Country
Programme
The institutionalization of model frameworks. To enhance the sustainability of its interventions,
UNICEF Ukraine should develop exit/transition action plans as early as possible in the process to
enable a smooth transfer of responsibilities to national and local authorities, as well as the scale-up
of the models piloted. The CO should develop concrete action plans for steps to be taken by the
institutions themselves in the first phase (before ownership is established) and should support them
in this process.
Recommendation 4. Strategic. Short term. During the design of new Country Programme
Implementation of effective change strategies. With a view to obtaining maximum results with
the resources available for the next CP, UNICEF Ukraine should select priority areas where an
64
effective combination of strategies can be applied, particularly in terms of strategic partnerships,
resource leveraging and capacity building.
The mapping of system bottlenecks. For each area covered, UNICEF Ukraine should identify, as a
minimum, the main specific risks and bottlenecks and integrate mitigation measures into the design
of the intervention (for example, if the support of decision-makers is insufficient, UNICEF should
increase effective advocacy, make the necessary expertise available, support assessments or policy
proposals, or extend partnerships at regional and local level).
The systematic pursuit of the needs of vulnerable groups of children across the whole
country. In the next CP, UNICEF Ukraine should assess in greater depth the extent to which certain
vulnerable groups of boys and girls have specific needs and take these into account in the design of
interventions.
The alignment of the Country Programme with Agenda 2030. UNICEF Ukraine should build more
on Agenda 2030 and ground its results in the national SDG targets and indicators. This may provide
additional arguments for closer engagement, ownership, and sustainability with the relevant
ministries, authorities and officials and may add an additional trigger for better cooperation with the
UN family.
Recommendation 5. Strategic. Long-term. During the implementation of the new Country
Programme
Strategy-based advocacy, evidence generation and best practices. Advocacy and evidence
generation should be undertaken systematically. UNICEF Ukraine should develop an advocacy
strategy that covers all stakeholders, considers their interests and power, and defines the most
appropriate advocacy strategy to be taken with each stakeholder. One of these strategies should be
the promotion of the best practices and innovative approaches implemented successfully by UNICEF
Ukraine.
Recommendation 6. Operational and mixed. Short-term (during the drafting of the new
Country Programme Document) and long-term (during the implementation of the new Country
Programme)
Evidence and progress. UNICEF Ukraine should develop ex-post monitoring procedures, as well as
procedures to enhance the availability of evidence, particularly for the medium- and long-term
changes triggered by its interventions (and that are not captured by the programme performance
framework). In this regard, the CO should formulate outcomes in the new CPD that are attainable in
the timeframe and with the resources at hand, and incorporate evidence collection in a monitoring
procedure that covers the period beyond interventions, at least in the evaluation plan.
The indicator system. The indicator system in the new Country Programme Performance
Framework needs to be improved to enable adequate regular monitoring. This would, therefore, aid
the identification of gaps between performance and the targets initially set, trigger corrective
actions and show UNICEF’s contribution to wider changes at national or regional level.

5. Annexes
Annex 1. Summary analysis of UNICEF Ukraine effectiveness and impact
66
The table below is mainly based on RAM and Annual Reports of UNICEF Ukraine CO.59
Output indicators are registered according to the 2020 RAM – the latest available report, although there have been changes of indicators operated since
2018. However, for newly formulated or introduced indicators there are often no data and they are not appropriate for impact evaluation.
Outputs related to COVID-19 response are not included in the table, because all indicators in the monitoring framework are reflecting effectiveness, not
impact – therefore are not under the scope of the evaluation. UNICEF Ukraine response to COVID-19 pandemic is analyse primarily under relevance.
Note on the assessment of UNICEF impact based on the outcome and output indicators in the Country Programme Document:
Although most of the indicators analysed are – according to UNICEF denomination – output indicators, they are not only measuring direct results of each activity conducted by UNICEF.
They also potentially show short term changes with direct relevance for children at scale, either referring to the situation of children, changes in public perception, attitude or behaviour
or systemic changes that enable institutions to fulfil better their role in providing services for children and protecting their rights.
Indicators in the table are marked on their relevance for the assessment of effectiveness or impact. And when impact can be measured, the type of impact is identified as: (1) better access
to services/direct improvement of the situation of children, (2) behavioural and attitudes change; (3) institutional change (including institutional capacity raised); (4) change in policy
(including strategies, plans, laws, legislation of other nature/level); (5) improvement of financing for children
Indicators in RAM 2020 but not in 2021 Resource Matrix are in with green. Indicators newly inserted in the latter, are in blue. This second set cannot be considered by the analysis anyway,
as the related data is from 2021 onwards.
Strategies identified in the table are a simplified presentation of UNICEF Strategies as in the schema below.

2018 and more than 100,000 families had already
benefitted by year end. It is expected that
approximately 360,000 families will receive a ‘baby
box’ on an annual basis. (2018)
In 2019, UNICEF jointly with UNOPS continued the
implementation of the universal ‘baby box’
programme. Since its launch, more than 270,000 new
born children and mothers received such box

well as hundreds of thousands of social media reactions.
This helped scale-up the child and family welfare agenda
in national public discourse. The renewed public
interest was used to advocate for a multi-stakeholder
dialogue around the formulation of a comprehensive
approach on child and family welfare. (2020)
Using its convening power, UNICEF co-chaired the
inter-ministerial commission on child rights with
government partners. The commission addressed
several gaps of inter-governmental coordination
across various reforms related to child welfare. It also
helped to advocate for the scale-up of child and youth
safety in different settings. (2018)
Children and youth actively participated throughout
the various stages of discussions with the
municipalities. With UNICEF’s support, a multi-
stakeholder coalition was established consisting of
government partners, the United Nations Population
Fund, national associations of municipalities and an
umbrella group of youth organizations.
Responding to a critical gap in locally driven social
protection services for children and families, UNICEF
promoted the reform of integrated social protection. The
Government officially endorsed the methodology, which
UNICEF developed and supported in 2018. UNICEF
organized integrated social protection trainings
attended by more than 200 officials and professionals
from several municipalities. The capacities of local
officials on case management methodology, inter-
sectoral cooperation, local planning and budgeting and
the establishment of social services were
strengthened. Officials from 12 conflict-affected
municipalities in Eastern Ukraine attended a special
session of integrated social protection training adapted
for the prevailing conditions. UNICEF advocacy resulted
in the allocation of European Union funding for training
municipalities. (2018)
Thanks to UNICEF’s advocacy and technical support,
the Government submitted the long-awaited 5th and
6th Consolidated report On the Realization of the
Convention on the Rights of the Child in Ukraine
covering the period from 2011 to 2017. Through a

network of the specialized non-governmental
organizations, UNICEF facilitated the development of
the ‘shadow’ report on Convention on the Rights of the
Child implementation in Ukraine in order to ensure an
impartial reflection of the situation on the rights of the
child in Ukraine. For the first time, the national report
included information on children affected by the armed
conflict in eastern Ukraine, including those from
internally displaced families. The reports helped to
address a number of critical gaps across child rights
and supported advocacy efforts. (2018)
UNICEF’s capacity development support resulted in
the development of a draft SDGs monitoring system
methodology to be approved by order of the Cabinet of
Ministers ‘on coordination of data collection and SDG
monitoring.’ To increase the awareness of media about
SDGs, UNICEF organized a training for journalists.
(2018)
In 2019, UNICEF commissioned a Child Poverty report
which aims at contributing to the knowledge on child
poverty, inequalities and informing the set of new
policies and strategies, including the new poverty
strategy for which consultations are starting early
2020.
Based on the data and recommendations stemming
from UNICEF commissioned ‘Budget brief on Health’,
UNICEF advocated for a more nuanced budget
planning on the role of sub-national governments in
primary health care financing. Based on the
expenditure data, UNICEF flagged out that newly
consolidated municipalities have a long way to become
champions of primary health care financing. (2019)

The first policy, which is based on a Finnish model,
provides a ‘baby box” to every newborn in Ukraine.
The second policy is a partial reimbursement of the
costs for all families and/or caregivers who officially
employ nannies for children below six years old. The
policy, which benefited 100,000 families, was enacted
through a special tax deduction scheme and was equal
to the minimum subsistence level.
Both policies are universal in nature. They directly
contribute to the realization of the Convention on the
Rights of the Child and the ‘no one left behind’ principle
of the SDGs. The adoption of the new policies resulted
in an additional US$105 million (0.4 percent of the
state budget, or 2 percent of the social protection
budget).
UNICEF submitted an official statement expressing
concerns about proposed legislative amendments
proposing to introduce an income conditionality to the
Universal Child Grant and transformed it into a targeted
program paid only to families whose per capita income
is below 15% of the benefit, while simultaneously raising
the benefit. Following a quick risk analysis on the
proposed policy amendments that - if approved - would
jeopardize its single universal child grant programme

UNICEF issued a public statement that within 24 hours

customized the global CFCI handbook, produced a

establishment of a baseline, and tracked the progress
for both SDGs and Convention on the Rights of the
Child at municipal level. (2018)
The CFCI initiative expanded from 22 to 32 various size

UNICEF continued advancing the Ending Violence
Against Children agenda promoting new programmes
aiming to prevent and address violence against children
in all settings (family, school, community, online). The
first national inter-sectoral conference on violence was
organized uniting different stakeholders to discuss
gender sensitive response mechanisms and policies. A
joint draft roadmap was developed with the objective
of Ukraine joining the Global Partnership on Ending
Violence Against Children. In eastern Ukraine,
recognizing the increased evidence of conflict impact
on attitudes and behavior of adolescents, UNICEF
expanded its programme on positive parenting. (2019)
A UNICEF-supported knowledge, attitudes and practices
study from June 2018 documented widespread beliefs
reinforcing the culture of violence. Sixty seven per cent
of adults interviewed believed that physical
punishment could be applied to a child with
educational purpose; 46 per cent of men and 32 per
cent women respondents believed that the victim of
domestic violence was guilty. And one in two people
believed that smacking children was not an act of
violence. (2018)

UNICEF also initiated a new partnership with Danish

analysis on child mine victims and mapping of
available services. This was the first ever attempt to
strengthen the protective environment for child mine
victims through community support networks and
awareness raising. It will contribute to the

The ongoing monitoring of alternative child care system
jointly with the Office of Ombudsman, Ministry of Social Modelling
Policy and the Ukrainian Child Rights Network, helped to
collect evidence on violations of child rights in 51 child
care institutions and advocate with 7 regional and
national authorities for the enhancement of gender
sensitive child and family-centered social protection
system focusing on prevention and “gatekeeping” at
local level. The monitoring targeted more than 2,000
children, including those living on the contact line
and/or left without parental care. It is noteworthy that
recommendations resulted in immediate follow-
up/decisions response from regional authorities, e.g.
per capita funding for food and supply was increased.
The monitoring also helped identifying inconsistencies
in legislation; unclear distribution of responsibilities as
well as lack of control over the implementation of
policies. (2019)
In 2020, the first ever national assessment of the existing
alternative care system was conducted. The final report
contains an overview of the child protection and
alternative care system in Ukraine and
recommendations that became the basis for the latest
revision of the National Plan of Action on

Under the ongoing DI reform, the transformation of
baby-homes is one of the national priorities. Thus,
UNICEF initiated transformation of 3 baby-homes in 2
Eastern regions of Ukraine. In the first 2 months of
implementation, 42 families received prevention
support and 52 children were prevented from
institutionalization. The project aims to strengthen the
existing and develop new preventive services to
support children and parents, inclusive of services for
children with disabilities. Development of complex
transformational plans for those baby-homes will start

urgent measures to prevent and combat domestic
violence, GBV, protection of rights of child-victims and
witnesses of violence, endorsing the Barnahus model. In
addition, implementation of the Council of Europe
(CoE) Lanzarote Convention became a priority for the
Parliament. Thus, UNICEF facilitated consultations
with the Law Enforcement Committee of the
Parliament, EU Advisory Mission and COE regarding
the legislative amendments necessary for the
execution of the Convention. (2020)
With UNICEF’s support, 12 municipalities in conflict-
affected areas of the Eastern Ukraine developed
working plans on combating VAC and GBV and around
480 professionals (educational professionals, police
officers, social workers, etc.) obtained skills and
knowledge on prevention of VAC and positive parenting.
In line with the Government priorities, UNICEF
initiated a pilot project on introduction of a Barnahus
model in Vinnitsia region for protection of child-victims
and witnesses of violence, including sexual exploitation,
abuse and trafficking. A thematic inter-agency Working
Group was established to develop regulations and
guidelines in support to the pilot. Also, the
Memorandum was signed with regional authorities
ensuring sustainability and ownership of the Barnahus
center. UNICEF supports the overall coordination,
capacity development of multi-disciplinary team of
professionals to cooperate in the framework of
Barnahus model (judges, investigators, prosecutors,
psychologists, social workers, advocates, etc.).
Also, UNICEF expanded its’ positive parenting
programmes aiming to prevent VAC, as well as
developed online courses for parents, teachers and
school psychologists. In particular, 2042 parents and
caregivers (110 fathers, 1932 mothers) received
knowledge on positive parenting through
online\offline sessions. Also, a comprehensive
programme for mothers serving their sentences in
detention, covering positive parenting, prevention of
violence, early childhood development was
introduced. (2020)

on schools and advocate with all the parties in the
conflict on the importance of respecting international
humanitarian law. Additional advocacy was conducted
with the Government of Ukraine to endorse the Safe
School Declaration. This included two roundtable
events, which contributed to an official
recommendation to sign the declaration issued by the
MoES to the Vice Prime Minister. (2018)
The first SCORE report jointly launched with MOES

cities and contributed to building 21st century skills
for over 4,700 young people. With a focus on youth
with disabilities, it contributed to advocacy for
inclusion, resulting in an Ukrainian UPSHIFTer
addressing the Parliament, the UN General Assembly
and taking over UNICEF ED Fore ’s twitter’s account on
Children’ Day.
In February UNICEF conducted two face-to-face waves
of UPSHIFT programme in Mariupol, offering
vulnerable adolescents to acquire skills and establish
their own social impact ventures. Second wave was
thematically focused on media literacy. With the
outbreak of COVID, UNICEF has equipped adolescents
with skills to cope with the pandemic circumstances
and engage them in emergency response.

cent before the conflict to approximately 53 per cent at
the end of 2017. Thirteen per cent of households
reported daily water shortages.
During 2018, UNICEF’s support was instrumental in
ensuring the provision of safe water to more than 1.7
million families living in the conflict-affected areas of
Eastern Ukraine, both in government controlled and
non-government-controlled areas. UNICEF supported
the major centralized systems operated by Voda
Donbassa and Popasna Vodakanal, as well as a number
of decentralized networks in remote areas of eastern
Ukraine, and responded to critical sanitation and
hygiene issues at facility and community level.
In 2018, the central water companies (Voda Donbassa
and Popasna Vodakanal) were provided with pumps,
pipes, fittings, and other necessary elements, to
replace defective or outdated equipment and ensure
uninterrupted water supply to 255,087 people along
the contact line. To strengthen the capacity of company
workers on safety and security as well as to reduce the

number of incidents, UNICEF supported mine risk
education sessions and first aid trainings.
UNICEF also assisted five small scale vodokanals in
Donetsk oblast and four in Lugansk oblast. An
assessment aimed at identifying major bottlenecks and
priority measures for each vodokanal was ongoing,
and support to develop rehabilitation and risks
mitigation plans will be provided in 2019. In the non-
government-controlled area of Luhansk, UNICEF
provided a sodium hypochlorite plant to Luhanskvoda
to improve access to safe drinking water, securing a
sustainable drinking water supply for 100,000 people.
This was the first project for UNICEF to assist
counterparts in transitioning from liquefied chlorine
gas as technology associated with high environmental
and civil risks, especially for areas located close to the
contact line, where the risks of chlorine leakage due to
shelling are high.
UNICEF supported the provision of water treatment
chemicals to water companies, benefiting 1,697,143
people. Since January 2018, UNICEF procured 438 tons
of liquefied chlorine gas, 285 tons of sodium
hypochlorite, 262 tons of activated carbon, 604 tons of
coagulant, 11 tons of flocculant benefiting nearly 1.4
million people in Donetsk oblast and 500,000 people in
Luhansk oblast. Given the safety and security risks of
chemicals, UNICEF initiated assessments on the
hazardous potential use of water treatment chemicals
with the objective of developing a transition strategy
for the water companies.
To reduce the number of leakages, UNICEF focused on
priority pipelines and rehabilitated parts of the
networks, e.g. 530 meters of DN 1400 pipe replaced
benefiting 500,000 people and pump-
motors/transformers benefiting over 3.2 million
people. Additionally, capacity of local service providers
was strengthened through a software supporting
Mariupol Vodakanal water system management, as
well as risk assessments conducted in 9 vodakanals
evaluating their strength and weakness to develop
water safety plans.
On water quality, UNICEF provided water treatment
chemical to the water companies benefiting around 1.5
million people. Complementarily to the water
treatment, UNICEF also conducted two thorough

assessments for both main water companies aiming at
setting up action plans to mitigate risks. In parallel,
UNICEF identified alternative and less hazardous
technologies and procured hypochlorite production
units installed on-site to replace chlorine gas.
In NGCA and along the contact line (0-5 km) in GCA,
UNICEF organized and assisted 90,000 people with the
distribution of water trucking and bottled water
during water supply disruptions resulting from
hostilities. (2019)
UNICEF ensured access to safe drinking water for
403,785 people in Donetsk oblast through provision of
water treatment chemicals to 8 filter stations of Voda
Donbasa serving the population on both sides thanks
to the procurement of 192 tons of liquified chlorine gas
and 2 tons of flocculant. Bottled water was provided to
support 35,414 people residents in rural settlements
affected by wildfires and centralized water cuts.
UNICEF also supported water trucking to two
checkpoints and educational, health care and social
institutions in settlements located along the contact
line benefitting 5,500 residents of villages and towns
and up to 20,000 people crossing the checkpoints on a
monthly basis. (2020)
Decentralized water systems (boreholes, water towers
and distribution systems) in 42 settlements were
rehabilitated ensuring the safe water supply of isolated
settlements for about 45,000 people. Water, sanitation
and heating systems were rehabilitated in 20 schools
and kindergartens and 11 healthcare facilities
benefiting over 25,000 people.

network strengthened its capacity to monitor child
rights and increased national representation through
new members (from 12 to 18). The cascade training
covered 85 regional non-governmental organizations
from all 24 regions of Ukraine. (2018)
In promoting the child rights agenda through media,
UNICEF significantly expanded its leadership by
increasing its media presence and engagement by
nearly a third in a year (from 105,000 to 145,000).
Despite continuous changes in the social media
landscape, UNICEF messages and campaigns reached
between 250,000 to 1,000,000 people every week
thanks to extensive local multimedia and video content
production on UNICEF interventions. (2019)
To strengthen monitoring of violations of child rights
at local level, including in alternative child care
institutions using the child tracking tools, UNICEF
signed a memorandum of understanding with the
Office of the Ombudsman, Ministry of Social Policy and
the Ukrainian Child Rights Network. Trainings of local
stakeholders were conducted. (2019)
Despite major existing challenges related to limited

Annex 2. Methodology for Process Tracing
Process Tracing is a theory-based evaluation method. It questions why and how change happens by
tracking evidence of each link in the causal chain. Therefore, it is suitable for the evaluation of
effectiveness and impact and, partially, the relevance as part of causal chain in the Theory of Change.
This method as a qualitative approach through ex-post design where there is no control group available.
It is distinguishable from other more commonly used approaches of evaluation because it focuses on
increasing our level of confidence in a causal story rather than trying to measure impact and attribute it
to a particular event. It rests on the belief that all processes, if correctly identified and specified, would
show empirical manifestations that if observed would increase our confidence on its existence.
The method includes assigning probabilities to assess the strength of within-case observations
and evidence of how and why an effect occurred.
Assigning probabilities to assess the strength of within-case observations and evidence can be
subjective, within the limit of the existing evidence. On the other hand, the entire Process Tracing analysis
is transparent: the evidence determining the probabilities assigned are presented to all readers of the
report and this allows stakeholders to understand the impact and contribution of UNICEF beyond the
numbers related to the evaluators own (subjective) assessment.
The impact case studies about UNICEF contribution on three selected areas – (a) adolescents and
youth participation and health; (b) inclusive education; (c) justice for children – are based on Process
Tracing. The reports sections dedicated to the impact case studies is structure according to the steps
that a PT evaluation needs to follow, explaining briefly in each sub-section what the evaluation team
did, following the six steps of Bayesian Updating in Evaluation set out by Befani (2019): 1)
formulating a contribution claim; 2) establish a prior level of confidence in it; 3) focus on one specific
piece of evidence at a time; 4) estimate the sensitivity of that piece of evidence for that contribution
claim (answering the question: If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?);
5) estimate the type I error of that piece of evidence for that contribution claim (answering the
question: If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?); 6) Update of the prior
into the posterior using the Bayes formula.
The contribution claims have been formulated in the Inception Phase of the evaluation and updated
based on the feedback from UNICEF Ukraine Country Office (CO), before data collection through
interviews. The prior level of confidence is established conventionally at 0.5.
The evidence used was collected from documents provided by UNICEF and the implementation
partners for each of the three selected areas mentioned above and from interviews. Prior to the
interviews, the evaluation team sent a list of the types of documents required to UNICEF CO and
received the most important documents. Interviews have been also used to collect evidences and
documents. Interviews are not considered independent evidence because the people interviewed
know each other and have been working together, sometimes for several years. This would make
them more likely to have a common discourse about the analysed subject. Even though complete
independence is not assumed, the interviews of public authorities and civil society organisations
about UNICEF’s contribution, its relative importance compared to other stakeholders, its reputation
and their trust in the organization are considered important evidences when documents are missing,
also considering that evidences on reputation and trust are traditionally based on stakeholders
contributions to the evaluation.
More iterations between the data collection and the analysis of the evidence can increase the
possibility of obtaining more supporting evidence and minimize issues arising from absence of
evidence. However, in practice, this process may increase the time and cost of the evaluation. For this
evaluation, only one iteration of data collection and analysis was possible, due to time constraints.

Assessment of UNICEF Ukraine contribution in the area of immunization
The analysis in this section uses Process Tracing to measure UNICEF Ukraine contribution in a
selected area of impact, namely the Immunization. As underlined in the section dedicated to the
methodology, we will present the change claim chain, as elaborated in the Inception Phase of the
evaluation and immediately after. Evaluation team will than present and analyse each claim in the
logical chain presented and assess the level of confidence for each claim and globally.

The analysis of each claim and the general conclusions are presented in the following sections.
Claim 1: UNICEF provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Health in order to ensure an
uninterrupted supply of vaccines through international procurement
a) Evidence
The legal framework developed in 2015 allowed international organizations including UNICEF
procure medicines, medical products and vaccines for the government using the state budget. The
state took such a step due to corrupt practices and limited competition have led to the delayed
public procurement of overpriced medicines and vaccines across Ukraine. The evidence of
adopted legal and policy framework for international procurement available at the MoH and the
government sites.
The evidence based on programme documents and reports provided by UNICEF and prove that since
2016 UNICEF supported the Government in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of vaccines through
international procurement. In 2017-2018 UNICEF also provided technical assistance to the Ministry
of Health by participating in the working group on the reform of the procurement of drugs, while
building the capacity of newly recruited staff from the recently established central procurement
agency (CPA) through their participation in the Vaccine Procurement Forum organized by UNICEF
Supply Division and capacity building.
The technical capacity of the MoH and of the MoH staff was strengthened in the areas of procurement
of drugs to the MoH (including the Central Procurement Agency (CPA) of the MoH). Policy-making in
this regard was also improved (through the Effective Vaccines Management assessment) and the
same is valid for policy implementation (trough optimization of the immunization schedule,
continued enforcement of the application of the new calendar, contraindications and guidelines for
simultaneous vaccines administration by healthcare providers).
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.7. The evaluators can be highly confident that UNICEF played an important role in the
healthcare reform with providing technical assistance to the MoH on procurement of vaccines in
2016-2019 which fully covered the needs in vaccines. Documents provided by UNICEF and all
interviews with stakeholders in the field of Immunization in Ukraine underlined the critical role of
UNICEF in capacity development, policy development and advocacy on routine vaccination and
behaviour change interventions in Ukraine.
But there is lack of evidence explaining why procurement of vaccines has been taken by the
government from UNICEF to another organization and the reason of why UNICEF stopped
capacity development the CPA.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.3. Overall, the evaluators are confident that the evidence could not be
observed if the claim is false. If the claim is false, this means that all documents and analysis provided
by UNICEF, including government documents and reports, the KAPs on Immunization and most
recent SitAn proved that the claim is true and the unanimous acknowledgement of interviewed
stakeholders allows evaluators to be reasonably certain that the evidence on initial UNICEF support
could not appear if the claim is false.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.7) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.3), the account evidence of the documents
and interviews increases to cautiously confident (0.7) the probability of the hypothesis of
UNICEF provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Health in order to ensure an
uninterrupted supply of vaccines through international procurement.

Claim 1 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this 0.7
evidence?
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the 0.3
evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.7
Claim 2:
UNICEF contributed, through technical assistance, to vaccine redistribution
a) Evidence
Documents and interviews show that UNICEF has been much more involved in the development of
vaccines redistribution before 2016 and it was mostly related to monitoring, stocks and availability
of vaccines at the local level. To strengthen the national immunization programme, UNICEF continues
to provide technical support to the public health center to monitor the availability of vaccines at
oblast and rayon levels, as well as in health facilities, and assist in facilitating vaccine redistribution.
Some informants indicated that UNICEFs’ efforts went into the planning of vaccines distributions, in
order to ensure that the government meets the demand for vaccines in each region accordingly to be
done at local and national level. Interviews showed that there were issues with calculation
on demand for vaccines, and situation appeared in which some regions needed more vaccines while
other regions recorded additional vaccines stocks.
In this context, UNICEF and the World Health Organization facilitated and participated in the
Effective Vaccines Management assessment. The primary aim of the exercise was to identify
bottlenecks and good vaccine management practices. The agencies also used the assessment to
increase the capacity of the Government in conducting immunization programme internal audits.
With UNICEF assistance, Ukraine optimized the immunization schedule in line with World Health
Organization and UNICEF recommendations.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity – 0.7. The evaluators can be highly confident that UNICEF provided technical assistance
to vaccines redistribution. But the evidence showed that, while procuring for the government UNICEF
was not in charge for redistribution of vaccines itself, rather give an advice through the MoH platform
on reforming health procurement or conducting relevant assessments.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability – 0.25. The evaluators are cautiously confident that the evidence could not
be observed if the claim is false. It is clear that the vaccines would not be available and accessible in all
sites prior UNICEF technical assistance on vaccines redistribution, or the cold chain would not apply
properly. At the moment of evaluation, UNICEF does not involve in either procurement neither
vaccines redistribution process or support.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.7) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.25), the account evidence of the documents
and interviews increases to confident (0.7368) the probability of the hypothesis of UNICEF
contributed, through technical assistance, to vaccine redistribution.

Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this 0.7
evidence?
119
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the 0.25
evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.7368
Claim 3:
UNICEF improved availability and accessibility of vaccines in Ukraine
a) Evidence
In 2018 MoH reported that due to international procurement and for the first time in 7 years, Ukraine
is fully equipped with the vaccines needed for monoprophylaxis according to the vaccination
schedule. All procured vaccines were WHO prequalified meaning that the quality of vaccines is
guaranteed. The government also released the National strategy of immunization until 2022 where
UNICEF provided inputs. The vaccine supply schedule has been agreed with UNICEF, taking into
account the proper cold chain of vaccines and region's capacity to store immunobiological drugs.
UNICEF continued to provide technical support to the public health centre (PHC) to monitor the
availability of vaccines at oblast and rayon levels. Thus, PHC reported that due to COVID-related
quarantine in the first half of 2020, immunization rates have deteriorated significantly. But by the end
of 2020 country managed to scaled up for missed vaccinations of children and reach the level of 2019.
However, there were remains a significant decline in diphtheria and tetanus vaccinations among
children aged 6 and 16, as well as adults.
UNICEF worked in the GCA and NGCA territories. In GCA UNICEF supplied fridges and cool boxes
bags for delivering vaccines, as well as conducted trainings for healthcare staff. The immunization of
children in the NGCAs remained a key priority for UNICEF. As part of its humanitarian response
programme, UNICEF delivered over 400 fridges and cool boxes and 100 items for control of the cold
chain system of the local health facilities. The UNICEF-supported polio vaccination campaign
continued in 2020 with IPV (inactivated polio vaccine), which was launched in 2019.
According to 2017 data, the coverage of routine vaccination of measles, mumps and rubella (CCP)
has more than doubled - the first dose of the CCP vaccine covered 93.3% of children aged 1 year, the
second dose - 90.7% of children aged 6 years.
Thus in 2018 at the request of the MoH, UNICEF has expedited the delivery of a measles outbreak
vaccine in Ukraine. 220,000 doses of the CCP vaccine, purchased from the state budget and under
international procurement scheme, have been delivered to the country.
2019 SDGs for children Report highlighted the epidemic situation in the country which has been
unstable with incidence of measles, rubella, epidemic parotitis, pertussis and diphtheria becoming
uncontrollable. Immunization coverage of infants in Ukraine has generally been growing in recent
years. However, it still remains insufficient, especially concerning Haemophilus influenza infections.
The progress in implementation of vaccination plans for older children currently varies between 22–
28 % (vaccination with ADT-M, second dose, at the age of 7 and over; and BCG-2, at the age of 7) and
88–89 % (vaccination with MMR-2 (at the ages of 6, 7 and over). This creates a pronounced risk of
epidemics, as less than 95 % of the population is covered with vaccination.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity – 0.7. The evaluators can be highly confident that UNICEF contributed to availability and
accessibility of vaccines in Ukraine. Providing the procurement service for the government UNICEF
ensure proper and time vaccines delivery, ensure its quality having WHO prequalification certificate.
But there is not so much evidence about UNICEF involvement in regular monitoring of vaccines
availability and accessibility at the local level, despite their partnership in monitoring with PHC at
the national level.
120
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability – 0.25. The evaluators are cautiously confident that the evidence could not
be observed if the claim is false. Although the increased level of immunization all over the country
cannot be false, the data of government monitoring and other evidences mentioned above prove that
the epidemic situation in the country in terms of vaccine-preventable diseases has been unstable
although the immunization coverage of newborns being growing.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.7) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.2), the account evidence of the documents
and interviews increases to confident (0.7368) the probability of the hypothesis of UNICEF
improved availability and accessibility of vaccines in Ukraine.

Claim 4:
Changes to the routine immunization calendar were introduced by the Government with
UNICEF support
a) Evidence
Last decade Ukraine has experienced outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. A 2011-2012
measles outbreak resulted in more than 16,000 reported cases of measles, and during the global
measles outbreak in 2017-2018, Ukraine had the highest rate of measles in the world, with over
47,000 cases recorded in 2018. In the latter outbreak, Lviv in western Ukraine had the highest
number of cases, correlating with greater resistance to and lower uptake of vaccinations are in
western Ukraine and in Kyiv, according to a 2014 survey.
In 2018 UNICEF reported about continuation to support the Government in monitoring the measles
outbreak, collecting data related to the outbreak and undertaking data analysis, while providing
communication support daily. Considerable challenges remained, and measles continued to pose a
national threat. And emphasized challenges next year, saying that despite all efforts immunization
continues experiencing challenges with coverage and quality of vaccination services, while
simultaneously responding to a measles outbreak (over 57,000 cases in 2019 with 20 deaths).
Catch-up campaign within the measles outbreak response was supported with in Lviv region in 2019,
as a result, MOH has reported that vaccination coverage against measles among school-aged children
in Lviv region has reached 90%.
According to recent UNICEF reports, changes to the routine immunization calendar are proposed
with UNICEF support and new vaccines (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV) were met favorably
by health authorities and will be introduced into the National Calendar for immunization in 2021.
Overall compliance with the national vaccination schedule among parents with children 0-6 y.o
dropped from 88% in 2019 to 77% in 2020 (at end of September). Changes to the routine
immunization calendar proposed were met favorably and new vaccines (pneumococcal conjugate
vaccine, PCV) are planned to be introduced in 2021.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
121
Sensitivity – 0.9. The evaluators can be highly confident that changes to the routine immunization
calendar ensured increasing the efficiency of measles vaccines for the youngest children. The figures
below showed how UNICEF supported the national respond and covered the gap in measles
outbreaks. The changes in the National Calendar of Immunization not only increased efficiency of
measles vaccines of children but also introduced new vaccines to be included in routine vaccination.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability – 0.2. The evaluators are cautiously confident that the evidence could not be
observed if the claim is false. The provided evidences and interviews proved that UNICEF supported
changes into the National Calendar of Immunization which expanded access to well-known vaccines
(measles) and brought new vaccines to be used in routine vaccination.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.2), the account evidence of the documents
and interviews increases to confident (0.8181) the probability of the hypothesis of UNICEF
provided changes to the routine immunization calendar were introduced with UNICEF support and
adopted to increase the efficiency of measles vaccines for the youngest children.
Claim 4 Evidence – Account and trail

Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this 0.9
evidence?
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the 0.2
evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.8181
Claim 5:
Long term and strategic behaviour change interventions supported and/or organised by
UNICEF
a) Evidence
Based on secondary evidence collected and reports reviewed, the component of capacity building of
house workers helped in increasing the demand for vaccines. The house workers are the main source
of information for parents on vaccinates. UNICEF has conducted many trainings with the house
workers.
Based on the informant opinion the attitudes towards the vaccination were very negative in Ukraine.
UNICEF was in the forefront on combating false information regarding vaccines and its quality.
UNICEF contributes to procuring vaccines was involved in educational campaigns and supported
campaigns against the anti-vaccinators.
Due to low vaccination coverage in previous years, the country has had an outbreak of measles since
2017, affecting more than 115,000 people and killing 41 people, including 25 children. In 2019, cases
of a deadly disease - diphtheria - were registered. Cases of tetanus in children are also registered in
Ukraine. In 2019 UNICEF supported primary school teachers to hold a lesson “Viruses. Bacteria.
Microbes. Protection against diseases”. During this lesson, children learn about infectious diseases
and protection from them, get a vision of the concept of evidence-based medicine and the concept of
disease prevention.
Moreover, responding the COVID crisis UNICEF and MOH have launched a national prevention
campaign, which highlights the benefits of vaccination against COVID-19 through the life stories of
Ukrainians who have already been vaccinated.
122
As of June 2020, only 28% of one-year-old children received the first dose of the measles, rubella, and
mumps (MMR) vaccine due at that age. On the same date in 2019, this number was 42%. The UNICEF
team decided to launch a national awareness campaign to remind parents and caregivers of the
importance of completing all routine vaccinations on time as well as highlight the new safety
measures that local health centers were using to keep health workers and families safe from COVID-
19. NICEF Ukraine recognized that the campaign’s success depended on crafting messages that
mitigated public concerns about vaccination safety during COVID-19. In order to figure out the most
effective messaging, UNICEF partnered with the Yale Institute for Global Health and Facebook to test
two message framings to determine how well the messages resonated with the target audience that
included parents and caregivers between the ages of 18 and 65. The campaigns reached a combined
total of over 7.9 million people across Ukraine. Survey results showed that the approach featuring
science-based messaging from an authoritative health messenger successfully increased both
knowledge of new COVID-19 safety measures and confidence in the safety of continuing routine
vaccination. The “emotional” approach, however, showed no statistically significant effect on
attitudes toward vaccination.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity – 0.9. The evaluators can be highly confident that UNICEF supported long term and
strategic behaviour change interventions. According to evidences and major interviews UNICEF is
one of the best international organization in organizing strategic and behaviour change
interventions, and communication. The figures and information above prove that despite COVID
crisis UNICEF took a proactive position in addressing the negative impact of COVID-19 and keep
supporting strategic behaviour change interventions on routine immunization and at COVID19
immunization also.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability – 0.15. The evaluators are cautiously confident that the evidence could not
be observed if the claim is false. Although evidence show for certainty regarding the number of
national strategies and behaviour change interventions have been initiated and supported by
UNICEF.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.15), the account evidence of the documents
and interviews increases to confident (0.8571) the probability of the hypothesis of UNICEF
contributing to long term and strategic behaviour change towards immunization.
Claim 5 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this 0.9
evidence?
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the 0.15
evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.8571
Claim 6:
The attitudes and demand towards vaccination among parents improved.
a) Evidence
Following efforts by the Ministry of Health and its international partners to improve knowledge
about measles and the importance of vaccination among healthcare workers and parents, as well as
to improve distribution of vaccines. By the end of 2017, 93% of 1-year-olds had received the first
123
dose of MMR, and 91 per cent of 6-year-olds received their second dose as recommended. MMR
vaccination rates remain below 95 per cent, however, which is the routine coverage to ensure
protection. Overall compliance with the national vaccination schedule among parents with children
0-6 y.o dropped from 88% in 2019 to 77% in 2020 (at end of September).
VNR report shows that progress towards higher positive perception towards vaccination that was
also confirmed by a study conducted for the Ukraine Health Index (2019). Health Index research
shows that 80.4 per cent had positive or rather positive attitude towards vaccination in 2019
compared to 70.9 per cent in 2016, while the percentage who had highly negative views had almost
halved.
UNICEF initiated the Baby Box project aims at guiding parents-to-be as to what they really need,
encourage them to be more selective, and reduce expenditure on baby goods. In the framework of
this programme UNICEF initiated and included targeted information materials to the baby boxes on
early childhood development and newborn health care (for example immunization, breastfeeding
etc.).
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity – 0.8. The evaluators can be highly confident that UNICEF introduced changes to the
routine immunization that improved demand towards vaccination among parents. There are not so
many reports proving the changes and improvements of parent’s attitude towards immunization, the
gap was covered during interview where informants proved that UNICEF contributed to
improvement the coverage of vaccination through changes the attitude of parents to vaccination.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability – 0.25. The evaluators are cautiously confident that the evidence could not
be observed if the claim is false. Even with limited number of evidences the evaluators could make a
resolution that claim is right, it could be obtaining from provided reports and also from indirect
indicators like immunization coverage that is growing every year (with small dropped down in the
beginning of COVID pandemic).
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.8) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.25), the account evidence of the documents
and interviews increases to confident (0.7272) the probability of the hypothesis of UNICEF
provided changes to the routine immunization calendar were introduced with attitudes and demand
towards vaccination among parents improved.
Claim 6 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this 0.8
evidence?
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the 0.25
evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.7272
Claim 7:
An enabling context for increased immunization coverage of children in Ukraine.
a) Evidence
According to VNR and other UNICEF reports indicating increase in the preventive immunization
coverage of newborns, this is as follows: against measles, mumps and rubella – 93.2% in 2019
(2015 – 63.2%); pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus – 85% (2015 – 26.5%); hepatitis B – 77.0%
124
(2015 – 25.4%), tuberculosis – 88.6% (2015 – 39.8%), poliomyelitis – 78.4% (2015 – 63.8%). In the
recent 7 years, due to a shift to international procurement, Ukraine has a sufficient quantity of
vaccines to provide immunization coverage of all the age groups that need it, according to law. The
growth of the population immunization rate (in accordance with the National Preventive Vaccine
Calendar) has been achieved due to: a shift to triennial planning of vaccine procurement; provision
of conditions to fully meet the health care facilities’ demand for immunobiological preparations for
vaccination; revision of the National Preventive Vaccine Calendar; and cancelled re-vaccination
against tuberculosis at 7 years of age (which allowed reduction of the number of injections for a child
during preventive immunization).
Despite some challenges with coverage and quality of vaccination services, measles outbreak in 2018,
the EPI is slowly increasing: DTP-3 for children below 1-year-old increased from 53.2% (2017) to
66.8% (2019). Attitudes of caregivers towards vaccination are improving steadily: in 2019, 88% of
parents intend to vaccinate their child according to the national vaccination schedule, compared to
84% in 2018.
During the COVID crisis, evidence show that the early national lockdown prevented many caregivers
accessing immunization services with consequences of reduced coverage for Q1 and Q2: as of 1 June
2020, 31,6% of children received DTD3 – compared to 33,2% in the same period of 2019, 30% of
children received Polio3 compared to 31,5 as of 1 June 2019, and 28,3% of children received MMR1
compared to 41,9% in the same period of 2019.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity – 0.8. The evaluators can be highly confident that the context for increased immunization
coverage children in Ukraine. The evidence provided above prove that UNICEF supported children
accessibility of quality vaccines, scaling up the children coverage of immunization. Reports provide
qualitative and quantities data that shows UNICEF role in ensuring immunization coverage of
children but after UNICEF lost the procurement its role in ensuring accesses to quality vaccines and
advocacy is less visible.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability – 0.3. The evaluators are cautiously confident that the evidence could not be
observed if the claim is false. Although the increased data of accesses to immunization and absence
of out stocks of vaccines in Ukraine led to the confidence that the claim is not wrong concerning
growing accesses to immunization in Ukraine.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.8) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.25), the account evidence of the documents
and interviews increases to confident (0.7826) the probability of the hypothesis of UNICEF
provided changes to the routine immunization calendar were introduced with the context for
increased immunization coverage of children in Ukraine.
Claim 7 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this 0.8

Conclusion
125
According to process tracing methodology, the confidence in the overall claim is set by the “weakest
link” (or lowest posterior) in the causal chain, corresponding to claim (UNICEF provided technical
assistance to the Ministry of Health in order to ensure an uninterrupted supply of vaccines through
international procurement) with a posterior of 0.7. This means that we can be cautiously confident
that UNICEF provided constant and requested technical assistance to the Ministry of Health
on international procurement. Moreover, it was not clear from provided evidence why UNICEF
stopped procurement and why government switch it to another international organization
that could be also connect with reduce technical assistance and capacity development of the
MoH and its institutions. The analysis allows evaluators to be more confident about the quality and
efficiency of procured vaccines for the government and improving the National Calendar of
Immunization, but there’re no evidence on strategic partnership with the MoH on procurement of
vaccines.

Documentary evidence and interviews indicate that due to the country decisions shifted to
international procurement since 2015, Ukraine has a sufficient quantity of quality vaccines to provide
immunization coverage of all the age groups that need it. The growth of the population immunization
rate (in accordance with the National Preventive Vaccine Calendar) has been achieved due to: a shift
to triennial planning of vaccine procurement; provision of conditions to fully meet the health care
facilities’ demand for immunobiological preparations for vaccination; revision of the National
Preventive Vaccine Calendar; and cancelled re-vaccination against tuberculosis at 7 years of age
(which allowed reduction of the number of injections for a child during preventive immunization).
UNICEF contributed, to a lower/some extent, to capacity building of newly established Central
Procurement Agency (CPA) of the MoH, which has to build capacity and take over the state
procurement from the international organization. In partnership with other international
organizations UNICEF aimed to develop human resources policy and good governance of CPA, but
after vaccine procurement was transferred from UNICEF to another international organization in
2020, UNICEF fully stopped supporting this institution which leads to the conclusion that the exit
strategy of transferring skills and experience to the state has not been prepared and discussed with
partners.
126
Despite challenges related to COVID-19, UNICEF continuously supported MOH in the implementation
of the health reform through the creation of effective dialogue and capacity building platforms for
raising awareness of health professionals on health management and public health. UNICEF led
multiple platforms of discussion among leaders of public health opinion, including government
officials, on effective healthcare services for children in the context of health reform, vaccination and
COVID-19 outbreak.
With UNICEF assistance, Ukraine optimized the immunization schedule in line with World Health
Organization and UNICEF recommendations. UNICEF supported communication and behaviour
change campaign and provided capacity development to healthcare institutions and to health
professionals on vaccines supplies, distribution and storing. The comprehensive campaign was
provided among parents which significantly increase level of vaccination among children.
Two main risks have been also identified:
- The COVID-19 pandemic affected the access to healthcare services in general and to the routine
immunization particularly. Because of the pandemic there have been delays in supplying MCC
vaccine for new-borns and as a result around 50 thds children were not vaccinated in time since
2020.
- Political changes impacted the efficiency of procurement processes and resulted in frequent
changes to the policy development agenda. The health reform agenda was not significantly
changed but the constant changes in the management of the MoH, lack of institutional memory
and turnover of key staff led to some gaps in UNICEF programme implementation. UNICEF tried
to mitigate this risk through orientation its work to the oblast and local levels.
Assessment of UNICEF Ukraine contribution in the area of justice for children (J4C)
The analysis in this section uses Process Tracing to measure UNICEF Ukraine’s contribution in a
selected area of impact, namely violence against children and thus, the improvement registered in
the area. As underlined in the section dedicated to the methodology, we present the change claim
chain, as elaborated in the Inception Phase of the evaluation and immediately after. We than present
and analyse each claim in the logical chain and assess the level of confidence for each claim and
globally.
Based on the initial research, the evaluation team formulated the following change claim chain (each
claim numbered separately):
(1) UNICEF ensured policy dialogue and cooperation of stakeholders in the field of Justice for
Children (J4C) and (2) supported the Government in reviewing/drafting a legal framework for
reforming J4C, (3) supported piloting of the Restorative Justice Programme for Juveniles in conflict
with the law, as well as its institutionalization (4) by supporting capacity development of police
officers, prosecutors, advocates-mediators and other professionals working in the field of J4C. In
addition, (5) UNICEF developed a comprehensive programme for preparation to release and
rehabilitation for juveniles in conflict with the law. These actions lead to (6) significant policy, legal
and institutional capacity improvements with (7) direct impact on children in contact with the
law (including: police response, legal investigations, penitentiary, child-friendly judiciary
procedures), because they are now benefiting from improved services, while institutions
better adapted to ensure the respect of child rights and to answer children needs.
A visual presentation of the theory of change based on the change claim chain for the case study is
presented below.

The analysis of each claim and the general conclusions are presented in the following sections.
Claim 1: UNICEF ensured policy dialogue and cooperation of stakeholders in the field of Justice
for Children
a) Evidence
The findings of the analysis presented below are based on the evidences collected from the
following documents Country Office Annual Reports, RAM outputs and outcomes reports, A
Situation Analysis on Children and Adolescents in Ukraine 2021, the official reports of and on the
data collected through interviews conducted with key stakeholders in the area, including
representatives of public bodies such us: the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Internal Affairs, the
Prosecutors Office, National Police, representatives of CSOs and academia, which are
implementing partners.
The evidence show that UNICEF has been a key actor in coordination of relevant actors in the
area of justice for children. The Inter-Agency Coordination Council on J4C has been established
in 2017 and co-chaired by UNICEF. Moreover, there has been established a sub-group on J4C
under the Justice Sector Donor Coordination Working Group (Government-Donor instrument),
also co-chaired by UNICEF61. In this concern UNICEF worked as a dialog cross-sectoral facilitator
among Ministries of Justice, Social Policy, Health, Education, Police, Office of the General
Prosecutor and other sub-national, development and CSO partners62. According to UNICEF’s
reports, this platform aims at promoting new and cross-sectoral models of work with children in
contact with the law.
The improvement of the cross-coordination system among relevant actors in the area of J4C has
also been highlighted in the Situation Analysis on children and adolescences 2021, commissioned
by UNICEF, which states that as a positive development in the field of justice of children there has
been registered enhanced cooperation at national level and that the “ICCJC includes high-level
representatives of all ministries and agencies responsible for justice for children, as well as CSOs
and international organizations”63. Also, the report Ukraine. Vulnerability regional aspects, form
2020 mentions that in the past 3 years Ukraine has made progress in the area of J4C by
establishing an effective mechanism of cooperation through the ICCJC64.
All interviewed stakeholders consider that the mechanism would not have the same effectiveness
without UNICEF’s support. Its contribution is considered to be essential in the developments that
have been registered in the area. UNICEF has signed MoU with national bodies such as Ministry
of Justice, Ministry of Interior, Prosecutor’s Office and also National Police, but also with local
authorities. UNICEF’s response in the context of the COVID 19 breakout was also very effective,
as emphasized during interviews, the work of the ICCJC has been moved online and has not been
affected by the pandemic. The data collected from interviews also indicates that the political
facing by Ukraine in the last years has also affected the justice sector. In this regard, the ICCJC has
been chaired by 3 different Deputy Ministries since its establishment in 2017 and this led to
delays in its activities. Nevertheless, the constant commitments and support provided by UNICEF,
as a co-chair of the agency, contributed to its stability and the progress registered in the cross-
coordination of J4C at national level.
Moreover, UNICEF supported participation of high-ranking Government officials at ECARO
Conference on Children’s Access to Justice, where they shared Ukraine’s progress in the area of
restorative justice65.
All data collected indicate that the improvement of the cooperation among stakeholders in the
field of justice for children has been a priority in UNICEF work and a lot of efforts have been put

in this area. The Council is unique platform for promoting and implementing J4C reform where
UNICEF plays a key role in support, coordination and technical assistance.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.95 The evidence allows the evaluators to be highly confident that UNICEF
ensured policy dialogue and cooperation of stakeholders in the field of Justice for Children.
The analysis findings, which corroborate official data with the collected perspectives of key
stakeholders in the area of justice for children, show that UNICEF has been a facilitator of
communication and collaboration among relevant public bodies, CSOs and academia in the area.
Moreover, official data show that cross-collaboration has been improved since the establishment
of the ICCJC in 2017. In this concern, UNICEF is perceived as a key actor acting for the
improvement of access to justice for children through the development of the legal framework
based on stakeholders’ collaboration.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.10 It is unlikely to see the evidence presented above if the claim is
false. All evidence collected converge through the same conclusion. Even if there is still room for
improvements in the area, the progress made since the establishment of the ICCJC, co-chaired and
continuously supported by UNICEF, is certain given the evidence presented evidence,
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.95) and the probability
of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.10), the account evidence of the
documents and interviews increases to highly confident (0.9048) the probability of the
hypothesis of “UNICEF ensured policy dialogue and cooperation of stakeholders in the field
of Justice for Children”, being true given the evidence.

evidence?
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the 0.10
evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.9048
Claim 2: UNICEF supported the Government in reviewing/drafting a legal framework for reforming
J4C
a) Evidence
As data collected through interviews show, UNICEF has been an essential actor in the
development of cross-coordination in the sector of justice for children and improvement of legal
framework. One of the governmental bodies interviewed emphasized that UNICEF is “the driver
force of J4C reform” in Ukraine.
In term of support provided to the government for the improvement of the legal framework in
the area of justice for children, data collected show that UNICEF contributed, through technical
support (including international expertise) and evidence-based advocacy, to the development
and, in almost all cases, adoption of the following:
• The National Strategy for Reforming the Juvenile Justice System up to 2023 and its
implementation plan;
130
• The Draft Law on Justice for Children66;
• The Memorandum on mediation for children in conflict with the law;
• The Unified Standards for the Training of Specialist in the Field of Justice for Children;
• The Recovery program for juveniles suspected of committing a criminal offense;
• The On Amendments to the Code of Ukraine on Administrative Offenses, Criminal Code
and the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine on child-friendly justice.67.
An important development in the legal framework of justice in Ukraine, as mentioned by the
Situation Analysis in Children and Adolescents from Ukraine, form 2021, was the development
and adoption of the National Strategy for Reforming the Juvenile Justice System up to 2023.
According to available information, UNICEF has provided technical support for the development
of the strategy and also conducted evidence-based advocacy for its implementation. Moreover,
the further efforts made by UNICEF in the area were focused on providing support for the
implementation of the strategy, including for strengthening the legal framework in the area
justice for children. With the support of UNICEF, the Draft Low of Justice for Children has been
finalized and sent to Parliament for revision in July 2021. The law introduces child-friendly
practices in the justice area, among which: restorative actions, mediation, integrated services for
children in contact with the law, alternatives to incarceration, trainings for professionals in child-
friendly procedures. Through the new legal framework proposes, it is aimed to change the focus
of judiciary punitive measures to friendly procedures and actions in the best interest of the child.
UNICEF also supported the development of the Order on Mediation for children in conflict with
the law68. It is important to further mention that, UNICEF’s contribution had been also
appreciated in regard with the international technical support provided to the Government, due
to its work with international experts in the evidence-based advocacy.
Moreover, as mentioned above, UNICEF have been a key factor in the establishment and
functioning of the ICCJC mechanism, whose mandate is to further enhance the legal framework in
the area of J4C. UNICEF has also supported the Ministry of Justice is piloting the programme
Restorative Justice Programme for juveniles in conflict with the law and its institutionalization at
the national level. In this process the programme received state financing69.
Is it important to mention that UNICEF had been perceived as a key factor in the improvement of
the situation of children in contact with the law in Ukraine, and that its efforts have been effective
in the area because its efforts were channelled in working close with national and public bodies
responsible for provide access to justice for children and providing constant support and
developing advocacy activities in order to generate changes at policy level. In this regard, one
interviewee emphasized that UNICEF have understood that the public authorities work within
the existing national legal framework and therefore, UNICEF focused its efforts on improving it.
Moreover, another interviewee stressed out that the legal reform on J4C in Ukraine would not
have been possible without active role played by UNICEF in the process.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.90. The evidence allows the evaluators to be highly confident that UNICEF
supported the Government in reviewing/drafting a legal framework for reforming J4C. Its
work in this regard was mainly centered on advocacy activities, technical support (including
international expertise) and cross-sector coordination among key duty bearers and other
relevant stakeholders. Nevertheless, the contribution of UNICEF and support provided should be
better documented in its official reports. The reports should be more explanatory and include
66 The Law on J4C has been finalized and sent to the Parliament for revisions in July 2021, thus it has not been
adopted yet.

Claim 3: UNICEF supported piloting of the Restorative Justice Programme for Juveniles in conflict
with the law, as well as its institutionalization
a) Evidence
The available evidence show that UNICEF has jointly developed together with the Ministry of
Justice the pilot programme “Restorative justice programme for juveniles in conflict with the law”
and further supported its institutionalization.
The pilot programme has been adopted in 2019, through the Ministry Order 172510 form 21st of
January. The project has been piloted in 6 regions of Ukraine, in the period of 2019 and 2020,
with the support of UNICEF. In 2020, the coverage of the programme has been expanded to the
entire country and its sustainability ensured by being funded from the state budget. The
institutionalization of the programme has been supported by UNICEF through technical
assistance and provision of evidence on the effectiveness of the model.
By the end of 2020, approximately 560 children benefited from the programme70. Also, according
to the Situation Analysis commissioned by UNICEF in 2020, almost 171 cases were referred to
the mediation procedure and from them for 134 cases criminal record has been avoided due to
resocialization programmes.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.95. The evidence allows the evaluators to be confident that UNICEF supported
piloting of the Restorative Justice Programme for Juveniles in conflict with the law, as well
as its institutionalization. The available data show that UNICEF’s technical support provided to
the development of the pilot has been essential. Moreover, within the programme, UNICEF has
also supported the delivery of trainings for mediation procedure and mediators specialization
and for child-friendly procedures.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.2. It is unlikely to see the evidence presented above if the claim is false.
The evidence collected on the contribution/technical support for the development of the
70 UNICEF, Situation Analysis of children and adolescents in Ukraine, 2021
132
programme and its institutionalization are enough to support the above-mentioned conclusion.
It is important that UNICEF’s contribution has not been well documented in official available data.
The information at the disposal of the evaluation team is not enough to be able to assess the extent
to which UNICEF has contributed to the development of the model, its exact inputs and types of
support provisioned. Nevertheless, this assessment has not been provisioned in the analysis of
claim 3, thus it does not influence its outcomes to a significant extent.
e) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.95) and the probability
of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.2), the account evidence of the
documents and interviews increases to confident (0.8261) the probability of the hypothesis
of “UNICEF supporting piloting of the Restorative Justice Programme for Juveniles in
conflict with the law, as well as its institutionalization.”, being true given the evidence.

Claim 4: UNICEF supported the capacity development of police officers, prosecutors, advocates-
mediators and other professionals working in the field of J4C
a) Evidence
The findings of the analysis presented below are based on the evidence collected from the
following documents Country Office Annual Reports, RAM outputs and outcomes reports, A
Situation Analysis on Children and Adolescents in Ukraine 2021 and on the data collected through
interviews conducted with key stakeholders in the area, including representatives of public
authorities, representatives of CSOs implementing partners and academia.
All available evidence show that UNICEF have das a significant contribution to the development
of the capacity of professionals from the judiciary to work with children in contact with the
system. The most important achievement in the area, to which UNICEF has contributed to, is the
development of unified standards of training for professionals in the area of J4C. Also, UNICEF has
provided support for the introduction of capacity development programme on child-friendly
procedures for the Office of the Prosecutor General71. It is important to also mention that UNICEF
has also supported the development of a methodology for using “Green rooms” when working
with children involved in proceedings.
The Unified Standards for the Training of Specialist in the Field of Justice for Children were
developed as measure of the implementation plan of the National Strategy of Reforming the
Justice System for Children until 2030 and adopted in 2019. The standards should be
implemented or used in developing curricula and training programs by central executive bodies
and educational institutions. According to the available data, the curricula is used for Police
Academies and training centers. UNICEF developed the curricula for universities and started
providing trainings for students (for example in Universities from Kharkov, Dnipro). All new
curricula are uploaded on the internal platform of Police Academies. This led to changes in BA
programmes. Moreover, the education materials are available online on the education portal.
71 UNICEF, RAM outcome and output report 2020
133
UNICEF has also trained, in partnerships with initially, advocates from 6 regions of Ukraine on
mediation procedures of child-friendly procedures and further expanded the coverage of the
trainings to other regions. And further, as emphasized in the interviews conducted, UNICEF
supported the development of the network of mediators from trained and certificated advocates.
UNICEF has also facilitated trainings for prosecutors on child-friendly procedures. Moreover,
according to data collected from interviews, practitioners that have attended the courses find
them useful and easy to apply in their activities, therefor the feedback provided by the target
groups has been positive. Further, stakeholders mentioned that UNICEF has also developed
methodological notes on working with children in the area of justice.
As a consequence of all above mentioned developments in respect to the training system for
professionals from the judiciary working with children, most of the key stakeholders that have
been interviewed consider that the skills of juvenal police, prosecutors, judges, advocates and
mediators were strengthened in prevention, social and psychological aspects.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.95. The evidence allows the evaluators to be highly confident that UNICEF
supported the capacity development of police officers, prosecutors, advocates-mediators
and other professionals working in the field of J4C. All data collected from documents and
interviews with key stakeholders, including duty bearers and SCOs working in the field, show that
UNICEF has provided technical support and also conducted evidence-based advocacy activities
as to facilitate, on one hand, the capacity development of professionals through trainings
provision and, on the other, the development of unified standard for training of professionals in
the J4C area.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.05. It is unlikely to see the evidence presented above if the claim is
false. No further evidence is necessary in order to be certain that the claim is true. The
triangulation of available and collected data led to the conclusion formulated above.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.95) and the probability
of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.05), the account evidence of the
documents and interviews increases to highly confident (0.95) the probability of UNICEF
supporting the capacity development of police officers, prosecutors, advocates-mediators
and other professionals working in the field of J4C.”, being true given the evidence.

Claim 5: UNICEF developed a comprehensive programme for preparation to release and
rehabilitation for juveniles in conflict with the law
a) Evidence
In regards with the programme for preparation to release and rehabilitation for juveniles in
conflict with the law, the available data is rather limited. While the representatives of CO and
other interviewees mention the programme, the official documents do not include enough data
on this particular programme as to be able to assess UNICEF’s contribution to it.
134
The programme has been also developed in the context of the implementation of the The National
Strategy on Reforming Justice for Children. For the development of the programme UNICEF has
conducted individual needs’ assessment. According to the data collected through interviews, the
programme is implemented successfully in partnership with UNICEF and NGO Volunteer.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity – 0,75. The evidence allows the evaluators to be rather confident that UNICEF
developed a comprehensive programme for preparation to release and rehabilitation for
juveniles in conflict with the law. Based on the data collected from interviews with key
stakeholders and available in few documents, the evidence show that UNICEF has developed the
programme.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error – 0,30. It is rather unlikely to see the evidence presented above if the claim is false.
Nevertheless, we have to emphasize that the only available data was provided by UNICEF, mostly
during interviews and that there is few information on this matter that are provided by other
stakeholders or in official documents. In order

Claim 6: Significant policy, legal and institutional capacity improvements were achieved
a) Evidence
The available data and data collected through interviews conducted with key stakeholders in the
area of justice for children, including duty bearers such us relevant ministries, national
authorities, professional bodies and CSOs working with children in projects supported by UNICEF
and academia representatives, show that to some extent progress has been registered in this
area at national level. Nevertheless, as the Situation Analysis of Children and Adolescents in
Ukraine emphasizes, “there is currently no holistic system of justice for children” in Ukraine72.
The available analysis on the situation of children in contact with the law mention that there is
still a need for further advancements in the legal framework and development of professional
skills in the area of justice friendly procedures. Moreover, currently, there is now legal provision
on the withdrawal of a child from the criminal justice system with the use of alternative
measures73 and according to the evidence collected, the procedures currently applicable to
children in contact with the law do not comply with the Guidelines on Child-friendly Justice of the
Council of Europe. Data also show that there still numerous cases of violation of the rights of
72 UNICEF, A Situation Analysis on Children and Adolescents in Ukraine, 2021
73 Idem
135
children in contact with the law74 and professions are not prepared for applying child-friendly
procedures. However, the reviewed reports lack in statistical and administrative data, which is a
general problem of the system and therefore certain assessments could not be conducted (e.g.
improvement of institutional capacity in terms of number of staff members responsible for
working with juvenile, number of trained professional in justice-friendly procedures and other).
Nevertheless, all available information, including data collected through interviews indicate that
in the past 3 years there has been registered certain progress in this area due to the commitment
of key stakeholders and most important, the commitment of Government to improve the legal
framework and the access to children in contact with the law to child-friendly procedures. On one
hand, the development and adoption of the National Strategy for Reforming the Juvenile Justice
System up to 2023 has led to prioritizing the J4C reform in Ukraine. Also, as a measure undertaken
for the implementation of the strategy, in 2017, the Inter-Agency Coordination Council on J4C has
been established and the cross-sectoral and sector cooperation among key stakeholders has been
improved. As a result of the work of ICCJC body, in the 2021 the Draft Law on J4C has been
finalized and send to the Ukrainian Parliament for revisions. Further, the Amendments to the
Code of Ukraine on Administrative Offenses, Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code of
Ukraine on child-friendly justice were drafted and prepared for the submission to the
Government. It is also important to mention that the Recovery program for juveniles suspected
of committing a criminal offense has been institutionalized and through this expanded to the
national level and received financing from the public budget.
It is important to mention that the aforementioned developments in the legal area are very recent
and some of the legal provisions are not yet adopted. Thus, their effects in terms of improvements
registered at the level of legal framework in the area of J4C are not observable yet. Nevertheless,
the adoption of the Law on J4C, when it will be concretized, will contribute in a significant manner
to changes in the judicial system on the approach of children in contact with the law. The wide
commitment of key public bodies to the introduction and utilization of child-friendly procedures
constitutes an important facilitating factor in further development of the area. The improvements
that have already been registered in this regard, through the pilot programme Recovery program
for juveniles suspected of committing a criminal offense, show that practices can be improved but
there is still a need for a national legal framework, which has not been adopted yet.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.70. The evidence allows the evaluators to be cautiously confident that policy,
legal and institutional capacity has been improved in Ukraine in the area of justice for
children. Even if, the available information shows that there has been registered, to some extent,
progress in the area, this has not been significant so far in terms of legal and institutional capacity
change at-scale. Moreover, the collected information is often inconsistent. While in the available
analysis done at the justice system in Ukraine, justice for children is still presented as an
underdeveloped area, where there is no unitary legal framework, the practices do not meet the
requirement or principles of child-friendly justice and where there still often cases if child rights
violation, the data collected from interviews picture a rather opposite perspective emphasizing
numerous changes produced in the area in regards with the policy framework, services and
procedures utilized (adoption of the National Strategy for reforming the juvenile justice system,
the establishment of the ICCJC and its work in the area, thus increased cross-sectoral cooperation
and provision of new legislative acts, the institutionalization of the pilot programme on
restorative measures and other). Nevertheless, the observed progress was not scaled-up yet and
the legislations changes, most important being the ones provisioned by the Law on Justice for
Children, were not adopted yet.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?

Nevertheless, the available administrative data is not sufficient to assess the progress made in the
regards to strengthening the institutional capacity of judicial bodies and other public bodies
working with children in the area of justice.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.70) and the probability
of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.30), the account evidence of the
documents and interviews increases to cautiously confident (0.70) the probability of the
hypothesis “policy, legal and institutional capacity has been improved in Ukraine in the area
of justice for children”, being true given the evidence.

Claim 7: Direct impact on children in contact with the law was registered (including: police
response, legal investigations, penitentiary, child-friendly judiciary procedures), because they are
now benefiting from improved services, while institutions better adapted to ensure the respect of
child rights and to answer children needs
a) Evidence
The collected data through document revision and interviews show that children in contact with
the law have access to improved services and that the professionals have been trained in the areas
of mediation as an alternative procedure and in the area of child-friendly procedures, which have
been applied to some extent in Ukraine. An important success in area of justice for children was
the decrease of the number of children offenders held under protection in specialized facilities
(juvenile prisons. The Situation Analysis on Children and Adolescents form Ukraine emphasizes
that the improvements in justice for children has led to a “sharp reduction in the number of
children remanded to judicial care”75. The closure of prison type of schools has also been
mentioned by the stakeholders which have been interviewed as one of the most important
accomplishments in the area. The number of centers for juvenile offenders have decreased from
8 centers in 2016 to 2 centers in 2021. Nevertheless, the available information indicate that the
improvements have been observed, mainly, at the level of actions supported by UNICEF (such as:
the establishment of Barnahus centers, including the adoption of green rooms procedure, the
implementation of the Restorative programme, the provided trainings for professionals working
with children in contact with the law). Thus, the effects of these actions were not yet scaled-
up and the impact has been isolated.
The available documents mention that children still face challenges when in contact with the law,
especially when they are involved in proceedings76. Moreover, the restorative system is not yet
put in place and even if there has been made progress in adopting practices that focus less on
punitive measures and more on rehabilitation of children facing crime accusations, the current
legal framework does not allow prosecutors to move children cases from the criminal justice
system to alternative restorative measures77. Currently, at national level, there are 11 probation
centers for juvenile offenders, but, as indicated in the Situation Analysis of Children and
75 UNICEF, Situation Analysis of Children and Adolescents in Ukraine, 2021
76 UNICEF, RAM outcome and output report, 2020
77 UNICEF, Situation Analysis of Children and Adolescents in Ukraine, 2021
137
Adolescents in Ukraine, form 2021, the number of psychologists working in these centers has
decreased since 2018, when the juvenile probation system was established in Ukraine.
Nevertheless, the data collected from interviews indicated that there are less children reaching
the courts and being involved in trials in the past yeast. However, there are no available
administrative data to support this tendency.
In terms of the effects of the Restorative programme piloted by the Ministry of Justice with the
support of UNICEF and further institutionalized at national level, the mediation procedure was
applied in 171 cases, where a juvenile was suspected in committing a crime, out of which in 134
cases juveniles finished their resocialization programmes. During the pilot, UNICEF provided 77
lawyers-mediators and online webinars for almost 300 prosecutors78. Moreover, by the end of
2020, approximately 560 children benefited from the programme79. Also, UNICEF have ensured
access to online means in order to facilitate the mediation process during the restrictions caused
by the COVID 19 pandemic. UNICEF has provided support to children in detention, under
probation and under supervision of Juvenile Police. According to the data provided by UNICEF, in
2020, more than 2511 children and 490 professionals benefited from guidance provided by
UNICEF.
The data collected from interview show that the adoption of Unified Standards for the Training
of Specialist in the Field of Justice for Children and further, the provision of trainings for
prosecutors, advocates and police officers within Juvenile Departments have led to the
improvement of their skills regarding the applications of child-friendly procedures, including
mediation.
Moreover, the implementation of Barnahus model, through a pilot project, in Vinnisa City
provides the opportunity for further improvements in the area of justice for children in Ukraine.
The by-law of Barnahus has been developed and an order of collaboration among different
institutions at local level has been signed. According to the data collected from interviews, the
model, which introduces friendly services for children, is expected to expanded soon due the
already progress made in signing Memorandums of Understanding with other local authorities
(e.g. Mykolayiv city). Moreover, the results achieved in Vinnitsa city through the establishment of
the center were related to improved multi-sectoral services for child victims of violence or
witnesses and the introduction of the “green room” procedure, which refers to child-friendly
procedures in the context of children interrogations.
As a general conclusion, in the past few years, in Ukraine there have been developed several
actions in the area of justice for children, focused in child friendly procedures and intergraded
support and services for children in contact with the law and these actions have improved the
compliance to international standards on the rights of children. Nevertheless, the observed
impact has been small due to the following 3 factors:
• interventions have been piloted in different regions and their impact has been limited to
their specific target groups;
• the legislation improvement process has been is still ongoing, thus a key legislative
change, namely the adoption of the Law on J4C, has not been enforced yet;
• and additionally, there is a lack in existing monitoring data in the system regarding
children in contact with the law and their course within the judicial system.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.80. The evidence allows the evaluators to be confident that direct impact on
children in contact with the law was registered (including police response, legal
investigations, penitentiary, child-friendly judiciary procedures), because they are now
78 UNICEF, RAM outcome and output report, 2020
79 UNICEF, Situation Analysis of children and adolescents in Ukraine, 2021
138
benefiting from improved services, while institutions better adapted to ensure the respect
of child rights and to answer children needs. Nevertheless, the registered progress, according
to the available is still limited, but there are important opportunities for the further advancement
of the J4C reform in Ukraine and thus, the improvement of the services provided to children in
contact with the law. All interviewees are confident that the Law on J4C, that introduces in the
legal framework the restorative procedures and other child-friendly procedures and provides a
general training framework for professional working with children is going to be adopted in the
near future.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.30. Taking into consideration that the collected evidence is rather
unlikely to expect this type of evidence if the claim was false. Nevertheless, the level of confidence
in the trueness of the claim has to be perceived with cautiousness due to the fact that the
registered progress has been limited mainly to the activities developed with the support of
UNICEF as pilot programmes, whit the exception of the Restorative programme which has been
recently scaled-up, but for which it is too early to assess its impact.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.80) and the probability
of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.30), the account evidence of the
documents and interviews increases to cautiously confident (0.7273) the probability of the
hypothesis that “direct impact on children in contact with the law was registered (including:
police response, legal investigations, penitentiary, child-friendly judiciary procedures), because
they are now benefiting from improved services, while institutions better adapted to ensure the
respect of child rights and to answer children needs”, being true given the evidence.

Conclusion
According to process tracing methodology, the confidence in the overall claim is set by the
“weakest link” (or lowest posterior) in the causal chain, corresponding to claim 6 (Significant
policy, legal and institutional capacity improvements were achieved) with a posterior of 0.7143.
This means that we can be confident that UNICEF contributed in a substantial manner to the
improvement of the policy, legal and institutional capacity in the area of justice for
children and overall, to the improvement of services provided to children in contact with
the law, which are focused more on child-friendly approaches, in line with the change chain
presented above and with the theory of change of the area (as presented in Annex 2).
Nevertheless, the analysis allows us to be highly confident about the fact that UNICEF has
contributed to the improvement of the cooperation among stakeholders in the area of
justice for children, by co-chairing the Inter-Agency Coordination Council on J4C and the sub-
group on J4C under the Justice Sector Donor Coordination Working Group (Government-Donor
instrument), which brings together the Ministries of Justice, Social Policy, Health, Education,
Police, Office of the General Prosecutor and other sub-national, development, CSO partners and
academia. Moreover, the analysis developed allows to by highly confident that UNICEF
supported, with technical assistance, external expertise and evidence-based advocacy, the
139
Government in reviewing or drafting a legal framework for J4C. As emphasized by one of the
key stakeholders that has been interviewed, the collected evidence show that UNICEF has been
driving factor in the J4C reform in Ukraine. UNICEF has also contributed to improvements in
practice at the level of judicial system, but the at-scale effects could not be assessed or
observed due to, on one hand, recent institutionalization of the Restorative Programme and on
the other, due to other interventions that have been so far implemented as pilot projects thus
their effects remain limited.
Nevertheless, due to available evidence we are less confident in the achievements of policy, legal
and institutional capacity in Ukraine in the area justice for children. Even if, progress has been
registered in the cooperation and commitment of key stakeholders and important legislative
changes have been prepared and drafted, the timing of the evaluation does not allow us to observe
significant changes in the area. The most significant change would be the adoption of the Law on
J4C, which introduces child-friendly practices in the justice area, among which: restorative
actions, mediation, integrated services for children in contact with the law, alternatives to
incarceration, trainings for professionals in child-friendly procedures and which had recently
submitted to the Parliament for revisions.

Based on the analysis conducted by the evaluation team, the strengths that facilitated and
supported the observed improvements were: (i) UNICEF’s credibility among duty bearers, CSOs;
(ii) the large commitment of public bodies for the development of the J4C reform in Ukraine,
including initiating pilot projects and proving state funding for their implementation; (iii) the
active role of training bodies and educational institutions in improving education and training
programmes for professionals within the judicial system working with children.
The analysis also led to the identification of some hindering factors in the area, such as: (i) lack of
administrative data in the area and (ii) political instability which led to delays in finalizing and
adopting legislative documents.

For the assessment of UNICEF Ukraine contribution in the area of adolescents and youth
empowerment and participation, Process Tracing was used, in order to determine the extent of
UNICEF contribution and the results of the contributing in a clear way. Using Process Tracing,
each claim was analysed and based on the available evidence, the level of confidence that the
claim is true was assessed.
Based on the initial research, the evaluation team formulated the following change claim chain:
With a view to improve meaningful child and youth participation in Ukraine, at national level,
(1) UNICEF provided technical expertise and support for the development of the National Youth
Strategy (2030),
(2) deployed the U-Report as a platform where children and youth can voice opinions,
(3) encouraged youth participation to the development SDGs voluntary national reviews (VNR).
At local level, (4) UNICEF supported capacity building and technical support on child and youth
involvement initiatives and active citizenship participation skills in the Eastern Ukraine,
(5) as well as the Child and Youth Friendly City Initiative (CFCI).
(6) These actions, contributed to an improved youth policy (at national and local level) and
resulted in
(7) a higher number of young people engaging and participating in civil society actions and
decision making in Ukraine.
A visual presentation of the theory of change based on the change claim chain for the case study
is presented below.

The analysis of each claim and the general conclusions are presented in the following sections.
Claim 1: UNICEF provided technical expertise and support for the development of the National Youth Strategy
(2030)
a) Evidence
UNICEF Ukraine reports that the Country Office continued to support the Ministry of Youth and Sports
(MoYS) to finalize and adopt the National Youth Strategy. According to the reports, features of the strategy
that have been recommended by UNICEF include: the cross-sectoral approach to the development of young
people’s competencies and increasing their resilience over the next decade, taking into account the
pandemic impact.80
The interview with the representative of the MoYS confirms UNICEF contribution to the strategy, but also
presented the involvement of other stakeholders. According to the interview: „youth was also involved in
the development of the strategy through youth organizations”. Regional and online consultations with a
large range of stakeholders have been organised by the MoYS.
On the other hand, UNICEF and the MoYS organised together an online conference with key youth workers
and groups to discuss how the findings of existing research provided by UNICEF can shape youth policy in
Ukraine.81
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.8. In order to assess sensitivity, we would expect evidence on the activities undertaken by
UNICEF to support for the development of the National Youth Strategy (2030) and evidence on the utility
of these activities and their results in shaping the strategy. We found this evidence, but it has only two
sources, that are not completely independent: UNICEF (reports and interviews with UNICEF
representatives) and the interview with the representative of the MoYS. On the other hand, evidence shows
two different ways of support provided by UNICEF: technical support and support and support in the
dialogue with other stakeholders. This increases our confidence that UNICEF contribution was important,
given that multi-stakeholder involvement is a quality of a strategic process.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.3. There is not enough evidence to identify UNICEF contribution to the text of
the strategy and strategic priorities, beside UNICEF claims in its reports and interviews. Moreover, there is
a large number of stakeholders that also participated to the strategic process. Therefore, the chance that
UNICEF contribution was very limited, in the context of the given evidence, is not negligible.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.8) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.3), the account evidence of the documents and interviews
increases to confident (0.7272) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF providing technical
expertise and support for the development of the National Youth Strategy (2030)”, being true given
the evidence.

Claim 2: UNICEF deployed the U-Report as a platform where children and youth can voice opinions
a) Evidence
There is extensive evidence on the use and utility of U-Report in Ukraine. UNICEF Ukraine reported 74,000
U-reporters (70% girls and 30% boys) in 2018 and 90,000 subscribers (U-reporters) in 2019, with the
gender gap maintained.82 According to UNICEF reports, an additional 10,000 young people were reached
through a U-ambassadors’ peer-to-peer campaign and 360 received legal counselling through UPartners.83
However, the platform shows a lower participation of U-reporters to polls in 2020 and 2021, compared to
2018 and 2019. However, in 2020, U-Report ran 10 polls reaching about 10,000 respondents and became
one of the first monitoring tools to assess youth opinions related pandemic circumstances
On the other hand, data was regularly used by central institutions including the Ministry of Justice, Ministry
of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Social Policy and Health, Ministry of Culture and Information, Ministry of
Internal Affairs, Office of Ombudsman for Child Rights, Office of the Prosecutor General, UN agencies. This
is reported by UNICEF, but also visible in the strategic and policy documents that are citing U-report as a
source of data.84
As a prove of its recognition as a powerful engagement and participation tool, in 2020, the U-Report Ukraine
team supported ECARO in in collecting data from eleven countries for the report “Preventing a Lockdown
Generation in Europe and Central Asia”, compiled jointly by UNICEF and European Training Foundation.85
In 2018-2019 U-Report Ukraine was a case study in the U-Report evaluation of innovation conducted by
UNICEF at global level.86
The reports conclude for U-Report Ukraine that:
- U-Report has strong brand recognition and generates trust among all partners and youth
interviewed.
- U-Report provides access to information not previously accessible to government and civil society,
representing a brand new and valuable channel for these organizations. In this context, moreover,
UNICEF has effectively engaged important governmental and civil society organizations and
enabled the effective use of U-Report to engage youth and gather information to inform
programming.
- There is opportunity for wider analysis of U- Report data, which could be used to inform
programming through an enhanced understanding of the youth population, and youth perspectives
and habits.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.85. Evidence expected for this claim included the evidence on U-Report being a (a) platform
used by young people and the evidence of U-Report being (b) used as a tool to engage young people in
decision making. Evidence is convincing for both types of expectations. However, the most convincing
evidence is from 2018 and 2019, and one should notice that in 2020 and 2021 the level of engagement with
U-Report decreased, limiting the sensitivity assessment to 0.85.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
82 COAR 2019. The participation to U-Report is provide by the online platform: https://ukraine.ureport.in
83 COAR 2020.
84 The interview with the representative of the Municipality of Lviv shows that U-Report is also used at local level. On the other
hand, the Ministry of Youth and Sports used data from U-Report for the National Youth Strategy, as well as data from UNICEF
HPSC report. At the Ministry of Economy, the recommendations given by the young persons were included in the State
Programme for Stimulation of Economy to Overcome the Negative Consequences Caused by the Restrictive Measures for
Preventing the Emergence and Spread of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) for 2020-2022.

144
Type I error probability– 0.2. Although there is convincing evidence on the U-Report data being used in
policy planning by Ukrainian authorities, we alack evidence on a more strategic use of U-Report for policy
planning as a tool to engage young people, not only to collect data.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.85) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.2), the account evidence of the documents and interviews
increases to confident (0.8095) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF deploying the U-Report
as a platform where children and youth can voice opinions”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 2 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this 0.85
evidence?
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the 0.2
evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.8095
Claim 3: UNICEF encouraged youth participation to the development SDGs voluntary national reviews (VNR)
a) Evidence
The first Voluntary National Review (VNR) of progress towards achievement of the SDGs acknowledges the
involvement of young people, the use of U-Report and the consultations organised with young people.
Young people designed a special methodology which allowed to calculate an integral estimate of the SDGs
progress achievement likelihood in Ukraine by every goal. Based on the data estimation, analysis and data
comparison with indicator target values for 2020 was conducted and incorporated into the SDG VNR.87
The process was endorsed and acknowledged by the Ministry of Economy on its website and documents, as
well as in the interview conducted for this evaluation.88
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.75. Although we have compelling evidence on youth participation to the Voluntary National
Review (VNR) of progress towards achievement of the SDGs and of UNICEF support for this participation,
the same evidence shows that this participation was limited to students of a couple of Ukrainian
Universities. There is no evidence of larger acknowledgement, at scale, of SDG among young people as a
result of this project. This lack of evidence is in line with the conclusion of the U-Report evaluation that
„global polls (also known as global actions) are perceived by the CO to typically not resonate well with the
local context of youth in Ukraine”89
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.15. The evidence of youth participation to the Voluntary National Review (VNR)
of progress towards achievement of the SDGs is convincing and there is difficult to imagine that the claim is
false. Although the risk of tokenism exists, it is limited due to the methodology used and described above,
in the evidence section.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.75) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.15), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to confident (0.8333) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF encouraged

Claim 4: UNICEF supported capacity building and technical support on child and youth involvement initiatives
and active citizenship participation skills in the Eastern Ukraine
a) Evidence
UNICEF implemented several initiatives on Eastern Ukraine. Building on its 2-years program on conflict
resolution skills, UNICEF and MoES developed peer-to-peer mediation toolkit and video tutorial on solving
conflicts and promoted it among 1,000 educators in conflict-affected area.90
Studies found that collaborative and executive skills, in combination with parent support and teacher
support, both provided to children and young people in Eastern Ukraine by the projects supported by
UNICEF, greatly contribute to build resilience in adolescents exposed to violence in their microsystem, i.e.
at school or at home. In addition, adolescents that are resilient to conflict exposure are more likely to be
characterized by supportive relationships with peers, emotional connection to the school, inter-dependent
values, collaborative problem-solving skills and tolerance of diversity.91
The evaluation of the Provision of Psychosocial Support and Protective Services through Child and Youth
Friendly Spaces and Community Protection Centers in Eastern Ukraine also find that “UNICEF has positively
contributed to the psychological well-being of school-age children in the areas affected by war: by reducing
the levels of negative behaviour of children in schools and reducing the levels of distress through psychological
work. UNICEF interventions contributed positively to reducing the isolation of IDP families and children and
increasing the sense of normality and community living of those affected by the war.”92
“On community level, UNICEF programme has had positive impact on generally strengthening social cohesion
and community integration between host communities and IDP children and families as well as reducing
isolation of children and families aspiring to deal with the consequences of war.“93
“On the other hand, due to a primarily child-focused rather than family-focused design of the interventions,
UNICEF interventions did not sufficiently reach the most vulnerable groups of children among which children
survivors of violence, children with disabilities.” 94
Moreover, the initiatives imploded in 2019 27 youth-led advocacy campaigns and 56 youth-led community-
mobilization projects were implemented in the Eastern Ukraine within the framework of UPSHIFT. In 2018,
UNICEF UPSHIFT programme was launched in Kharkiv city, Eastern Ukraine’s largest city. Four waves were
organized, with the participation of 40 teams of young people trained to build skills and capacities suitable
for the 21st century, including designing and implementing social impact projects. A small grants project
promoting civic engagement also was launched in the conflict-affected areas of Donetsk and Luhansk
90 COAR 2019. See as well the study: An evidence-based analysis of the psychosocial adaptability of conflict-exposed adolescents and

oblasts, reaching 1,619 adolescents through 26 projects in its first wave. UNICEF promoted girls’
empowerment through the UPSHIFT programme, and their participation reached 72%. This was
communicated widely through social media, while joining efforts with more than 75 partners in support of
the United Nations Secretary-General’s campaign UNiTE to End Violence against Women (UNiTE).95
There is no independent evidence, beside the reports provided and drafted by UNICEF, on the effectiveness
of UPSHIFT in empowering and engaging young people in Eastern Ukraine.
On the other hand, interviews conducted with independent observers from academia, underline that
UNICEF has a strong team and projects in the East and is the most important organisation that uses the
participatory approach and involvement of youth in the Eastern Ukraine.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.85. For the sensitivity assessment we need to see evidence on UNICEF activities for capacity
development on child and youth involvement initiatives and active citizenship participation skills in the
Eastern Ukraine and the actual results of these activities.
Existing evidence shows the implementation of activities and independent existence exists on the positive
results of some of the activates (the Provision of Psychosocial Support and Protective Services through Child
and Youth Friendly Spaces and Community Protection Centers in Eastern Ukraine), but not of other
activities (UPSHIFT).
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.2. There is independent, but limited evidence that the progress observed
concerning the resilience, empowerment and community engagement of young people in Eastern Ukraine
is due to UNICEF, considering limited interventions of other organisations.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.85) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.2), the account evidence of the documents and interviews
increases to confident (0.8095) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF supporting capacity
building and technical support on child and youth involvement initiatives and active citizenship
participation skills in the Eastern Ukraine”, being true given the evidence.

Claim 5: UNICEF supported the Child and Youth Friendly City Initiative (CFCI)
a) Evidence
According to UNICEF reports, the CFCI in Ukraine continued to be a strong instrument for child-friendly
planning and budgeting at municipality level. CFCI’s coverage has expanded in 2020 to a total of 35
municipalities of different size cumulatively covering over 10% of the population in Ukraine. According to
data from UNICEF reports and interviews ear new municipalities have been interested and made efforts to
be part of the initiative, to receive support and have young people participation in training and empowering
and engaging activities, encouraging their innovation and participation.96
95 COAR 2018 and 2019
96 Evidence available in UNICEF reports is confirmed by interviews with national and local stakeholders.
147
In 2020, municipalities with approved Action Plans, have already budgeted over USD 58 million for
children. Thus, in 2020, every USD 1 spent by UNICEF leveraged USD 386 for children.97 These figures
should be added to the ones resulting from the implementation of the imitative in 2018 and 2019. For
example, in 2018, the 22 allocated an additional US$30 million to implement their child and youth friendly
action plans.
UNICEF contribution to capacity development of target municipalities in child and youth participation
included technical support for local authorities and training for young people. In 2019 a year-long course
“How to strengthen child and youth participation at local level” helped more than 400 young people design
and implement their own projects and young people have been empowered by a competition where three
best projects were recognized by the global CFCI Team at the concluding award ceremony.98
UNICEF reports, as well as interviews also underline that CFCI is an initiative of UNICEF but implemented
with partners. With UNICEF’s support, a multi-stakeholder coalition was established consisting of
government partners, the United Nations Population Fund, national associations of municipalities and an
umbrella group of youth organizations.
In 2020, with the purpose to help local councils to better cope with COVID-19, UNICEF also supplied local
Child and Youth councils with tailored information on COVID-19 prevention. Bi-weekly COVID-19
newsletters have been published and distributed to over 100 municipalities, with the key information and
UNICEF resources related to COVID-19 response. UNICEF collected local best practices on socio-economic
response to COVID-19 and formed a comprehensive database of sub-national efforts. The results were
shared with municipalities and the Ministry of Social Policy.99 As a result of these efforts, Ukraine’s case on
local government’s response to COVID-19 was selected by HQ to be among the five best practices at the
global level.
Since 2019 the Child and Youth Friendly City Initiative enjoys the support of the Prime Minister of Ukraine
and evidence can be traced on a government proposal allowing municipalities to allocate an additional 1%
of the locally generated income tax to children and youth services after attaining child and youth friendly
recognition from UNICEF. However, there is no clear evidence on the decision made to implement this
proposal.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.8. For the sensitivity assessment we need to see evidence on UNICEF activities on Child and
Youth Friendly City Initiative (CFCI) and the actual results of this initiative reflected in youth empowerment
and engagement by local authorities, as well as increased youth local participation.
There is extensive evidence on activities implemented and a very good indicator of interest of municipalities
for the initiative, as well as convincing data on budget allocations. The evidence is supported not only by
UNCICEF reports and figures, but also by interviews with representatives of national and local authorities.
We lack, however, independent evidence on the quality of the action plan and their implementation (for
plans already established in 2018 and 2019) and on extensive youth participation beside the most active
young people.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.25. One of the interviews with representatives of the academia underlined that
the CFCI is not able to empower and engage vulnerable young people. It is not clear how much tokenism is
actually included in the activities of local authorities and how many young people that are not already active
in youth organisations are participating in a meaningful and constant way. However, evidence show that a
large number of young people is participating, larger than we would expect if UNICEF empowerment and
engagement activities would be without results. Therefore, the type I error probability is assessed at 0.25.

Claim 6: UNICEF contributed to improved youth policy (at national and local level)
a) Evidence
The evidence on UNICEF contribution to the youth strategy 2030 was presented in the assessment of claim
1, above.
Following the strategy, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the State Targeted Social Programme “Youth of
Ukraine” for 2021-2025. The Programme is designed to create opportunities for self-realization and
development of the potential of young people in Ukraine, their participation and integration into public life.
It is intended to remove barriers to participation connected to gender, age, place of residence, psychological
and physical abilities, disability and other characteristics. The Programme is intended to increase the level
of youth competencies, including civic ones; increase the level of volunteering culture among young people;
intensify youth involvement in decision-making processes; strengthen the social cohesion of youth,
including through exchanges of youth within Ukraine and in partnership with other states and international
organizations; implement programmes to train professionals working with youth, including the Youth
Worker Programme; ensure the functioning of youth centres; and facilitate civil society participation in
achieving youth development.100 Beside the evidence provided directly by UNICEF on the quality of the new
legislation, this quality is also confirmed by the assessment of youth policy researchers, members of the
Pool of European Youth Researchers (PEYR) organised by the EU-Council of Europe youth partnership.101
Moreover, on 27 April 2021, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a new Law “On the Main Principles of Youth
Policy”. The Law is intended to stimulate youth participation. It regulates the activities of the Ukrainian
Youth Fund – a budgetary institution whose activities are directed and coordinated by the Ministry of Youth
and Sports and proposes the creation of an extensive network of youth centres. The Law also establishes
the organizational and legal grounds for the activities of youth and children’s public associations.
According to UNICEF reports, adolescents and young people’s agenda were further streamlined in different
sectors with the establishment of new national bodies for youth policy implementation. Amendments to the
adolescents’ age and age of consent to access health services were also proposed to the current law in line
with international standards.102
UNIEF contribution to the youth policy in general is acknowledged by the Ministry of Youth and Sports and
other stakeholders, on the other hand, many other stakeholders are also mentioned by interviewees: youth
organisations, youth researchers, UNFPA, the Council of Europe and the EU-Council of Europe youth
partnership.
On the other hand, as showed by the assessment of the previous claim, UNICEF contributed to improved
local panning (local policies) providing measures for youth empowering and engagement.

149
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.9. For the sensitivity assessment we need to see evidence on UNICEF contribution to
improved youth policy we expect evidence on UNICEF involvement in the development of the youth policy,
as well as evidence on the quality of youth policy in Ukraine.
Evidence shows a clear improvement of the Ukrainian youth policy. On the other hand, evidence from
different (partly) independent sources (UNICEF, UNEFPA, the MoY, Ministry of Economy, academia, CSOs)
show that UNICEF had a contribution to the development of the policy, providing technical assistance,
support and advice to the Government of Ukraine.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.25. There is not enough data to assess with high confidence that UNICEF
contribution in a significant way to the improved quality of national and local youth policy. There is,
therefore, not enough evidence to be sure we are not in the presence of more important positive influence
of other stakeholders and that UNICEF contribution had limited results.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.25), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to confident (0.7826) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF contributing
to improved youth policy (at national and local level)”, being true given the evidence.

Claim 7: A higher number of young people engaging and participating in civil society actions and decision
making in Ukraine
a) Evidence
UNICEF reports show UNICEF contributed directly to the empowerment and engagement, at
different levels and with different levels of intensity of over 100,000 young people from Ukraine.
UNICEF activities, implemented in cooperation with the Government of Ukraine (MoYS, MoES) and civil
society organisations focus on building young people skills for the world of work, active citizenship as well
resilient mental health. UNICEF continued to expand UPSHIFT in 2018-2019, empowering young people as
grassroot innovators and social entrepreneurs and reached 75,000 second beneficiaries, according to its
own reports.103
UNICEF reports show that in 2019, in order to strengthen civic participation demand and skills, UNICEF
engaged 24,000 young people though a series of activities aimed at increasing resilience and civic
103 COAR 2020 mentions that: in February UNICEF conducted two face-to-face waves of UPSHIFT programme in Mariupol,
offering vulnerable adolescents to acquire skills and establish their own social impact ventures. Second wave was thematically
focused on media literacy. With the outbreak of COVID, UNICEF has equipped adolescents with skills to cope with the pandemic
circumstances and engage them in emergency response. In August UNICEF engaged 41 adolescents through digitized version of
UPSHIFT to co-design innovative solutions for COVID response. Aiming to capacitate young people for post-COVID world,
including environmental challenges, UNICEF launched “UPSHIFT Green”. This modified version of the programme empowers
young people as leaders of climate change action. Thirty-seven adolescents received training from leading environmental experts
and developed solutions to counteract climate change in their municipalities. In total, during 2020 some 75,000 young people
were engaged in the projects designed by 161 UPSHIFT participants.

engagement while also building active citizenship skills of 35,000 adolescents (45% boys, 55% girls)
through extracurricular skills-building gender responsive program.104
In 2020, UNICEF enhanced digital tools such as Learning Passport, ‘UPSHIFT Online’, U-Report, web-based
system for peer emotional support, national volunteering platform and online training programme on
conflict resolution, to engage them in risk communication and COVID-19 response.105
However, evidence at national scale don’t show important or significantly increased levels of young people
engagement and participation in civil society actions and decision making in Ukraine. A 2020 Save the
Children research project with 3–17-year-olds found that girls and boys feel that adults do not listen to
them or value their concerns. The study suggested there are pervasive attitudes in Ukraine that children’s
opinions are not important and that adults know better than children. This contributes to limited
opportunities being provided for children’s views to be taken into consideration during decision making.
This frustrates children, who feel they have valuable insights to offer.106
On the other hand, the situation of youth participation seems to have been better in 2017. In a 2017 U-
Report poll, 94% of respondents stated that the opinions of young people and children should be considered
in decision-making processes, while 68% indicated that children and adolescents can participate in
decision-making processes through membership in NGOs. Almost half of respondents believe that there is
a need to establish consultative bodies of children at both national and local levels.107 Another poll108
revealed that more than half of young people have ideas on how to develop their communities, with young
men slightly more likely than young women to report that they have ideas about community development.
Of those who had such ideas, 62% were ready to pursue them, 25% were already working on realizing them,
and 13% are still developing these ideas.
According to the interview with the UNICEF representatives, before 2014, 40% of young people said that
they participated in civil life and activated in NGOs. After the political changes in 2014, the number has been
decreased, people have become disappointed (10-15%). Currently, after 2017, the government big
statistical research called Youth for Ukraine showed a little increase in the number of people involved in
anticorruption campaigns and other civic initiatives.
In 2020, the results of one U-Report show that 43% of the respondent young people encountered
“decorative” involvement of young people in decision making, in other words tokenism. Data form the U-
Report are not conclusive in showing that young people participated more in 2020 to decision making
compare to 2017, but COVID-19 pandemic and the connected restrictions could have been an impediment
to participation.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.65. Although there is good evidence that UNICEF encourages youth engagement and
participation and there are good results in each of UNICEF projects and activities, evidence at national scale
104 COAR 2019.
105 COAR 2020 mentions that: with the schools’ closure in March and consequent frustration, anxiety and increased violence,
UNICEF conducted series of 55 online workshops “Solving conflicts in digital space” reaching 2177 adolescents and 1883 adults.
The course promoted non-violent communication in solving the conflicts which arise in the digital learning circumstances.
UNICEF piloted peer support intervention to increase adolescents’ resilience in the challenging time. Fifty peer volunteers were
trained to provide emotional support to adolescents via a web-based service. They engaged 900 adolescents in need into
appropriate self-care, while referring them to professional mental health and violence response services. More than 100,000 were
reached by an awareness raising campaign.

don’t show important or significantly increased levels of young people engagement and participation in civil
society actions and decision making in Ukraine.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.4. The evidence from UNICEF initiatives and projects and their results are not
conclusive at national scale, but they show that the claim is not false in all instances. On the other hand, data
at national level shows that, in general, there is no important improvement of young people engagement
and participation in Ukraine, therefore the claim can be false in many instances, if we are looking for
country-wide impact.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.65) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.45), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews allow us to be only more confident than not (0.5909) the probability of the hypothesis of
“a higher number of young people engaging and participating in civil society actions and decision
making in Ukraine”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 7 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this 0.65
evidence?
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the 0.45
evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.5909
Conclusion
According to Process Tracing methodology, the confidence in the overall claim is set by the “weakest link”
(or lowest posterior) in the causal chain, corresponding to claim 7 (A higher number of young people
engaging and participating in civil society actions and decision making in Ukraine) with a posterior of 0,5909.
This means that we can only be more confident than not that UNICEF contributed in a substantial
manner to the empowerment, engagement and participation to young people in Ukraine, in line with
the change chain presented above and with the theory of change of the area.
The analysis allows us to be confident about UNICEF input regarding:
- The improvements of the national youth policy in Ukraine, in the context of undeniable quality
improvements of the policy framework, including the strategy, action plan and law on youth.
- The increased capacity to take youth into consideration in local policies and by local authorities, due
to the constant implementation of the Child and Youth Friendly City Initiative (CFCI) and the great
interest generated by the initiative among municipalities / local institutions.
- The creation of conditions for participation of young people, using face-to-face and online tolls,
including U-Report and UPSHIFT, but also other initiatives.
- The resilience and participation of young people to social cohesion building in Eastern Ukraine
UNICEF Ukraine success in using the U-Report, UPSHIFT and in the implementation of CFCI was already
recognised by UNICEF global and regional teams and these initiatives are presented in global publications
of UNICEF.
On the other hand, data collected show that UNICEF is among the very few organisations supporting young
people in Eastern Ukraine and independent reports show that these activities are effective and they
“positively contributed to the psychological well-being of school-age children in the areas affected by war: by
reducing the levels of negative behaviour of children in schools and reducing the levels of distress through
152
psychological work.” “UNICEF interventions also contributed positively to reducing the isolation of IDP families
and children and increasing the sense of normality and community living of those affected by the war.” 109

Ukraine than not
On the other hand, although there are undeniable improvements of the youth policy in Ukraine, the budget
of the youth programme is only 2% of the budget of the Ministry of Youth and Sports and this reduces the
chances of a well implemented policy. Youth participation structures remain week, youth participation
is, effectively, very limited and evidence is not enough to show that many vulnerable young people
have increased chances to participate. Actually, one critique to UNICEF initiative for adolescents and
youth participation (excepting the initiative in Eastern Ukraine) is that they don’t include enough tools and
methods to encourage the participation of the vulnerable and marginalised children.
Moreover, the impact of the youth empowerment and engagement initiatives at the level of local and
national authorities is still unclear. Although youth and child responsive plans have been developed
in several municipalities, there is no consistent evidence about the implementation of the activities
planned, therefore about the long-term commitment of the local authorities. This is relevant in the context
of the widespread risk of tokenism. Data collected from interviewees and results of the U-Report show that
tokenism (youth engagement in a ‘decorative’ and ‘manipulative’ way) continues to be an important
bottleneck for meaningful youth participation.
Therefore, there is need for sustained advocacy taking profit of this window of opportunity generated by
the reform of the youth policy in 2021, to promote regulations on youth consultation at local level, students
and youth councils at school and community level, supported by the government and the development
agencies and provided with tools to empower and engage young people, on the model of the initiative
already initiated.

We analyse the strength of the partnership, based on the Social Network Analysis. The specialists/country
officers that have provided us answers to the questionnaire for the Social Network Analysis work in
following areas: child protection, education, health, WASH, social policy, child rights monitoring (CRM) and
field operations.
According to the collected data, the main institutions with whom the CO collaborates are: Governmental
bodies (including ministries), National Agencies and Institutes and Municipalities and local institutions.
CSOs are also important within the network of UNICEF CO.

The Ministry of Social Policy and Voda Donbassu company have been identified most often as important
partners in the development of COs activities (6 times each), followed by The Ministry of Healthcare, the
Office of the Ombudsman and the Ukrainian Child Rights NGO (4 times each). All other institutions or
organizations have been indicated less than 4 times, even if the number of questionnaires responds form
CO Ukraine is rather high. This means that the respondents have provided us information on a wide range
of institutions and organization with whom they collaborate.
Regarding the frequency of communication, as observed from the data collected, most frequent contacts
have been established with: Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, UN agencies, CF Early Intervention
Institute, Free Legal Aid and NGO Infection Control in Ukraine. According to the data collected and based on
the average frequency of collaboration for each category of stakeholder identified, the most frequent
contact has been established with CSOs and the least frequent contacts with the governmental bodies
(including the ministries). Therefore, the communication and collaboration established with the two
ministries mentioned above constitutes an exception regarding the overall cooperation with governmental
bodies.
According to the opinion of respondents, the primary benefit of the collaboration developed with the
indicated institutions or organization, most frequent support was rated to access to decision makers (32%
of the analyzed case), followed by receiving support in accessing and convincing decision makers (23%)
and information that helps solving problems (20%).

When speaking about the benefits identified in the collaboration with CSOs, most important types of
support identified were information that helps solving problems (26,08%) and access to decision makers
(21,73%). When addressing the benefits received from the collaboration governmental bodies, the most
important aspect, as perceived by respondents, is also access to decision makers (51,43%), followed by
support in accessing and convincing decision makers (31,43%). In the case of collaboration with LPAs, the
benefits are equally distributed among the following: information for solving problems (28%) and access
to decisions makers (28%). Access to target groups (other than decision makers) is also an important
benefit of the collaboration with local authorities (24%). According to the data collected, CO staff consider
that when collaborating with public agencies and institutes the most important support received is the
information provided for solving problems (41,38%).
Another important criterion of the analysis is the level of value that the CO’s staff or contracted experts give
to certain collaborations. On a scale form 1(no value) to 10, the average value of the collaboration
established with CSOs is 8,28. In the case of governmental bodies the average collaboration value lower,
namely 7,06. The CO staff members consider that the partnership and communication established with state
agencies and institutes is rather good (7,67 points). In the case of UN agencies and international
organizations the received score is similar, 7,78 points. Nevertheless, municipalities and other local public
institutions are most valued within the CO’s network, being scored with 8,60 points.

In Ukraine, the social network of UNICEF CO has an average degree of 2.825 edges per nodes and an average
weight degree of 3.1 edges. The coefficients of these two metrics indicate that the average connection per
UNICEF expert and external partner organization of UNICEF is 3 connections.
The size of the network of UNICEF CO Ukraine is 80 nodes and the network diameter has a coefficient of 8
nodes. As in the case of UNICEF CO Ukraine, the peripheral areas of the network of UNICEF CO Ukraine are
more isolated, as the shortest path between the two most distant nodes in the network is 8 nodes. This
could be explained through the higher number of municipalities and NGOs that show up in the network.
Regarding the characteristics of the overall partnership network developed by UNICEF CO Ukraine, the data
analysis shows the existence of a relatively strong community, with various connections between actors in
different clusters formed around the departments of the CO or the specialists/experts of the CO. However,
this network is more partitioned than the network of UNICEF CO Bulgaria and the overall regional network.
This conclusion is based on the modularity coefficient (0,566), that shows that the network is not formed
157
only by clusters of interactions, but that the identified clusters are interconnected through the connections
established between their members.
Concerning the average path length, it has a coefficient of 3.898, which indicates relative strong flow of
information in the network of UNICEF CO in Ukraine. The average number of steps along the shortest paths
for all possible pairs of network nodes is 4 UNICEF experts and/or external partner organization of UNICEF,
which is longer than in the network of UNICEF CO Republic of Moldova and similar with the of UNICEF CO
Ukraine. This length can pe explained due to the peripheral areas of the network in Ukraine, which is more
isolated than in the network from the Republic of Moldova. In other words, to reach a certain node in the
network it only requires a path through 4 UNICEF’s experts and/or external partner organizations.
The following graphs highlights the nodes that have the highest coefficient in three metrics of network
analysis: number of degrees, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality for Ukraine.

degrees, the Education Officer with 10 degrees and the Chief Wash with 10 degrees. In addition to the
aforementioned nodes, the following ones have 10 degrees as well: the Health Officer, Chief Child Protection
Officer and Chief Social Policy, all of UNICEF CO Ukraine. Concerning the external partners organizations of
UNICEF in Ukraine that have the most edges, the evaluators identified the following nodes: the Oblast
administration in Donetsk (6 degrees), the Oblast administration in Luhansk (6) degrees, the Ministry of
Social Policy (5 degrees), the Ministry of Healthcare (4 degrees) and the Office of the Ombudsman (4
degrees).

The Oblast administration in Donetsk and the Oblast administration in Luhansk are the nodes that have the
highest closeness centrality coefficient, 0.37. The other nodes that have high closeness centrality coefficient
are the Chief of the WASH programme (0.35), the Child Protection Officer (0.34) and the Education Officer
(0.34). Other external partner organizations that have a central position in the network are VodaDonbassu
company, Ministry of Healthcare UA, Ministry of Regional Development and Ministry of Social Policy,
The Chief of the WASH Programme and the WASH Officer are the nodes that have high coefficients in all
three metrics of network analysis: degrees, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality. Thus, they can
be considered as the nodes that the best connected in the UNICEF Network. Both nodes are connected with
the following nodes that have high or moderate high betweenness centrality and closeness centrality:
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Ukraine (betweenness centrality: 0.02,
closeness centrality: 0.29), State Water Resources Agency (betweenness centrality: 0.07, closeness

Annex 9. Methodology and Results of the Social Network Analysis
Social Network Analysis contributes to answering the evaluation question no. 9 (“To what extent did UNICEF manage to build
effective and sustainable partnerships in working towards addressing the predefines bottlenecks, advocating for evidence for
equity and contributing to the results at scale?”). Social network analysis (SNA) is a field of data analytics (a quantitative method)
that uses networks and graph theory to understand social structures. In order to build SNA graphs, two key components are
required: actors and relationships. In network analysis, actors are referred to as nodes (the dots on the graph) and relationships as
edges (the lines on the graph). Social Network Analysis is the most effective method available today for visualizing and evaluating
group connectivity. By using Network Analysis, three measures can be tracked: (1) depth of relationship and (2) frequency of
communication The Network Analysis allows the evaluation team to track and measure the connections that exist between
stakeholders and UNICEF Country Offices.
In order to apply the Social Network Analysis an online survey among all staff members of UNICEF CO has been conducted.
The data collection phase has been conducted in August 2021. Through the SNA questionnaire, the
evaluation team has collected data on main collaborations developed by UNICEF Bulgaria CO, the areas of
collaboration, type of support received or benefits, frequency of collaboration and the value of information
or other type of support received CO specialists.
By applying network analysis, the evaluation team was able to track and measure the connections that exist
between stakeholders from Bulgaria and the Country Offices and to make recommendations to strengthen
the collaboration of UNICEF with other organizations and/or institutions across the country110. Network
Analysis is the most effective method available today for visualizing and evaluating group connectivity.
Through network analysis, the evaluation team identified key stakeholders and potential connections for
the Country Offices of UNICEF111. By using Network Analysis, the evaluation teams appreciated the depth of
the relationship by looking at two dimensions112:
• Frequency of communication, which was quantified by including a 1-10 scale in the survey that
measures frequency of communication, in which 1 represents weak communication and 10
represents strong communication. The respondents were asked to appreciate the frequency of
communication by using the scale;
• Quality of support, which was quantified by including a 1-10 scale in the survey that measures the
quality of support offered by the selected stakeholders in the survey, in which 1 represents weak
support and 10 represents strong support. The respondents were asked to appreciate the quality of
support by using the scale.
Network analysis provided a tool through which UNICEF ECARO and the Country Office can increase their
collective self-awareness and ability to see the whole system. The network maps that were developed have
the following components113:
• A node is any individual or organization in the network. Nodes can take different size, proportional
to the influence of the individual or organization. In the network analysis that was conducted for
this evaluation, the nodes are the experts (officers, specialists or external consultants) that work
for or collaborate with the Country Offices of UNICEF from the Republic of Moldova, Bulgaria,
Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan and various stakeholders from the four countries that collaborate with
the Country Offices of UNICEF.
• An edge is a bond or relationship that connects two individuals or organizations. Edges can be
assigned a weight depending on the strength of the connection. For this evaluation, the weight
accorded to the edges encompass the values given by the respondents for the two scales included

in the survey: frequency of communication and quality of support. The evaluation made an
average of the values given by the respondents on the two dimensions and applied to the edges.
Besides the development of the graphs, the evaluation team applied a collection of metrics to quantify how
important and influential are nodes in the network, evaluate the size and diameter of the network and
obtain information on the length and distance of the paths between nodes in the network.
Metric Value
Average Degree Average number of links per node
Network Diameter The maximum distance between any pair of nodes in the graph.
Modularity is one measure of the structure of networks or graphs. It was designed to
measure the strength of division of a network into modules (also called groups, clusters or
Modularity
communities). Networks with high modularity have dense connections between the nodes
within modules but sparse connections between nodes in different modules.
Average path length is defined as the average number of steps along the shortest paths for
Average Path Length all possible pairs of network nodes. It is a measure of the efficiency of information or mass
transport on a network.
A connected component is a group of nodes that are connected to each other, but not
Connected Component connected to another group of nodes. Another way of thinking of this is a group of connected
nodes that have no path to a node from another group.
According to the social network analysis carried out for the purpose of this evaluation, the main institutions
with whom the CO collaborates are: Governmental bodies (including ministries), National Agencies and
Institutes and Municipalities and local institutions. CSOs are also important within the network of UNICEF
CO.

The Ministry of Social Policy and Voda Donbassu company have been identified most often as important
partners in the implementation of COs activities, followed by The Ministry of Healthcare, the Office of the
Ombudsman and the Ukrainian Child Rights NGO. On the other hand, most frequent contacts have been
established with: Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, UN agencies, CF Early Intervention Institute, Free
Legal Aid and NGO Infection Control in Ukraine. According to the data collected, and based on the frequency
of collaboration for each category of stakeholder identified, UNICEF CO staff members get in contact more
189
frequently with CSO and the less frequently contacts with the governmental bodies (including the
ministries).
From the perspective of the CO staff, the most fruitful cooperation (i.e., in terms of value information
or support received) is established with CSOs (value of information or support received is scored
8,28 out of 10) and municipalities and other local public institutions ((value of information or
support received is scored 8,60 out of 10).

Regarding the characteristics of the overall partnership network developed by UNICEF CO Ukraine, the data
analysis shows the existence of a relatively strong community, with various connections between actors in
different clusters formed around the departments of the CO or the specialists/experts of the CO.
Social media data analysed114, on the other side, indicate a strong cooperation between UNICEF and
central ministries, particularly Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education. UNICEF CO Ukraine is
mentioned in approximately 35% of social media announcements analysed; at least half of them refer to
COVID vaccination but a significant number also address important topics regarding on-line/remote
learning, for all parts, i.e., children, including with SEN, teachers, parents. Social media presence involving
UNICEF also refers to reform of pre-school education and nutrition in school.
