1. BACKGROUND
1. The purpose of this evaluation of the Programme on Prevention of Violence and Bullying in School – Steps
Together (hereinafter referred to as the Steps Together Programme) was forward-looking to lead to
improvements of the structure, implementation and quality of the Steps Together Programme, and eventually
to ensure its national scale-up and sustainability through its legal and administrative institutionalization and
status budgeting. The Steps Together Programme was implemented in five pilot schools in Bulgaria – Sofia,
Teteven, Kustendil, Iskar and Zavet. The Steps Together Programme was implemented with no external donor
funding, but was funded by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Ministry of Education and
Sciences (MES) at a cost of BGN 487,490, of which BGN 427,490 was UNICEF’s contribution. At the time of this
evaluation, Programme implemented had ended.
2. The target audience, including primary expected users of this evaluation will be UNICEF CO and the MES, along
with the pilot schools and schools who are interested in implementing the Programme in the future. Other
users of this evaluation may include the ASA, MLSP and SACP. This evaluation will also be of interest to partner
UN agencies and international financial institutions and donors that contribute to UNICEF results and wider UN
system commitments, intended outcomes and efforts on the realization of children’s rights and wider human
rights commitments, including promoting gender equality and ending violence against women and girls.
3. The design of this evaluation was guided by the Terms of Reference (TOR) and programme documents, and the
Revised Evaluation Policy of UNICEF14, Evaluation Norms and Standards of the United Nations Evaluation Group
(UNEG)15, UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards and Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis16 and
UNICEF-Adapted UNEG Evaluation Report Standards.17
1.1. Country Context
4. Bulgaria has been a member of the European Union (EU) since 2007; nevertheless, Bulgaria still strives to catch
up with EU standards in socio-economic development and cohesion.18 According to the World Bank, Bulgaria
is an upper-middle income country19 with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of USD 69.89 billion in 2020.20 Over
the past decade, Bulgaria has achieved significant economic growth from a GDP of USD 13.2 billion in 2000 to
USD 69.89 billion in 2020, including a 3.6 percent annual increase in GDP from 2017 to 2019. In 2020, however,
due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Bulgaria experienced a 4.4 percent annual decrease in GDP from 2019.21
In 2022, the National Statistical Institute of the Republic of Bulgaria reported an annual GDP growth of 4.5
percent and a monthly inflation rate of 2.5 percent.22
5. In 2019, the World Bank reported that Bulgaria’s income per capita is 47 percent of the EU average; the lowest
in the EU.23 Poverty measured by the upper-middle income line of USD 5.5 per day (in purchasing power parity
(PPP) terms) has decline from 5 percent in 2015 to 2 percent in 2019.24 The World Bank projects that
productivity will need to grow by at least 4 percent per year over the next 25 years if Bulgaria is to catch up to
average EU incomes levels and boost shared prosperity.25

6. In 2022, Bulgaria’s population was estimated at 6,838,973.26 In 2020, it was estimated that 17.5 percent were
children aged 0-17.27 According to most recent population census data (2011), the main ethnic group is
Bulgarian (84.8 percent); ethnic minority groups include Turkish (8.8 percent) and Roma (4.9 percent).28 A key
challenge in Bulgaria is the disparity between the Bulgarian ethnic group and Turkish and Roma ethnic groups.29
In 2017, the Roma ethnic group was five times more likely to live in poverty (77.2 percent), compared to the
Bulgarian ethnic group (15.7 percent). Risk of poverty is influenced by education, regardless of ethnic group,
but the Roma ethnic group is more likely to be poor with a primary or no education (73.2 percent). The Roma
ethnic group is also more likely to be unemployed (39.9 percent) and to be working poor (25.9 percent),
compared to working poor in the Turkish ethnic group (25.7 percent) and Bulgarian ethnic group (20.1
percent).30 Indigence rates or serious material deprivation are also highest among the Roma ethnic group (81.0
percent), compared to the Turkish ethnic group (36.9 percent) and Bulgarian ethnic group (23.7 percent).31
7. In 2020, Bulgaria’s multidimensional poverty rate was 32.1 percent (down from 49.2 percent in 2010).32 That
same year, the multidimensional poverty rate for children aged 0-17 was 32.8 percent (down from 49.8 percent
in 2010.33 In 2017, it was estimated that 37.9 percent of children aged 0-17 in Bulgaria were at-risk of living in
poverty before social transfers, and this was reduced to 29.2 percent after social transfers; social transfers have
helped to reduce the percentage of children living in poverty.34 Child poverty is linked to family separation and
poor health and development outcomes, as well as low levels of academic achievement and under
employment.35 The most vulnerable and marginalized children in include children living in poor households,
female-headed households, and large families with more than three children. Among the most vulnerable and
marginalized are children those who belong to Roma and Turkish ethnic groups, and migrant and refugee
families, as well as unaccompanied and separated children, and children living in residential institutions.36
Fighting against child poverty is a national priority, but implementation requires an integrated approach and
multi-sectoral policies, along with financial support (e.g., housing benefits, child benefits or tax relief for
families).37
8. The Human Development Indices and Indicators: 2020 Statistical Update38 presents Human Development Index
(HDI) values39 for 189 countries and territories with the most recent data for 2019. Table 1 compares 1990 and
2019 HDI values40 for Bulgaria.41 Scores for the three HDI dimension indices are aggregated into a composite
index using a geometric mean and a ranking provided.42 In 2019, Bulgaria was classified as being ‘very high’ on
the HDI, positioning at 56 out of 189 countries and territories. Between 1990 and 2019, Bulgaria’s HDI value
increased from 0.708 to 0.816, an increase of 15.3 percent. Bulgaria has made progress on each of the HDI
indicators. In particular, from 1990 to 2019, Bulgaria’s life expectancy at birth increased by 3.8 years, mean

39 The HDI is a composite index focused on three basic dimensions of human development: the ability to lead a long and healthy
life, measured by life expectancy at birth; the ability to acquire knowledge, measured by mean year of schooling and expected
years of school; and the ability to achieve a decent standard of living, measured by gross national income per capita. The scores
for the three HDI dimension indices are aggregated into a composite index using a geometric mean and a ranking provided; see

9. To measure human development more comprehensively, the Human Development Indices and Indicators: 2020
Statistical Update presents the Gender Development Index (GDI), which compares female and male
achievements on HDI values, and the Gender Inequality Index (GII), which highlights women’s empowerment
as it relates to reproductive health, education, political representation and the labour market.45 The GDI is
calculated for 167 countries. In 2019, the female GDI value for Bulgaria is 0.813, in contrast to 0.817 for males,
resulting in a GDI value of 0.995, placing it into Group 1 of countries with high equality in GDI achievements. In
addition, Bulgaria has a GII value of 0.206, ranking it 48 out of 162 countries.46
10. Bulgaria has ratified core international human rights conventions, including the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (UDHR), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the
International Covenant of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESC), as well as the Millennium Declaration
and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As a signatory, the Government of Bulgaria (GoB) has
prioritized improving access to and quality of health, education, child protection and social services for children
and families in need, including social inclusion of persons with disabilities.
11. Since ratifying the CRC in 1991, Bulgaria has made significant progress in ensuring compliance of its legal and
policy frameworks to protect children from violence and abuse. After the adoption of the Child Protection Act
in 2000, Bulgaria developed a national child protection system in keeping with international standards and
practices. Corporal punishment is prohibited under the Child Protection Act, the Family Code (2009) and the
Pre-school and School Education Act (2015). In 2017, the Council of Ministers adopted a National Programme
on Prevention of Violence Against and Abuse of Children.47
12. In recent years, there has been increased knowledge generation as to nature, extent and dynamics of violence
against children (VAC) in Bulgaria. Such knowledge has contributed to the development of prevention
programmes, referral mechanisms and provision of services for child victims of violence and abuse. Steps have
also been taken to raise awareness and build the capacities of professionals from across sectors (education,
health, social work, police and justice) to identify and respond to VAC, and to monitor and inspect systems of
child protection and social service provision to vulnerable children and their families.48

46 As it relates to the GII dimension indices, 25.8 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women in Bulgaria. In addition, 94.4
percent of adult women have reached at least a secondary level of education, compared to 96.4 percent of adult males. Also,
female labour force participation is 49.2 percent, compared to 62.0 percent for men. Also, for every 100,000 live births, 10
women die from pregnancy-related causes, and the adolescent birth rate is 3995 births per 1,000 women of aged 15-19; Ibid,

13. Children’s issues have remained high on the national policy agenda and significant progress has been achieved
in key areas with support from UNICEF and other partners. In particular, progress has made in early childhood
development and education (ECD/E), and education in general, child protection and access to justice for
children, including improvements to the juvenile justice system, and deinstitutionalization of children from
state-run residential institutions.49 In recent years, Bulgaria has increasingly provided technical assistance to
other countries in the region for advancing child rights, by sharing knowledge and experiences through
horizontal cooperation.50 Still, however, negative trends in child and adolescent health, well-being and
behaviours exist in Bulgaria, including early pregnancies and abortions, adolescent mental health problems and
engagement in risky behaviours which undermines the realization of a healthy transition into adulthood.51
14. As it relates to child protection, Bulgaria has achieved progress in moving away from the inherited system of
placing vulnerable children in state-run residential institutions to developing a system of foster care and family-
type homes of children in need of alternative care.52 Bulgaria has been a leader in comparison to other
countries in the region for their work to deinstitutionalize children.53 Still, however, Bulgaria struggles with
coordination of multi-sectoral responses to children in need of protection and building the capacities of
professionals at local and regional levels to assess and respond to the needs of vulnerable children and their
families, including child victims of violence.54 In addition, weak enforcement and implementation of otherwise
good child protection policies, and inadequate budgeting and monitoring of multi-sectoral programmes have
served as a barrier in Bulgaria.55 There is also a lack of disaggregated administrative data on vulnerable children
and child victims of violence and abuse.56
15. At the societal level, Bulgaria has a weak child rights culture and discriminatory social norms, attitudes and
practices that contribute to disparities and social exclusion that impact children nationwide. This contributes
to Bulgaria having among the lowest social indicators for children in the EU.57
16. UNICEF’s agenda has been to assist Bulgaria to ensure that all children, especially the most vulnerable and
disadvantaged, to enjoy their rights and develop to their full potential in an inclusive and protective society
which is respectful of their voices.58 This agenda is in line with Bulgaria’s national priorities as identified in the
National Strategy for the Child (2008-2018)59, National Development Programme Bulgaria 203060, National
Strategy for Reduction of Poverty and Promotion of Social Inclusion (2021)61, National Strategy on Roma
Integration (2012-2020)62, National Strategy for Vision of Deinstitutionalization (2012-2025), National Health
Strategy (2015-2020), National Program for Improving Maternal and Child Health (2014-2020), and National

1.2. Violence Against Children in Bulgaria
17. Protection of children from all forms of violence is a fundamental right enshrined in the CRC and is included as
a specific target in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In particular, Sustainable Development Goal
(SDG) Target 16.2 aims to end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of
children; this target gives renewed impetus towards the realization of the rights of every child to live free from
fear, neglect, abuse and exploitation. In addition, SDG Target 5.2 aims to eliminate all forms of violence against
all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of
exploitation.69
18. VAC continues to be a serious problem in Bulgaria.70 VAC includes emotional, physical and sexual abuse, and
neglect and exploitation. It occurs in homes and families, educational settings, care and justice systems, and
public spaces.
19. In 2019, UNICEF supported a study on VAC in Bulgaria, which revealed that one in three children aged 13-17
and young people aged 18-24 experienced physical violence as a child, and physical violence was commonly
experienced at home and in schools and the community. Boys were more likely to experience physical violence
in the home than girls (Chart 1).

20. Parents were the most common perpetrators of physical violence in the home In fact, 40 percent of
parents/caregiver reported using physical violence as a form of discipline in the last year and about 5 percent
reported using severe physical punishment. Although mothers and fathers were equally like to use physical
violence against the child in the home, fathers were more likely to inflict serious injury. In comparison, physical
violence that occurred at school and in the community was most often committed by other students or
children..71
21. School violence and peer-on-peer violence are also problems in Bulgaria. In 2019, UNICEF-supported research
found that 17 percent of children aged 13-17 and young people aged 18-24 experienced physical violence at

school. Boys were more likely to experience physical violence at school than girls More than one in four or 25
percent of children and young people who experienced physical violence at school reported they suffered
physical injuries, including bruising and bleeding. Children and young people also reported experiencing
emotional violence in school; in particular, 35 percent of children and young people reported being subjected
to humiliation and/or insults at school. In schools, other students were the most common perpetrators of
physical and emotional violence.72 In addition, ‘other adults’ in and around the school (e.g., parents of other
children), but not adults working at the Fewer than 5 percent of children and young people reported being
subject to physical violence by their teacher.73
22. Along with previous research, this study demonstrate that corporal punishment is widely used in Bulgaria,
particularly in the home and family setting, and is widely accepted as a means to discipline and control
children.74 In fact, in 2020, 29 percent of respondents agree that ‘smacking a child is sometimes for their own
good’ and 18 percent of respondents neither agreed or disagreed with this statement.75 Given the social norms
supportive of corporal punishment, there is a reluctance among state authorities to interfere in private family
matters, and VAC is generally perceived as a private family matter; as a result, most incidents of VAC go
unreported and undocumented.76
23. There is clear evidence that violence harms children’s physical and mental health and development, including
their ability to learn and build relationships with others, and to become fully functional adults and parents.
More specifically, school violence and bullying, and unsafe and insecure school environments are reasons for
children’s poor attendance, school performance, and dropout from school. Individuals who drop out of school
are more likely to have negative outcomes that limit opportunities for children to achieve their full potential in
life and socio-economic success in adulthood.77
24. To address school violence and bullying, in April 2017, the MES initiated the development of a multi-sectoral
action plan which aimed to prevent violence and create safe environments in schools. This plan included the
development of a Mechanism of Counteracting Bullying and Violence in the Institution of the Preschool and
School Education System which was put forth by MES; this is the only education-based policy on VAC. The
Mechanism include provisions of psychologists and pedagogical counsellors, targeted trainings for teachers,
and the introduction of classroom and afterschool activities for prevention of violence. This initiative highlights
the fact that the MES understands that addressing school violence and bullying requires implementing a
coherent and purposeful policy that is shared and implemented by all key stakeholders in the education sector.
25. In keeping with the Mechanism, each school, including preschools, are obligated to: establish a Coordination
Council, which is responsible for planning, monitoring and coordinating efforts to prevent and respond to
school violence and bullying; assess and analyse the situation of school violence and bullying in an effort to

73 In comparison, the 2014 HBSC Survey found that peer bullying impacts children nationwide. More specifically, 17 percent of
students were victims of cyber-bullying (offensive chat messaging, Facebook posts and creation of websites) and 14 percent of
students had insulting or inappropriate images of them published on the internet. About 6 percent of students aged 11-15 were
exposed to cyber-bullying more than twice a month. Among the 43 countries where the HBSC Survey was administered, students
in Bulgaria were among the top ten countries to be affected by school bullying; as a result, many children did not feel protected

activities. To further address school violence and bullying, steps were taken to review and revise the State
Standard on Inclusive Education.
26. Despite the existence of a unified framework that lays the foundation for safe schools, it appears that
educational institutions need more support to effectively implement ending violence against children (EVAC)
initiatives. Some of the weaknesses with the MES approach to addressing school violence and bullying are that
students have not been viewed as active or equal participants in efforts to improve school safety, the roles of
parents have not been clearly defined and need to be strengthened, and pedagogues need support to fulfil
their roles and responsibilities related to preventing school violence and bullying. To address this and support
implementation of the Mechanism of Counteracting Bullying and Violence in the Institution of the Preschool
and School Education System, in 2019, UNICEF, in partnership with MES, initiated the development and
implementation of the Programme on Prevention of Violence and Bullying in Schools – Steps Together
Programme (the Programme). The Steps Together Programme was self-funded by UNICEF and MES.
1.3. Child Protection System in Bulgaria
27. UNICEF’s analyses of VAC and the child protection system in Bulgaria78 has identified weak institutional
capacities for detecting and reporting incidents of VAC, as well as weak multi-sectoral and inter-institution
cooperation in the handling of VAC cases. In recent years, national policy and coordination mechanisms for
responding to VAC have improved; yet a very small number of VAC cases are handled by multi-disciplinary
teams. Quality coordinated, multi-sectoral responses are not systematically available across the country and
the effectiveness of interventions have yet to be documented.79
28. In the social service sector there is also a lack of capacity among professional responsible for responding to VAC
and other child protection-related issues. Professionals lack the knowledge and skills needed to recognize the
signs and negative consequences of VAC, and to effective support child victims of violence. As a result, only
the most severe incidents and forms of VAC are typically registered by authorities; whereas most incidents of
VAC go unreported and undocumented. Thus, Bulgaria has very low prosecution and conviction rates for
perpetration of VAC.80 In addition, lack of public awareness as to the negative consequences and long-term
effect of violence on children hampers national strategies to end VAC.81
29. Research has found that training sessions for social workers are typically done on an ad hoc basis (e.g., as part
of a project funded by the EU or an NGO project), but are not part of the formal system of training for social
workers. Moreover, social workers have a heavy workload, with no clear process for prioritizing cases, and lack
the resources needed to do their jobs; this contributes to a high level of workplace stress. In addition, social
workers have a large volume of paperwork that is required as part of monitoring and inspections; this is coupled
with inefficiencies in the sectors information management system.82 This situation is further compounded by
low salaries and a lack of supervision, which contributed to high rates of turnover.83
30. Research and evaluations have also found that Child Protection Departments face difficulties when it comes to
organization inter-agency and cross-sectoral coordination (multi-disciplinary coordination), which is needed in
child protection cases. 84 Although social workers recognized that there was good cooperation among social

82 The child protection system in Bulgaria need an integrated information management system that will improve monitoring,
reporting and evaluation of child protection cases, and will improve case management and linkages among different child
protection departments and sectors; see UNICEF & Coram International (2020). Study on Violence against Children in Bulgaria,

workers, municipal authorities, and police authorities, it was more difficult to secure the engagement of
education and health professionals, and justice officials in child protection cases. The lack of cooperation of
health professionals in child protection cases was particularly evident in the relatively low rate of referrals (46
percent) from the health sector to social workers, which is particularly concerning given the high proportion of
children who experience physical violence across settings. Given the lack of formal multi-disciplinary
coordination in child protection cases, informal networks have been established to strengthen coordination
and cooperation across agencies in child protection cases.85
31. Developing a roadmap for changing social norms related to corporal punishment, gender-based violence (GBV),
and child marriage, coupled with strengthening processes and practices for preventing and responding to VAC
and GBV, including child marriage, has been a priority of the GoB, and development partners, such as UNICEF.86
32. In 2016, the UN Committee for the Rights of Children expressed in its Concluding Observations to Bulgaria
concerns with prevailing social norms that domestic violence is a private matter and that there are insufficient
services for children who have experienced violence. In recent years, prevailing social norms in Bulgaria have
challenged the advancement of reforms related to women and children’s rights, including the draft National
Strategy for the Child 2019-2030 and the national child helpline.
33. In 2015, UNICEF partnered with two NGOs to establish Child Advocacy Centres (CACs), known nationally as Zona
ZaKrila. The Centres were established to work with child victims and witnesses of violence and crimes,
particularly children who experienced sexual and/or physical violence, domestic violence, school violence and
community violence.87 Modeled after best practices identified in Child and Youth Advocacy Centres in Canada,
the CACs were designed to utilize an integrated, multi-sectoral approach to provide coordinated and integrated
services. The Centres are often described as a ‘one-stop shop’ where child victims and witnesses of violence and
crimes can receive consultations and services, including legal aid, psychological support, social support,
assistance with medical examinations, and child-sensitive forensic interviews and hearings. Staff working in
CACs are trained and qualified to provide child-centred approaches and to advocate for the best interests of
the child, and to take into consideration the child’s safety and welfare.88
34. CACs provide case management in close cooperation with child protection departments, police, prosecutors
and courts. Such an integrated, multi-sectoral approach aims to improve inter-sectoral communication and
cooperation in the best interests of the child, and to reduce inefficiencies, duplications and omissions in service
provision for child victims and witnesses of violence and crimes. The Centre aims to improve linkages among
community providers of therapeutic services to guarantee that child victims and witnesses receive protection,
support and gain redress.89
35. In 2020, there were three CACs in Bulgaria. The first Centre was opened in Montana in September 2015, the second
was opened in Sofia in October 2015, and the third was opened in Shumen in January 2016. Each of the CACs
were licensed by the Agency of Social Analyses (ASA) in October 2016. The CACs in Montana and Shumen cover the
entire areas of their respective regions, whereas the Centre in Sofia covers the metropolitan area. Still, however,
each Centre have responded to notifications outside of their coverage areas.90
36. Financed, in part by UNICEF Bulgaria, the CACs provide a 24/7 response to incidents of VAC. The Centres in
Montana and Shumen are managed by Social Activities and Practices Institute (SAPI), whereas the Centre in Sofia is managed by
Animus Association Foundation. These are two of the largest and most experienced NGOs in Bulgaria, with over 20 years of
experience working on issues of violence and trauma. The two NGOs regularly cooperate with one another and exchange
methodologies, good practices and documents/reports in an effort to equip their staff with the knowledge and skills needed to carry
out effective case management and risk assessments, and to monitor and review children’s progress, and to evaluate the needs of
children and their families.91

37. CACs have facilities and staff who have been trained to interview children in a child-sensitive manner. Services
offered are individualized and guided by findings from needs assessments conducted for each child and their
parents/caregivers. Each Centre is equipped with child friendly spaces specially equipped with video and sound
recording systems for evidential video interviewing of child victims and witnesses, and for their participation in
legal proceedings.92
38. In 2020, UNICEF conducted an external evaluation of the CACs. The evaluation concluded that CACs are able to
deliver quality integrated services, which has been relevant to the national priorities and needs of the
government. It is quality integrated service delivery that benefits children and families the most. As CACs
successfully support children and families, the number of referrals made to CACs by institutions/agencies and
self-referrals to CACs has significantly and steadily increased from 2015 to 2019; in keeping, the number of
children and parents who received psycho-social support, therapeutic treatment, crisis intervention and legal
services from CACs has steadily increased.93
39. The evaluation also found that CACs work with lawyers who provide free legal services to children and their
families, which has improved access to justice for children who experience violence and crimes, including
improved access to justice for vulnerable and marginalized children. CACs also prepare children for involvement
in litigation when they have been witnesses or victims of violence and crimes, and they accompany children
and parents to court proceedings as their cases proceed through the justice system.94
40. CACs were also able to improve cooperation and coordination across sectors and professionals (e.g., teachers,
social workers, police officers, prosecutors and judges) in keeping with the best interests of the child. Despite
the fact that CACs are not a state-regulated bodies and do not have coordination mechanism powers (this is
the responsibility of Child Protection Department (CPDs)), CACs were able to establish good relations with
professionals across sectors to support inter-agency coordination to support child victims of violence and
crimes, and their families.95
41. CACs are able to contribute to long-term positive changes in children’s well-being and recovery because they
provide long-terms services, especially in serious cases of violence where children show negative effects and
symptoms related to the violence and victimization. Both children and parents reported the CACs helped to
make positive changes or improvements in their lives.96
1.4. Educational System in Bulgaria
42. In Bulgaria, education is compulsory from 5-16 years of age. Compulsory public education is free which means
that education services, facilities for training and state exams are free of charge. Textbooks for students from
grades I to VII are also free, as are textbooks on special subjects for students with sensory disabilities up to XII
grade and educational materials on general subjects printed in Braille. Since 2006, children from grades I to IV
receive breakfast free of charge.97
43. Over the past decade, the GoB has undertaken reforms to the educational system. In 2015, the GoB adopted
and enacted a new Preschool and School Education Act, which introduced for the first-time inclusive education
in all kindergartens and schools, and differentiated the types of support for children with disabilities and
vulnerable children at-risk of dropping out of school early. The MES has also carried out a number of activities
to increase access to education and to improve the integration of ethnic minority children, in an effort to reduce
dropout rates and improve the literacy and numeracy. This included adopting strategic documents, such as the
National Strategy for Reducing Early School Leaving (2013-2020), National Strategy for Educational Integration
of Children and Students from Ethnic Minorities (2015-2020), National Strategy for Lifelong Learning (2014-
2020), National Strategy for Improving and Promoting Literacy (2014-2020).98

44. In Bulgaria, there are notable disparities across schools in respect to the quality of school facilities. In 2017, it
was documented that in many small schools, there are still no internal toilets, which makes their use difficult.
Underfunding for school infrastructure impedes the maintenance of all schools, as well as the provision of
technical resources, technology and laboratories. Some of the smaller schools also lack adequate heating during
the winter months. Options for extracurricular activities for students are also very limited in rural schools and
in some urban districts where the existing infrastructure for play and entertainment is underdeveloped. Many
schools are still without gyms or any other facilities that could encourage physical activities and interest in
sports among students.99
45. The MES is responsible for ensuring children’s safety in schools and developing school policies and programmes
that aim to prevent violence and bullying in schools. In keeping, the MES sits on the National Council on the
Prevention of Violence and cooperates with SACP and NGOs to develop projects to prevent VAC in schools. As
part of their activities for addressing VAC, MES have established the Mechanism for Counteracting Bullying and
Violence in the Institutions of the Pre-school and School Education System. The Mechanism outlines a standard
approach for the prevention of violence and bullying in schools, and intervention that aim to create safe school
environments. In keeping with the Mechanism, school are expected to develop a school policy for prevention
and response to violence and bullying in schools, and a Coordination Council consisting of teachers, students
and parents. The Coordination Council is charged with planning, monitoring and assessing efforts of dealing
with violence and bullying in school.100
46. Despite the key role that educators play in identifying and responding to cases of VAC, research has found that
school staff are less likely than other professionals (with the exception of healthcare workers) to say that they
would definitely report situations involving children at risk of violence, abuse or neglect. In fact, only 17 percent
of school staff identified a child who was at-risk of violence, abuse or neglect during six-month period prior to
the study. It is notable that education professionals were least able to identify markers of VAC, compared to
other professionals, and generally viewed VAC, particularly child sexual abuse, as not a serious issue.
47. Although the majority of school staff viewed physical punishment as unacceptable, about one in six educators
thought that hitting or smacking children was an acceptable form of discipline; this finding indicates a need for
greater awareness-raising of the negative consequences of corporal punishment on children, and greater
support for school staff to use methods of non-violent and positive discipline, and to communicate more
effective with the parents of students.
48. Child protection officials have expressed concern that schools rarely report or refer situations of VAC or child
protection. Low reporting and referrals by schools is most likely due to the fact that school staff lack the
knowledge and awareness needed to identify incidents of VAC and the referral and reporting mechanisms that
are in place. In addition, school staff face challenges when it comes to working with parents, and they believe
that parents do not trust schools and will not cooperate in cases of school violence or bullying. This is regardless
of the fact that the majority of schools have policies and procedures related to reporting incidents of VAC and
child protection. The main barrier identified by teachers was a lack of training and guidance for both teachers
and schools counsellors. In fact, kindergarten and secondary school teachers were least likely to be trained on
VAC. So, while a mechanism to report school violence and bullying exists, many teachers expressed concern
that the mechanisms are not utilized and are essentially ineffective at preventing and responding to school
violence and bullying.
2. PROGRAMME ON PREVENTIONS OF VIOLENCE AND BULLYING IN SCHOOLS – STEPS TOGETHER
49. UNICEF’s Country Programme 2018-2022 has focused on supporting Bulgaria in its efforts to enable all children
and adolescents in the country, including the most disadvantaged, to enjoy their rights and to develop to their
full potential in an inclusive and protective society. The realization of the right of every child to live free from
violence, abuse, exploitation and harmful practices is a cross-cutting element throughout the Country
Programme.

50. In 2019, an Expert Group was
established in MES to develop a whole
school programme101 for a safe
environment102 to prevent violence in
schools. A whole school approach as
one where, “well-being and mental
health are everyone’s business, with
genuine engagement across the enter
community, including school staff,
students, parents, local authorities and
external services. The approach
involves multiple components,
including early identification and
intervention, staff well-being and
development, and skills-based work for
students, but above all it adopts a
positive and universal focus on well-
being.”103
51. As it related to the Programme on
Prevention of Violence and Bullying in
Schools – Steps Together, a whole
school approach is focused on
establishing a safe school environment
that prevents the emergence and

bullying, with a focus on reaching out to
and involving all participants in school
life, including school staff, students and parents. This approach has been multi-faceted, including:104
a. Emphasis is placed on the school’s policies, curriculum (e.g., introduction of social and emotional learning)
and changes to the schools social setting and amendments to its rules.
b. Participation of all members of the school community is promoted.
c. All teachers are responsible for prevention and management of cases of bullying in school, even if the
students involved are not their direct responsibility.
d. All students and all classes are engaged, not just the few students who are ‘at-risk’.
e. Activities aimed at preventing violence and bullying are integrated in the school curriculum and strategies,
and (in)formal interaction between teachers and their students, parents and other school staff.
52. The Programme on Prevention of Violence and Bullying in Schools – Steps Together Programme was envisaged
as a joint effort between UNICEF and MES. Other key stakeholders include the five pilot schools – Sofia, Teteven,
Kustendil, Iskar and Zavet – where the Steps Together Programme was implemented.105 Other key stakeholders
include local CPDs managed by the ASA, as well as the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection (MLSP) and the
State Agency for Child Protection (SACP), although they were not engaged in Programme implementation.
53. The stakeholder analysis identifies the duty-bearers as UNICEF Bulgaria and MES. As mentioned above, the
Steps Together Programme was envisaged as a joint effort between UNICEF and MES. Rights-holders include
intended and unintended beneficiaries of the Programme, which includes school staff, students and parents.
School staff are considered right-holders because they lacked the knowledge, attitudes and practices needed
101 A whole school approach is based upon a social-ecological model to address school violence and bullying.
102 A safe environment is characterized by a positive social and psychological climate at school and requires fostering a caring,
respectful, inclusive and supportive culture at school. A school having a positive climate is hospitable and its students and
teachers try their best to behave in the best possible way. Being part of such a setting positively affects students’ sense of
belonging to the school; see Steps Together Programme Document.

to implement the Steps Together Programme, so they were direct beneficiaries of the Programme (Annex G:
Stakeholder Analysis and Section 2.1 for a further description of the stakeholders in this Programme).
54. The aim of the Steps Together Programme was to raise awareness, commitment and capacity of the entire
school community to prevent and tackle school violence and bullying. In keeping, the goal of the Steps Together
Programme was to create a safe school environment to prevent violence and bullying at school, and the three
broad objectives, including:106
a. To support and foster school attitudes based on mutual respect, equal dignity and justice
b. To promote well-informed and competent participation on the part of all members of a school community
c. To employ a whole school approach by supporting school-based activities at all levels
55. The Steps Together Programme Document (ProDoc) did not include a clear or well-developed ToC, but did
include a Results Monitoring Framework (RMF) with defined outcomes, activities and indicators (Annex P). The
RMF did attempt to highlight how programme activities were envisaged to contribute to results of the
programme.107
56. In keeping, UNICEF Bulgaria envisions that an effort to tackle the problem of school violence would require a
whole school approach and responses at multiple levels, including working with individuals (i.e., school staff,
students and parents), groups (i.e., classes), schools and communities.
57. In keeping with the ProDoc, the components of the Programme include:
a. Increased awareness and enhanced sensitivity and willingness of school commitment to work on the
problems of violence and bullying.
b. Increased management capacities of school principals and coordination councils to apply the whole school
approach to prevent school violence and bullying.
c. Increased capacities and support of teaching staff to cope with their roles and functions related to
preventing violence and bullying.
d. Increased capacities and work with students to prevent school violence and bullying.
e. Parental involvement in the process of creating a safe school environment to prevent violence and bullying.
f. Development of the school community and its engagement to establish a safe environment.
g. An engaged local community to establish a safe school environment.
58. The Steps Together Programme is meant to regulate the long-term objectives relevant to establishing a safe
environment and prevention violence and bullying. Protection of children from all forms of violence, which is
a fundamental right enshrined in the CRC, and included as a specific target in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. In particular, SDG Target 16.2 aims to end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of
violence against and torture of children. In addition, SDG Target 5.2 aims to eliminate all forms of violence
against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types
of exploitation.108
2.1. Programme Implementation in Five Pilot Schools
59. To support the implementation of the Mechanism of Counteracting Bullying and Violence in the Institution of
the Preschool and School Education System, UNICEF, in partnership with MES, implemented the Programme on
Prevention of Violence and Bullying in Schools – Step Together Programme.
60. The Steps Together Programme was implemented in five pilot schools – Sofia, Teteven, Kustendil, Iskar and
Zavet - over the course of three school years, 2019-2022. The first school year, 2019-2020, was a preparatory
year, and the second and third school years, 2020-2022, were for Programme implementation. School selection
was completed in two phases. First, 13 schools were pre-selected using a questionnaire. Second, discussions
were held with school staff, students and parents to explore their willingness, readiness and motivation to join
the Steps Together Programme. Each school signed a decision by the pedagogical team to join the Steps
Together Programme.

61. The five pilot schools engaged in the Steps Together Programme were obliged to:
a. Sign an Agreement for participation in the Steps Together Programme and perform activities within the
framework of the Programme, under said Agreement.
b. Designate a Coordination Council for the purpose of the Steps Together Programme.
c. Participate in a baseline assessment of the situation of school violence and bullying [at the school level]
prior to beginning Programme activities, as well as during Programme implementation and at the end of
the Programme.
d. Introduce class activities in the school’s education plan/curriculum and conduct a number of classes
sufficient to cover the eight topics on preventing violence and bullying, promoting mental health and
personal development within the framework of the Steps Together Programme (for each class of students).
e. Provide for the participation of Coordination Council members, teaching and non-teaching staff and
student volunteers in training activities under the Steps Together Programme (about six days).
f. Introduce and apply methods to prevent and respond to violence and bullying, such as: peer support
groups, conflict mediation and restoration of values, as necessary.
g. Work jointly with parents on a regular basis (a minimum of four topical meetings per school year) and
involve parents in school life through various activities and by setting up a feedback system for parents to
use.
h. Partner and exchange information and practices with other schools and organisations working on
preventing and responding to VAC, personal development and the promotion of mental health.
i. Identify a space on school property that can be repurposed, and cooperate in the process of repurposing
and maintaining the space so that it can be used to implement the goal of the Steps Together Programme.
This could mean setting up and outfitting a relaxation area or a stress-free area for teachers and/or
students, or outfitting a meeting room where various meetings and seminars can be conducted.
j. Conduct active communication on a bilateral basis with representatives of the Programme’s management
from UNICEF and MES, and other participants in the initiative (each month).
k. Participate actively in working meetings to plan, coordinate, assess and raise awareness about actions
under the Steps Together Programme (each month.
l. Plan and implement a school policy on preventing and responding to violence and ensure mechanisms
suitable for said implementation.
m. Participate in mid-term evaluation of the Programme’s implementation and an external evaluation of the
Programme (i.e., the evaluation being conducted at this time).
62. Table 2 shows the number of classes and students engaged in the Steps Together Programme by region and
type of school – primary school (grades 1-4), middle schools (grades 5-7) and high schools (grades 8-12). In
total, an estimated 121-124 classes were engaged in the Programme, of which 21.5 percent were students in
primary schools, 27.3 percent were in middle schools and 51.2 percent were in high schools. In addition, 2,963
students were engaged in the Programme, of which 21.7 percent were primary school students, 26.1 percent
were middle schools students and 52.2 percent were high school students.

64. Evidence and knowledge generated through implementation of different components of the Steps Together
Programme are being used to inform the national policy framework on violence prevention and child protection
in the education sector, and will support development of training packages and modules on the topic.
2.2. Mid-Term Evaluation of the Steps Together Programme
65. UNICEF established a process to monitor and assess expected results. For instance, in September 2021, UNICEF
led a mid-term evaluation of the Steps Together Programme. The mid-term evaluation revealed that from
September 2020 to September 2021, during the first year of Programme implementation, a solid foundation
was laid both organizationally and methodologically to support the Programme’s implementation in the five
pilot schools. Activities accomplished in first year included:
a. An entrance survey in each of the five pilot schools which was focused on the school environment and
situations of violence and bullying.
b. UNICEF CO conducted workshops and trained school staff from the five pilot schools, particularly
homeroom teachers and educators, who showed an interest in supporting the Steps Together Programme.
This work continued into the second year of Programme implementation as well.
c. A process was set up with school mentors who would regularly monitor progress, receive feedback from
participants and provide support to Coordination Councils and teachers.
d. School Coordination Councils became more involved in their role as Programme coordinating bodies in
each of the pilot schools.
e. Work with parents was introduced, trainings were conducted to support community work and parent-
teacher conferences were conducted in each of the pilot schools.
f. Pedagogical specialists were given support to overcome stress and occupational burnout.
66. In the second year of the Programme (2021-2022), the focus was on strengthening programme implementation
in the five pilot schools. The second year included:
a. Operationalize the mechanism for counteracting violence and bullying in the institutions in the system of
pre-school and school education, as this was among the goals of the Programme.
b. Completion of trainings for homeroom teachers and educators, and delivery of refresher trainings.
c. Conduct workshops on all of the topics in the guide and practices of completing monitoring tools, including
the facilitators’ logbook and monitoring table, and gathering feedback from the pupils.
d. Formation of peace maker groups, and adoption of plans and activities for these groups.
e. Include Programme activities in annual plans and the guide for student activities.
f. Strengthen Coordination Councils, which would become a permanent body responsible for creating a
secure school community and preventing school violence and bullying. This included delegating more tasks
to the Coordination Council and encouraging involvement of male school staff, along with students and
parents.
g. School mentors provided methodological support to schools and conducted workshops on student
activities.
14
67. Recommendations in connection with filling in the facilitator’s logbook and feedback from the workshops in
which the student participated and the training in which teachers participated included:
a. Plans were adopted by school for working with parents and monitoring such plans at regular meetings of
the Roditeli (Parents) Association.
b. Introduction of supervision and intervision and strengthening the recovery approach.
c. Conduct an exit survey to identify any changes in the current state of the school environment and situations
of school violence and bullying.
68. The mid-term evaluation resulted in three recommendations, including: 1) people should be reminded that for
monitoring purposes, filling in the facilitator’s logbook should take place after finishing workshops; and 2)
homeroom teachers should be encouraged, when they remind middle school and high school students to
provide feedback, including what they like most and least about the Steps Together Programme, and what they
have learned; and 3) encourage school staff at the primary level to work with parents to provide feedback.
3. EVALUATION PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE
3.1. Evaluation Purpose
69. The purpose of this evaluation of the Programme is to lead to improvements of the structure, implementation
and quality of the Programme, and eventually to ensure its national scale-up and sustainability through its legal
and administrative institutionalization and status budgeting. The Programme was established with UNICEF
support in five schools in five different regions – Iskar, Kustendil, Sofia, Teteven and Zavet. The aim was to
understand why and to what extent intended and unintended results were achieved and to analyse implications
of the results.109
70. The target audience, including primary expected users of this evaluation will be UNICEF CO and the MES, along
with the pilot schools and schools who are interested in implementing the Programme in the future. Other
users of this evaluation may include the ASA, MLSP and SACP. This evaluation will also be of interest to partner
UN agencies and international financial institutions and donors that contribute to UNICEF results and wider UN
system commitments, intended outcomes and efforts on the realization of children’s rights and wider human
rights commitments, including promoting gender equality and ending violence against women and girls.
3.2. Evaluation Objectives
71. The main objectives of this evaluation were to:
a. Assess and evaluate the Programme and its implementation, along with its relevance, efficiency,
effectiveness, coherence and sustainability, and, to the extent possible, its impact on teachers, students
and parents.
b. Assess the Programme’s equity and child rights perspective, both in terms of the capacities to reach out to
and deliver support for prevention of violence and bullying in schools and ensure an environment of safe
schools.
c. Identify the enablers and challenges for institutionalizing and scaling up the Programme nationally.
d. Examine integration of the Programme into school life and management in the five pilot schools.
e. Examine the impact of the Programme in schools and the Mechanism for Countering Bullying and Violence
in Schools.
f. Provide recommendations for the process of institutionalizing and scaling up of the Programme nationally
and actions that need to be taken to ensure quality and sustainable implementation of the Programme in
the future.
3.3. Evaluation Criteria and Questions
72. Evaluation evidence was assessed using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
Development Assistance Committee’s (DAC) criteria110 of relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency,
impact and sustainability, as well as partnerships and cooperation. In the early stages of evaluation design, in
consultation with both the UNICEF Country Office (CO) and Regional Office (CO), the Lead Evaluator narrowed

3.4. Evaluation Scope
80. The evaluation focused on the five pilot schools – Sofia, Teteven, Kustendil, Iskar and Zavet – and covered the
period of September 2019 to June 2022. The evaluation included perspectives and views of all relevant partners
and stakeholders, including UNICEF CO personnel and school mentors, MES staff, members of the Roditeli
(Parents) Association, and pilot school staff (i.e., school principals, school psychologists, pedagogical
counsellors, teachers), students and parents who participated in and benefited from the Programme.
81. This evaluation also took into consideration challenges faced implementing the Programme during the COVID-
19 global pandemic, which had a significant impact on implementation of planned activities. National measures
taken to contain the spread of COVID-19 created enormous pressure on the capacities of schools to educate
students. During the pandemic, face-to-face teaching and learning had to be replaced with online distance
education and learning. The COVID-19 response became the main priority and captured most of the attention
and capacities of state institutions. In light of this situation, the evaluation was sensitive to how the COVID-19
pandemic influenced and shaped Programme implementation, and led to the need to adapt and adjust to
imposed restrictions and measures aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, the global pandemic
was ongoing at the time of the evaluation, although restrictions had been lifted.
82. Human and child rights-based and equity-based approaches guided the evaluation and data collection.
Particular attention was paid to exploring human rights as the goal of the programme; taking into account the
needs of school staff, students and parents. Attention was also paid to equity dimensions of the intervention.
For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential,
without discrimination, bias or favoritism. Equity-based evaluations provide assessments of what works and
what does not work to reduce inequity, and highlights intended and unintended results for the most vulnerable
groups, as well as inequalities in outcomes for vulnerable children and families. To the extent possible, access
to quality support and outcomes for different subgroups of vulnerable children and families were explored in
this evaluation, and the groups least reached will be identified.
4. EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
83. To ensure the evaluation approach was as thorough and reliable as possible, a mixed methods evaluation
approach was developed to ensure systematic collection of data and information related to each of the
evaluation criteria and questions. The primary sources of data and information was qualitative in nature.
84. The evaluation methods and data collection tools were developed for this evaluation were guided by the TOR
and a preliminary desk review with input from the UNICEF CO. UNICEF helped to ensure that data collection
tools were sufficient to meet the evaluation criteria.
85. During the inception phase, in consultation with both the UNICEF Country Office (CO) and Regional Office (CO),
the Lead Evaluator narrowed the focus of the evaluation questions to key questions, which also required
narrowing the evaluation matrix to focus on the key questions. During the evaluation, particularly during the
data analysis and report writing phases, only the 15 key questions were focused on as agreed with UNICEF CO
and RO, so the sub-questions were removed from the evaluation matrix (Annex F: Evaluation Matrix).
86. At the inception phase, the evaluation matrix included a total of 30 indicators related to the 15 key evaluation
questions, of which 21 were qualitative indicators and 9 were quantitative indicators. During the data analysis
and report writing phases, the evaluation matrix was slightly revised to include 34 indicators related to the 15
key questions, including 27 qualitative indicators and 9 quantitative indicators (two indictors that were both
qualitative and quantitative indicators). Minor modifications to the indicators were made because during the
inception phase only five programme documents were available for review, which made it difficult to draft
indicators. During the data collection and analysis phases, the evaluation team came to better understand the
Programme and data that were available. The minor modifications that were made to the indicators were done
18
to strength the evaluator’s ability to effectively answer the evaluation questions and present the findings (see
Annex Table F2 for an explanation of modifications made to indicators).
87. It was beneficial that majority of evaluation indicators were qualitative in nature given the complex nature of
implementing a school-based programme during the COVID-19 pandemic when schools were temporarily
closed and learning shifted to online platforms, and people worked from home because of lockdown and social
distancing measures. Qualitative indicators allowed the valuation team to fully understand how the programme
was designed and implemented during the pandemic, and evolved and changed from the way it was originally
envisioned to adapt to the needs of each of the pilot schools and their staff during the pandemic. Qualitative
indicators allowed the evaluation team to more accurately understand and evaluation Programme
implementation process, outcomes and challenges faced, among others. Unlike quantitative indicators,
qualitative indicators do not strictly involve enumeration, which allows them to capture a much broader picture
and nuisances related to the Programme’s coherence, relevance, effectiveness, impact, efficiency and
sustainability. Ultimately, the indicators in the Evaluation Matrix enabled the evaluation team to get closer to
project participants to understand more authentically their experiences in and with the Programme, and from
different perspectives and vantage points. Coupled with the evaluation methods and data collection tools, the
qualitative indicators allowed for a comprehensive, fair and unbiased evaluation of the Programme.
4.1. Desk Review
88. The evaluation began with a desk review of five relevant background documents111 shared by UNICEF CO staff,
including programme documents, a baseline and assessment report, relevant mechanisms or guidelines, and
data related to the numbers of teachers, classes and students in each of the pilot schools. The desk review also
included a review of other documents and reports on child protection and violence against children in Bulgaria,
and recent Country Programme Documents (Annex A: References). Monitoring reports and documents were
not shared with the evaluation team (and were only available in Bulgarian).
89. The desk review informed the development of the Inception Report which defined the evaluation purpose,
scope and objectives, described the evaluation methods and ethical review process, and included the
evaluation matrix, data collection tools and other relevant documentation to ensure that all questions and
measures were related to the evaluation criteria and related questions. UNICEF CO staff were consulted to
ensure programme documents were properly understood in terms of merit and use, and were used to inform
the Inception Report. The Inception Report received a ‘highly satisfactory’ ranking during the quality assurance
review.
90. The desk review was an important part of the evaluation. During the evaluation and finalization of the report,
upon request from the lead evaluator, five additional documents was provided by the UNICEF CO to support
the desk review112, and was incorporated into the final evaluation report. Desk review materials were limited
in number, but those that were available to the evaluation team were used, when appropriate, to draw
triangulate findings and draw conclusions.
4.2. Inception Phase Consultations
91. Evaluations are typically characterized by extensive team engagement throughout the evaluation period,
coupled with independent field assessments, data collection and analysis, and generation of findings and
111 At the beginning of the evaluation, UNICEF CO provided several programme documents in English for the desk review. These
included: 1) Steps Together Program Document with RMF; 2) internal assessment covering the period of September 2019 to
September 2021; 3) Mechanism of Counteracting Bullying and Violence in the Institution of the Preschool and School Education
System; 4) summary baseline report (executive summary) for the Steps Together Programme that described the different types
of school violence and bullying; and 5) Excel spreadsheet of the number of teachers, classes and students from each of the pilot
schools. The endline report for the Steps Together Programme was made available in English to the evaluator after the
evaluation was completed and during the finalization of the report.
112 During the evaluation, upon request of the lead evaluator, the UNICEF CO also provided: 1) a summary calendar of all capacity
building trainings organized under the aegis of the Programme for school directors, coordination councils, mentors, teachers and
school psychologists for the period of September 2020 to June 2022; 2) basic budget information for the Programme; 3) the SEES
Programme Handbook for Prevention of Peer Violence for a Safe and Enable Environment in Schools, which was published by
UNICEF Croatia in 2015, and was available in English; 4) summary of the endline report; and 5) UNICEF reporting on programme-
related indicators.
19
conclusions by the evaluation team to ensure independence and open discussion. Thus, UNICEF CO staff were
involved in this process, including planning for the evaluation, determination of the evaluation methods and
data collection tools, selection of sites to visit and key informants to interview, coordination and scheduling of
interviews across each of the sites, and finalization of the Inception Report and Evaluation Report
92. During the inception phase, prior to beginning the evaluation and data collection in the field, several
consultations with UNICEF CO staff occurred via Zoom. The focus was on planning for the evaluation,
developing the evaluation methodology and data collection tools, and planning for the mission trip to conduct
data collection in the field.
4.3. Study Sites
93. The evaluation did not aim to represent the entire country, but was conducted in Sofia (the capital city), Iskar,
Kustendil, Teteven and Zavet (Map 1). The five cities/towns where UNICEF supported piloting the Programme,
and where UNICEF and MES were located. Each of the five cities and towns where the pilot schools were located
varied in population and demographics. Site visits and data collection in the field was conducted over a one-
month period from 27 June to 23 July 2022. The International Consultant and National Expert conducted the
evaluation simultaneously with different national partners, school staff, students and parents.
Map 1. Study sites in Bulgaria
94. In the study sites, a cross-section of duty-bearers and rights-holders were sampled. This included: UNICEF CO
staff and school mentors; MES staff; members of the Roditeli (Parents) Association; school staff from each of
the five pilot schools (i.e., principal, deputy principal, members of the Coordination Council, pedagogical
counsellors, school psychologists and teachers); and students and parents from the pilot schools. A purposeful
sampling approach was used to interview individuals who had knowledge of and/or experience with the
Programme.
20
4.4. Data Collection Methods
4.4.1. Key Informant Interviews (KIIs)
95. A purposive sampling approach was used. In many cases more than one person was identified as a relevant
contact in each of the different organizations, ministry and pilot schools. Given this reality, the evaluation
approach involved conducting a combination of one-on-one and small group interviews. Small group interviews
included two to four persons. Participation in KIIs was voluntary and those who participated were guaranteed
confidentiality.
96. One-on-one interviews were conducted in those situations where there was one person in an organization,
ministry and/or school that needed to be interviewed and/or in situations where a senior official/representative
needed to be interviewed. One-on-one interviews were used in situations where individuals had an area of
specialization and/or expertise that required a one-on-one interview. One-on-one interviews were also
conducted if an interviewee requested.
97. Small group interviews of two to four persons were utilized when interviews need to be conducted with staff
of the same rank in the ministry and schools, and school staff who worked together as a team (e.g., Coordination
Councils). Small group interviews allowed for some degree of synergy and discussion on questions which
allowed for more depth and perspective by groups from the same organization, ministry and school. Small
group interviews allowed the evaluators to maximize their contact with a wide range of individuals from
organizations, ministries and schools, identified as partners and key stakeholders by the UNICEF CO.
98. KIIs were conducted by the International Consultant and National Expert. To maximize coverage and inclusion
of national partners and key stakeholders, the evaluators conducted most interviews separately. All interviews
were conducted in the language of preference to interviewees. Most interviews were conducted in Bulgarian;
however, some interviewees preferred to conduct the interview in English. The International Consultant
worked with an interpreter in the field to conduct interviews in Bulgarian; UNICEF CO provide the interpreter.
4.4.1.1. UNICEF Interviews
99. An important component of this evaluation approach was to interview UNICEF CO staff and school mentors
with working knowledge of UNICEF’s support to establish and implement the Programme in the five pilot
schools. One-on-one interviews were conducted with each of these individuals.
100. A structured interview questionnaire was used to guide interviews with UNICEF CO staff and school mentors
(Annex I: UNICEF and MES Interview Questionnaire). The interview questionnaire included questions related to
each of the evaluation criteria and questions. Questions were designed to capture historical perspective to the
degree to which respondents had a historical perspective of UNICEF’s support to the Programme. On average,
interviews with UNICEF CO staff took about 1.5 hours to complete and were conducted in English.
4.4.1.2. National Partner Interviews
101. Another important component of this evaluation was to interview national partners, particularly MES staff and
members of the Roditeli (Parents) Association, who had working knowledge of UNICEF’s support to establish
and implement the Programme in the five pilot schools. UNICEF CO staff identified two MES staff and two
members of the Roditeli (Parents) Association who were interviewed; small group interviews were conducted
with each in Sofia.
102. A structured interview questionnaire was used to guide these interviews (Annex I: UNICEF and National Partner
Interview Questionnaire). The interview questionnaire included questions focused specifically on the evaluation
criteria and questions. Questions were designed to capture historical perspective to the degree to which
respondents had a historical perspective of UNICEF’s support to the Programme. On average, interviews with
national partners will take about one hour to complete.
21
4.4.1.3. Pilot School Staff Interviews
103. School staff from the five pilot schools who had working knowledge of UNICEF’s support to establish and
implement the Programme were interviewed. In each pilot school, the goal was to interview the principal
and/or deputy principal, members of the Coordination Council, pedagogical counsellors and school
psychologists. In addition, teachers who were actively involved in implementing the Programme were invited
to participate in a one-on-one or small group interview, with the aim of gathering more detailed information
from what was gathered during FGDs with school staff.
104. UNICEF notified each of the five pilot schools about the dates for the evaluation site visit and provided guidance
as to which school staff the evaluators should interview. Still, however, participation will be voluntary.
105. A structured interview questionnaire was used to guide the interviews with school staff (Annex J: School Staff
Interview Questionnaire). The interview questionnaire includes questions focused specifically on the evaluation
criteria and questions. Questions were designed to capture historical perspective to the degree to which
respondent’s had a historical perspective of the Programme. On average, interviews with school staff take
about 1.5 hours to complete.
4.4.2. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs)
106. FGDs were conducted with separate groups of teachers, students and parents in four of the five pilot schools.
Teachers invited to participate in the FGDs were those who engaged in the Programme and delivered
programme activities to students and/or parents. In addition, students and parents who were beneficiaries of
the Programme in four of the five pilot schools were invited to participate in the evaluation. A purposive
sampling approach was used to determine which teachers, students and parents were invited to participate in
FGDs.
107. Separate FGDs were conducted with teachers, students and parents. FGDs with students were further divided
by age groupings of primary, middle and high school. School staff were asked to help organize the FGDs of
teachers, students and parents by inviting them to come and participate in an FGD with the evaluators on a
particular day and time.
108. FGDs with teachers were be conducted by the International Consultant, whereas FGDs with students and
parents were be conducted by the National Expert. All FGDs were conducted in Bulgarian. The International
Consultant worked with an interpreter in the field to conduct FGDs in Bulgarian; UNICEF CO will provide the
interpreter and additional assistance for translation of some key information.
4.4.2.1. FGDs with Teachers
109. FGDs were conducted with teachers in four of the five pilot schools, excluding the pilot school in Zavet. A total
of 10 FGDs were conducted with teachers in the four pilot schools (Table 4). More specifically, in Iskar and
Sofia, three FGDs were conducted with teachers, including one FGD with primary school teachers and two FGDs
with middle and high school teachers. In Teteven and Kustendil, two FGDs were conducted with teachers,
including two FGDs with middle and high school teachers. The pilot schools in Teteven and Kustendil did not
include primary schools. FGDs were not conducted with teachers at the pilot school in Zavet; instead, online
interviews were conducted by the National Expert with teachers.

Note: Teachers at middle and high school levels are typically the same.
110. The Teachers’ FGD Guides was developed to focus on the evaluation criteria and questions (Annex K: Teachers’
FGD Guide). Informed consent was obtained from teachers who participated in the FGDs (Annex N: Consent
Form for Parents/Guardians). Informed consent forms were collected prior to beginning the FGD. All teachers
were informed about the purpose of the evaluation and that their confidentiality was ensured. They were also
informed that the FGD will be audio-recorded with their consent. Each FGD take about one hour, sometimes
longer.
111. In each school, school principals and coordination councils were asked to help identify teachers who were
willing and able to participate in a FGD. The pre-selection criteria and guidance provided to schools was to
identify teachers who participated in the Programme. FGDs with teachers took place in the school for purposes
of teachers’ comfort and well-being.
4.4.2.2. FGDs with Students
112. FGDs were conducted with students in four of the five pilot schools. A total of 17 FGDs were conducted with
students in the four pilot schools (Table 5). In Iskar and Sofia, FGDs were conducted with students, including
one FGD with primary school students and two FGDs with middle and high school students. In primary schools,
only children in grades 3 and 4 (aged 9-10 years) were invited to participate in a FGD. In Teteven and Kustendil,
four FGDs were conducted with students, including two FGDs middle school students and two FGDs with high
school students. The pilot schools in Teteven and Kustendil did not include primary schools. Schools were
instructed to make sure that students invited to participate in FGDs were from different grades and classes.
FGDs were not conducted with students at the pilot school in Zavet for the aforementioned reasons.

a In primary schools, only students in grades 3-4 (aged 9-10) will be invited to participate.
113. The Students’ FGD Guide was developed to focus on six thematic areas (Annex M: Students’ FGD Guide):
a. Familiarity with the Steps Together Programme
b. How the Programme and activities were relevant to the school and them and their peers
c. What impact Programme activities had on the school and them and their peers
d. What they like best about the Programme and its activities
e. What they did not like or would change or improve with the Programme
f. What more they would like to do as part of the Programme
114. The FGD facilitator had prior experience conducting FGDs and interview with children, and used visualization
techniques involving drawing and colouring to engage students to express themselves and to talk about the
Programme.113
115. In advance of the FGD, parental informed consent was obtained from parents of students who participated in
the FGDs (Annex L: Parental Consent Form for Children’s Participation). Parental consent forms were collected
prior to beginning the FGD. Each student was also asked to give verbal informed assent to participate using a
standard script prior to starting the interview (Annex M: Children’s Focus Group Discussion Guide). They were
113 These drawings and colouring were included in the first couple of FGD notes prepared by the National Expert; however, such

also informed about the purpose of the evaluation and that their confidentiality was ensured. Students were
also informed that the FGD would be audio-recorded with their consent. Each FGD will take about one hour.
116. In each school, school principals and/or coordination councils were asked to identify students who were willing
and able to participate in a FGD with the National Expert. The pre-selection criteria and guidance provided to
schools was to identify students who were in grades 3-12 (aged 9-17) and had participated in the Programme,
and are confident to participate in a FGD. Schools were instructed by UNICEF that the evaluation team did not
want schools to select children who were disadvantaged or specifically vulnerable, or known to have
experienced school violence or bullying.
117. FGDs with students took place in the schools for
purposes of parents/caregivers and children’s comfort
and well-being. The evaluator at no point or time asked

following statement to all participants:
a. “Thank you for your cooperation. I know that some of these questions were personal and may have made
you feel sad or upset. I am going to give you a leaflet with phone numbers of some places that you can
contact in case you would like to speak with someone. You can reach out at any time and these services are
free. We would suggest that you keep this leaflet somewhere safe where no one else will be able to find it.
I can also directly link you to a school staff member who can provide some help and support. Would you like
for me to do this for you?”
4.4.2.3. FGDs with Parents/Guardians
119. FGDs were conducted with parents in four of the five pilot schools. A total of 10 FGDs were conducted with
parents in the four-pilot school (Table 6). More specifically, in Iskar and Sofia, three FGDs were conducted with
parents, including one FGD with parents of primary school students, one FGD with parents of middle school
students and one FGD with parents of high school students. In Teteven and Kustendil, two FGDs were conducted
with parents, including one FGD with parents of middle school students and one FGD with parents of high
school students. The pilot schools in Teteven and Kustendil did not include primary schools. FGDs were not
conducted with parents at the pilot school in Zavet.

120. The Parents’ FGD Guide was developed to focus on six thematic areas (Annex O: Parents FGD Guide):
a. Familiarity with the Steps Together Programme
b. How the Programme and activities were relevant to the school and parents and students
c. What impact Programme activities had on the school and students
d. What they like best about the Programme and its activities
e. What they did not like or would change or improve with the Programme
f. What more they would like to see as part of the Programme
g.
121. Informed consent was obtained from parents who participated in FGDs (Annex N: Consent Form for
Parents/Guardians). Informed consent forms were collected prior to beginning the FGD. All parents were
informed about the purpose of the evaluation and that their confidentiality would be ensured. They were also
informed that the FGD would be audio-recorded with their consent. Each FGD will take about one hour.
122. In each school, school principals and/or coordination councils were asked to help identify parents who were
willing and able to participate in a FGD with the national research. The pre-selection criteria and guidance
provided to schools was to identify parents of students who participated in the Programme in the primary,
middle and high schools. Some students identified parents who were also teachers in the schools; however,
once this was realized this approach of selecting parents was quickly rectified.
123. FGDs with parents took place in the school for purposes of parents’ comfort and well-being. The evaluator at
no point or time asked parents to speak publicly about their child’s personal experiences with school violence
or bullying, rather the focus of the FGD was on the Programme.
124. At the end of all FGDs, parents who participated were provided with a leaflet that was prepared by UNICEF and
the schools, and distributed in the past as part of the Programme. Separate leaflets were prepared for each
school, as the information for services in each region were different, except for the National Helpline for
Children 116 111. The National Expert also read the following statement to all participants:
a. “Thank you for your cooperation. I know that some of these questions were personal and may have made
you feel sad or upset. I am going to give you a leaflet with phone numbers of some places that you can
contact in case you would like to speak with someone. You can reach out at any time and these services are
free. We would suggest that you keep this leaflet somewhere safe where no one else will be able to find it.
I can also directly link you to a school staff member who can provide some help and support. Would you like
for me to do this for you?”
4.5. Sample
125. In total, this evaluation had 330 respondents or participants, including UNICEF staff and mentors, MES staff,
schools staff, students and teachers. Table 7 provides summary information about the sample of respondents,
including UNICEF CO staff and mentors, MES staff and school staff. The sample included an estimated 126
respondents, of which 29.4 percent were high school teachers, 23.8 percent were middle school teachers and
12.7 percent were primary school teachers. In addition, 19.8 percent were members of the coordination
councils and 5.6 percent were principals and/or deputy principals. Only 4.8 percent of respondent were UNICEF
mentors, 2.4 percent were UNICEF CO staff and 1.6 percent were members of the MES. Nearly all respondents
in Table 7 were female (91.3 percent); only 8.7 percent of respondent (n=11) were male.

4.6. Stakeholder Participation and Triangulation
128. The evaluators used a participatory approach that recognized national partners, key stakeholders and
beneficiaries as important and active participants who contributed to the production of knowledge and
understanding of the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, impact, efficiency and sustainability of the Steps
Together Programme. In keeping, the evaluation team set out to collaborate with all national partners, key
stakeholders and beneficiaries, including UNICEF CO management and staff. As part of the participatory
approach, UNICEF CO staff oversaw the evaluation design and report writing processes, and guided and
managed data collection in the field. In addition, national partners, key stakeholders and beneficiaries
participate in the data collection process and asked to share their perspectives of and experiences with the
Steps Together Programme.
129. Triangulation was also an important part of the evaluation approach to ensure not only the credibility of
information and data collected, but also to allow diverse perspectives and experiences to be captured.
Triangulation involved triangulating perspectives and experiences of UNICEF CO staff and mentors, MES staff,
school staff (including school principals, coordination councils, psychologists and teachers, and specifically
teachers of primary, middle and high schools), students (including primary, middle and high school students)
26
and parents (including parents of primary, middle and high school students). Each of these target groups saw
and experienced the Programme from different vantage pints. The International Consultation/Evaluation Lead
undertook analysis and interpretation of data collected in the field as an opportunity to allow the diverse
perspectives and experiences captured through triangulation to come to the forefront and to reveal the full
influence of UNICEF’s initiative to establish and support the Programme in the five pilot schools.
130. Triangulation allowed for a critical examination and analysis of information gathered and the synthesis of data
an objective manner. If contradictory information was obtained from stakeholders, effort was made to
understand the reasons for such information, including sector and institution/agency differences in
perspectives and experiences.114
4.7. Ethical Review
131. UNICEF CO sent the Inception Report for an external ethical review to ensure effective processes and
accountability for ethical oversight, and to ensure that human subjects protections, including the protection of
and respect for human and child rights, were incorporated into the evaluation methodology and data collection
processes in keeping with UNICEF Procedures for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and
Analysis.115
132. The ethical review was conducted by an external Ethics Review Board (ERB). The ERB was responsible for
reviewing the evaluation methodology and data collection to ensure the following requirements were satisfied:
a. Proposed evaluation approach is methodologically sound and designed to minimize risk to human subjects
(participants).
b. Human subjects are not placed at undue risk, and any risks are reasonable in relation to the anticipated
benefits.
c. Special protections are provided to special populations, including children.
d. Human subject’s participation in the evaluation is voluntary.
e. Informed consent is sought from each human subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative
prior to their participation in the evaluation.
f. Informed assent is sought from children prior to their participation in the evaluation.
g. Relevant protection protocols are in place to ensure human subjects’ protections and safety
h. Human subjects’ safety, privacy, confidentiality, and anonymity when possible, are maximized.
i. Data collection and analysis does not result in violations of confidentiality and/or anonymity
133. ERB reviewers paid attention to the following written elements of this Inception Report:
a. Informed consent forms or guidelines
b. Protocols for the protection of subjects’ safety
c. Protocols for the protection of subjects’ identities
d. Protocols for the protection of collected data
e. Interview questionnaires and other data collection instruments, human subject recruitment plans, and any
parts of the evaluation approach that are relevant to human subject protections.
134. ERB approval was obtained on 27 June 2022 (HML IRB Review #578BULG22). HML IRB is authorized by the
United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections (IRB#1211,
IORG #850, FWO #1102).
4.8. Ethical Considerations
135. The evaluation followed UNEG Norms and Standards and Ethical Guidelines for Evaluations.116 In keeping, the
evaluation was “conducted with the highest standards of integrity and respect for the beliefs, manners and
customs of the social and cultural environment, for human rights and gender equality, and for the ‘do not harm’
principle for humanitarian assistance.”117 In keeping with UNICEF Procedures on Ethical Standards in Research,

Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis118 principles of respect, beneficence, justice, integrating and
accountability were integrated into the methodology, data collection and ethical procedures, and informed
day-to-day decision-making during data collection in the field and as part of the data analysis and report writing
process (Box 1).
Box 1. Five principles that informed evidence generation in this evaluation
1. Respect – This principle involves engaging with all stakeholders in a way that honours their
dignity, well-being, participation and personal agency, and acknowledges any limitations of
agency. This evaluation will be responsiveness to respondent’s sex/gender, age, background,
ethnicity and ability, among others characteristics.
2. Beneficence – This principle means striving to do good for people while minimizing harms
arising from evidence generation. This evaluation weighs the harms and benefits of data
collection. Data collected will be purpose-driven (directly informed by the activity or benefit),
proportional (only collecting what is required) and protective of children’s rights.
3. Justice – The principle of justice requires that consideration is given to those who benefit and
those who carries the burden of evidence-generation, and the broader equity of the project, its
implementation and outcomes. This evaluation will be “people-centric”, which means the
needs, interests and expectations of people, including school staff, student and their
parents/guardians will be prioritized by the evaluation team.
4. Integrity – This principle necessitates the active adherence to moral values and professional
standards, which are essential for all evidence that is commissioned or undertaken.
5. Accountability – Is the obligation to be answerable for all decisions made and actions taken, and
to be responsible for honoring commitments, without qualification or exception, as well as to
report potential or actual harms observed through the appropriate channels. The principle
includes accountability to relevant populations. This principle will be followed in keeping with
the process of ethical review and international ethical standards of research and evaluation,
including human subjects protections.

136. In addition, the evaluation was conducted in an independent manner, with key elements of impartiality,
objectivity, professional integrity and absence of bias at all stages of the evaluation process. Credibility was
established as evaluation findings and recommendations were informed by and grounded in the use of the best
available qualitative and quantitative data and analysis to meet organizational needs for learning and
accountability.119
137. Special measures were put in place to ensure the evaluation process was ethical and that participants could
openly provide information and express their opinions in confidence. Sources of information were protected
and only known to the evaluators. In keeping with UNEG Ethical Guidelines, specific attention was paid to issues
related to harm and benefits, informed consent, privacy and confidentiality, and exercising commitment to
avoid conflicts of interest in all aspects of the evaluation, thereby “upholding the principles of independence,
impartiality, credibility, honesty, integrity and accountability.”120 Data was protected and coded so as to ensure
anonymity.
138. All participants will be informed of the context and purpose of the evaluation, and guaranteed confidentiality.
To ensure confidentiality, all interviewees were assigned a unique identification (ID) number at the time of the
interview by the interviewer, and reassigned a new ID number at the time of data input by the International
Consultant. In the evaluation report, only ID numbers are used to identify and differentiate among
respondents. ID numbers and generic categories (e.g., school staff, students, parents) were used to identify
and differentiate respondents.

139. All interviews were saved in files with only the identification numbers assigned to them to further ensure
confidentiality and stored in a password protected file.
140. Qualitative data are presented in the report in a manner that ensures anonymity and confidentiality, to ensure
that respondents cannot be identified, particularly in the case of beneficiaries. This is especially important as it
relates to beneficiaries to reduce the risk that their participation would impact their experiences in their
schools. Still, however, the evaluators cannot fully guarantee that participation in this evaluation could have
some negative effects.
141. The International Consultant/Lead Evaluator did not audio-record any interviews; rather, verbatim interview
notes were typed directly into Word on a laptop by the International Consultant/Lead Evaluator during the
interviews and cleaned immediately thereafter for accuracy. The International Consultant/Lead Evaluator has
the skills needed to record verbatim interview notes in this manner, which is more efficient and just as effective
as audio-recording interviews.
142. The National Expert audio-recorded some FGDs with the approval of participants, and took verbatim in other
FGDs. All audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and translated into English by the National Expert. The
English version of all transcribed interviews were sent to the International Consultant/Lead Evaluator for
analysis. UNICEF CO ensured that all audio-recordings were erased/deleted following completion of this
evaluation.
143. All participants were informed of the context and purpose of the evaluation, after which they were asked to
give informed consent to participate in the evaluation. They were informed of their rights as voluntary
participants in the evaluation, including the right to confidentiality and that all data would be coded to ensure
anonymity and confidentiality. UNICEF included in the Informed Consent Form a paragraph in accordance with
Bulgaria’s Child Protection Act121 regarding mandated reporting in the event that a child discloses risk or abuse
unprompted by the interview. Participants were also informed that they had the right to decline participation
in the evaluation without penalty, and could end their participation at any time and/or skip questions without
penalty.
144. Universally recognized values and principles of human rights, gender equality and do no harm were integrated
into all stages of this evaluation and respected by the evaluators.122
4.9. Mitigation of Risk
145. Minimizing the risks of procedures incorporated several complementary components, including:
a. Evaluation methodology provided sufficient detail to demonstrate how each data element contributed to
the analysis plan to eliminate all unnecessary procedures and to minimize the risk of procedures
b. If children or other vulnerable groups were to become upset during a FGD, the FGD would be stopped and
a school staff member would be invited to console and talk with the child.
c. Minimum data necessary for the evaluation was collected
d. Minimum number of identifiers were collected
e. Performed only procedures that were necessary to achieve the evaluation purpose and objectives
f. Took steps to ensure confidentiality to minimize risk to human subjects
g. Data were coded to conceal identifiers
h. Stored data was secured so that confidentiality of the subjects was preserved
4.10. Evaluation Team
146. This external evaluation was conducted by two consultants, including: Dr. Robin Haarr, International
Consultant/Lead Evaluator, from the United States; and Ms. Dessislava Ilieva, National Expert, from Sofia,
Bulgaria. Both the Lead Evaluator and National Expert have extensive experience conducting evaluations and
121 Article 7 (1) (amend. SG 120/02; suppl., SG 36/03 amend; SG 38/06) – A person who knows that a child needs protection shall
oblige immediately to inform the directorate of the State Agency for Child Protection or the Ministry of Interior. (2) The same
obligation shall have also each person to whom this has become known in connection with the profession or the activity exercised
by him even if it is bound with professional secret.

interviewing children. The Inception Report, including the evaluation approach and data collection tools were
developed by the Lead Evaluator, in consultation with UNICEF CO. UNICEF reviewed and approved the
evaluation approach and data collection tools prior to beginning the evaluation (Annex D: Work Plan).
147. The evaluation was conducted between May and October 2022, with data collection in the field during the
period of 27 June to 23 July 2022 (Annex E: Draft Itinerary for Data Collection in the Field). Prior to beginning
data collection in the field, the Lead Evaluator provided guidance to the National Expert on the methodology,
data collection tools and ethical procedures. The National Expert was responsible for reviewing the Inception
Report to familiarize herself with the methodology, sampling framework, data collection tools, consent forms
and ethnical procedures.
148. Following data collection in the field, data analysis and report writing was led by the Lead Evaluator. In addition,
finalization of the evaluation report was carried out by the Lead Evaluator, following review and feedback from
UNICEF CO and MES. The evaluation report was validated in a validation meeting with UNICEF CO and MES.
149. The Lead Evaluator was responsible for managing and leading the evaluation team, including: designing the
evaluation methodology and tools; data collection and analysis; drafting and finalizing the Inception and
Evaluation Reports; and presenting the Evaluation Report at the validation meeting.
150. Specific tasks for the International Consultant included:
a. Desk review of all relevant programme documents and reports, previous studies and research, and other
relevant documents
b. Develop and provide methodological guidance for the team with regard to methodology and data
collection tools development, and defining the overall direction of data analysis and quality assurance
c. Manage the evaluation workplan
d. Maintain coordination and communication with UNICEF CO
e. Lead evaluation planning and implementation processes
f. Lead and undertake the data collection in the field, with support from the National Expert
g. Lead data analysis and report writing
h. Lead presentation of evaluation findings and recommendations to UNICEF CO and MES
151. Specific tasks for the National Expert included:
a. Desk review of all relevant programme documents and reports, previous studies and research, and other
relevant documents.
b. Implementation of the agreed upon evaluation methodology, data collection tools and ethical
guidelines/procedures as spelled out in the Inception Report, in cooperation with the International
Consultant.
c. Implement the agreed upon evaluation work plan and field visit schedule, in cooperation with the
International Consultant.
d. Maintain regular communication and coordination with the International Consultant and UNICEF CO
e. Undertake the data collection in the field, as spelled out in the Inception Report, in cooperation with the
International Consultant.
f. Participate in the validation meeting.
4.11. Data Management and Analysis
152. Data were coded and analyzed using grounded theory.123 Grounded theory allowed data collection and analysis
to occur simultaneously, strengthening both the quality of data and analysis. As data collection and analysis
progressed, and preliminary findings began to emerge, the evaluators were able to identify and explore
emerging themes, such as results achieved, lessons learned, challenges encountered and adjustments made.
153. All data from interviews and FGDs were saved in Word files. The National Expert and Lead Evaluator were
responsible for managing their own interview and FGD notes in Word. Verbatim transcribed and translated
FGD notes in English were be sent to the Lead Evaluator for data analysis. All data were stored in a password
protected files and computers.

154. KIIs and FGDs conducted by the evaluation team generated more than 550 pages of interview and FGD data.
These data were extremely important to this evaluation, as they represented the voices of the ‘duty-bearer’
and ‘rights-holders’, and revealed their perspectives of and experiences with the Programme, and insights into
how the Programme was implemented in each of the school. The plethora of data also allowed the lead
evaluator to triangulate findings by type of respondents (UNICEF CO staff, mentors, MES staff, school staff,
students and parents) and schools (e.g., primary, middle and high school), and where possible, data were
triangulated with information garnered from the desk review.
155. Qualitative data from open-ended questions, where were the majority, were coded based upon themes and
sub-themes, and analyzed for patterns by the lead evaluator, in keeping with the evaluation criteria and
questions. Quantitative data collected from several close-ended questions (scale questions) were coded and
input into SPSS by the lead evaluator, and analysed using analysis of means. Both the qualitative and
quantitative data allowed for an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the Programme and its
coherence, relevance, effectiveness, impact, efficiency and sustainability, and lack thereof. This includes
progress made toward expected outcomes. The Lead Evaluator lead all of the qualitative and quantitative data
analysis.
156. Data analysis focused on answering the key evaluation questions related to relevance, coherence, impact,
effectiveness and sustainability. Interview and FGD data also provided a more comprehensive understanding
the Programme, including from the perspectives of school staff, students and parents, as well as d school
mentors, UNICEF CO staff and MES. Data were also analyzed to understand similarities and differences in
Programme implementation and results among the five pilot schools, and challenges and bottlenecks faced and
overcome by the schools.
157. The Lead Evaluator lead the report writing process. Reports were prepared according to the UNICEF-Adapted
UNEG Evaluation Report Standards124, as per the Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS).
4.12. Evaluation Limitations and Mitigation Measures
158. There were several limitations that hindered the evaluation process. Most notable were:
a. An evaluability assessment with all the partners was not conducted.
b. Mitigation measure: Despite the lack of an evaluability assessment and some data gaps there was available
information to conduct a summative and formative evaluation.
c. Not all programme implementation and monitoring documents and reports were made available to the
evaluation team, nor were they available in English.
d. Mitigation measure: UNICEF was asked to extract data from Programme monitoring documents that were
not made available to the evaluation team to report on RMF indicators (Annex Q: UNICER Reporting on
Programme-Related Indicators).
e. The evaluation did not aim to represent the entire country or all schools in the country.
f. Mitigation measure: The focus was on the five pilot schools in Iskar, Kustendil, Sofia, Teteven and Zavet
where UNICEF supported piloting the Programme, and where UNICEF and MES are located.
g. There were limitations as to the lack of administrative data on school violence and bullying in Bulgaria,
even in the five pilot schools.
h. Mitigation measure: This constrained an analysis of the impact of Programme; there was no way for the
evaluation team to mitigate this risk.
i. The school year ended at the end of June 2022, which served as a challenge to the evaluation team because
data collection the field occurred during the one-month period of 27 June to 23 July 2022.
j. Mitigation measure: All steps were taken to mitigate this risk by working in cooperation with UNICEF and
each of the pilot schools to organize site visits and the coordination and participation of school staff,
students and parents, based upon their availability.
159. There were no apparent biases that arose during the evaluation.

160. As it related to meeting safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, at the time of this evaluation the Government
of Bulgaria did not have any restrictions or protocols related to COVID-19 as Bulgaria was officially in the green
zone. There were no face mask or social distancing requirements.
5. EVALUATION FINDINGS
161. Findings are presented by each of the evaluation criteria related to coherence, relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency and sustainability. Findings are presented so that readers know the characteristics of respondents
quoted throughout the findings section. Respondents are identified as school staff, teachers, students and
parents. School personnel include school principals and deputy principals, school psychologists and members
of the school coordination council. A unique number associated with each respondent is also provided; this
makes it clear which respondents are quoted throughout the findings section. More than one unique number
may be associated with a quote because there were sometimes two to four people in a small group interview
and all respondents agreed with the statement or perspective, so they were also recognized as associated with
the quote. Region is also identified for each respondent.
5.1. Coherence
5.1.1. To what extent the Steps Together Programme supported the operationalization of the
mechanism for countering bullying and violence in the institutions in the pilot schools?
162. The Programme was squarely aligned with the national priorities of the Government, particularly MES. Prior to
developing the Programme, MES recognized that school violence and bullying was an issue that needed to be
addressed through prevention and intervention. In 2016 and 2017, MES reported more than 8,000 cases of
violence and bullying in schools, of which 4,500 involved physical and verbal aggression. On average, there were
an estimated 30 incidents of school violence per day.125 MES was also documenting an increase in online peer
bullying; in 2016, online bullying comprised 38 percent of all cases of school violence (up from 25 percent in
2010).126
163. In 2019, an Expert Group was established in the MES to develop a whole school approach for creating a safe
environment in schools and to prevent school violence and bullying. In response, UNICEF-supported MES to
develop and pilot this Programme to support schools in their efforts to implement the Mechanism of
Counteracting Bullying and Violence in the Institutions of the Preschool and School Education System and to
support MES’s policy on inclusive education.
164. The Mechanism offers a policy framework for prevention and intervention against school violence and bullying,
which aims to assist educational institutions in their efforts to create a safe education environment. The
Mechanism includes the development of a system of measures for achieving a safe education environment,
which includes establishing school-based coordination council’s responsible for planning, monitoring and
assessment of efforts to cope with school violence and bullying. In each school, the coordination council should
be headed by a vice-principal and/or another teaching specialist designated by the school director, with
membership of a school psychologist and/or pedagogical counsellor, teachers, children and parents.
Coordination councils are responsible for preparing and implementing a plan of prevention and intervention
against school violence and bullying. The action plan should include prevention activities at the institutional
(school community) level, as well as at the classroom (group) level (e.g., educational activities, child-centered
and peer-support approaches), and to work with parents.
165. After the Mechanism was established and introduced, it became apparent that schools needed capacity
building, technical assistance and tools to implement the Mechanism. In response, UNICEF and MES jointly
developed the Steps Together Programme that offers a whole school approach to creating a safe school
environment that would help to prevent school violence and bullying, and choose to pilot the Programme in
five schools as a three-year comprehensive programme. The plan was that lessons learned from the three-year
pilot project would lead to good practices that could be used to inform the next steps and scale-up the
Programme in all schools across Bulgaria.

166. In the pilot schools, coordination councils recognized that the Programme made it easier to recognize violence
and helped to make members of the coordination councils more aware of the Mechanism. Coordination council
members also pointed out that the Programme’s methodology provides them with better approaches to
resolving school violence and bullying. There were some coordination council members who thought that the
Programme is actually better than the official Mechanism. Some respondents even felt that the MES needs to
reform the Mechanism to align with the Steps Together Programme to be more meaningful.
5.2. Relevance
5.2.1. To what extent the Steps Together Programme’s objectives, strategies and activities are relevant and
aligned with government priorities, policies and reform agendas related to prevention and response to
VAC, specifically school violence and bullying?
167. The Steps Together Programme is aligned with UNICEF’s Country Programme 2018-2022, which focuses on
supporting Bulgaria in its efforts to enable all children and adolescents, including the most disadvantaged, to
enjoy their rights and to develop to their full potential in an inclusive and protective society. The realization of
the right of every child to live free from violence, abuse, exploitation and harmful practices is a cross-cutting
element in UNICEF’s Country Programme. The Programme is also in line with Bulgaria’s national priorities as
identified in the National Development Programme Bulgaria 2030 and regional priorities identified in the
Europe 2030 Strategy127, European Commission Recommendation "Investing in Children: Breaking the Cycle of
Disadvantage”128, and the Council of Europe Strategy for the Rights of the Child (2016-2021 and 2022-2027).129
The Programme is also aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development130 and UNICEF’s Global
Strategic Framework 2018-2021 and 2022-2025.131
5.2.2. To what extent the Steps Together Programme’s approaches are evidence-based and
correspond with, and address the actual needs of the whole school community – school staff,
students and parents – in the pilot schools?
168. The Steps Together Programme was evidence-based and modeled after a similar programme, entitled ‘For a
Safe and Enabling Environment in Schools’ (SEES), which was designed and implemented In Croatia with full
support from UNICEF Croatia from 2003-2011.132 The SEES Programme focused on prevention of peer violence
and bullying for a safe and enabling environment in schools. To support the SEES Programme, UNICEF Croatia
developed a handbook for teachers, school associates and principals involved in the development of the SEES
Programme that was. In 2015, the Handbook was published by UNICEF Regional Office for Europe and Central
Asia and has served as an evidence-based model for other schools in the region.
169. UNICEF adapted the SEES Programme Handbook to the national context of Bulgaria to support the development
and implementation of Bulgaria’s Steps Together Programme. UNICEF contracted a national consultant to adapt
the SEES Programme Handbook to the national context of Bulgaria. The Handbook developed to support
Bulgaria’s Programme was an abridged version of the SEES Programme Handbook, but was aligned with the
SEES Programme Handbook developed by UNICEF Croatia. It was beneficial that the SEES Programme
Handbooks was remarkably similar to was needed in Bulgaria to implement the Steps Together Programme.
170. From December 2020 to January 2021, UNICEF organized a series of trainings for mentors and pilot school staff
on the Steps Together Programme, but also engaged the author of the UNICEF Croatia SEES Programme
Handbook, in an effort to develop support for the Steps Together Programme and the Programme’s approach

to establishing a safe school environment and to prevent school violence and bullying (see Annex Q for
information about the number of trainings conducted and number of school staff reached by these trainings)..
171. UNICEF’s support to develop the Programme has been in line with the needs of schools in Bulgaria, which had
problems with violence and bullying. In fact, the Programme corresponded with and addressed the actual needs
of the whole school community and made possible their ability to implement the Mechanism of Counteracting
Bullying and Violence in the Institutions of the Preschool and School Education System.
172. To address the actual needs of the schools, UNICEF assigned a mentor to each of the pilot schools to build their
capacities and provide them with technical assistance when it came to implementing the Programme.133 Each
mentor was capacitated by UNICEF to provide school staff with capacity building and technical assistance to
implement the Programme. In the first year of the programme, the five mentors included three women and
two men; in the second year, there were four female and one male mentors. Each of the pilot schools found
their mentors to be extremely helpful. Pilot schools typically had weekly and/or monthly online sessions with
their mentors which they found to be remarkably helpful because it was a new environment and new way of
working with a whole school approach to prevent and respond to school violence and bullying. See Annex Q for
basic data on the numbers of trainings conducted related to each activity and outcomes, with some
disaggregation by sex and school.
173. School staff recognized and appreciated the support
provided by mentors. Some school staff felt that the

provided by mentors helped them to better understand
their role and how they can address and overcome
challenges encountered with students and parents, and
specific actions to take when violence and/or bullying occurs. In addition, when teachers were faced with
challenges and had a specific case, they were assisted by the mentors. When school principals were asked,
‘What if the mentor was not there to support you?’ They explained that “it would have been different if we
didn’t have a mentor because the system suffers from a very serious deficit.”135 Thus, school principals
appreciated the support, advice and guidance that they received from mentors, such as helping them to see
and understand problems or issues with students and parents from a different perspective.
175. Middle school teachers also appreciated being able to talk with the mentor when they had a difficult situation.
They would discuss the difficult situation with the mentor and the mentor would provide them advice and
guidance on how to handle the situation, including specific approaches that they could take to address the
situation. In general, coordination councils met with their mentors at least once a month. Likewise, high school
teachers also appreciated that mentors enabled them to enrich their experience and to see things from a
different perspective.
176. UNICEF mentors found that school staff typically lack the capacities to intervene and respond to incidents of
school violence and bullying, so the Programme offered school staff with opportunities to learn how to prevent
and respond to school violence and bullying in schools in ways that were evidence-based and benefited the

teachers, students and parents. They felt that everyone
in the school was working together to prevent and
respond to school violence and bullying, in ways that
had not been done before, and this was a notable achievement for everyone in the schools. In each of the pilot
schools, teachers felt that the Programme was applicable and relevant to the youngest and middle school
students; in part, because Programme materials helped teachers to encourage children to open up and share
their emotions and pains. They recognized that the Programme was especially useful because it was based upon
empathy, which is important to relationships among children, and they felt that children benefited significantly
from learning how to recognize their own emotions, as well as those of others.
178. In Kustendil, school staff felt that the programme helped to
create a more united school community and to improve “The most meaningful aspect of

very responsive, but over time students became more
interactive and were able to share their common viewpoints.
5.2.3. To what extent the Steps Together Programme’s design and activities are appropriate for
achieving the intended results and outcomes?
179. As evidenced by the findings in this report, the Steps Together Programme’s design and activities were
appropriate for achieving the intended results and outcomes. In fact, the Steps Together Programme Document
(ProDoc) had a RMF with defined outcomes, activities, and indicators (Annex P: Steps Together Programme
RMF). The RMF was ambitious and included a remarkable number of outcomes to which UNICEF and MES were
focused on accomplishing. There were 32 outcomes identified in the RFM, including 10 outcomes planned for
the 2019-2020 school year (i.e., preparation stage preceding full implementation of the Programme), 22
outcomes planned for the 2020-2021 school year (i.e., Year 1 of the full implementation of the Programme)
and one outcome planned for 2021-2022 school year (i.e., Year 2 of the full implementation of the Programme).
The RMF also included an ambitious list of 36 activities that were envisaged to contribute to the Programme’s
outcomes.136 For the 32 outcomes and 36 activities there were 52 indicators, of which 37 were quantitative
indicators (e.g., number of meetings, number of volunteers) and 15 action indicators (e.g., decision taken at a
teachers council, decision of the coordination council reached). The indicators evidence the number of activities
and actions, but did little to demonstrate evidence results or progress made toward the 32 different outcomes
(Annex Q: UNICEF Reporting on Programme-Related Indicators).
180. The RMF for the Steps Together Programme was largely activities driven. Although the Programme was
interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF and MES were able to accomplish most of the planned activities
within the timeframe planned (2019-2022), although it was a challenge. UNICEF Programme staff and mentors
136 The ToC included detailed indicators for monitoring outcomes and outputs
35
worked tirelessly to ensure the Programme was a success, and worked closely with MES and schools to pivot
and adapt during the COVID-19 pandemic.
36
181. The Programme lacked a clear and comprehensive ToC, but this did not hinder the work or achievements of
UNICEF or MES to successfully implement the Programme. If, however, UNICEF plans to continue to invest in
the Programme to support MES to scale up the Programme to all schools in Bulgaria, UNICEF and MES would
benefit from working together to develop a clear and comprehensive ToC for the Programme. For instance, a
ToC with clearly identified components and a causal chain of high-level changes, along with intermediate
changes will help to guide the way forward for both UNICEF and MES. A well-developed ToC will also help to
support the change process and key priorities, and would help to identify assumptions, risks and bottlenecks
that may hinder progress toward planned changes and change strategies, and would need to be mitigated
(Annex S: Model for Development of a Theory of Change).
5.2.4. To what extent is the Steps Together Programme integrated into school life and management
in the pilot schools?
182. In each of the pilot schools, the Programme was integrated into school life and management to varying degrees.
In an effort to document this, respondents were asked to rank on a scale of 1 to 10 (1=not important to 10=very
important), how important the Programme has been to preventing school violence and bullying. Chart 2 shows
that the majority of respondents thought the Programme was very important to preventing school violence
and bullying. On average, the full sample of respondents ranked the Programme as an 8.4 on a 10-point scale.
More specifically, representatives from MES (mean=9.5) and principals/deputy principals (mean=9.3) were
most likely to report the Programme as very important to preventing school violence and bullying. This was
followed by UNICEF staff (mean=8.7), coordination council members (mean=8.6) and UNICEF mentors
(mean=8.4). In comparison, middle school teachers (mean=7.8), high school teachers (mean=7.7) and primary
school teachers (mean=7.6) were less likely to rank the Programme as very important to preventing school
violence and bullying.

184. Respondents were asked why they gave the Programme a particular ranking; responses varied among UNICEF
mentors and school staff. For instance, UNICEF mentors saw that the Programme fits very well with the needs
of schools and gives school staff concrete ways and opportunities to deal with school violence and bullying.
Similarly, mentors recognized that although not all teachers in the pilot schools were engaging in the
Programme, they found that those who were engaged recognized that the Programme was important.
185. Some mentors ranked the Programme an 8 on a 10-
point scale because while they recognized that the
Programme was implemented in systematic way and “I believe it is a key programme. We

adjustment to be more efficient; in other words, the
preparatory process should be longer because teachers
need more capacity building to implement the
Programme.
186. In comparison, school staff who ranked the Programme a 10 on a 10-piont scale felt that Programme had made
a a huge difference, particularly when they compared the past to the present. When asked to identify tangible
differences from before and after implementation of the Programme, one respondent explained,
a. “There is a more united spirit across the school . . . Diminishing or deleting the dividing line that existed
between the teacher and the student. Traditionally, we have had a strong dividing line between teachers
and students, and now we have a break through and we are pulling it down. They no longer see us as a
teacher, but people who they can approach when they need help solving their issues. This is a very important
achievement. My parents are even approaching me when they need help, they approach more for feedback
when an incident has a occurred, they approach me to tell them from my perspective.”137
187. There were teachers who appreciated that the Programme helped them, particularly after the COVID-19
pandemic lockdown to rebuild their students relationships and to build them back stronger. They recognized
that the Programme helped students to rediscover each other and to learn the importance of the school’s rules.
At the same time, teachers pointed out that they do not have enough time to implement the Programme. Some
teachers tried to adjust their other classes to extend the amount of time that they could spend on the
Programme, because they recognized that children need more time to learn the lessons and to apply what they
learned in the classroom.
188. One coordination council member ranked the Programme an 8 on a 10-point scale because they would have
liked to receive more support from the Parents Association. The Parents Association was a recognized
organization, given the fact that they conducted a mapping of the collaboration between parents and schools

Schools, however, expected practical guidance from “It was indeed a very important

needed for the Programme to be fully implemented,
and for school staff to notice and feel its impact. Some
school staff described the Programme as too ambitious, but they still wanted to continue working with this
Programme because they recognized it was important to school life and management, and helped them to
think out-of-the-box on preventing and responding to school violence and bullying.
190. It is notable that in some pilot schools, the Programme’s implementation was limited by deeply engrained social
norms and biases against the poor and ethnic minorities in Bulgaria. Biased attitudes and practices had an
impact on the way that school staff perceived the Programme and spoke about their ability to work with
students and parents/caregivers, particularly those who were poor and ethnic minority.138 As a result, MES
needs to do more to integrate inclusivity as part of the Programme.
5.3. Effectiveness
5.3.1. Has the Steps Together Programme achieved the planned objectives? To what extent the
objectives are realistic?
191. The Programme did make progress toward its planned objectives of creating a safe school environment and
preventing school violence and bullying. One of the cornerstone activities that was embraced by many teachers
was the Programme’s focus on establishing classroom rules and values, as defined by students. In this activity,
teachers guided students to discuss what is a horrible classroom and then contrast that with what is the perfect
classroom, and from there they worked together to develop the classes values and rules to ensure the perfect
classroom.
192. Classroom rules are supposed to help prevent school
violence and bullying; whereas restorative justice was
supposed to address the harms done by engaging all of those “I have participated in a number of

punitive sanctions on students who violate school’s rules,
which is in contrast to the concept of restorative justice.
138 UNICEF’s 2022 Steps Together Programme endline study found that ethnicity is an important factor in conflicts. It was
reported that both parents and teachers report the disinterest of minority parents as an difficult problem, which is an
insurmountable barrier, regardless of efforts on the part of teachers and parents. See 2022 Steps Together Programme Endline
Report, 2022. UNICEF: Sofia, Bulgaria
39
193. Some of these practices were more successful and more easily accepted by school staff, than others. For
instance, peer-to-peer initiatives, such as the peace makers, were well received by the pilot schools.
Coordination councils saw the peace makers initiative as innovative and fairly easy to implement. Schools that
were able to implement the peace makers initiative thought that the peer-to-peer approach was particularly
helpful or beneficial to creating a safe school environment. Three pilot schools implemented the peace makers
initiative, however, each school took a different approach. For instance, in Iskar the school engaged 8 middle
school students (5 girls and 3 boys); whereas the pilot school in Kustendil engaged about 20 students (16 girls
and 4 boys), including 10 middle school students (9 girls and 1 boy) and 10 high school students (7 girls and 3
boys) and 5 teachers. Most important, the peace makers were capacitated by teachers using Programme
materials, after which they were engaged in outreach and awareness-raising activities, including peer-on-peer
dialogue.
a. “We developed the peace makers during the second semester and the peace makers has stirred interest
among the students, and many of the peace makers are from the student council and they attended the
classes of the form teachers and ran different scenarios [or programme activities with students]. The
feedback from the form teachers was that the peace makers are welcome and helpful to the form teachers;
therefore, we plan to have more peace makers among the students next year.”139
194. Despite efforts to implement the Programme, school staff were well aware that it takes time to change a
school’s environment. School staff gained knowledge and experience on how to create a safe school
environment, and felt better prepared to define classroom rules and values, and to display those, yet they were
not as equipped to handle situations when students break the rules or commit acts of school violence or
bullying.
195. Some school staff were trying to be more proactive and using prevention-related activities from the Programme
as a means to prevent school violence and bullying, versus always being reactive to such incidents, thus, they
felt that their efforts were paying off because they started to receive fewer alerts or tip-offs from parents and
colleagues. Some teachers also reported that they were more willing to approach students when they saw them
arguing, and that they felt more capable to address the issue with students versus letting the argument grow
and get out-of-control. Teachers also felt that students act as a kind of corrective check among themselves,
and they remedy each other’s behaviours.
196. Some school staff also felt that the IKEA coroners that were created under the aegis of the Programme provided
different students with the opportunity to sit and communicate among themselves during class breaks, which
they thought was conducive to developing friendly relations and a more harmonious school environment. The
pilot schools in Kustendil and Iskar had very large IKEA coroners that were located in open areas across
from/outside of the school principal’s office, in open enclaves in the hallways where there was a lot space,
natural light and windows that made the location feel welcoming.
197. Overall, the Programme clearly influenced the environment in each of the pilot schools to varying degrees and
offered the whole school community with a different level of understanding of prevention of school violence
and bullying. The whole school approach was something new for school staff, so they were not fully sure if it
influenced directly the school practice.
198. School staff also recognized that the Programme
helped them, to varying degrees, to create a safe “First and maybe the most important was

5.3.2. To what extent target groups have been reached? Did the Steps Together Programme manage
to reach the whole school community in the pilot schools? What factors affected the
effectiveness of the Steps Together Programme and its impact on target groups, including the
most vulnerable groups?
199. In each of the pilot schools, the Programme reached the whole school community and benefitted school staff,
students and parents. The ways in which the Programme reached the whole school community in the pilot
schools and the factors that affected the effectiveness of the Programme and it impact on target groups are
described in the subsections that follow.
5.3.2.1. Benefits of the Programme for School Staff
200. School principals felt that teachers benefited from the Programme because teachers learned a lot and applied
what they learned in the classes with students, including how to solve different issues. At one pilot school, the
school principal pointed out that the support received from the Parents Association was very helpful because
working with parents is often difficult for teachers. Some school principals found that the Parents Association
offered very good advice and useful recommendations, and workable solutions. They also found the viewpoints
of the Parents Association to be relevant because they
are active and involved parents, and an experienced
and knowledgeable organization. For these reasons, a “The burnout training was effectives. It was

They also appreciated the methodological workshops

and created a space for sharing and building relations, confidence and trust. One coordination council wished
that there was a school staff member who would take on such an initiative to organize methodological
workshops, even after the Programme ends.
202. Another benefit of the Programme was the Programme’s Handbook that school staff received and the
interactive teaching approach that they were introduced to; this was a new teaching style in the educational
system which relies more heavily upon lecture-based teaching and memory-based learning.
203. Consequently, middle school teachers appreciated that they now methodology for addressing school violence
and bullying that they can continue to use in the future. As they explained, “I didn’t have to come with the
curriculum or case study myself.”140 Some middle school teachers felt that the Programme’s materials were
“probably super effective for the 5th to7th grades, but some of the workshops are quite childish.” 141 These same
primary teachers pointed out that some of the topics focused on were sometime heavy or emotional for
students, and required more time. Teachers felt that when they finished a handbook activity that students had
to hurry off to another class, without enough time to discuss the activity and their emotions. Thus, teachers
pointed out that the duration of one class was not enough to teach the Programme.
204. Some teachers proposed a Steps Together Camp for students because that would give them more time to focus
efforts and energy on the Programme, without stealing time from or other programmes. While this idea was
intriguing, a Steps Together Camp for students would not promote a whole school approach to preventing

141 2-9, Middle School Teachers
41
school violence and bullying because it would only involve some teachers and students from the school.
Moreover, the students who would participate in such a camp would more than likely be the more privileged
students with good academic performance. To ensure a stronger whole school approach to implementing the
Programme, the evaluator proposed the idea of a Steps Together Camp for School Staff that would strengthen
teacher’s capacities to understand the Programme and how to effectively implement the Programme and teach
the curriculum to students. This recommendation was introduced to school staff in four of the pilot schools
throughout the evaluation to gauge their interest in such an initiative as part of the Programme and for
purposes of capacity building.
205. The majority of school staff thought that the Step Together Programme Camp for School Staff was a good idea
and expressed interest in the opportunity to attend such a camp to strengthen their knowledge and capacities
to implement the Programme and to build a better whole school approach, as well as to network with other
schools implementing the Programme. Teachers felt that engaging school directors in the camp, alongside
teachers and psychologists, that this would help to strengthen commitments to the Programme throughout the
school. Teachers also expressed interest in helping to facilitate sessions so that new schools could learn from
the pilot schools.
206. In comparison, high school teachers explained that if
the issue of bullying was contained, they could spend
more time on teaching and supporting students’ “I am a form teacher and my objective is to
learning. However, many high school teachers felt control my own class. Being a form teacher,

violence and bullying. Quite often bullying remains
invisible to teachers because it occurs between
students and in peer groups.
208. Mentors also felt that school staff benefited from the Programme because they heard firsthand from teachers
that the training was useful on a personal and professional level. One mentor highlighted that school staff
learned teamwork, which was “one of the biggest benefits and what they [teachers] really appreciated about
the programme.”142 Mentors also reported that teachers realized that they can let go of the expectations that
they alone have to handle school violence and bullying; after which they are open to receive help from their
coworkers.
209. One mentor explained that the Programme helped to “build a community of teachers, something that up to
now was not working actively . . . and create spaces where they support each other in a broader group to provide
self-help; this turned out to be a very good instrument, it was a welcomed one by management and teachers
alike.”143 During the workshops and activities, teachers were able to discuss real-life topics and issues with their
colleagues in a very different way, which provided them a forum or means to talk openly about school violence
and bullying in a more engaging and meaningful way.

5.3.3. Benefits of the Programme for Students
210. School principals also felt that students benefited from the Programme because they learned to recognize
specific forms of behaviours as violence and bullying, that they did not recognize before, and that they learned
how to work out the rules together, and to listen to the opinions of their classmates. School principals felt that
the Programme helped students to resolve conflicts themselves, and to know to whom to reach out for help.
One school director pointed out the Programme helped to create a peaceful atmosphere in the classroom
where students feel safe.
211. At the time of the evaluation, most pilot schools were still in the early stages of introducing students to the
Programme, because of implementation delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and teachers were still learning
how to teach the Programme’s curriculum to students. As a result teachers pointed out,
a. “There were very interesting topics that were not discussed with the students before, such as what is it that
encourages them to use aggression, how would they feel if they were the victim, who are they and why
shouldn’t they conceal our emotions. There were a number of topics that form the emotional intelligence,
such as behavioural aggression and how to respond. We had never discussed them in the school.”144
212. In pilot schools where the peace makers initiative was implemented, school staff thought that this
initiative benefited students by providing them opportunities to be role models and to teach the
Programme’s curriculum to younger students. FGDs with high school students revealed that some
of the peace makers benefited from this initiative. In the Sofia pilot school, peace makers were
introduced at the end of the last school year. Peace makers were provided some of the general
workshops meant for all students, plus five additional workshops; this was the approach taken in
UNICEF’s SEES Programme in Croatia. The assumption was that the five additional workshops would
capacitate peace makers to have increased social and emotional intelligence and skills to be able to
intervene if they witness acts of violence, or at least to report the incident to a teacher or the school
psychologist. The goal was that the peace makers would help to establish the trust and confidence
among their classmates, and promote violence prevention among their peers.
a. “The idea behind the peace makers programme is to have the students help one another, if there were
physical forms of violence the peace makers are there to help. They can step in and given advice to the
survivors of violence, such as whom to talk to or to help them. In Bulgaria, reaching out to a psychologist or
for help is quite stigmatizing. Our society is not open to this advance, so having access to a peacekeeper,
someone who can support you and is also equipped to handle the violence and bullying. The peace makers
try to help the child in these situations. Peace makers received the training, there are five workshops and
they together with the two high school teachers delivered the seminars. We developed this project to crate
peace makers out of the 10th and 11th grades, and the 12th graders taught the 9th class for social and
emotional learning. The teachers worked with them, but they delivered some of the activities.”145
213. Mentors recognized that a key to the Programme’s success was the engagement of students. They felt that
students who participated in the Programme were better able to recognize school violence and bullying, and
to express themselves in way that their words do not hurt or harm others. Peace makers were particularly
influential among their peers, as they were able to communicate messages of intolerance for violence and
bullying. Mentors also felt that students liked the Programme because it provided them opportunities to openly
discuss interesting topics and to engage in fun activities and games.146
214. FGDs with students in each of the pilot schools revealed that to varying degrees some students were exposed
to school violence and bullying, as victims and/or witnesses, or heard stories about school violence and bullying
in their schools. When talking about school violence they often focused on acts of physical aggression by a
144 32, Sofia
145 10-15, High School Teachers
146 These findings are similar to findings from UNIEF’s 2022 Steps Together endline study found that students valued programme

judged, to listen and communication, to participate in joint activities, to share and recognize their emotions and those of others,
and to participate in role plays.
43
student(s) against other students and teachers, and against school property (e.g., damaging school desk and
walls). These were acts of school violence and bullying that occurred in the classroom, school buildings and on
school grounds. Students who experienced school violence and/or bullying were typically afraid to speak out
or to report their experiences to schools staff.
215. Many students, particularly at the middle and high school levels, thought the Programme had no impact on
changing students behaviours, particularly the behaviours of students who were aggressors and bullies. There
were, however, some students who thought that the Programme helped to reduce some of the conflicts
between students, but more so among students who were not known troublemakers and did not have a
reputation of being aggressive or a bully. One student explained, “For the troublemakers the programme is
some nonsense and is nothing serious; they disregard it. They simply do not enter the lessons and get away with
it.”147 Primary school students were slightly more likely to think the Programme had an impact on relations
between students.
216. Some students spoke about establishing classroom
rules and values, and defining the consequences of
breaking rules; whereas other students did not think “I had a classmate who was rude to both

of paper.”148 Students felt that it is important that
teachers bring students back to classroom rules when
they are broken.
217. No students spoke about the use of restorative justice by schools, rather they described the continued use of a
punishment-based system in schools. One student explained that “the deputy principle announced that some
kids (they even announced the names) would be expelled, but did not follow this and nothing happened. The
kids became better for a week and once they see that there are no consequences, it becomes evident that this
was just a bluff and their behaviour became worse again.”149 Given this situation, some students expressed
concern that school management and teachers were unable to control aggressive students who bullied other
students and teachers in the school.
218. High school students seemed to be less interested in the Programme because they perceived the content of
the Programme to be more for younger students; except for high school students who were involved in the
peace makers initiative. Students involved in the peace makers initiative looked at the Programme in a different
light and thought that without the peace makers they would not have gotten together. Some students thought
the peace makers initiative actually helped students to learn to work as a team and provided students with
opportunities to get to know other students in their school, both older and younger, which was something that
they enjoyed. Some students even expressed a desire to join the peace makers imitative next year, if the
Programme continued.150
5.3.4. Benefits of the Programme for Parents
219. UNICEF outsourced capacity building activities for school staff to strengthen their abilities to work with parents
to the Parents Association. UNICEF was unable to engage the Parents Association as initially planned because
schools were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also a misunderstanding from the side of schools
as to how the Programme would capacitate and support them to work with parents. Schools expected that the
147 Middle School Students

150 UNICEF’s Programme endline study found that among students sample (sample size unknown) the Programme topics they
engaged in the most were focused on Violence (63%), setting rules (42%), how to respond to mistreatment (36%), how bad
attitudes occurs (31%), how to recover from bad attitudes (26%), what responsibility they have for their own behaviours (26%),
are emotions normal (22%) and what am I (21%).
44
Programme would actually work with parents directly, but this was not the case, the plan was only to provide
capacity building to schools on how to work with parents. One respondent explained, “This caused a clash of
expectations as to what UNICEF was supporting.”151 Nevertheless, schools managed with the support of the
Parents Association to work with parents in a more structured way. The Parents Association worked with
schools to create a plan for working with parents and the plans included specific activities.
220. School staff had a difficult time seeing what were the benefits of the Programme for parents because it was
difficult for them to engage parents in the Programme, including to identify one or two parents who were
willing to serve on the coordination council.152 From the perspective of school staff, parents are not typically
engaged in their students schooling because they are busy and work long hours, or have to commute quite a
distance to and from work. Pilot schools did not appear to have a clear approach for systematically
communicating with parents about the Programme or engaging parents in the Programme. In an effort to
engage more parents, some schools organized sports events, such as a football games that involved teachers,
parents and students. Schools also had a difficult time getting parents to come to the school to participate in
FGDs for purposes of this evaluation, and for the Programme’s baseline and endline studies.
221. Mentors felt that when it came to engaging parents, schools were often hesitant or lacked confidence when it
came to engaging with parents.153 It is notable, however, that the pilot school in Iskar worked with mayors in
neighboring communities to arrange occasional mobile parent-teacher meetings, which helped to improve
communication between parents and teachers, particularly among ethnic minority parents/caregivers of
students.
222. FGDs with parents of primary, middle and high school
students revealed that most parents were not fully aware of “Absolutely, it is very important to
the Programme, nor did they fully understand the talk about violence, the more there is
Programme. Nevertheless, parents believed that a communication on that topic with

bullying that their child and other children in the school society and I think discussions like this
experienced at the hands of schoolmates (peers) and from are useful.” (Middle School Parents)
school staff, including teachers and other staff in the school.
223. Parents wanted more information about the Programme and how to respond to situations of school violence
and bullying.154 One parent explained, “It seems the school relies on the children to inform us [parents], but
children do not share everything.”155 Some parents spoke about how they often had to handle situations of
peer aggression and bullying themselves by contacting the parents of the child who was causing the problem
or going to the school and talking to the school staff person. Parents wanted more opportunities for role plays
and participation in Programme-related events, versus just getting a lecture or completing a survey. Some

154 During the finalization of this evaluation report, the UNICEF Programme Coordinator reported that they gave several
opportunities for parents to learn about the Programme. For example, in December 2020, UNICEF established an online forum
for the exchange of good practices, and in January 2021, UNICEF presented and discussed the results of the baseline research in
each of the five pilot schools, which parents were invited to attend. The Programme Coordinator reported they monitored how
information for these events was spread to parents and saw that official channels, such as the electronic diary, was used by
schools to inform parents, and that some form teachers informed parents trough their class channels. Despite these efforts, the
Programme Coordinator found that few parents were interested to join the meeting in January 2021 and listen to the findings
from the baseline research; therefore, community events were organized to start attracting parents to school life. The
Programme Coordinator recognized that efforts to engage parents requires time and trust; this takes much more than two years
because there are barriers to communication between teachers and parents. The Programme Coordinator reported that a new
culture needs to be created in school to improve communication between teachers and parents, that this will take time.
155 Primary school parent
45
parents felt that the educational system is not active enough when it comes to addressing school violence and
bullying, and they felt that the Programme had yet to have an impact on ending school violence and bullying in
their child’s school.
5.4. Impact
5.4.1. What impact has the Steps Together Programme had after two years of piloting? Are there any
differences in impact among the five pilot schools?
224. Assessing the Programme’s impact after two years of piloting was not really possible, nor was assessing
differences in impact among the five pilot schools because the COVID-19 pandemic delayed implementation of
the Programme and effected how the Programme was ultimately implemented, which was different from
initially planned (as already explained). Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Programme, there
was a shorter timeframe for Programme implementation; thus, it is too early to answer evaluation questions
related to the impact of the Programme in each of the five pilot schools.
225. Also, given the fact that the Programme was not implemented school-wide in any of the five pilot schools, the
impacts are not clear. Respondents spoke about the effectiveness of the Programme, but had few words to say
about impact. Moreover, school staff have not wanted to say that there are any notable differences in terms of
impact of the Programme on girls versus boys or primary, middle and high school students. School staff in the
pilot schools explained, “We need more time to build the soft skills of our students, they don’t have the adequate
skills for that and we don’t have the time to teach those skill.”156
5.4.2. To what extent did the Steps Together Programme contribute to capacity building of schools
to support long-term positive changes in schools and reductions in level of violence and bullying
in pilot schools?
226. As part of the Programme, UNICEF mentors received capacity building trainings from UNICEF, particularly
UNICEF mentors. UNICEF mentors delivered capacity building trainings to school staff in the pilot schools to
support long-term positive change in the schools, and to contribute to reduced levels of violence and bullying
in pilot schools. The capacity building trainings were designed to be delivered in a face-to-face setting to school
staff, including principals, coordination council members, school psychologists and teachers; however, due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, most of these trainings were delivered online in half-day and two- to three-hour
training sessions. Training topics included, but were not limited to: peer-to-peer methodologies: establishing
values, rules and consequences; restoration approach; improving teacher-parent communication; building a
school community; and overcoming professional burnout.157 Pilot schools were also provided with the
opportunity to engage online with the author of the Programme’s Handbook, and were presented findings from
the Programme’s baseline research.
227. To understand how effective the capacity building activities were to school staff who were targeted, school
principals, coordination council members and teachers were asked to rank on a scale of 1 to 10 (1=not effective
to 10=very effective), how effective were the capacity building activities provided by UNICEF and mentors.
Chart 4 shows that the majority of respondents thought the capacity building activities were effective. On
average, the full sample of respondents ranked the programme’s capacity building activities as a 7.6 on a 10-
point scale. More specifically, school principals and coordination council members from Iskar (mean=9.8),
Teteven (mean=9.3) and Kustendil (mean=9.2) ranked the capacity building trainings as very effective, whereas
those from Sofia (mean=6.3) were less likely to rank the capacity building trainings as very effective. This, in
part, is because school teachers in Sofia were also asked about the effectiveness of the capacity building
trainings.

interview.
228. Respondents were asked why they gave the capacity building trainings the rank they did. Respondents who
ranked the capacity building trainings a 10 on a 10-point scale explained that they found the capacity building
trainings to be “very interesting, exciting and amusing, and time was flowing when we had the trainings.” The
pilot school in Iskar had the opportunity to participate in both online and face-to-face capacity building trainings
and they found it much better to have face-to-face trainings.158 School staff appreciated the trainings, as they
provided them the opportunity to learn from the mentors, as well as school staff from the other pilot schools
in some trainings/workshops.
229. Among those who ranked the capacity building trainings a 9 on a 10-point scale, they recognized that the
mentors were very dedicated and responsible people, who took into consideration the needs of school staff
and gave their best to the Programme and schools. At the start of the Programme, some school staff did not
know how these workshops would take place given the COVID-19 pandemic, but word spread quickly that the
workshops were useful, so from then on school staff attended the workshops; however, the time selected for
the workshops was not always the best for teachers and because of the pandemic, teachers were reluctant to
take on additional work. School principals explained that had the workshops been face-to-face they would have
been more effective.
230. School staff who ranked the capacity building
trainings an 8 or 7 on a 10-point scale did so

47
presentations that were things we were already doing. We gave some feedback . . . Maybe they didn’t meet
our expectation, what they had planned and our expectation.”159
232. In comparison, other school staff found the trainings offered by the Parents Association to be quite useful
because they provided them with ideas on how to prepare for meetings with parents and how to communicate
with parents. Surprisingly, not all school staff had the confidence to effectively engage with parents about their
child. School principals from one pilot school explained, “Regrettably, sometimes we work on the basis of old
and outdated practices, so it is very important for form teachers to know what they should not do when
interacting with parents.”160
233. Some school staff found that sometimes the presentations were long in the online forum and were not tailored
for teachers. School staff did not typically find lecture-based trainings to be very useful; they preferred adult
learning models that provide opportunities to be active learners and to share their experiences and learn from
others. This is why they focused on capacity building trainings offered by the mentors, which tended to use
more engaging and adult learning approaches. They explained, “We had an excellent mentor who worked well
with the teachers and the mentor gave good advice.” Yet, they maintained that there are “still some deficits, in
terms of working with specific cases, particularly more complicated cases with children, as well as
communication between teachers and students; there is room for improvement.”161
234. In 2022, UNICEF’s Steps Together Programme endline study found that teachers were interested in training,
including dealing with occupation stress and burnout, understanding and dealing with challenging students and
behaviours, and communication with parents.162
235. It is notable that when the evaluation was conducted, it was too early to assess or know whether the capacity
building provided to school staff in each of the pilot schools to supported long-term positive changes in schools
and reductions in level of violence and bullying in pilot schools
5.4.3. To what extent and in which areas the Steps Together Programme had significant impact? Are
there any sub-group differences?
236. Although impact could not be assessed at this early stage of Programme implement, effort was made to assess
school staff’s satisfaction with the Programme, including to what extent and in which areas the Programme had
a notable impact. To accomplish this, during the evaluation, all respondents were asked to rank on a scale of 1
to 10 (1=not satisfied to 10=very satisfied), how satisfied they were with the Programme. Chart 5 shows that
the majority of respondents were satisfied, at least to some degree, with the Programme. On average, the full
sample of respondents ranked their level of satisfaction with the Programme as an 8.7 on a 10-point scale.
More specifically, school staff from Iskar (mean=10.0) and Kustendil (mean=9.3) were most likely to report
being very satisfied with the Programme, followed by school staff from Sofia (mean=8.1) and Teteven
(mean=8.0), whereas school staff from Zavet (mean=7.3) were least likely to be very satisfied with the
Programme.

Note: 1=Not Satisfied to 10=Very Satisfied. Mean scores are based only on responses of school staff, including principals/deputy principals and
members of Coordination Councils.
237. School principals and coordination councils were asked how satisfied they were on a 10-point scale with the
Programme. Respondents who reported being very satisfied with the Programme (i.e., a 10 on a 10-point scale)
explained it was because the Programme managed to adapt to the circumstances and accomplish its objectives,
despite the challenges, particularly challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. School staff who were
involved in the Programme reported being able to see the strengths of the Programme, but they were not sure
that all teachers agreed with them that the Programme was beneficial.
238. Respondents who ranked the Programme a 9 on a 10-point scale reported it was because they found the
information provided as part of the Programme, including during the capacity building trainings, was very
useful; yet they thought that there was room for improving the Programme, including programme-related
materials and capacity building activities, as well as Programme implementation. Respondents who gave the
Programme an 8 on a 10-point scale, reported it was because there are school staff, including form teachers,
who are either unwilling or reluctant to implement the Programme and to teach the curriculum. School staff
also saw that there is still room for improving how schools work with parents, which is a core component of the
Programme.
239. School staff who ranked the Programme a 7 on a 10-point scale reported it was because some of the
Programme’s materials were not fully adopted for students in the 8th graders above. School staff perceived
that the foundational content of the Programme was relevant, but found that some of the handbook activities
needed to be adapted for older students (e.g., middle and high school students). Other school staff felt that “it
is too early to be able to reap the fruits of the programme, although there is a change and difference.”163
240. Finally school staff who ranked the Programme a 6 or 5 on a 10-point scale reported that they gave a lower
score because they wished that there would have been less documentation. They complained that they were
already overburdened with administrative work, and the Programme just added to that workload. They also
recognized that they would not be able to apply or implement all of the components of the Programme, so they
were picking and choosing what to implement, and were not implementing the Programme in full as originally
intended for the Programme to be effective and to have an impact.
5.4.4. What factors favorably or adversely affected the impact of the Steps Together Programme on
school staff, students and parents, including the most vulnerable?
241. Respondents were asked what factors contributed to the success and effectiveness of the Programme in their
schools, and what factors adversely affected the impact of the Programme on school staff, student and parents.
There were some notable differences across pilot schools that are highlighted below.
242. The pilot school in Kustendil identified numerous factors that contributed to the Programme’s success and
effectiveness. These included capacity building workshops provided to school staff by UNICEF and the mentor,
as well as technical assistance from the mentor. They also recognized that funding for the Programme was
beneficial. They explained, “I am including the funding because some of the activities included financial
support.” They identified buy-in and support from the principal as crucial to the success and effectiveness of

the Programme, and they recognized that the principal fully shared their ideas about developing students’ social
and emotional competence, which was a component of the Programmes.
243. School staff from the pilot school in Kustendil explained that, “We were very hard working, persistent and put
a lot of effort [into the Programme], and the psychologist was very involved, she acted as a coordinator.” In
addition, this same group of teachers identified “the wish for change . . . because we are aware of the need for
change” as a contributing factor to the Programme’s success and effectiveness.
244. The pilot school in Iskar had a difficult time identifying factors that contributed to the success and effectiveness
of the Programme; however, some school staff identified the important role of the mentor and the students
who participated in the Programme. On the other hand, there was strong sentiment among many teachers that
they wanted a stronger focus on the parents and families, particularly those whom they believed did not value
education for their children, including poor and ethnic minority families. They were also dissatisfied with the
online meetings which were organized during the COVID-19 pandemic and often took place after school hours.
245. The pilot school in Sofia also had a difficult time identifying factors that contributed to the success and
effectiveness of the Programme; however, one teacher pointed out that “we have very good organization
because during the monthly meetings of the Coordination Council we knew what had to be done after that and
we planned accordingly.” Likewise, other teachers explained, “I think one of the factors for the success of the
programme is that we work well as a team, we exchange experiences and we ask for help. We are investing
efforts in making the school a better place. We are also open to work.” They also maintained that classroom
rules introduced through the Programme were done so willingly by students and teachers, and that they were
eventually able to introduce the peace makers initiative to high school students.
246. In the pilot school in Teteven, factors that contributed to the Programme’s success and effectiveness included
the buy-in and commitment of the school principal, including her ability to recognize that the Programme as
relevant and beneficial to the school. In addition, school staff reported that the Programme’s success was due,
in part, to the fact that there were a group of teachers who took responsibility to act as coordinators. Some
active form teachers were the driving force behind the Programme. Another factor was schools good
partnerships with the Parents Association and UNICEF, particularly the mentor. They also identified the
importance of team work164 and the engagement of students, as well as having a well-designed package of
Programme materials to support the Programme’s implementation.
247. In the pilot school in Zavet, factors that contributed to the Programme’s success and effectiveness were
attributed largely to particular teachers who were motivated because there were challenges when it came to
the school principal’s commitment and motivation to implement the Programme. From the mentor’s
perspective, in this pilot school there is a “culture that everyone is doing what they are supposed to do, so for
teachers not motivated about the programme, they still had to participate in the trainings because they had to
do it, and after the trainings they were more convinced about the programme.” Another difference was that
this pilot school was not overwhelmed by other programmes, which gave them more space to do something
different or new.
248. UNICEF recognized that the key to success in any school that aims to implement the Programme is the
commitment and buy-in of the school principal. If school principals do not recognize the Programme’s value,
the school will not succeed at implementing the Programme because school staff, particularly teachers, will not
be supported. School principals can also provide teachers with extra time to ensure that the Programme’s
curriculum is taught to students, and can motivate teachers to properly implement the Programme in their
classrooms and throughout the school.
5.4.4.1. Factors that adversely affected the Programme
249. To assess what factors adversely affected the impact of the Programme on school staff, student and parents,
respondents were asked what challenges need to be addressed to improve the Programme and its
164 In UNICEF’s 2022 Steps Together Programme endline study found that only 51% of teachers (sample size unknown) reported
that team work at school on problems of violence and bullying was one of the successful activities that they participated in as
part of the Programme. See, Steps Together Programme Endline Report, 2022. UNICEF: Sofia, Bulgaria.
50
implementation. Most notable, school principals identified the challenge of engaging school staff; they were
not sure how they could help school staff, particularly teachers, see the benefits of the Programme.
250. In addition, mentors identified challenges finding time and space to teach the Programme’s curriculum. Some
teachers found the curriculum to be ‘heavy’ in terms of content; thus, they either did not feel comfortable or
confident teaching the Programme’s curriculum. Others teachers reported they did not teach the curriculum
because they did not have enough time; they needed more class time to share and discuss the subject matter
with students.
a. “I believe the content is extremely rich and interesting. In the beginning, I thought that children would fail
the topics, but children got actively involved. Children were extremely capable of getting to know the topic
of bullying and violence. We have a good team. I think the problems is more that don’t have enough time.
I propose to take this issue to the ministry to have more hours in the programme.”165
251. Teachers also reported that they were not
motivated to implement the Programme because
they have a lot of ‘bureaucratic work’ which leaves “To address the challenge of burnout, tiredness

cooperating with parents/caregivers, particularly
since it is not uncommon for school staff to hold
negative attitudes and beliefs about parents. School staff described parents as uncooperative and even accused
parents of not caring about their children’s education or behaviours. Such resentment of parents was even
stronger if the students came from poor and/or ethnic minority families. Teachers need a great deal of capacity
building to be able to effectively engage and cooperate with parents, and to eliminate the ‘us against them’
mentality that is commonly expressed. This is a component of the Programme that needs to be significantly
strengthened.166
253. Another challenge identified by both teachers and mentors was that the Programme Handbook is too childish
for middle and high school students. One middle teacher explained, “We found the case studies in the handbook
to be a bit childish, so to say, for children of that age, and some of the students didn’t take it seriously because
of that.”167In addition, the Programme Handbook does not reflect the diversity of experiences of ethnic
minorities; thus, it does not speak to or resonate with ethnic minority students in ways that promote inclusivity.
254. Another limitation of the Programme Handbook was that it was modeled after the SEES Programme Handbook
that had been developed nearly a decade earlier, so school staff from the pilot schools felt the Programme
Handbook’s content and activities were a bit outdated and needed to be revised and developed to reflect
children and adolescents of today, particularly since there have been many technological and development
changes, as well as the COVID-19, that has reshaped the national context and shaped the lives of children and
adolescents.
165 Primary School Students
166 UNICEF’s 2022 Steps Together Programme endline study found that teachers feel that they have not received enough support
to work with parents and that they fail to involve parents; teachers feel in constant defensive mode with parents, with no
support. In addition, teachers revealed that there are situations in which they do not know how to react, but they must have
answers for parents. See Steps Together Programme Endline Report, 2022. UNICEF: Sofia, Bulgaria.

5.5. Efficiency
5.5.1. How well the Steps Together Programme and its implementation was planned and managed?
255. This Programme was implemented with no donor funding; it was funded predominately by UNICEF.168 Table
10 provides a summary of Programme expenditures. The total cost of the programme was BGN 487,490, of
which BGN 427,490 was UNICEF’s contribution and BGN 60,000 was MES’s contribution (Annex R: Breakdown
of Summary Programme Expenditures).

256. MES and UNICEF signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the joint implementation of the
Programme. In MES, the Directorate of Inclusive Education led the process of Programme implementation.
UNICEF put a notable amount of time and resources into planning, implementation and coordination of the
Programme. In addition, the MES established a working group to support the Programme’s planning and
development. Working groups members served as an advisory group, informing the development and
implementation of the Programme. The working group had a lot of input as to what the Programme should
look like. UNICEF also signed MoUs with each of the pilot schools. From start to finish, with the support of
school mentors, UNICEF tried to tailor implementation strategies to each of the five pilot schools. Despite all of
these efforts, there was still room for improvement.
257. Initially, the plan was that the Programme would be implemented over a three-year period, but the Programme
started late and the design in the working group took longer than expected, and then the Programme was
interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, UNICEF had to shift their focus and provide schools with
support on crisis management to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures, which included
the temporary closure of schools and shifting to distance learning, which came with unique challenges.
258. In terms of the Programme, the COVID-19 pandemic forced UNICEF and MES to pivot and develop a more
flexible hybrid model for the implementing the Programme. This required tailoring planned capacity building
workshops for school staff to be delivered in online platforms. Also, they explored ways of teaching the
Programme’s curriculum to students in an online platform when schools were closed. This approach came with
challenges, which have been described in previous sections.
259. Ultimately, UNICEF learned that two years was not enough time to implement the Programme to the extent
that it was able to change the culture in the pilot schools, and to engage all of the school staff, students and
parents. Nor was there enough time to really assess the Programme’s impact or effectiveness, or to ensure
sustainability over time. Schools need a longer period of time to be capacitated to possess the knowledge,
attitudes and practices needed to effectively implement the Programme as a whole school approach, and the
technical assistance of mentors. Each of the pilot schools would benefit from an additional two years of piloting
the Programme.
168 Conducting a costing analysis was beyond the scope of this evaluation and the evaluation team was not able to conduct cost
comparisons. The evaluation team was only provided with summary expenditures data presented in Table 10 and Annex R).
52
260. Pilot schools were provided with some opportunities to engage with each other and share experiences. The
first meeting was a joint online meeting that engaged each of the pilot schools, and there were other online
meetings that provided school principals and teachers with opportunities to exchange experiences. During the
2021-2022 school year, another joint meeting of pilot schools was held, mainly involving members the
coordination councils. Pilot schools were also provided access to a Facebook page dedicated to the Steps
Together Programme where pilot schools could upload photos and information about Programme-related
activities and events.
261. There were also opportunities provided for school principals from two schools to communicate more directly
with each other. In addition, peace makers and teachers from the pilot school in Sofia were provided the
opportunity to travel to Teteven to meet with their peace makers and teachers for an exchange of experiences
and ideas. Peace makers were also provided opportunities to engage in online meetings where they become
acquainted with the peace makers in the other pilot schools.
262. Mentors highlighted the fact that they were unable to arrange as many meetings and opportunities for
cooperation among pilot schools as they had wanted because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
263. Pilot schools would have benefited from having a better community of practice and more exchanges, including
separate communities of practice and exchanges for school principals, coordination councils, primary school
teachers and middle and high school teachers.
264. In terms of partnership, other than some engagement with the Parents Association to support Programme
implementation, UNICEF and pilot schools did not really engage local communities in their efforts to establish
safe schools or to prevent school violence and bullying. Teachers at one of the pilot schools reported that this
was “one of the failures, we haven’t involved the local community, particularly leaders in our local
community.”169 It is notable, however, that UNICEF established a partnership with IKEA to support each of the
schools to design and furnish a so-called relaxing space or coroner.
265. UNICEF was able to adapt and change to meet the needs
of beneficiaries, particularly during the COVID-19
pandemic, but shifting the Programme’s rollout to an

provided the opportunity to back out of the initiative if
they so desired.
266. Ultimately, the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly influenced the Programme’s implementation and made it
more difficult to engage school staff and students, as teachers were struggling to teach online and students’
were having a difficult time with distance learning. By the time, children started to return to in-class learning,
there were periods in time when COVID-19 forced schools to re-close temporarily and return to online teaching

53
and distance learning; this continued for more than one-year. This made it more difficult for teachers to remain
focused on and committed to the Programme and for students to fully engage in the Programme. Nevertheless,
the five pilot schools continued to work with the mentors in an effort to implement the Programme.
a. “A large portion of the training and communication took place remotely and online, we had only a few
cases when there was direct contact and eye contact with the teachers, this was a challenge because we
had to adapt the way we worked and the contents that we had to deliver online. This was difficult for
teachers as well because there were periods of entire remote work and others where the classrooms would
rotate, this made the delivery of education difficult. It required flexibility on the part of the teachers, this is
likely the reason why we had delays in the start of the programme, and these objective difficulties were not
as easy to cope with for everyone. There were form teachers that managed to cope with online learning
very easily, and they managed to apply elements of the workshops, and there were other form teachers
who said it was very difficult for them to engage students in this remote environment.”171
267. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, some school staff were unable to appreciate the benefits of the
Programme and did not understand how to implement it in an online platform. In fact, it was difficult to keep
both school staff and students engaged and interested online teaching and learning, which made Programme
implementing in an online platform difficult. For many school staff, the online capacity building workshops and
training offered under the aegis of the Programme were an added burden on top of their online teaching and
administrative responsibilities. Too much screen time each day caused many teachers to burnout. This meant
that UNICEF mentors had to cut their capacity building trainings short, which meant that Programme-related
trainings were not delivered to the full extent as initially envisioned and planned for the Programme.
5.5.2. To what extent data collection and monitoring activities performed by UNICEF and MES informed and
contributed to improving implementation of Programme activities and achievement of results?
268. UNICEF had a monitoring and reporting approach to
support Programme management. Although the
“I think the monitoring was meant to

RMF. Documentation procedures were elaborated by
UNICEF and presented to mentors and schools during an
informational session. During this session, the UNICEF
Programme Coordinator was available to provide additional support during the programme’s implementation
period. The UNICEF Programme Coordinator was also responsible for collecting and archiving monitoring data
and information, and documenting progress and results, such as in the mid-term assessment in September
2021. On a monthly basis, the UNICEF Programme Coordinator informed the mentors in each school of progress
made. Mentors all supported the collection of evidences by communication with school coordinators; mentors
organized the collection of data at the school level.
269. For UNICEF it was also a challenge that schools were slow to complete or did not complete monitoring and
reporting forms and diaries, as requested by UNICEF; thus, UNICEF had to do a lot of follow up to collect data
and information needed for monitoring and reporting. School staff pointed out that they are overburdened
171 39, Mentor
54
with teaching and administrative responsibilities, particularly during the pandemic, so they did not have time
to complete the monitoring tools. Regardless of these challenges, UNICEF and mentors did attempt to provide
schools with feedback, particularly after meetings and trainings, but the feedback was not always addressed by
the pilot schools.
270. In general, the focus of monitoring was on documenting progress made toward implementing activities and
pre- defined indicators (Annex Q: UNICEF Reporting on Programme-Related Indicators). UNICEF also invested
in Programme-related baseline and endline studies172 and summaries of these reports were translated into
English and shared with the Lead Evaluator. These study reports were largely qualitative in nature and scope,
with some quantitative data, but they did not explicitly measure Programme-related indicators from the
baseline and endline.
271. Programme implementation and monitoring tools and reports were in Bulgarian and were not shared with the
evaluation team; however, the mid-term assessment that covered the period of September 2019-2021 was
available in English and was shared with the evaluation team, as was an executive summary of the baseline and
endling studies (written in Bulgarian and translated into English). Based upon documents reviewed, it was
evident that there is room for improvement when it comes to monitoring and reporting, including the need for
a clear monitoring and evaluation framework, which should be spelled out in the Programme Document, and
more qualitative indicators.
5.6. Sustainability
5.6.1. To what extent has UNICEF and MES been able to support pilot schools to ensure ownership of the
Steps Together Programme? What are the key factors that can be positively or negatively influence the
institutionalization and long-term financial sustainability of the Steps Together Programme?
272. At this stage, the Programme’s sustainability is limited in the pilot schools because there had not been enough
time, commitment or buy-in from the majority of school staff to implement the Programme as originally
envisioned, as a whole school approach. Moreover, not all school staff felt that they had been capacitated
enough to understand how to implement the Programme and teach the curriculum, nor are they provided
enough time in the school day and curriculum to do so. These are significant barriers to sustainability.173
273. Some teachers may continue to utilize components of the Programme, such as the practice of developing
classroom rules and values, and posting them in the classroom, but it is not clear that they will continue to
implement any of the other components of the Programme, such as restorative justice or teaching the
curriculum in the classroom.
274. Similarly, mentors envisioned that schools may keep three or four activities from the Programme Handbook,
such as establishing classroom rules and values, and providing space for discussion, but that was about it.
Mentors pointed out that if the Programme’s curriculum were part of the required curriculum, it would have a
better chance of being sustained over time. One mentor explained that right now the Programme “cannot be
sustainable . . . they [schools] accepted a programme with a beginning and an end, if it is not something from
the Ministry, part of their every week programme, I doubt it will be sustained.”174
275. In general, mentors had their doubts that the Programme will be sustainable. One mentor explained, “I am not
sure we increased the willingness, I have my doubts that after the programme ends that they will start to
function like they ordinarily do. Maybe some teachers will continue to use the instruments, but I have my
doubts.”175 Mentors felt that school staff need more structured time to implement the Programme, as two
years was not enough time.
172 The baseline study was conducted between October and December 2020, and it is not clear from the endline report as to
when the endline study was conducted; thus, the length of time between the baseline and endline reports are unknown.
173 During the finalization of this evaluation report, the UNICEF Programme Manager felt that it was important to mention that
the Programme provided flexibility to schools to choose on which elements they want to focus based upon the needs of each
school. This was a vision promoted by MoES at the design and implementation stages. Still, however, the Programme had a set
or minimum standards or package of activities which are outlined in the Mechanisms. Thus, the Programme aimed to provide
schools with practical tools that would help them to operationalize the Mechanisms.

55
276. Any effort to ensure sustainability of the Programme requires capacitating all school staff, and ‘winning their
hearts and minds’ and getting them to commit to implementing the Programme and teaching the Programme’s
curriculum. Any effort to ensure sustainability of the Programme also requires ongoing guidance and
mentorship for school staff to implement the Programme, and further Programme development to ensure
teachers have access to age- and grade-specific curriculum content for primary, middle and high school
students
6. CONCLUSIONS
277. The conclusions presented below are derived from the findings, and present a picture of the strengths and
limitations of the Programme, as it relates, in part to the Programme's objective of creating a whole school
approach to creating a safe school environment and to prevention school violence and bullying. The conclusions
are, in part, forward looking, particularly if MES intends to scale-up the Programme nationally.
278. Conclusion 1: This evaluation found that the Steps Together Programme was coherent and designed and
implemented specifically to support schools in their efforts to operationalize the Mechanism of Counteracting
Bullying and Violence in the Institutions of the Preschool and School Education System. The Mechanism offers a
policy framework for prevention and intervention against school violence and bullying, and which aims to assist
educational institutions in their efforts to create a safe education environment. The Programme focused on
providing each of the pilot schools and their staff with capacity building, technical assistance and tools to
implement the Mechanism (paragraphs 162-166 and 171).
279. Conclusion 2: The Programme’s objectives, strategies and activities were relevant and aligned with government
priorities, policies and reform agendas related to prevention and response to VAC, specifically school violence
and bullying. In particular, the Programme was in line with the National Development Programme Bulgaria 2030
and regional priorities identified in the Europe 2030 Strategy, European Commission Recommendation
"Investing in Children: Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage”, and the Council of Europe Strategy for the Rights
of the Child (2016-2021 and 2022-2027). The Programme was also aligned with the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development and UNICEF’s Country Programme Document 2018-2022 (paragraph 167).
280. Conclusion 3: The Programme was evidence-based and modeled after a similar programme, entitled ‘For a Safe
and Enabling Environment in Schools’ (SEES), which was designed and implemented In Croatia from 2003-2011,
with full support from UNICEF Croatia.176 The SEES Programme focused on prevention of peer violence and
bullying for a safe and enabling environment in schools. To support the SEES Programme, UNICEF Croatia
developed a handbook for teachers, school associates and principals involved in the development of the SEES
Programme. In 2015, the Handbook was published by UNICEF Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia and
has served as an evidence-based model for other schools in the region. UNICEF Bulgaria maintained that the
Steps Together Programme Handbook was adapted to reflect the Bulgarian context and needs of schools, such
as including a component on engaging students and parents (paragraphs 168-170).
281. Conclusion 4: The Programme was relevant because it was aligned with the needs of schools, and was
implemented in a way that enabled schools to focus on their identified needs, in cooperation with the school
mentor; however, there was a standard package of Programme materials and handbooks, and capacity building
trainings and technical assistance provided to schools of schools. The Programme was aligned with the needs
of schools as evidenced by school staff’s recognition that the Programme was relevant (paragraphs 171-178).
282. Conclusion 5: The Programme’s design and activities were appropriate for achieving the intended results and
outcomes; however, UNICEF and MES would benefit from reviewing and revising the Programme Document to
update it based upon lessons learned and plan for the future, and develop a proper ToC and to strengthen the
RMF. The ToC should include a clearly developed programme goal and related outcomes, outputs and
activities.177 The lack of a proper ToC may have hindered the Programme, and could have been used to
strengthen the RMF. Thus, any desire to scale-up the Programme should occur with a review and revision of
the Programme Document and the ToC and RMF (paragraphs 179-181)

Regional Office for the Central and Eastern Europe and its Commonwealth and independent State: Geneva, Switzerland.
177 The ToC included detailed indicators for monitoring outcomes and outputs
56
283. Conclusion 6: This evaluation found that in each of the pilot schools, the Programme was integrated into school
life to varying degrees, and the majority of respondents who were engaged with the Programme recognized
that the Programme was important to preventing school violence and bullying. On average, respondents ranked
the Programme as an 8.4 on a 10-point scale (1=not important to 10=very important). In general, school staff
appreciated the support provided by mentors to build their capacities to understand school violence and
bullying, and to implement good practices for developing a whole school approach that will help to implement
the Mechanism and prevent and respond to school violence and bullying, and to create a safe school
environment. This is despite the fact that pilot schools were unable to fully implement the Programme in its
entirety in the two-year period (paragraphs 182-190)
284. Conclusion 7: In terms of effectiveness, this evaluation found that the Programme achieved the planned
objectives; yet there were challenges and delays that occurred during implementation because of the COVID-
19 pandemic. Although most pilot schools described their schools as having a safe environment, with occasional
problems of aggression and bullying, some school staff tried to be more proactive and use prevention-related
activities from the Programme Handbook as a means to prevent school violence and bullying. They felt that
their efforts were paying off because they started to receive fewer alerts or tip-offs from parents and colleagues
about aggression and bullying (paragraphs 191-198).
285. Conclusion 8: The Programme included a number of practices to prevent school violence and bullying. Some
of these practices were more successful and readily accepted by school staff. For instance, establishing
classroom rules and values was one, and peer-to-peer initiatives, such as the peace makers, was another; both
of these practices were well received by pilot schools. Coordination councils saw the peace makers initiative as
innovative and fairly easy to implement. The restorative justice approach, however, which was meant to be a
cornerstone of the Programme, was more difficult for school staff to understand and implement. This, in part,
is because the educational system has a long-held tradition of imposing punitive sanctions on students who
violate school’s rules, which is in contrast to the concept of restorative justice (paragraphs 191-195).
286. Conclusion 9: In each of the pilot schools, the Programme reached its target groups and had an impact on the
targeted groups – school staff, students and parents – to varying degrees. The Programme fell short, however,
of creating a whole school approach in the pilot schools. This in part was because at the time the evaluation
was conducted, most pilot schools were in the early stages of introducing students and parents to the
Programme, because implementation was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and teachers were still
learning how to teach the Programme’s curriculum to students. In addition, teachers faced difficulties when it
came to finding time to integrate the Programme’s curriculum into their teaching. The number of courses that
form teachers could use to teach the Programme’s curriculum was limited each semester (paragraphs 200-209).
287. Conclusion 10: Many students, particularly at the middle and high school levels, thought the Programme had
little or no impact on changing students’ behaviours, particularly the behaviours of aggressive and bullying
students. There were, however, some students who thought the Programme helped to reduce some conflicts
among students, but more so among students who were not known troublemakers and did not have a
reputation of being aggressive or bullying. High school students seemed to be less interested in the Programme,
because they perceived the Programme’s content and materials to be more appropriate for younger students,
except for high students who were involved in the peace makers initiative (paragraphs 210-218).
288. Conclusion 11: It was more difficult to see the benefits of the Programme for parents because it was difficult
for school staff to engage parents in the Programme, including to identify one or two parents who were willing
to serve on the coordination council. Parents of children in primary, middle and high school grades were not
fully aware of the Programme, nor did they understand the Programme’s content. Nevertheless, many parents
believed that a Programme focused on creating a safe school environment and preventing school violence and
bullying is very important, but they want it to be substantive and to have a real impact (paragraphs 219-223).
289. Conclusion 12: Assessing the Programme’s impact after two years of piloting was not possible, nor was
assessing differences in impact among the five pilot schools because the COVID-19 pandemic delayed
implementation of the Programme and effected how the Programme was ultimately implemented, which was
different from initially planned (as already explained). Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
Programme, there was a shorter timeframe for Programme implementation; thus, it is too early to answer
evaluation questions related to the impact of the Programme in each of the five pilot schools. Also, given the
57
fact that the Programme was not implemented school-wide in any of the five pilot schools, the impacts are not
clear (paragraphs 224-225).
290. Conclusion 13: The Programme contributed to capacity building of schools to implement the Programme and
address school violence and bullying. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of these trainings were delivered
online in two- to three-hour training sessions; which was different from what was originally planned (i.e., face-
to-face trainings). This was a challenge for everyone involved in the Programme, as they were not accustomed
to delivering or receiving capacity building trainings online, and school staff were overwhelmed by online
teaching and distance learning, which was leading to burnout. Nevertheless, on average, school staff ranked
their level of satisfaction with the Programme as an 8.7 on a 10-point scale (1=not satisfied to 10=very satisfied)
(paragraph 226-240).
291. Conclusion 14: Programme implementation was negatively impacted by challenges and barriers, including:
difficulties findings time and space to teach the Programme’s curriculum; teachers did not feel comfortable
and/or confident teaching the Programme’s curriculum; not all teachers were motivated to implement the
Programme; school staff faced challenges engaging and communicating with parents; and many teachers’ held
negative attitudes toward parents and expressed an ‘us against them’ mentality (paragraphs 249-254).
292. Conclusion 15: This evaluation found that the Programme and its implementation was well planned and
managed. From start to finish, with the support of mentors, UNICEF tried to tailor implementation strategies
to each of the five pilot schools. Despite all of these efforts, there was still room for improvement. UNICEF was
able to adapt and change to meet the needs of each of the pilot schools, particularly during the COVID-19
pandemic; however, the pandemic significantly influenced the Programme’s implementation and made
engaging school staff and students more difficult as teachers were struggling to teach online and students’ were
having a difficult time with distance learning. Ultimately, UNICEF learned that two years was not enough time
to implement the Programme to the extent that it was able to change the culture in the pilot schools, and to
engage all of the school staff, students and parents. Nor was there enough time to really assess the
Programme’s impact or effectiveness, or to ensure sustainability over time. Schools need a longer period of
time to be capacitated to possess the knowledge, attitudes and practices needed to effectively implement the
Programme as a whole school approach, and the technical assistance of mentors. Each of the pilot schools
would benefit from an additional two years of piloting the Programme (paragraphs 255-267)
293. Conclusion 16: This evaluation found limited evidence that the Programme will be sustainable after only two-
years of implementation; more time is needed for Implementaiton. There were challenge and barriers to
Programme implementation that need to be addressed for the Programme to be sustainable. This includes:
revisions and enhancement to Programme-related materials; strengthening the capacities of school staff to
implement the Programme as a whole school approach, in cooperation with students and parents; and ongoing
technical assistance of mentors (paragraphs 272-276).
294. It is notable that there were no unexpected or unintended findings, either results or impacts, documented
during this evaluation.
7. LESSONS LEARNED
295. There were several lessons learned to consider if there are plans going forward to scale-up the Programme,
and could be relevant in other countries where there are plans to implement school-based programmes
focused on preventing school violence and bullying. Lessons learned include:
a. For the Programme to be properly and effectively implemented, school principals need to be committed
to the Programme and the whole school approach to Programme implementation. In keeping, school
principals need to serve as role models to school staff and communicate and demonstrate their
commitment to the Programme, and ensure that all school staff are capacitated to implement the
Programme.
b. School principals need to delegate some responsibilities for coordination and implementation of the
Programme to school staff, particularly coordination councils and teachers who are committed to the
58
Programme.178 The Programme’s success depends, in part, on coordination councils willingness to
implement the Programme and apply the Mechanism.
c. In Bulgaria, educational institutions and school staff are slow to change their approaches to engaging with
and teaching students, and addressing anti-social and behavioural problems of students; thus, efforts to
‘win the hearts and minds’ of school staff to implement the Programme requires significant capacity
building and technical assistance, a demonstration of results, and proper allocations of time in weekly
teaching schedules.
d. The majority of school staff need to be properly capacitated and mentored to implement the Programme
and to work together as a team to implement the Programme as a whole school approach. A whole school
approach will increase the responsibility and engagement of all school staff in the Programme, including
school principals, coordination councils, psychologists and teachers, as well as students and parents.
Schools need school staff who are willing to champion the Programme.
e. School staff need to work with students of all grades, including those who are well-behaved and perform
well in school, and those who tend to act aggressively and bully other students and teachers, to create a
safe school environment and to prevent school violence and bullying,.
f. Both school staff and parents need capacity building and technical assistance to learn how to work together
to ensure school environments are safe, and to prevent and address school violence and bullying. This
requires breaking down the ‘us versus them’ mentality held by school staff, and strengthening partnerships
and collaboration among school staff and parents.
g. Programme Handbooks need to be age- and grade-specific to ensure that the curriculum and activities are
relevant to students of all grades and ages. To accomplish this, Programme curriculum needs to advance
with each grade and be transformative in ways that promotes social and emotional learning, and action for
change to end school violence and bullying.
h. Mentors need to exist outside of the school and not be subordinate to the school principals. By being
outside of the school, mentors are able to take an independent perspective and provide recommendations
and guidance, without being constrained or influenced by school principals. By being independent, mentors
could ensure that school staff have a safe space to discuss challenges or issues that they are facing in the
classroom and/or with particular students and colleagues, with confidence that the discussions will be held
in confidence.
8. RECOMMENDATIONS
296. The recommendations that follow are based upon findings, conclusions and lessons learned from this
evaluation, and were discussed with UNICEF CO and MES staff, as well as school staff during data collection in
the field. Recommendations have also been guided by good practices identified during previous efforts to
implement and evaluate school- and curriculum-based initiatives aimed at preventing and responding to
violence and bullying in schools. The level of participation of UNICEF CO and MES staff, and school staff in
helping to formulate recommendations was not in proportion to their level of participation in the intervention
or this evaluation. At the time of this evaluation, UNICEF and MES no longer had a reference group convened;
thus, there was not reference group engaged in the formulation of the recommendations.
297. Recommendations presented below aim to TOR, focused on providing recommendations for the process of
institutionalizing and scaling up the Programme nationally and actions that need to be taken to ensure quality
and sustainable implementation of the Programme in the future. Following the recommendations is a
prioritization and classification of each recommendation based upon urgency, impact and difficulty is provided
(Table 11 ).
8.1. Strengthen National Mechanisms to Address School Violence and Bullying
298. Recommendation 1: UNICEF should support MES and the Expert Group to review and revise the Mechanism
of Counteracting Bullying and Violence in the Institutions of the Preschool and School Education System to
strengthen the Mechanism and their implementation. This evaluation found that In the pilot schools,
178 During the finalization of this evaluation report, the UNICEF Programme Coordinator stressed that it depends on the
leadership style of the school principal. In the Programme, mentors observed in some pilot schools school principals over
delegated Programme responsibilities of the school principal to a few active and experienced teachers who were also engaged
in other school programmes; as a result, these teachers soon burnt out or shifted their focus away from the Programme and
only to implementing their formal duties.
59
coordination councils recognized that the Programme made it easier to recognize violence and helped to make
members of the coordination councils more aware of the Mechanism. Coordination council members also
pointed out that the Programme’s methodology provided them with better approaches to resolving school
violence and bullying. There were some coordination council members who thought that the Programme is
actually better than the official Mechanism. Some respondents even felt that the MES needs to reform the
Mechanism to align with the Steps Together Programme to be more meaningful (paragraphs 162-166). Based
upon these findings, the Mechanism should be reviewed and revised for purposes of strengthening the policy
framework for addressing school violence and bullying in schools, and working with child victims, witnesses and
perpetrators of school violence and bullying.
8.2. Strengthen Steps Together Programme Materials
299. Recommendation 2: UNICEF should support the MES and the Expert Group to review and revise Steps
Together Programme materials. This evaluation found that school staff and mentors perceived that the
Programme materials were relevant, but that the Programme Handbook was too childish for middle and high
school students and does not reflect the diversity of experiences of ethnic minorities. Thus, the Programme
does not speak to or resonate with older students, nor does it resonate with ethnic minority students in ways
that promotes inclusivity. School staff also found that the Programme Handbook. Another limitation of the
Programme Handbook was that it was modeled after the SEES Programme Handbook that had been developed
nearly a decade earlier, so school staff from the pilot schools felt the Programme Handbook’s content and
activities were outdated and needed to be revised and developed to reflect children and adolescents of today,
particularly since there have been many technological and development changes, and a global pandemic, that
has reshaped the national context and shaped the lives of children and adolescents.
300. Based upon these findings, it would be best to have separate handbooks and curriculum for primary, middle
and high school students. The Programme should have a curriculum that advances in terms of content and
activities from grades 1-12. In keeping with lessons learned, Programme Handbooks need to be age- and grade-
specific to ensure that the curriculum and activities are relevant to students of all grades and ages. To
accomplish this, Programme curriculum needs to advance with each grade and be transformative in ways that
promotes social and emotional learning, and action for change to end school violence and bullying. There are
lessons to be learned from the UN Women-supported Voices Against Violence Handbook179 on how to develop
age-specific educational curriculum focused on preventing and responding to violence, including gender-based
violence, and to make the curriculum action-based. Programme Handbooks would benefit from also
strengthening content related to gender-based violence in the Programme Handbook and curriculumy.
301. The Programme Handbook should also be reviewed and revised to ensure that they are contemporary,
reflecting children and adolescents of today. It would be a good to engage a team of mentors and school staff
from the pilot schools to provide input and guidance during the review and revision processes. It would also be
important to make sure that ethnic minority educators are engaged to ensure that revised Programme
materials promote inclusivity of ethnic minority students and cultural diversity. It would also be beneficial to
include content that supports inclusivity of children with disabilities.
302. Recommendation 3: UNICEF and MES should consider developing a full-package of ‘how-to videos’ for school
staff on how to roll out various components of the Programme. This evaluation found that school staff need
more resources that will help them to understand the Programme and how to implement the Programme,
including teaching Programme-related activities from the Programme Handbook. During the evaluation, the
evaluator explored teacher’s interest in having a full-package of ‘how to videos’ that would help to build their
capacities and show them how to roll out various components of the Programme, such how to teach different
programme-related activities in the classroom, how to speak to student about school violence and bullying, and
how to effectively communicate with parents in different scenarios. Teachers expressed interest in having
access to such materials. Thus, it is recommended that UNICEF and MES should consider developing a full-
package of ‘how-to videos’ for school staff on how to roll out and implement various components of the
Programme. Such videos can be based upon a combination lecture and role play that provides vary practical
guidance on how to implement various components of the Programme effectively and properly. These how-to

curriculum (wagggs.org)
60
videos can be made part of a resources package of materials for school staff and is available online at the Steps
Together Programme website.
303. Recommendation 4: UNICEF and MES should work together to develop a proper ToC and RMF for the Steps
Together Programme. This evaluation found that the Programme lacked a clear and comprehensive ToC and
had a RMF that had an ambitious and remarkable number of outcomes and activities which UNICEF and MES
were focused on accomplishing; the RMF for the Programme was largely activities driven and not aligned with
a ToC. If UNICEF plans to continue to invest in the Steps Together Programme and support MES to scale-up the
Programme to all schools in Bulgaria, UNICEF and MES should work together to develop a clear and
comprehensive ToC for the Programme. The ToC should have clearly identified components and a causal chain
of high-level changes, along with intermediate changes will help to guide the way forward for both UNICEF and
MES. A well-developed ToC would help to support the change process and key priorities, and to identify
assumptions, risks and bottlenecks that may hinder progress toward planned changes and change strategies,
and would need to be mitigated (Annex Q: UNICEF Reporting on Programme-Related Indicators). Once a clear
and comprehensive ToC is developed, a new RMF should be developed that is aligned with the ToC, and not so
activities driven. UNICEF and MES should use this as an opportunity to Integrate gender and inclusivity into the
ToC and RMF, and baseline and monitoring and reporting tools.
304. UNICEF should contract a technical expert who can provide UNICEF and MES the support needed to develop a
proper ToC and RMF to support the scale-up of the Steps Together Programme. The technical expert should
also have the expertise needed to develop proper baseline, monitoring and reporting tools and results-based
monitoring guidance to support the scale-up of the Programme. The ToC, RMF and related tools and guidance
should also address issues of gender and inclusivity, which was lacking in the pilot for the Steps Together
Programme. It would be important that the technical expert have expertise in school-based violence prevention
programming, gender-based violence, transformative education and child development. They should also have
a background in development contexts developing ToCs and RMFs, as well as baseline, monitoring and
reporting tools and results-based management guidance.
305. There are also several documents that UNICEF and MES use to proceed with developing a proper ToC and RMF,
and integrate gendering and inclusivity into programming.

8.3. Strengthen Efforts to Implement the Steps Together Programme
306. Recommendation 5: UNICEF and MES should continue to support the pilot schools in their efforts to
implement the Steps Together Programme for an additional two-years, particularly the pilot schools that are
committed to strengthening their capacities to implement the Programme properly and effectively. This
evaluation found that the Programme was integrated to varying degrees in each of the pilot schools, however,
none of the pilot schools were able to fully implement the Programme in the two-year period. At this stage, the
Programme’s sustainability is limited in each of the pilot schools because they have not had enough time,
commitment or buy-in from the majority of school staff to implement the Programme as originally envisioned,
i.e., as a whole school approach. Moreover, not all school staff felt that they had been capacitated enough to
understand how to implement the Programme; in part, this is because the Programme was interrupted by the
COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, teachers felt that they were not provided enough time in the school day to
teach the Programme’s curriculum, because of the mandatory curriculum. For these reasons, the pilot schools
would benefit from another two years of support to implement the Programme and to ensure more
components of the Programme are sustainable. If UNICEF and MES decided to longer continue to support
61
Programme implementing in the five pilot schools, these schools will most likely not continue to implement the
Programme or to scale up the Programme as a whole school approach as originally envisioned.
307. Recommendation 6: UNICEF and MES should develop a plan to ensure the sustainability of mentors
as a component of the Steps Together Programme. This evaluation found that mentors are a key
component of the Steps Together Programme. Each pilot school was assigned a mentor, which was
capacitated by UNICEF to provide school staff with capacity building and technical assistance to
implement the Programme. Pilot schools typically had weekly and/or monthly online sessions with their
mentors which they found to be extremely helpful because the Programme brought a new way of working
with a whole school approach to prevent and respond to school violence and bullying. School staff recognized
and appreciated the support provided by mentors. School staff appreciated the support, advice and guidance
that they received from mentors, such as helping them to see and understand problems or issues with students
and parents from a different perspective. School staff also felt they were able to share with their mentors
concerns and challenges, and mentors helped them to understand their role and how they can address and
overcome challenges encountered with students and parents, and specific actions to take when violence and/or
bullying occurs. In this way, mentors were an important component of the Steps Together Programme.
308. If UNICEF plans to continue to invest in the Steps Together Programme to support MES to scale up the Steps
Together Programme to all schools in Bulgaria, UNICEF and MES should work together to develop a plan to
ensure the mentors component of the Programme is sustainable. This requires developing a job description or
Terms or Reference for mentors, defining mandatory qualifications for mentors, defining the selection process,
defining mandatory induction and in-service training requirements and supervision.
309. Recommendation 7: UNICEF and MES should develop a plan for a phased scale-up of the Steps Together
Programme to all schools in Bulgaria, with a model that aims to roll out the Programme to schools that have
school principals and at least 50-60 percent of school staff who are committed to implementing the
Programme. This evaluation revealed that It is too early to scale-up the Programme to all schools in Bulgaria;
rather, it would be best to develop a plan for a staged scale-up which entails adding more and more schools
each year. At this stage, the focus should be on identifying at least five to ten additional schools that are
interested in being part of a larger cohort of schools that are implementing the Steps Together Programme. To
be part of the scale-up, schools must demonstrate their commitment to implementing the Programme. This
should include willingness and commitment of the school principal and deputy principal in the school, and at
least 50-60 percent of school staff to implement the Programme and a whole school approach to creating a
safe school environment and preventing school violence and bullying. This should include a commitment to
participate in a series of Programme-related capacity building activities and to receive technical assistance from
a mentor, as well as to learn from the other pilot schools. The Programme should not be rolled out to schools
with no or limited expressed interest in implementing the Programme.
310. Recommendation 8: MES should consider setting up a Step Together Programme Training Camp for School
Staff that engages school principals, coordination councils, school psychologists and teachers. This evaluation
found that although school staff in each of the pilot schools were capacitated by UNICEF and mentors to
implement the Programme, not all school staff were confident using the Programme Handbook or teaching the
Programme’s curriculum to students, and some school staff resisted the Programme. This evaluation also found
that In Bulgaria, educational institutions and school staff are slow to change their approaches to engaging with
and teaching students, and addressing anti-social and behavioural problems of students. Thus, brining changes
to practices and processes can be slow and meet with resistant.
311. Thus, efforts to implement the Programme in schools and ensure sustainability requires ‘winning the hearts
and minds’ of school staff to implement the Programme. The majority of school staff need to be properly
capacitated and mentored to implement the Programme, and to work together as a team to implement the
Programme as a whole school approach. A whole school approach will increase the responsibility and
engagement of all school staff in the Programme, including school principals, coordination councils,
psychologists and teachers, as well as students and parents. Schools need school staff who are willing to
champion the Programme, and school staff need to see the positive outcomes of the Programme.
312. To accomplish this MES should consider setting up a Steps Together Programme Training Camp for School Staff
that would strengthen teacher’s capacities to understand the Programme and how to effectively implement
62
the Programme, and to teach the Programme’s curriculum to students. This recommendation was introduced
to school staff in four of the five pilot schools during the evaluation to gauge their interest in such an initiative
as part of the Programme and for purposes of capacity building. The majority of school staff thought that the
Step Together Programme Training Camp for School Staff was a good idea and expressed interest in the
opportunity to attend such a camp to strengthen their knowledge and capacities to implement the Programme
and build a whole school approach, as well as to network with other schools implementing the Programme.
Teachers felt that engaging school directors in the camp, alongside teachers and psychologists, would help to
strengthen commitment to the Programme throughout the school. Teachers also expressed interest in helping
to facilitate sessions so that new schools could learn from the pilot schools.
313. A Steps Together Programme Training Camp for School Staff should be established by MES which can serve as
a training centre for school staff. The Training Camp should be a place where school staff come together and
receive structured capacity building trainings from Programme experts and technical assistance from mentors
on how to implement the Steps Together Programme. The Training Camp should be offered on an annual basis
and school staff from schools selected to implement the Programme, including from the original five pilot
schools, should be invited to attend the Training Camp. The Training Camp should be should be a prestigious
training camp that allows participants to receive a certificate of completion. The training camp should be a five-
day, all-inclusive training camp where school staff come together to learn about the Programme and how to
implement the Programme in their schools, and learn how to teach the curriculum to students of different ages
and to implement the peace makers initiative, how to effectively engage and communicate with students and
parents, and more. The training camp should be highly interactive and engaging, and use an adult learning
model and a variety of approaches to provide school staff with opportunities to ‘learn by doing and through
practice’, coupled with instruction. School staff need to learn practical and technical skills on how to develop a
whole school approach, and to work in teams to prevent and respond to school violence and bullying. The Steps
Together Programme Training Camp for School Staff should be a requirement for a cadre of school staff from
schools that have expressed an interest and commitment to implementing the Steps Together Programme.
Over time, school staff who have been trained and become champions of the Programme can also help to train
other school staff during the training camp.
314. Recommendation 9: MES should develop a community of practice of school staff engaged in implementing
the Steps Together Programme to strengthen their capacities and commitment to implement the Steps
Together Programme, and to learn from each other. This evaluation found that school staff from the pilot
schools appreciated when they had opportunities to engage with school staff from other pilot schools to learn
from each other as to how the Programme was being implemented. Even within schools, school staff
appreciated have a school-based community of practices where school staff in a particular school were able to
come together and receive capacity building trainings and develop plans to implement the Programme, and
address challenges face and possible solutions. At the school level, mentors were important to the community
of practice.
315. Given the desire for and benefits of a community of practice among school staff engaged in implementing the
Steps together Programme, MES should develop a platform to establish a community of practice and organized
exchanges at the national level to support school staff from across schools to strengthen their capacities and
commitments to implement the Steps Together Programme, and to learn from each other and share
experiences and approaches. At the national level, the community of practice can be formulated and emerge
out of the Steps Together Programme Training Camp for School Staff, and be encouraged through an online
social media platform, and an annual Steps Together Programme conference. This requires a budget to support
a national community of practices for the Steps Together Programme.
316. School staff should also be encouraged and supported with technical assistance and a budget to have a school-
based community of practices in which school principals, coordination council members, school psychologists
and teachers can strengthen their work as a team, and learn from each other as they implement the Steps
Together Programme. By strengthening cooperation between and among school staff and schools, through a
community of practice, the Steps Together Programme will become a larger movement among educators in
Bulgaria, particularly those who take pride in career development and advancement.
63
8.4. Strengthen the Steps Together Programme to Work with Aggressive and Bullying Students
317. Recommendation 10: UNICEF and MES should integrate into the Steps Together Programme approaches for
school staff to work with at-risk and high-risk students with behavioral problems and provide individualized
intervention plans that serve to help the student understand the harm they are causing to other students
and the disruptive environment they are creating in the school. This evaluation found that students and
parents felt that the Steps Together Programme had done little to address the behaviours of aggressive and
bullying students. The Steps Together Programme offers a primary prevention curriculum and whole school
approach, but lacks secondary and tertiary interventions that aim to address at-risk and high-risk students
problem behaviours. Thus, UNICEF and MES should integrate into the Steps Together Programme and
Mechanisms guidance and approaches for working with at-risk and high-risk students.
318. Secondary interventions are designed to
provide more targeted interventions,
instruction, and support to at-risk students to At-risk students – students that demonstrate low

positive effects from secondary intervention
for at-risk students.180
319. High-risk students who require tertiary interventions require a support team, including their parents/caregiver,
teachers, school psychologists, coordination councils and school principals. In most cases, high-risk students
also require referrals to non-school sector agencies/organizations, such as child protection authorities and
community-based services providers who specialize in working with vulnerable children and their families. The
student and his/her parents should also be required to meet with the Coordination Council on a bi-weekly basis
to review the student’s progress in participating in and meeting the requirement of the tertiary intervention
plan, and discuss any successes and/or continued problems.
8.5. Scale-up the Steps Together Programme
320. Recommendation 11: MES should develop a plan to phase-in and make mandatory the Steps Together
Programme curriculum in primary, middle and high schools. This evaluation found that school staff,
particularly teachers, complained that they faced challenges finding time and space to teach the Programme’s
curriculum. In fact, some teachers reported they did not teach the curriculum because they did not have
enough time; they needed more class time to share and discuss the subject matter with students. To overcome
this challenge, MES should develop a plan to phase-in and make mandatory teaching the Steps Together
Programme in primary, middle and high schools, at least once every two weeks. This, however, cannot occur
until MES has developed age- and grade-specific Programme Handbooks (see Recommendation 2). Once age-
and grade-specific Programme Handbooks are available and school staff have been properly training to
implement the Programme (see Recommendation 8), then they should be mandated to teach the Steps
Together curriculum in their schools. This, however, requires a plan that phases-in mandatory teaching of the
Programme’s curriculum.
321. Recommendation 12: Conduct a costing for the scale-up of the Steps Together Programme. It was beyond
the scope of this evaluation to conduct a costing analysis or cost comparisons for the Steps Together
180 Resources: Center on PBIS | Tier 2; Help Your At-Risk Students Succeed: 3 Strategies for Motivation | UMass
Global; Prevention and Early Intervention | Youth.gov
64
Programme. If, however, MES has plans to scale-up the Steps Together Programme, they needs to conduct a
proper costing study for the scale-up. A costing study should focus on estimated the costs of scaling up the
Programme for MES and the costs of Programme implementation for schools. The costing study could also
estimate the costs of not scaling up or implementing the Steps Together Programme in terms of costs of school
violence and bullying on children’s learning and development.

1. CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND
General context
Violence against children includes emotional and physical abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, sexual
exploitation and abuse. It occurs in homes and families, schools, care and justice systems, workplaces and
communities. Perpetrators include parents, family members, teachers, caretakers, law enforcement
authorities and other children.
Many children do not feel protected in school. Globally, more than one third of all children aged between
13 and 15 say that they are regularly a subject of violence or bullying at school1. This is why the sustainable
development goals put on the global agenda ending violence against children and its sustainable
prevention. There is clear evidence of the harm of violence on physical and mental health and children's
development, on their ability to learn and build relationships with others, to become fully functional
adults and parents. School bullying and insecure school environments are one of the reasons for early drop
out of the education system, reduced attendance, poor student performance, and have significant socio-
economic effects as education is key for the personal and professional realization of individuals and for
the prosperity of societies.
According to the study on the health and behaviour of school aged children (HBSC)2 students in Bulgaria
are among the top ten out of 43 surveyed countries affected by the problem of school bullying. Data from
the MES shows around 8000 cases of different forms of violence are registered in schools annually. A study
of the views of

Bulgarian children on important areas of their life4, conducted by UNICEF and the State Agency for Child
Protection, also confirms that violence, in particular school violence, is as a major problem for children and
adolescents. The different forms of aggression, violence and bullying, are identified as one of the four major
problems faced by children in Bulgaria together with poverty, the easy access to drugs, alcohol and cigarettes,
and the low quality of education.
Schools, on the other hand, are recognized as an important space where children, teachers and education
personnel can learn and adopt pro-social behaviours that can contribute to preventing violence within the
school and in the community.
In April 2017, MES initiated the development of a cross-sectoral Action Plan which aims at prevention of
violence and building safety in schools. The measures include provision of psychologists and pedagogical
councillors, targeted trainings of teachers, introduction of in- class and after school activities for prevention
of violence. There has been a revision of the State Standard on Inclusive Education with regards to the cases
of bullying and violence in schools.
A Mechanism for combatting bullying and violence in educational institutions has been introduced in the
education system5 to support educational institutions in their efforts to create a safe school environment.
Its introduction implies the understanding that real progress in addressing violence and bullying can only be
achieved by implementing a coherent and purposeful policy that is shared and implemented by all actors in
the education process. The document introduces the necessary measures to create a safe school
environment in the understanding of social-ecological model and a whole-school approach to prevention
and intervention on violence. Each institution in the system of pre-school and school education is obliged to:
• Set up a coordination council which is responsible for planning, monitoring and coordinating efforts to
tackle violence and bullying.
• Assess and analyse the situation with a view to educating the school community on the topic of violence,
but also revealing prevalence of certain forms and measures taken so far.
• Based on the assessment, plan / update prevention and intervention activities at both institution and
group/ class level.
Despite the existence of a unified framework that lays the foundation for a safe school environment, it
appears that educational institutions need support for its effective implementation and enforcement. One
of the weaknesses of the approaches so far is that they are adult-oriented, and that children and adolescents
are not active participants. Empowering them as equal participants in improving the school climate is an
approach that also contributes to their development as responsible and independent individuals.
Additionally, the role of parents as part of the school community needs to be strengthened and pedagogues
need support for their role in the prevention process.
UNICEF role
UNICEF Bulgaria is in the last year of implementation of the Country Programme for the period 2018-2022.
The overall goal of the country partnership is to support Bulgaria in its efforts to enable all children and
adolescents in the country, including the most disadvantaged, to enjoy their rights and develop to their full
potential in an inclusive and protective society. The realization of the right of every child to live free from
violence, abuse, exploitation and harmful practices is a cross-cutting element throughout the country
partnership in the period 2018 – 2022.

5 The document has been introduced in 2012 and its latest update was in December 2017.
71
In June 2019 an expert group was established within the MES to develop the program intervention based on
a whole-school approach which addresses violence and bullying in schools. The main goal of the programme
is to raise the awareness, commitment and capacity of the entire school community to prevent and tackle
school violence. Theory of change model was developed to explain how the activities are envisaged to
contribute to results of the Program Detailed indicators for monitoring outcomes and outputs are included
in the model.
The program builds on the whole-school approach, a social-ecological model to addressing the problem.
Under this approach violence is looked at as social phenomenon with drivers on several levels (individually,
interpersonally-the class, the school and the local community). Tackling the problem requires a response on
each level, as well as from every participant in the school community (students, pedagogical and non-
pedagogical staff, principals and parents). Key components of the programme are:
• assessing the school environment and creating a school commitment to prevention work;
• raising awareness and knowledge on the issue;
• training of principals and coordination committees in the whole-school approach;
• ongoing support and training of teachers on effective classroom management and communication with
parents;
• strengthening the school community through student and parent participation and other mechanisms;
• creating a student peer-to-peer support group and installing the restoration of value approach.
The Program was implemented in five pilot schools for 3 school years (one preparatory 2019- 2020 and two
full school years of implementation 2020 – 2022). The schools` selection was completed in two phases: 1)
pre-selection of 13 schools through a questionnaire and 2) discussions with children, school staff and parents
to explore their readiness and motivation to join the Programme.
Evidence and knowledge generated through the application of the approach and the implementation of the
different components will inform the national policy framework on violence prevention and child protection
in the education and will support the development of training packages and modules on the topic.
II. PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION
The purpose of the evaluation of the Program on Prevention of Violence and Bullying in School “Steps
Together” (The Program) is to lead to improvement of the structure, implementation, and quality of the
Program, and eventually to ensure its national scale up and sustainability through its legal and administrative
institutionalization and state budgeting.
The key target of the evaluation will be UNICEF CO and Ministry of Education and Science (МЕS) and pilot
schools of the Program.
It is planned the evaluation to be supported by a Reference Group, consisting of representatives of the
Ministry of Education and Science, State Agency for Child Protection, Council of Children to the State Agency
for Child Protection, Ombudsman, school principals, school psychologists and pedagogical councilors and
teachers and other stakeholders as per nomination by the MES. The group will support and oversee the
evaluation process, as well as will review the findings and recommendations.
III. EVALUATION OBJECTIVES
To conduct an independent evaluation of the model and components of the Program and their impact on
the school environment and levels of violence and bullying in five pilot schools in Sofia, Teteven, Kustendil,
Iskar and Zavet.
72
The evaluation is both formative and summative in nature - the overall evaluation should bring an
understanding and improvement of the process and also on whether the Program works.
The specific objectives will be:
• Assess and evaluate the Program, its implementation, relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, coherence
and sustainability and, to the extent possible, its impact on teachers, children and parents.
• Assess the Program’s equity and child rights perspective both in terms of the capacities to reach out to
and deliver support for prevention of violence and bullying in school and ensure safe school environment.
• Identify the enablers and challenges for institutionalizing and upscaling the Program nationally.
• To examine the integration of the Program into the school life and school management in pilot schools
in Sofia, Teteven, Kustendil, Iskar and Zavet.
• To examine the impact of the Program on the operationalization in schools of the Mechanism for
Countering Bullying and Violence in the Institutions in the System of Preschool and School Education.
• Provide recommendations for the process of institutionalizing and scaling up of the Program nationally
and for actions to ensure its quality and sustainable implementation in the future.
The provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the Concluding observations to
Bulgaria, and the other key human rights documents should guide the process of the evaluation, together
with design of the methodology, implementation and analysis of results. The evaluation should also be
designed and carried out to assess the equity dimensions of the interventions, as well as gender equality.
IV. EVALUATION SCOPE
The evaluation will focus on the five pilot schools, where the Program is implemented with UNICEF and
Ministry of Education and Science support and will cover the period September 2019 – present.
Geographical coverage of the evaluation includes the pilot schools in Sofia, Teteven, Kustendil, Iskar and
Zavet. The evaluation shall include the perspective and views of all relevant stakeholders: Ministry of
Education and Science; school principals, school psychologists and pedagogical counsellors, teachers,
children, parents, who benefited from the Program; UNICEF team – mentors of schools, Education Program
Director, Coordinator of the Program, mentors and Consultant on VAC who supported the mentor’s team,
Consultant leading the component for work with parents.
The Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA), equity and gender equality and mainstreaming approaches also
need to be assessed. Particular attention should be paid to exploring equity dimensions of the intervention.
For UNICEF equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop, and reach their full
potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. Equity-based evaluation provides assessments of what
works and what does not work to reduce inequity, and it highlights intended and unintended results for the
most vulnerable groups as well as the inequalities in the outcomes for vulnerable children and families. To
the extent possible access to quality support and outcomes for different subgroups of vulnerable children
and families should be explored in the evaluation (based on ethnicity, residence, setting –
institutional/family, gender, disability, etc.) and the groups least reached identified.
V. EVALUATION FRAMEWORK AND QUESTIONS
The evaluation will assess the Program in terms of the following criteria: relevance to the child rights and
equity agenda, effectiveness, efficiency, relevance to national priorities/context and needs, coherence,
sustainability, and impact (as defined by OECD/DAC).
73
Below are given indicative questions to guide the evaluation but the Consultant may further expand and
refine them during the inception phase in consultation with UNICEF and implementing partners and the
Reference Group. The need of assessment of relevant human rights, equity and gender equality aspects
should be considered while formulating the questions. Local dimension (with respect to the five towns, where
the Program is implemented) should be explored as well.
Relevance: Questions should include but not limit to:

and Gender Equality will be addressed across the evaluation questions or, if required, developed as specific
points as per United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Guidance on Integrating human-rights and gender
equality in evaluation (see link below) and complies with the organization’s commitment to gender
mainstreaming as expressed in the Policy on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Girls6.
VI. METHODOLOGY AND PHASES
The evaluation will follow internationally agreed evaluation criteria of relevance, efficiency, effectiveness,
impact, and sustainability.
Mixed method approach will be applied in the evaluation combining qualitative and quantitative
components to ensure complementary strengths and non-overlapping weaknesses. The analysis is expected
to build on information collected from variety of sources through different methods including review of
administrative data, primary data collection from government representatives, monitoring of the Program,
pilot schools and others. It should critically examine the information gathered and synthesize it in an
objective manner. If contradictory information is obtained from different stakeholders, an effort should be
made to understand the reasons for such information, including any gender-based differences.
The evaluation should be participatory involving beneficiaries of the Program and representatives of the
target groups. Methods, data collection tools and analysis should build on a human rights and child rights
approach and should be gender and culturally sensitive.
76
The evaluation results will be validated with national partners and key stakeholders.
Inception Phase: The first step of the evaluation process will be the inception phase during which the
Consultant will develop an evaluation framework, methodology, sources of information (including
stakeholders to be involved) and data collection tools based on the TOR. For each of the questions and sub-
questions, the Consultant will develop indicators to inform the responses and identify the corresponding
means of verification. In addition, the Consultant will assess potential limitations to the evaluation work and
the availability and reliability of data. During the inception phase the Consultant will also examine any ethical
issues that may arise and propose appropriate mitigation strategies.
A Desk Review of relevant studies’ reports and if necessary, laws, policies and strategies, Program
documentation (Program description, schedule, base-line research on the levels of violence and bullying and
the environment in schools, participating in the Program, mid-term assessment of the Program, final
research on the levels of violence and bullying and the environment in schools participating in the Program,
summaries of feedbacks of students (1-4 grade), electronic feedbacks from teachers and students (5-12
grade) from Workshops, other). The necessary documentation related to the Program will be provided by
UNICEF and the respective local partners in English and in Bulgarian languages.
Primary data collection: Primary data will be collected at school level – in the five pilot schools, through in-
depth, semi-structured interviews and/or individual face to face interviews/questionnaires and/or focus
group discussions (depending on the methodology of the Consultant). The aim of primary data collection is
to explore the opinions of school principals, school psychologists and pedagogical counsellors, teachers,
children, parents in pilot schools in Sofia, Teteven, Kustendil, Iskar and Zavet, who benefited from the
Program; UNICEF team – mentors of the schools, Education Program Director, Coordinator of the Program,
mentors and Consultant on VAC who supported the mentors’ team, Consultants on implementing the
component for work with the parents and the Ministry of Education and Science. Primary data collection
from pilot schools need to include in any case opinions of principals/deputy principals and pedagogical
counsellors and opinions of teachers, parents and children from all educational levels in the relevant schools.
Data collection tools are subject to UNICEF ethical review. The Consultant should ensure that the
methodology allows for exploring the views of representatives of different stakeholders: representatives of
the MЕS, UNICEF team – mentors of schools, Program Director Education, the Program coordinator and the
consultant on VAC, representatives of the target group. In addition, evaluation data on and from Program
beneficiaries with different socio-economic, ethnic and residence (urban/rural) profile should be collected
as well to assess equity dimensions of the interventions. The methodology and data collection tools should
also consider language difficulties experienced by some ethnic groups whose mother tongue is not Bulgarian
(Turkish and Roma).
The possibility to use electronically administered questionnaires should be considered if applicable.
Data analysis and report writing: the process will start at the inception phase when the Consultant will
propose a detailed methodology and the structure of the final report. Data analysis will progress
simultaneously with the desk review and the data collection. Inception report and draft final report will be
reviewed by UNICEF CO and national stakeholders as well as an external quality review company. Consultant
will incorporate the received comments and submit the final report to UNICEF Bulgaria.
General considerations: The methodology of the evaluation should be in line with the United Nations
Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards. UNEG Norms and Standards and UN Evaluation Policy. The
Methodology and data collection tools are subject to UNICEF ethical review.

Data/information sources:
Official state institutions, pilot schools and UNICEF are the main sources of data and information for the
purposes of the evaluation and are therefore considered reliable and of sufficient quality. Disaggregated
data (based on ethnicity, socio-economic status, gender, disability, etc.) may not always be available through
the official sources and the Program sources.
Available documentation:
• Program documentation – Program descriptions and initial and updated schedules, base-line and final
research on the levels of violence and bullying and the environment in pilot schools, mid-term
assessment of Program implementation;
• MoUs, related to the Program;
• National strategic and policy documents in the area of violence prevention and response.
• Statistical data of the Ministry of Education and Science for the school years 2019/2020 - 2021/2022.
• UNICEF VAC study
• Any other studies, assessments and relevant documents available or that may be provided by the
partners.
• CPD 2018 – 2022.
• Mission Reports from MES from monitoring visits in schools
All needed documents in English and in Bulgarian, together with a contact list of key stakeholders whose
views should be taken into consideration, will be provided to the Consultant once a contractual agreement
has been made.
Limitations of the evaluation
An evaluability assessment with all the partners hasn’t been conducted. However, despite some data gaps
there is available information to conduct a formative evaluation. Data sources being different from country
to country, trends analysis will be preferred over comparison.
The level of disaggregation of available data and the quality of data provided by the monitoring of the Program
may not be sufficient to assess equity dimension. This limitation can be addressed by ensuing the
participation of the most vulnerable families in the evaluation process through appropriate data collection
methods and tools.
Not all documents related to the programme implementation and monitoring are at UNICEF disposal and
are available in English, particularly MES records and internal reports.
End of school year is end of June 2022 which should be taken into consideration when planning the data
gathering processes, particularly surveys and interviews with school staff and students.
VII. TENTATIVE WORK PLAN AND EVALUATION MANAGEMENT
The evaluation will take place over the period May 2022 – October 2022 and will include the following
activities, for a total up to 40 consultancy days. The Consultant will be supported for data collection and other

1. CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND
General context
Violence against children includes emotional and physical abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, sexual
exploitation and abuse. It occurs in homes and families, schools, care and justice systems, workplaces and
communities. Perpetrators include parents, family members, teachers, caretakers, law enforcement
authorities and other children.
Many children do not feel protected in school. Globally, more than one third of all children aged between
13 and 15 say that they are regularly a subject of violence or bullying at school181. Therefore, the sustainable
development goals, put on the global agenda are targeting ending violence against children and its
sustainable prevention. There is clear evidence of the harm of violence on physical and mental health and
children's development, on their ability to learn and build relationships with others, to become fully
functional adults and parents. School bullying and insecure school environments are one of the reasons for
early drop out of the education system, reduced attendance, poor student performance, and have significant
socio-economic effects as education is key for the personal and professional realization of individuals and
for the prosperity of societies.
According to the study on the health and behaviour of school aged children (HBSC)182 students in Bulgaria
are among the top ten out of 43 surveyed countries affected by the problem of school bullying. Data from
the Ministry of Education and Science183 (MES) shows around 8000 cases of different forms of violence are
registered in schools annually. A study of the views of Bulgarian children on important areas of their life184,
conducted by UNICEF and the State Agency for Child Protection, also confirms that violence, in particular
school violence, is as a major problem for children and adolescents. The different forms of aggression,

violence and bullying, are identified as one of the four major problems faced by children in Bulgaria together
with poverty, the easy access to drugs, alcohol and cigarettes, and the low quality of education.
Schools, on the other hand, are recognized as an important space where children, teachers and education
personnel can learn and adopt pro-social behaviours that can contribute to preventing violence within the
school and in the community.
In April 2017, MES initiated the development of a cross-sectoral Action Plan which aims at prevention of
violence and building safety in schools. The measures include provision of psychologists and pedagogical
counsellors, targeted trainings of teachers, introduction of in-class and after school activities for prevention
of violence. There has been a revision of the State Standard on Inclusive Education with regards to the cases
of bullying and violence in schools.
A Mechanism for combatting bullying and violence in educational institutions has been introduced in the
education system185 to support educational institutions in their efforts to create a safe school environment.
Its introduction implies the understanding that real progress in addressing violence and bullying can only be
achieved by implementing a coherent and purposeful policy that is shared and implemented by all actors in
the education process. The document introduces the necessary measures to create a safe school
environment in the understanding of social-ecological model and a whole-school approach to prevention
and intervention on violence. Each institution in the system of pre-school and school education is obliged to:
• Set up a coordination council which is responsible for planning, monitoring and coordinating efforts to
tackle violence and bullying.
• Assess and analyse the situation with a view to educating the school community on the topic of violence,
but also revealing prevalence of certain forms and measures taken so far.
• Based on the assessment, plan / update prevention and intervention activities at both institution and
group / class level.
Despite the existence of a unified framework that lays the foundation for a safe school environment, it
appears that educational institutions need support for its effective implementation and enforcement. One
of the weaknesses of the approaches so far is that they are adult-oriented, and that children and adolescents
are not active participants. Empowering them as equal participants in improving the school climate is an
approach that also contributes to their development as responsible and independent individuals.
Additionally, the role of parents as part of the school community needs to be strengthened and pedagogues
need support for their role in the prevention process.
UNICEF role
UNICEF Bulgaria is in the last year of implementation of the Country Programme for the period 2018-2022.
The overall goal of the country partnership is to support Bulgaria in its efforts to enable all children and
adolescents in the country, including the most disadvantaged, to enjoy their rights and develop to their full
potential in an inclusive and protective society. The realization of the right of every child to live free from
violence, abuse, exploitation and harmful practices is a cross-cutting element throughout the country
partnership in the period 2018 – 2022.
In June 2019 an expert group was established within the MES to develop the program intervention based on
a whole-school approach which addresses violence and bullying in schools. The main goal of the programme
is to raise the awareness, commitment and capacity of the entire school community to prevent and tackle
school violence. Theory of change model was developed to explain how the activities are envisaged to
contribute to results of the Program Detailed indicators for monitoring outcomes and outputs are included
in the model.
185 The document has been introduced in 2012 and its latest update was in December 2017.
85
The program builds on the whole-school approach, a social-ecological model to addressing the problem.
Under this approach violence is looked at as social phenomenon with drivers on several levels (individually,
interpersonally-the class, the school and the local community). Tackling the problem requires a response on
each level, as well as from every participant in the school community (students, pedagogical and non-
pedagogical staff, principals and parents). Key components of the programme are:
• assessing the school environment and creating a school commitment to prevention work;
• raising awareness and knowledge on the issue;
• training of principals and coordination committees in the whole-school approach;
• ongoing support and training of teachers on effective classroom management and communication with
parents;
• strengthening the school community through student and parent participation and other mechanisms;
• creating a student peer-to-peer support group and installing the restoration of value approach.
The Program was implemented in five pilot schools for 3 school years (one preparatory 2019-2020 and two
full school years of implementation 2020 – 2022). The schools` selection was completed in two phases: 1)
pre-selection of 13 schools through a questionnaire and 2) discussions with children, school staff and parents
to explore their readiness and motivation to join the Programme.
Evidence and knowledge generated through the application of the approach and the implementation of the
different components will inform the national policy framework on violence prevention and child protection
in the education and will support the development of training packages and modules on the topic.
II. PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION
The purpose of the evaluation of the Program on Prevention of Violence and Bullying in School “Steps
Together” (The Program) is to lead to improvement of the structure, implementation, and quality of the
Program, and eventually to ensure its national scale up and sustainability through its legal and administrative
institutionalization and state budgeting.
The key target of the evaluation will be UNICEF CO and Ministry of Education and Science (МЕS) and pilot
schools of the Program.
National experts will assist an international consultant, based on a proposal for the scope of their
engagement, provided by him/her.
It is planned the evaluation to be supported by a Reference Group, consisting of representatives of the
Ministry of Education and Science, State Agency for Child Protection, Council of Children to the State Agency
for Child Protection, Ombudsman, school principals, school psychologists and pedagogical councilors and
teachers and other stakeholders as per nomination by the MES and UNICEF. The group will support and
oversee the evaluation process, as well as will review the findings and recommendations.
III. EVALUATION OBJECTIVES
To conduct an independent evaluation of the model and components of the Program and their impact on
the school environment and levels of violence and bullying in five pilot schools in Sofia, Teteven, Kustendil,
Iskar and Zavet.
The evaluation is both formative and summative in nature - the overall evaluation should bring an
understanding and improvement of the process and also on whether the Program works.
The specific objectives will be:
86
• Assess and evaluate the Program, its implementation, relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, coherence
and sustainability and, to the extent possible, its impact on teachers, children and parents.
• Assess the Program’s equity and child rights perspective both in terms of the capacities to reach out to
and deliver support for prevention of violence and bullying in school and ensure safe school
environment.
• Identify the enablers and challenges for institutionalizing and upscaling the Program nationally.
• To examine the integration of the Program into the school life and school management in pilot schools
in Sofia, Teteven, Kustendil, Iskar and Zavet.
• To examine the impact of the Program on the operationalization in schools of the Mechanism for
Countering Bullying and Violence in the Institutions in the System of Preschool and School Education.
• Provide recommendations for the process of institutionalizing and scaling up of the Program nationally
and for actions to ensure its quality and sustainable implementation in the future.
The provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the Concluding observations to
Bulgaria, and the other key human rights documents should guide the process of the evaluation, together
with design of the methodology, implementation and analysis of results. The evaluation should also be
designed and carried out to assess the equity dimensions of the interventions, as well as gender equality.
IV. EVALUATION SCOPE
The evaluation will focus on the five pilot schools, where the Program is implemented with UNICEF and
Ministry of Education and Science support and will cover the period September 2019 – present.
Geographical coverage of the evaluation includes the pilot schools in Sofia, Teteven, Kustendil, Iskar and
Zavet. The evaluation shall include the perspective and views of all relevant stakeholders: Ministry of
Education and Science; school principals, school psychologists and pedagogical counsellors, teachers,
children, parents, who benefited from the Program; UNICEF team – mentors of schools, Education Program
Director, Coordinator of the Program, mentors and Consultant on VAC who supported the mentors' team,
Consultant who led the component for work with parents.
The Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA), equity and gender equality and mainstreaming approaches also
need to be assessed. Particular attention should be paid to exploring equity dimensions of the intervention.
For UNICEF equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop, and reach their full
potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. Equity-based evaluation provides assessments of what
works and what does not work to reduce inequity, and it highlights intended and unintended results for the
most vulnerable groups as well as the inequalities in the outcomes for vulnerable children and families. To
the extent possible access to quality support and outcomes for different subgroups of vulnerable children
and families should be explored in the evaluation (based on ethnicity, residence, setting –
institutional/family, gender, disability, etc.) and the groups least reached identified.
V. EVALUATION FRAMEWORK AND QUESTIONS
The evaluation will assess the Program in terms of the following criteria: relevance to the child rights and
equity agenda, effectiveness, efficiency, relevance to national priorities/context and needs, coherence,
sustainability, and impact (as defined by OECD/DAC).
Below are given indicative questions to guide the evaluation, but the national expert(s), guided by the
international consultant may further expand and refine them during the inception phase in consultation with
UNICEF and implementing partners and the Reference Group. The need of assessment of relevant human
rights, equity and gender equality aspects should be considered while formulating the questions. Local
dimension (with respect to the five towns, where the Program is implemented) should be explored as well.

equality in evaluation (see link below) and complies with the organization’s commitment to gender
mainstreaming as expressed in the Policy on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Girls186.
VI. METHODOLOGY AND PHASES
The evaluation will follow internationally agreed evaluation criteria of relevance, efficiency, effectiveness,
impact, and sustainability.
The evaluation will be led by the international consultant. National expert(s) will follow his/her guidance
with respect to methodology, instruments, planning and implementation of the evaluation process. Mixed
method approach will be applied in the evaluation combining qualitative and quantitative components to
ensure complementary strengths and non-overlapping weaknesses. The analysis is expected to build on
information collected from variety of sources through different methods including review of administrative
data, primary data collection from government representatives, monitoring of the Program, pilot schools
and others. It should critically examine the information gathered and synthesize it in an objective manner. If
contradictory information is obtained from different stakeholders, an effort should be made to understand
the reasons for such information, including any gender-based differences.
186 http://www.uneval.org/documentdownload?doc_id=980&file_id=1294
90
The evaluation should be participatory involving beneficiaries of the Program and representatives of the
target groups. Methods, data collection tools and analysis should build on a human rights and child rights
approach and should be gender and culturally sensitive.
The evaluation results will be validated with national partners and key stakeholders.
Inception Phase: The first step of the evaluation process will be the inception phase during which the
international consultant will develop an evaluation framework, methodology, sources of information
(including stakeholders to be involved) and data collection tools based on the TOR. National experts shall
assist the international consultant by reviewing the most important background material, documents, and
reports related to the evaluation, which are in Bulgarian language. For each of the questions and sub-
questions, the international consultant will develop indicators to inform the responses and identify the
corresponding means of verification. In addition, the international consultant will assess potential limitations
to the evaluation work and the availability and reliability of data. During the inception phase the
international consultant will also examine any ethical issues that may arise and propose appropriate
mitigation strategies. National expert (s) will support the international consultant in this process.
A Desk Review of relevant studies’ reports and if necessary, laws, policies and strategies, Program
documentation (Program description, schedule, base-line research on the levels of violence and bullying and
the environment in schools, participating in the Program, mid-term assessment of the Program, final
research on the levels of violence and bullying and the environment in schools participating in the Program,
summaries of feedbacks of students (1-4 grade), electronic feedbacks from teachers and students (5-12
grade) from Workshops, other). The necessary documentation related to the Program will be provided by
UNICEF and the respective local partners in English and in Bulgarian languages.
Primary data collection: Primary data will be collected at school level – in the five pilot schools, through in-
depth, semi-structured interviews and/or individual face to face interviews/questionnaires and/or focus
group discussions (depending on the methodology, offered by the international consultant). The aim of
primary data collection is to explore the opinions of school principals, school psychologists and pedagogical
counsellors, teachers, children, parents in pilot schools in Sofia, Teteven, Kustendil, Iskar and Zavet, who
benefited from the Program; UNICEF team – mentors of the schools, Education Program Director,
Coordinator of the Program, mentors and Consultant on VAC who supported the mentors’ team, Consultants
on implementing the component for work with the parents and Ministry of Education and Science. Primary
data collection from pilot schools need to include in any case opinions of principals/deputy principals and
pedagogical counsellors and opinions of teachers, parents and children from all educational levels in the
relevant schools. Data collection tools are subject to UNICEF ethical review. The international consultant
should ensure that the methodology allows for exploring the views of representatives of different
stakeholders: representatives of the MЕS, UNICEF team – mentors of schools, Program Director Education,
the Program coordinator and the consultant on VAC, representatives of the target group. In addition,
evaluation data on and from Program beneficiaries with different socio-economic, ethnic and residence
(urban/rural) profile should be collected as well to assess equity dimensions of the interventions. The
methodology and data collection tools should also consider language difficulties experienced by some ethnic
groups whose mother tongue is not Bulgarian (Turkish and Roma).
The possibility to use electronically administered questionnaires should be considered if applicable.
Data analysis and report writing: the process will start at the inception phase when the international
consultant proposes a detailed methodology and the structure of the final report. Data analysis will progress
simultaneously with the desk review and the data collection. Inception report and draft final report will be
reviewed by UNICEF CO and national stakeholders as well as an external quality review company.
International consultant will incorporate the received comments and submit the final report to UNICEF
Bulgaria.
91
General considerations: The methodology of the evaluation should be in line with the United Nations
Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards. UNEG Norms and Standards and UN Evaluation Policy. The
Methodology and data collection tools are subject to UNICEF ethical review.
Data/information sources:
Official state institutions, pilot schools and UNICEF are the main sources of data and information for the
purposes of the evaluation and are therefore considered reliable and of sufficient quality. Disaggregated
data (based on ethnicity, socio-economic status, gender, disability, etc.) may not always be available through
the official sources and the Program sources.
Available documentation:
• Program documentation – Program descriptions and initial and updated schedules, baseline and final
research on the levels of violence and bullying and the environment in pilot schools, mid-term
assessment of Program implementation.
• MoUs, related to the Program;
• National strategic and policy documents in the area of violence prevention and response.
• Statistical data of the Ministry of Education and Science for the school years 2019/2020 – 2021/2022.
• UNICEF VAC study
• Any other studies, assessments and relevant documents available or that may be provided by the
partners.
• CPD 2018 – 2022.
• Mission Reports from MES from monitoring visits in schools
All needed documents in English and in Bulgarian language, together with a contact list of key stakeholders
whose views should be taken into consideration, will be provided to the international consultant and
national expert (s) once a contractual agreement has been made.
Limitations of the evaluation
An evaluability assessment with all the partners hasn’t been conducted. However, despite some data gaps
there is available information to conduct a formative evaluation. Data sources being different from country
to country, trends analysis will be preferred over comparison.
The level of disaggregation of available data and the quality of data provided by the monitoring of the
Program may not be sufficient to assess equity dimension. This limitation can be addressed by ensuing the
participation of the most vulnerable families in the evaluation process through appropriate data collection
methods and tools.
Not all documents related to the programme implementation and monitoring are at UNICEF disposal and
are available in English, particularly MES records and internal reports.
End of school year is end of June 2022 which should be taken into consideration when planning the data
gathering processes, particularly surveys and interviews with school staff and students.

of interest. The international consultant is required to clearly identify in her/his proposal any potential
ethical issues and approaches, as well as the processes for ethical review and oversight of the evaluation
process. The inception report should further elaborate on them including appropriate mitigation strategies
to address any potential ethical issues. Participation in the research should be voluntary and the identity of
the respondents should be protected. The inception report should also describe procedures for obtaining
informed consent and preserving privacy and confidentiality of the respondents.
The evaluation methodology will go through an ethical review by an internal Ethical Board set up at UNICEF
CO in Bulgaria.
Data sharing requirements and procedures:
International Consultant and national experts are responsible for ensuring that all data collected are stored
and protected appropriately. They need to set up a system to ensure that personal data is accessible only to
the members of the team involved in the research and is transferred securely between research team

ANNEX F: EVALUATION MATRIX
During the inception phase, in consultation with both the UNICEF Country Office (CO) and Regional Office (CO), the Lead Evaluator narrowed the focus of the evaluation questions to
key questions which required narrowing the evaluation matrix to focus on the key questions. During the evaluation, particularly during the data analysis and report writing phases, only
the 15 key questions were focused on as agreed with UNICEF CO and RO, so the sub-questions were removed from the evaluation matrix. At the inception phase, the evaluation matrix
included a total of 30 indicators related to the 15 key evaluation questions, of which 21 were qualitative indicators and 9 were quantitative indicators. During the data analysis and
report writing phases, the evaluation matrix was slightly revised to include 34 indicators related to the 15 key questions, including 27 qualitative indicators and 9 quantitative indicators
(two indictors that were both qualitative and quantitative indicators). Minor modifications to the indicators were made because during the inception phase only five programme
documents were available for review, which made it difficult to draft indicators. During the data collection and analysis phases, the evaluation team came to better understand the
Programme and data that were available. The minor modifications that were made to the indicators were done to strength the evaluator’s ability to effectively answer the evaluation
questions and present the findings. See Annex Table F2 for an explanation of modifications made to indicators.

Who are we and why are we conducting this evaluation?
The evaluation is being conducted by the United Nation’s Children Fund (UNICEF), and is necessary for
the purposes of the Steps Together Programme, which is implemented by UNICEF Bulgaria and the
Ministry of Education and Science (MES) from 2019 to 2022. As the evaluators we are contracted by
UNICEF, but we are not employees of UNICEF.
The purpose is to obtain an independent evaluation of the Steps Together Programme which is being
implemented in five schools in five regions – Iskar, Kustendil, Sofia, Teteven and Zavet. The aim is to
understand why and to what extent intended and unintended results were achieved and to analyse
implications of the results. The evaluation is expected to support strategic learning and decision-making

Review the ground rules with participants.
Here are suggestions for ground rules that can be especially helpful for focus groups:
• This is a public discussion, not a debate. The purpose is not to win an argument, but to hear
many points of view related to the Steps Together Programme.
• Everyone is encouraged to participate. You may be asked to share what you think or I may ask
for comments from those who haven't spoken. It is always OK to "pass" when you are asked to
share a comment.
• No one or two individuals should dominate a discussion. If you have already voiced your ideas,
let others have an opportunity.
• One person speaks at a time. Refrain from side conversations. Pay attention to the person
speaking. If you think you will forget an idea that comes to mind, write it down.
• Listen to and respect other points of view.
• Seek first to understand, not to be understood. Ask questions to seek clarification when you
don't understand the meaning of someone's comments.
• Keep focus group discussions confidential from anyone outside the group, this is important to
ensuring everyone confidentiality.
In smaller focus groups, creating expectations together as part of the meeting is a helpful first step.

ANNEX L: PARENTAL CONSENT FORM FOR CHILDREN’S PARTICIPATION
Agreement for Child’s Participation in the Evaluation of the Child Advocacy Centre
Parental Consent Form for Children’s Participation
Who are we and why are we conducting this evaluation?
The evaluation is being conducted by the United Nation’s Children Fund (UNICEF), and is necessary for
the purposes of the Steps Together Programme, which is implemented by UNICEF Bulgaria and the
Ministry of Education and Science (MES) from 2019 to 2022. As the evaluators we are contracted by
UNICEF, but we are not employees of UNICEF.
The purpose is to obtain an independent evaluation of the Steps Together Programme which is being
implemented in five schools in five regions – Iskar, Kustendil, Sofia, Teteven and Zavet. The aim is to
understand why and to what extent intended and unintended results were achieved and to analyse
implications of the results. The evaluation is expected to support strategic learning and decision-making
with regard to improving the structure, implementation and quality of the Steps Together Programme,
and its eventual scale-up and sustainability.
What will be your child’s involvement?
Your child’s opinion and point of view is very important to us; therefore, we want to invite your child to
participate in a focus group discussion and share their perspectives and experiences related to their
participation in the Steps Together Programme. We will ask them questions about Programme activities,
including activities focused on preventing school violence and bullying, and create a safe school
environment. This will allow us to assess the relevance, effectiveness and impact of the Steps Together
Programme. Your child will not be asked about school violence or bullying that they may have personally
experienced.
Bear in mind, your child will be just one of more than 100 people what we will be meeting with and talking
to as part of this evaluation. Everyone who participates in this evaluation are guaranteed confidentiality
to protect their privacy. No names or identifiers will be included in any documents or reports. Only
summary data for all respondents will be presented in an evaluation report of the Steps Together
Programme. It is also important that you know that participating in this interview will cause no risk to you
or your child.
We anticipate the focus group will take about 1 hour/60 minutes. We want to make sure that you are
aware that this focus group discussion will be audio recorded, subject to the rules of confidentiality of
participants.
Is it mandatory for your child to participate in this focus group discussion?
It is up to you and your child to decide whether your child will participate in this focus group; their
participation is voluntary. If you decide, now or at a later stage, that you don’t want your child to
participate in this focus group, you can withdraw your consent at any time without giving any reason why.
Even if you would be happy for your child to participate, they will decide for themselves whether they
want to take part. It will also be explained to the child that they may stop their participation at any time
without reason, as well as that they may refuse to answer any of the questions.
125
About 40 students from your child’s school will asked to participate willingly in one of the four focus
groups that we have schedule (10 students per focus group).
Will the child’s answers be shared with anyone else?
The focus group is designed to protect your child’s identity. All the information collected as part of the
focus group will be strictly anonymous and confidential.
Who will have access to the data from this survey?
Only members of the evaluation team will be allowed to examine focus group responses. All information
from focus groups will be stored on password protected computers, which are accessible only to
authorised interviewers.
How will the anonymous answers given by your child in this survey be used?
The answers given by your child in the focus group will be used to evaluate how the Steps Together
Programme was implemented in your child’s school. We are interested in the general responses shared
by all children who participate in focus groups. We plan to conduct a total of 18 focus groups in 5 schools
in the country. Your child is one of about 100 children who have been asked to participate in a focus
group.
HOW DO I GIVE PERMISSION FOR MY CHILD TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS EVALUATION?
You give permission for your child to participate by checking the appropriate ‘Yes’ box and signing the
form. If you do not give your permission for your child to participate, check the ‘No’ box. You should fill

Introduce yourself and explain the purpose of the evaluation and offer a brief description of the
methodology. Let the children know that they are only one of a large number of children who are
being interviewed in four schools in four regions of Bulgaria – Iskar, Sofia, Teteven and Zavet.
Read the following script before starting each interview:
Your participation in this discussion is voluntary which means that you can choose not to participate
if you do not want. It also means that if you choose to participate that you can skip questions or end
your participation at any time without penalty. It is also important to understand that participation in
this discussion is not a requirement of the school or your ability to continue to programme. If you
choose not to participate in this discussion or choose to end your participation it will in no way
impact your grades in school. No one from the school will know that you declined to participate.
There are no right or wrong answer. You are guaranteed confidently which means that no one at the
school will know how you answered any of the questions.
No names will be used during the report writing process, and no information that you provide will be
attached to your name. If a quote is used it will be identified in general terms, such as “student.” Also,
everyone will be randomly assigned a number to guarantee confidentiality.
I would like to audio record the discussion, so that I can go back later and type up the notes from our
discussion. I will bring the audio-recordings back to Sofia with me and type them up. After I type up
my notes I will delete/erase the recording. I want to make sure that each one of you are okay with
my recording our discussion. Do I have your permission to audio record the discussion?

Post the ground rules in the room and review the ground rules with participants.
Here are suggestions for ground rules that can be especially helpful for focus groups:
• This is a public discussion, not a debate. The purpose is not to win an argument, but to hear many
points of view related to the Steps Together Programme.
• Everyone is encouraged to participate. You may be asked to share what you think or I may ask for
comments from those who haven't spoken. It is always OK to "pass" when you are asked to share
a comment.
• No one or two individuals should dominate a discussion. If you have already voiced your ideas,
let others have an opportunity.
• One person speaks at a time. Refrain from side conversations. Pay attention to the person
speaking. If you think you will forget an idea that comes to mind, write it down.
• Listen to and respect other points of view.
• Seek first to understand, not to be understood. Ask questions to seek clarification when you
don't understand the meaning of someone's comments.
• Keep focus group discussions confidential from anyone outside the group, this is important to ensuring
everyone confidentiality.
In smaller focus groups, creating expectations together as part of the meeting is a helpful first step.
Once ground rules are clarified, participants should confirm that these rules will guide the discussion. The
group's agreement allows the facilitator to directly address an issue when a ground rule is not followed.
Familiarity with and Relevance of the Programme
Let’s get started. I want to ask you some questions about the Steps Together Programme.
I know that you have taken part in the Steps Together Programme, which focused on preventing school
violence and peer bullying. What did you and your classmates call this programme?
Today, I want to talk with you about that Programme. I want to hear what you and your peers did in the
Programme, what you learned from the Programme, your thoughts about the Programme, what you
liked about the Programme. You may even have some ideas on how to improve the Programme.
Reminder the students that there are refreshments and to make themselves comfortable.
I want you to think back to when you first participated in the Programme. I want you to use the paper
and markers to draw or list on the paper the different activities that you remember participating in as
128
part of the Steps Together Programme. You can work together as a team to develop that list of
activities you participated in as part of the Programme. Maybe some of you participate in an activity,
but others did not, that is okay, still draw or list the activity on your paper.
Maybe want to list the activities on a timeline from past to present. For instance, what were some of
the activities that you did at the beginning of the programme, what were some activities that you did in
the middle of the programme, and what were activities that you did more recently at the end of the
programme? Don’t worry if you can’t remember the order of activities. If you don’t remember the
order you can just list the different activities that you remember.
Depending on the number of attendees, you may want to split the children into two groups, but it is best
to have 3-5 children in a group. So, if there are 6 children in the focus group divide them into 2 groups of
3. If there are 5 children in the focus group let them work together as a group of 5. You should have no
more than two groups in one focus group discussion.
GIVE THE CHILDREN 10-15 MINUTES MAXIMUM TO COMPLETE THIS ACTIVITY
1.1 After 10-15 minutes, once each group is done, ask each group, one at a time, to talk about the
different activities they listed on their paper. Verify how the activity was part of the Steps
Together Programme. You should ask:
• Tell me about the activities you have drawn or listed on your paper?
Probing questions:
• When did this happen?
• Who participated?
• What impact did that activity have on you and your classmates?
Note: By involving all children in the discussion and the visualization task, it helps them recall
the programme and their participation in it, which will help them to reflect in greater detail as
the discussion continues.
2 Do you think the Steps Together Programme is a good Programme to have in this school? If yes, why
is it a good Programme to have in this school? If no, why don’t you think it is a good Programme?
10 Do you think the Steps Together Programme has helped to prevent violence and bullying in your school?
If yes, in what ways? If no, why not?
11 Do you think the Steps Together Programme has helped to create a safe environment in your school? If
yes, in what ways? If no, why not?
18 From your perspective, what have been the benefits of the Programme for students in this school?
31 Has the Programme led to any positive changes in this school? If yes, what positive changes have you
seen? If no, why not?
50 What did you like most about the Steps Together Programme?
51 Was there anything you did like about the Steps Together Programme?
129
20.2 Do you have any thoughts on how to improve the Steps Together Programme?
Wrap-up and Closure
I want to thank you for participating in this discussion today. I really appreciate you taking the time to
come and talk with me and share your views and opinions. This information is very useful to our
evaluation. It is important to UNICEF to hear the views of children, because children are important to
the Steps Together Programme.
“Thank you for your cooperation. I know that some of these questions were personal and may have
made you feel sad or upset. I am going to give you a leaflet with phone numbers of some places that
you can contact in case you would like to speak with someone. You can reach out at any time and these
services are free. We would suggest that you keep this leaflet somewhere safe where no one else will
be able to find it. I can also directly link you to a school staff member who can provide some help and
support. Would you like for me to do this for you?”
Please let me know if you have any questions of me before we end this meeting today.
Close the meeting.
