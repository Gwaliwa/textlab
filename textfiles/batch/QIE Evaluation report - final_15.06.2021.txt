Executive summary
The Quality Inclusive Education Initiative (QIE) aimed to be the foundation of a “friendly and inclusive
school” for all pupils and teachers and to positively change the image of school as an institution. The
intervention was meant to respond to the needs for capacity and professional development of headmasters and
teachers and brought to the fore the importance of early childhood education. The results and lessons
generated by the model were meant to inform the elaboration of new laws, standards and regulations
applicable nationwide1.
QIE includes child-centred interventions at school, family and community levels. The education package is
universal, as all schoolchildren and schools may benefit from its interventions and of its results in terms of
quality education. The package is also modular, which means that it may be customized to the specific needs
of a school/community, and thus it could be applied in all types of schools. QIE focuses in several of its
components on children who are the most at-risk of dropout2.
QIE was developed in partnership by the Romanian Ministry of National Education and UNICEF Romania, and
implemented during September 2015 and June 2019 (4 school years), in Bacău County, in 51 schools from 44
communities in 37 urban and rural localities.
QIE was implemented in wide partnership with the Institute for Educational Sciences (IES)3, The Romanian
Agency for Quality Assurance in Pre-academic Education (ARACIP), Step by Step, Holtis, Împreună Agency, as
well as with the support of the Ministry of Education, Bacău County School Inspectorate (CSI), Bacău County
Centre for Educational Support and Resources (CCREA) and Bacău County Council.
The summative evaluation of the Quality Inclusive Education package of the “Social inclusion through the
provision of integrated social services at community level” modelling project in Romania, aimed „to assess
whether the underlying assumptions and objectives formulated in the Theory of Change for QIE [Quality
Inclusive Education] were validated and achieved as well as to ascertain whether QIE contributes to promoting
the child rights to quality inclusive education”.
The evaluation aims to be a key element in the process of promoting the scale-up of the QIE at national level.
The evidence generated by the evaluation will be used for advocacy and policy advice with authorities and
stakeholders at local, county and national levels including to the Ministry of Education, as regards in developing
and amending educational policies related to prevention of dropout, absenteeism and early school leaving.
Therefore, the evaluation observed the following objectives:
• Evaluate relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact of the QIE component;
• Identify and document the key elements that contributed to the QIE success and replicability, as well
as main bottlenecks and barriers in implementation;
• Document key lessons learned in relation to the QIE implementation and propose recommendations
for improvement;
• Make recommendations for further actions related to sustainability, scalability of the QIE as a whole
or components of QIE throughout the country.
• Identify the way in which the QIE component is relevant and produced results in addressing issues
related to gender equality, equity and overall advancement of child rights

The evaluation covered all QIE components and activities implemented in the framework of the model during
its lifetime (September 2015 – June 2019) and all 51 schools benefiting under QIE, located in 44 urban and
rural communities in Bacău County.
The summative evaluation used a mixed methods design, by combining qualitative and quantitative data
collection and data analysis techniques. Triangulation was used in order to validate findings, including the
triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data collected. Quantitative analyses of secondary data preceded
in most cases qualitative field data collection, to allow explanation of possible different results through data
collected during interviews, focus groups etc.
Quantitative data collection and data analysis techniques used by the evaluation are counterfactual impact
analysis, surveys and exploratory data analysis (descriptive statistics, visual representations).
The counterfactual assessment was carried based on administrative data made available by Ministry of
Education for the 51 QIE schools in Bacău and 6 schools in the control group in Galați County. Data recorded
by UNICEF and implementation partners concerning activity implementation and outputs (i.e., participants in
training, parental counselling and parental education), as well as a number of key variables among data
collected by the Institute for Educational Sciences (IES) on children at risk and vulnerable children enrolled in
the targeted schools were analysed using descriptive statistics (frequency distribution, correlations). Five
surveys were conducted among headmasters, teachers, kindergarten teachers, schoolchildren in the 51 schools
where QIE was implemented, as well as the parents of the latter.
Qualitative data collection and data analysis techniques used by the evaluation include desk research,
interviews, focus groups and case study.
Extensive desk research was carried out, involving the summary, collation, analysis and/or synthesis of existing
documents. At national level interviews were carried out with UNICEF, project partners, Ministry of Education
and Research, World Bank and representative NGOs. At country level 2 interviews with CSI and CJRAE were
conducted, as well as 1 focus group with county coordinators.
Case study was a key methodological instrument applied in the framework of this evaluation, as part of the
mixed-method approach. Based on the quantitative data at disposal, collected from school annual reports, and
on qualitative data (good and less good examples mentioned in the 2015 in-depth assessment and project
documents), the following schools were selected to be a part of the multiple case study:
1. Şcoala Gimnazială Zemes (high number of roma children, and very high number of absences, but no
children reported to dropout)
2. Şcoala Gimnazială Horgeşti (high number of absences, high number of children dropping out of school,
but considered a good practice by some QIE partner organisations)
3. Şcoala Gimnazială Frumoasa, Balcani (low number of absences, no children reported to dropout,
considered a good practice by some QIE partner organisations)
4. Şcoala Gimnazială Colonești (high number of absences, no children reported to dropout, considered a
less good practice by some QIE partner organisations)
5. Şcoala Gimnazială Nr. 2 Targu Ocna (high number of absences, but no children reported to dropout,
considered a good practice by some QIE partner organisations)
6. Şcoala Gimnazială "Dr. Alexandru Safran" (moderate number of absences, no children reported to
dropout, considered a less good practice by some QIE partner organisations)
The evaluation was undertaken during the crisis triggered by COVID pandemic, however, the methodology
planned could be applied to a very large extent. Most instruments were deployed on-line (and in this respect
on-line schooling helped evaluation as the stakeholders involved already had a degree of understanding and
were used to working with virtual communication platforms). Where baselines were not available,
administrative data was used or questions in the survey were formulated in such a manner that progress is
indicated (in 2020 compared to 2015). For example, changes of attitude, values and awareness, at the level of
teachers, children (including adolescents) and parents were very difficult to measure, as there is no baseline
on these dimensions. The risk of bias was, though, limited, as multiple triangulation was ensured during
secondary analysis and findings of the evaluations are based multiple data sources: documents, quantitative
data analysis and survey results.
7
Based on evidence collected and analyses carried out, the evaluation concludes that the Quality Inclusive
Education package was highly relevant. The project addressed all children and adolescents, including children
in vulnerable categories, in both urban and rural areas, and this was the adequate strategy to answer the
problems identified and ensure project effectiveness (i.e., to tackle more than barrier to participation to school
but take a step forward and offer quality education).
A strong feature of QIE from a relevance perspective, but also impact, is its “integrated” approach, i.e., QIE
created a broad context focused on learning interactions and collaboration between traditionally separate
groups - pupils, teachers, parents, institutions such as ARACIP - and it redefined the relationships among these
actors, particularly at local level, for the benefit of the child.
The implemented activities have a high degree of relevance as they addressed directly causes of school dropout
such as family educational difficulties, limited interest in learning, limited involvement in class/school, limited
material base, limited communication between parents and school or insufficient help from teachers, and their
associated needs. Based on evidence collected, QIE objectives, activities and results are also highly relevant in
relation to the European and national strategic and legislative framework. QIE is fully aligned to all national
strategies, as it proposed a model to implement existing legal provisions as regards integrated interventions.
The evaluation has identified a degree of flexibility maintained throughout the implementation process. In this
vein, although not without challenges, activities were adjusted in order for the project to adequately respond
to further needs identified on the spot. However, the evaluation identified a (rather limited) number of
additional activities that would have further enhanced the relevance and effectiveness of the model and could
be taken into consideration when QIE is scale-up.
The child rights approach was embedded already in the project Theory of Change, as QIE addresses bottlenecks
and barriers in access to and retention in education for children and adolescents at risk, in order to ensure that
the right to education of every child is observed without discrimination. A differentiated approach for girls and
boys was applied only when deemed appropriate, otherwise equal and non-discriminatory participation in all
activities was ensured. The gender dimension was addressed in training sessions, monitoring visits and
exchanges of experience, however, specific activities addressing different needs of boys and girls were not
planned / developed.
In general, the evaluation found that QIE triggers changes in terms of increased participation but also improved
atmosphere, i.e., better communication and collaboration, in school. However, maintaining the effects
registered and, thus, continuing reform at school level, greatly depends on the intensity of the intervention (e.g.,
if all or a majority of teachers are instructed), on its continuous implementation (as opposed to an on-off,
project-based activity) but also on external factors, particular to the educational system in Romania and to the
wider socio-economic context. Rural – urban dimension of school and path dependency, i.e., an open mentality
and management capacity already in place at school level, also influence effects and impact obtained.
In the schools participating in the project QIE had an important contribution, in terms of redefining and
strengthening:
• the relation between school-local authorities (the local authorities better understood their role in
supporting the educational act by ensuring cooperation between school and the social
assistants/teams/policies but also to endow and renovate school buildings, in some cases);
• the teacher-parent relationship (parents understood that school can also have another approach to
schoolchildren’ problems, that it is oriented towards the support of schoolchildren, especially those at
risk);
• parents’ relationship with the school and teachers (e.g., parents understood that school is not only
resource consuming, but also a service provider and that their role is not only material, but also
emotional and supportive in the education process);
• the concept of pupils at risk and transforming this category into a more visible one and, moreover,
transforming the children who were considered ‘predestined to a fate of non-fulfilment’ into pupils
who can be supported by joint school-family efforts;
• the “inclusive school” concept in the perspective of school headmasters and of the other stakeholders.
8
In terms of impact, the evaluation highlight positive effects of QIE in terms of school participation, namely as
regards number of schoolchildren enrolled, number of schoolchildren enrolled at the end of the year, number
of schoolchildren completing their graduation requirements by the end of the year and schoolchildren
repeating grades”. Overall, due to increased attention paid to vulnerable children by the school management
and teachers, in closer partnership with parents, some results were confirmed for this target group.
However, QIE’s impact in terms of absenteeism and drop out is rather indirect and restricted by several
external factors contributing in this regard. Family material and social circumstances (i.e., conflicts, alcoholism,
involvement of children in household chores etc.) remain the key reasons for absentees and dropping out and
this confirms the need for wider social and economic measures with effects locally as well as closer
collaboration and better social services at community level. School drop-out is more widespread in the last
years of lower secondary school, when children move towards high school/vocational schools and among girls
of Roma ethnicity.
Overall, positive changes at school management level have been identified as a result of school headmasters
and their teams’ participation in activities organised by QIE. School management is more involved and directly
encourages teamwork and communication among teachers, but also between teachers, children, parents and
other school specialists. Headmasters understand better their role and facilitate access to resources, including
for infrastructure works, and, in this sense, they are more oriented towards development and more focused on
accessing available grants. On the other side, there is room for improvement as regards school management
and drafting school planning documents, for the latter in terms of collecting evidence to support Plan’s
development and implementation and formulating realistic implementation plans including additional,
customised support for vulnerable groups.
Changes induced by the model at school management level, while positive in many schools, are stronger in
schools already having an open organization culture and/or a champion determined to develop the school. On
the other side, the evidence collected also indicated that QIE’s impact at management level may be very limited
where school headmasters are not interested and open to a new vision / modern approaches. The same is valid
in cases where headmasters are replaced and organisational culture may be weak from a strategic planning
perspective.
QIE had an important positive effect in terms of improved relationship with the community in general,
including parents and local authorities. As regards the latter, cooperation was strengthened with social
assistants identifying and working with vulnerable families. QIE also made many participating schools more
child-friendly, by offering a more welcoming environment and a more friendly looking learning space
decorated also during non-formal activities organised under mini-grants.” However, significant room for
improvement exists in this regard, too, if we take into account the fact that less than 20% of children consulted
in the framework of this evaluation declared that feel safer when they study/ go to school compared to some
years before, and this perception is only mildly influenced by recent developments caused by COVID 19.
At the same time, although stakeholders consulted in the framework of the evaluation positively assessed the
training activities implemented, continuous intervention is needed for schools to reach expected standards as
regards providing good quality teaching and learning processes with individualized instruction appropriate to
each child’s developmental level; using active, cooperative, innovative and democratic learning methods and
structured content and select good quality materials and resources. Still, the evaluation identified a series of
impacts at teachers’ level i.e., teachers collaborate more with schoolchildren and parents, promote a healthy
climate in school, and continue to use in class, although to a more moderate extent, materials promoting
diversity.
Changes in case of early education teachers are similar as those available for school teachers. At this level, the
difference was made, as in the case of schools, by the 360° approach taken (i.e., a combination of educational
resources/materials, training for all or a majority of teachers, exchanging experiences with other teachers and
activities focused on enhancing collaboration with parents, including parental education). Materials and
equipment purchased for kindergartens and schools as well as extracurricular activities (the latter two in the
framework of the microgrants) had an important contribution to effects identified by this evaluation.
9
At the same time, ample parental education activities implemented under QIE as well as other activities
involving parents (i.e., parents counselling, extracurricular activities) had positive impacts in terms of parents’
involvement and connectedness with the school; an improved relationship with children as a result of
improved communication and quality time spent together. However, while already involved parents and
parents of schoolchildren performing well in school, as well as young parents embraced and benefited of
activities implemented, parents of vulnerable children were more difficult to involve.
The evaluation observed that tolerant and non-discriminatory attitudes develop more gradually. From a
conceptual perspective, evidence collected reflect a good, broader understanding of the concepts of inclusive
education. School headmasters, teachers, and parents are significantly more aware of every child’s uniqueness
and particular needs, however, at a more subtle level, interviews and focus groups with these stakeholders
capture attitudes of segregation or denial of vulnerabilities in communities, especially on ethnic or socio-
economic criteria. Acceptance of children with disabilities seems to have increased slightly more compared to
other vulnerable categories.
Overall, UNICEF has been a long standing and reputed partner for the Ministry of Education (MoE) in Romania.
Support delivered by UNICEF in the form of technical assistance for drafting legislative acts, methodologies,
strategies and different studies to fundament policy alternatives has been in all case perceived as highly
relevant, of high quality and useful. Unfortunately, instability at political level hampered the adoption of some
inputs provided by UNICEF (i.e., related to early education, parental education, the methodology for standard
cost per ante-pre-schoolchild). In the absence of a National Parenting Strategy adopted by the government, this
highly relevant policy instrument cannot be applied country-wide and thus its positive effects, supported by
findings of this evaluation, manifest only where parental education is carried out trough singular projects.
As regards “efficiency”, the evaluation observed that QIE used its budget in an economical way, with smaller
unit cost compared to other intervention in the field of education and aiming at increasing access and
participation to school as well as developing teachers’ capacity to implement effective teaching and learning
methods. The County School Inspectorate Bacău and nine schools participating in QIE raised approximately
RON 865,000 (EUR 158,800) from Erasmus+ and other European and national programme, therefore
surpassing the investment in technical assistance in the first year after QIE ended its implementation. In
conclusion, technical assistance for schools is a needed and worth investment, given that the investment in
technical assistance for schools has been recovered by schools that have been successful in fundraising
activities.
In longer run, the evaluation found that stakeholders generally have an adequate understanding of the need to
continue all activities proposed by QIE. There is sufficient determination and experience to continue and
improve existing practices regarding (i) the diversification of the offer of school and extracurricular activities
that motivate and involve all schoolchildren, (ii) the use of teaching strategies adapted to the needs of
schoolchildren from vulnerable groups and (iii) in the area of strategic management, with an emphasis on
reducing dropout and increasing school participation.
However, the capacity of schools is insufficient for further development and facilitation of involvement of
parents/ community in school activities, parenting education and parenting counselling activities, counselling
and mediation support services for children from vulnerable groups, project writing activities / funding
applications. Further resources and interventions are needed for continuing the activities initiated by QIE, for
maintaining and further strengthening the results obtained and for achieving a long-term, solid impact on
schoolchildren.
QIE can be rolled out and scaled up entirely or partially, starting with the most disadvantaged schools and / or
counties. Initiatives including almost all QIE components show that replication is possible at local and national
level. Some QIE components (as separate initiatives) are already rolled out under the coordination of the
Ministry of Education, UNICEF, its implementing partners or other non-governmental organisations. European,
Norwegian and EEA funds, as well as limited national funds are available or will be available (in the
programming period 2021-2027 for EU funds) for this replication. In this context, it is important to note that
scaling up the model (as it stands) at national level requires less than 2% of the budget of the Ministry of
Education in the first year of implementation and less than 1% every year afterwards according to the costing
model developed by UNICEF, which makes QIE roll-out highly cost-effective.

The evaluation formulates the following hey recommendations:
Recommendation Priority Timeframe Responsible
institution
In planning and performing QIE’s roll out, the integrated approach High Medium Ministry of
should be maintained, as one of the key strong points of the term Education,
project. UNICEF,
However, responsible actors need to include in any case, in the Local
customised packages delivered at school level, comprehensive Authorities
training for a majority of teachers in school (differentiated by
levels of seniority/experience) as well as equipment and didactic
materials, in complementarity with recent measures taken to
ensure on-line schooling. In the same vein, activities targeting
non-discrimination and tolerance should be continued and
enhanced, for the aimed change to occur.
Interventions in educational area, overall and in the framework of High Medium Ministry of
rolled-out QIE, should provide for actions aligned to different term Education
needs of boys and girls. Such gender-customised actions should be
considered also for the activity of the school counsellor.
To ensure success in rolling out QIE, the role, responsibilities and High Medium Ministry of
interventions of local authorities in the area of education should term Education,
be clearly detailed for each case (community), in line with the local Local
and country development strategies and legislation in place. Authorities
Additional mechanisms for cooperation with local institutions involved
(with the mayor's office) should be developed and more applied
cooperation with social assistance services should be ensured.
The Ministry of Education should put in place effective High Medium Ministry of
mechanisms for assessing regularly and ensuring the quality of the term Education
school development plan and its implementation, i.e., three times
by plan period. These mechanisms may be
embedded/strengthened in existing monitoring, control and
evaluation systems, as undertaken by ARACIP and County School
Inspectorate.
QIE roll out should take into consideration different needs of High Medium Ministry of
schools involved, from the perspective of quality and motivation term Education,
of human resources including school headmasters, of vulnerable UNICEF,

1. Evaluation background
1.1. Object of the evaluation
The Quality Inclusive Education Initiative (QIE) aimed to be the foundation of a “friendly and inclusive school”
for all pupils and teachers and to positively change the image of school as an institution. The intervention was
meant to respond to the needs for capacity and professional development of headmasters and teachers and
brought to the fore the importance of early childhood education. The results and lessons generated by the
model were meant to inform the elaboration of new laws, standards and regulations applicable nationwide4.
QIE was developed in partnership by the Romanian Ministry of National Education and UNICEF Romania, and
implemented during September 2015 and June 2019 (4 school years), in Bacău County, in 51 schools from 44
communities in 37 urban5 and rural6 localities. To the initially 45 schools selected (one school/community), six
new school units from the same communities were added to the project in the school year 2017-2018.
The total budget allocated for QIE was approximately US 3 million (for the period 2015-2019) and the project
was implemented in partnership with the Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Pre-academic Education
(ARACIP), the Romanian Institute of Educational Sciences (IES7), “Impreuna” Community Development Agency
(Impreuna Agency), HOLTIS Association and “Step-by-Step” Centre for Education and Professional
Development at national level. Also, broad partnerships have been established at the level of Bacau County with
the County Council (CC), County School Inspectorate (CSI) and the County Center for Resources and Educational
Assistance (CJRAE).
QIE includes child-centred interventions at school, family and community levels. The education package is
universal, as all schoolchildren and schools may benefit from its interventions and of its results in terms of
quality education. The package is also modular, which means that it may be customized to the specific needs
of a school/community, and thus it could be applied in all types of schools. QIE focuses in several of its
components on children who are the most at-risk of dropout8.
The activities were grouped in 6 components, mentioned below.
1) School Management Component
2) Teaching and Learning Methods Component
3) Role Models (non-cognitive skills) Component
4) Parenting Support Component
5) Early Education Component
6) Micro-grant Component
Other activities implemented were:
a) Local communication and behaviour change campaign targeting public service providers from
administration, health, education and social sector for reducing stigma and discrimination against
Roma: capacity building of local professionals was enhanced in order to recognize and fight
discrimination related to the access of public services
b) Communication, Monitoring and Advocacy, activities carried out on a permanent basis.
QIE is a comprehensive integrated model consisting of a multitude of interventions, tackling various problems
and causes of absenteeism and dropout, with a clear focus on enhancing the quality and inclusiveness of
education (see figure 1 below). QIE includes several interventions and targets multiple groups of key right
holders (children, with a focus on children at risk, parents, preschool and school personnel) and duty bearers

QIE aimed to increase not only the quality of education but also all children’s participation in school.
The educational package had a universal character, all schoolchildren and all schools benefiting from the
interventions. In order to achieve equity, QIE addressed in particular the most vulnerable children in the
selected schools.
The model included child-centred interventions at school, family and community level, but also policy-related
interventions at national level. Implemented in Bacău Country, in the North-East Development Region of
Romania, the project reached the managerial teams of all participating schools, more than 1,500 teachers and
10,000 parents. All children in school benefited, directly (trough activities developed under mini-grants) or
indirectly (as a result of improved teaching and managerial techniques) of QIE interventions. Ministry of
Education and local institutions as duty bearers (i.e., the County Council (CC), County School Inspectorate (CSI)
and the County Center for Resources and Educational Assistance (CJRAE) benefited of activities at policy level
(i.e., technical assistance support for developing/modifying/evaluating strategies and legislation,
methodologies and new approaches).
The general objective of QIE was to step up efforts to achieve the right to education for all children,
especially the vulnerable ones, by improving the quality of teaching and school management, and by
mobilizing schools, families and communities to support school participation and provide support to
each child.
QIE aimed to:
• Improve the ability of headmasters and teachers to support each child, according to the latter’s needs;
• Improve teaching methods and tools;
• Create partnerships with children’s families and develop parenting skills;
• Mobilize communities to support education;
13
• Improve non-cognitive skills and child motivation;
• Encourage diversity among schoolchildren, regardless their gender, ethnicity, religion, (dis) ability and
socio-economic status.
The model addressed the bottlenecks and barriers to at-risk children’s and adolescents’ access to and retention
in education, at four key levels: system, community, family, and school. The approach focused on prevention
and participation.
1.2. Context of the intervention
In 2020, the World Bank classified Romania as a high-income country for the first time, based on 2019 data.
Ecpnomic growth in the country was robust in 2019, close to the previous year’s level, however, the Romanian
economy contracted by 3.9 percent in 2020, on the back of COVID-19-related expenditures and lower revenues
due to the economic downturn and tax relief. Rapid household assessments of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic showed a substantial rise in the share of the population at risk of poverty in April 2020, which
gradually declined until January 2021, as temporarily inactive workers returned to work. Poverty levels at the
start of 2021, however, remain elevated, linked to the combination of the sharp agricultural contraction and
the persistence of the pandemic.
The Social Scoreboard supporting the European Pillar of Social Rights points to a number of employment and
social challenges9. High economic growth has translated into improved social conditions and the de-
institutionalisation of children continues to show encouraging progress. However, poverty and social exclusion,
as well as in-work poverty, remain very high while income inequalities have increased. Social transfers have a
limited impact on poverty reduction. Inequalities persist, in particular for people in rural and disadvantaged
areas. The inactivity rate for women and early school leaving are also very high. The decentralisation of social
services has not been accompanied by the provision of proper financial allocations, thus hampering the
sustainability of service delivery.
At global level, QIE is directly linked to SDG No.4 – Quality Education, and contributes to Target 4.1, “By 2030,
ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to
relevant and effective learning outcomes”, Target 4.2, “By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to
quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary
education” but also, in long run, to Target 4.6, “By 2030, ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of
adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy”.
Overview of the education system in Romania - initial problem and inequities at the national level
According to the Romanian Partnership Agreement for the 2014‐2020 programming period10, Romania needs to
further improve its performance at all levels of education and training system due to realities such as: the
limited availability of early childhood education and care-services and, consequently, reduced participation or
disparities in participation; high rates of non-enrolment and school drop-out, especially among vulnerable
categories of pupils, including Roma, children with disabilities, children from rural areas and from poor
families; levels of school education in the compulsory education system, still below European averages.
The Country Report Romania 2020, European Semester11, respectively the Council Recommendation on the
2020 National Reform Programme of Romania12, identifies the main systemic problems that determine the low
performance in education:

• Underfunding and delayed reforms continue to hamper the equity, inclusiveness and quality of
education.
• Delays in the rationalisation and modernisation of the school infrastructure.
• Participation in early childhood education and care remains low.
• Participation in higher education is low and remains insufficiently aligned to labour market needs.
• The education system continues to face significant challenges in terms of quality and inclusiveness.
The equity, inclusiveness and quality of education remain important challenges and strategic reforms
in this area are needed.
• Acquisition of digital skills remains limited. Due to inadequate digital infrastructure, teaching
materials and insufficient digital skills, the shift to distance learning caused by the COVID-19 outbreak
poses challenges for education and training institutions, educators and schoolchildren, in particular
for disadvantaged schoolchildren and Roma.
• Teacher shortages, particularly in rural areas, together with limited continuous professional
development (CPD) opportunities, restrict the quality and inclusiveness of education.
• Romania has a high share of early leavers from education and training (15,3% in 2019). There is still
no integrated, nation-wide mechanism targeting early school leaving.
Limited financial commitment to education (3,2% of GDP in 2019, compared to the EU27 average of 4.6% in
201913) coupled with a lack of continuity and coherence of the educational reforms undermine children’s
access to quality inclusive education. The budget allocated to education has decreased, so in 2020 the initial
allocation was 2.7% of GDP. Also, for 2021, education receives 2.5% of GDP, according to the recently adopted
budget law.14 Investments in both infrastructure and institutional development for early education were still
very low, resulting in limited availability, quality and inconsistency in ante-preschool and pre-school education
with effects on enrolment and performance in the compulsory education system, which represents also a
barrier to the participation of parents (especially for women) in the labour market.
According to Eurostat data15, at 15,3 % in 2019 (slightly decreasing from 16,4 % in 2018), the rate of early
leavers from education and training (aged 18-24) remains one of the highest in the EU. In 2018 the participation
of children aged between 4 and the compulsory school age of 6 decreased slightly to 86.3 % (89,6% in 2017)
still below the Education and Training 2020 benchmark of 95 %. The participation rate in childcare (ages 0-3)
was 15.1% in 2019.
As regards participation, there are significant disparities at ethnic level (especially for Roma)16 and from a
territorial perspective. Dropout among Roma can also be explained due to high levels of poverty, limited
parental participation in education and lower qualifications of teachers in predominantly Roma schools. In
2016 Romania adopted an anti-segregation roadmap and revised legislation by expanding the focus from Roma
to a wider set of target groups (i.e., children with disabilities, from rural areas and from disadvantaged
backgrounds).
Even if education has seen improvements in recent years, according to the Education and Training Monitor
2018, Romanians are significantly behind the EU average for basic skills, which predicts later motivation and
school achievement. Although Romania’s PISA scores have improved since 2006, they are substantially lower
than other EU countries. Implementation of the competence-based curriculum is under way, but it is
incomplete. Only 57 % of young people aged 16-19 have basic or above basic digital skills (EU-28: 83 %)17.
1.3. Theory of change (ToC) of Quality Inclusive Education Initiative (QIE)
The Theory of Change (ToC) developed for Quality Inclusive Education package relies on implementing the
evidence-based solutions to the problems (bottlenecks and barriers to various vulnerable groups of children’s
participation in school education: children from rural areas, Roma children, children with disabilities and

special educational needs, children from families affected by poverty, etc.) identified at each level: system,
community, family and school. The model design, objectives and ToC were based on relevant literature in the
field of education, consultations with relevant stakeholders, as well as one previous modelling experience
tested by UNICEF in education (School Attendance Initiative).
Figure 2 below presents the QIE’s theory of change, in a concise manner. Although not required by the ToR, the
ToC was reconstructed in order to present in more detail the activities undertaken under QIE and how they
link to needs and problems identified and outcomes expected. The project, thus the input, activities and
outcomes presented below, cover three education levels, i.e. pre-school, primary and secondary.

1.4. Key stakeholders and their contributions
The evaluation and its outputs have three main categories of intended users:
(1) UNICEF as initiating organisation that designed the model, coordinated monitored and
evaluated activities implemented;
a. Implementing partners for QIE, i.e., the Institute of Educational Sciences (IES), The
Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Pre-academic Education (ARACIP), Step-
by-Step, Holtis, Împreună Agency) involved in the design of the model, as well as in
the implementation of several activities (capacity building, development of tools and
guidelines, monitoring);
(2) National decision makers (particularly Ministry of Education) involved in the design of the
model, as well as in project steering;
(3) County and local authorities, i.e., County School Inspectorate (CSI), County Centre for
Educational Support and Resources (CCREA) and County Council that aimed to contribute by
providing technical and methodological guidance to local professionals, while ensuring
complementarity of the model with institutional priorities and Bacău County Strategies;
(4) Schools and kindergartens and educational institutions’ managers, responsible for
creating school teams for the implementation of the QIE components at preschool, primary
and lower secondary level;
(5) NGOs that can either support local authorities or replicate the model themselves.
The key stekholders benefit of evaluation results depending on their role. Therefore:
(1) UNICEF which can use the evaluation to promote and/or reshape other/future models using
a similar approach;
(2) Implementing partners for QIE can apply lessons learned in shaping future similar activities,
some of them being already continued with support from other sources;
(3) Ministry of Education is a key beneficiary of this evalution as most recommendations are
meant to support this institution is effectively rolling out QIE at national level;
(4) County and local authorities that can replicate and/or continue the activities of QIE at
county and local level in line with the lessons learned and recommendations issued by this
evaluation, particularly during QIE roll out but also in other projects, EU - funded or supported
under different other initiatives. For scauthorities in other counties the evaluation report
constitutes an important source of information on how to implement QIE in their area.
(5) Schools and kindergartens and educational institutions’ managers in Bacău County may
build on the lessons learned in continuing QIE activities and/or future activities having the
same objective. For schools and kindergartens and educational institutions’ managers in other
county the evaluation report constitutes an important source of information on how to
implement QIE in their school.
(6) NGOs can apply lessons learned in shaping future similar activities or replicate the model
themselves.
The evaluation ensured the participation of key stakeholders, by involving them in data collection, as well
as in validation refinement of recommendations issued.
2. Evaluation purpose, objectives and scope
In accordance with the Terms of References (ToR), the purpose of this evaluation is „to assess whether the
underlying assumptions and objectives formulated in the Theory of Change for QIE [Quality Inclusive
Education] were validated and achieved as well as to ascertain whether QIE contributes to promoting the
child rights to quality inclusive education”. In this context, the main assumptions of the model evaluated rely
on the idea that the QIE implementation determines the development of quality education, and that the
most important feature of quality in education is its inclusiveness, generating in this way a better
observation of child rights.
The evaluation aims to be a key element in the process of promoting the scale-up of the QIE at national
level. The evidence generated by the evaluation will be used for advocacy and policy advice with authorities
and stakeholders at local, county and national levels including to the Ministry of Education, as regards in
developing and amending educational policies related to prevention of dropout, absenteeism and early
school leaving. The evidence generated will also be used to mobilize resources from the national and local
budgets, as well as for leveraging funds from the new EU Structural Funds 2014-2020 to ensure the
sustainability at local and county level and replicability of the model developed at national level.
In accordance with the Terms of References (ToR), the objectives observed by the evaluation are to:
• Evaluate relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact of the QIE component;
• Identify and document the key elements that contributed to the QIE success and replicability, as
well as main bottlenecks and barriers in implementation;
• Document key lessons learned in relation to the QIE implementation and propose
recommendations for improvement;
• Make recommendations for further actions related to sustainability, scalability of the QIE as a
whole or components of QIE throughout the country.
• Identify the way in which the QIE component is relevant and produced results in addressing
issues related to gender equality, equity and overall advancement of child rights
As a summative evaluation, and in line with the ToR provisions, the scope of the evaluation covers all QIE
components and activities and thus encompasses:
• QIE package of UNICEF modelling project18 in Bacau, as a standalone model,
• the period September 2015 – June 2019,
• all the 51 schools chosen from the 44 urban and rural communities in Bacău County, in 37
municipalities that were included in the project in two phases.
Within the purpose and the scope of the evaluation, its focus is to assess:
• how QIE package of the project is addressing the challenges faced by children, parents (or
other caregivers), teachers and the management of the targeted schools;
• changes and results of implementing QIE in relation with children, parents (or other
caregivers), teachers and the management of the targeted schools, but also other relevant
stakeholders at local, county and national level. The effects of the QIE are assessed considering
and using – when available – data from the baseline, the mid-term review and the existing
databases built by partners involved in the implementation of different QIE components
and taking into account the implementation of other interventions carried out in the same
period of time, having the same, partially the same or a similar target group;
• how QIE can be translated in plans for national scale-up to cover all the schools in Romania or
other educational institutions.
Considering the purpose, objectives and scope of the evaluation, the use of the evaluation is manifold:
• supporting the advocacy for scaling-up QIE at national level as a governmental policy,
involving the ministries that are part of the project steering committee and using the lessons
learned in modelling to design the best possible policy.
• providing assistance to the Ministry of Education in developing and amending educational policies
related to prevention of dropout, absenteeism and early school leaving and input the national
efforts for reaching the targets set for Romania by the EU 2020 Strategy.
• mobilizing resources from the national and local budgets, as well as for leveraging funds from the
EU Structural Funds 2014-2020 and planning for the period 2021-2027 to ensure the
sustainability at local and county level and replicability of the model as a package or of its
components developed at national level.
18 The model also includes the Minimum Package of Services component, that is not part of the current evaluation and
has beeen evaluated separately.
19
3. Evaluation methodology
Considering OECD-DAC criteria19, the evaluation specifically addressed the following categories of
questions, expected to provide accurate insights related to the evaluation objectives, scope and focus (see
table 1 below).
Table 1.Evaluation criteria and questions
DAC criteria Question under the criteria (as defined in the Terms of Reference)
Relevance • Are the activities and outputs of the modelling project consistent with the overall goal and its
objectives?
• To what extent has the modelling project been developed and implemented in line with the
key criteria for model projects?
• To what extent is the modelling project relevant to national policies and programmes and
cross-sectoral strategies20?
• Are all processes based on a child/human rights approach? Are any age and gender issues
considered in providing the services?
Effectiveness • Did the interventions of the modelling project address the needs identified at the level of the
most vulnerable children and families? Are any age and gender issues considered in providing
the services?
• Does the model contribute to the capacity development of the local educational units and
service providers at county level?
• Which parts of the modelling project are the most and least effective? What factors explain
success?
• Are there any unplanned outcomes worth considering for filling in capacity gaps and/or
addressing remaining bottlenecks?
Efficiency • Does the modelling project use resources in the most economical/efficient manner to achieve
expected results?
• What is the value added (in terms of financial value) of the modelling project?
• Are the cost implications for scaling up considered?
Sustainability • Are the interventions modelled likely to continue when external support is withdrawn?
• Is the modelling project replicable? Are any adjustments of the model needed for replication?
• What are the lessons learned at each level of intervention that should be considered for
implementation and further replication of the modelling project?
• What recommendations could be made to UNICEF and to the GoR to replicate and scale up
such a model?
Impact • What change did the modelling project determine or influence at the level of beneficiaries
(children and their families), educational units (schools, and kindergartens), communities,
professionals, public administration – at local, county and/or national level?
The evaluation questions under each criterion were further refined through judgement criteria, presented
in the evaluation matrix inserted in Annex 2.
The summative evaluation used a mixed methods design as follows, combining qualitative and quantitative
data collection and data analysis techniques. Triangulation was used in order to validate findings, including
the triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data collected but also the triangulation of data and
information from the same type of method: data collected through interviews and focus groups were
triangulated, as well as data from the survey and the counterfactual evaluation. Quantitative analyses of
secondary data preceded in most cases qualitative field data collection, to allow explanation of possible
different results through data collected during interviews, focus groups etc.
The list of risk factors that can influence the school participation and the academic level of the pupil, defined
at OECD level, was confirmed to a large extent by the National Risk Map of ARACIP. Several concerns in
identifying risks, areas or even schools that have schoolchildren from vulnerable backgrounds were
addressed, starting with the provisions of Ministerial Order no 6517/2012 on the approval of the
Methodology for external evaluation of the quality of education in pre-university education. Based on
19 http://www.oecd.org/dac/evaluation/daccriteriaforevaluatingdevelopmentassistance.htm

Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction, etc.
20
reporting on result indicators (i.e., survival rate from one year of study to another, school situation from
the end of the year, results from exams, continuity indicator from one level of education to another),
ARACIP defined risk indicators as related to: family (level of education, economic level, disorganized
families), pupil (Roma pupils, pupils with SEN, percentage with access to the library), teachers (continuous
education, mobility of teachers, qualified teachers), infrastructure (number of volumes in the library,
number of computers), absences (motivated and unmotivated). In the framework of QIE, IES defined the
criteria for vulnerable pupils in accordance with the philosophy promoted by ARACIP, with a view to clearly
identify children with more intensive needs.
3.1. Overview of methods used for data collection
3.2. Quantitative methods
The counterfactual approach
The counterfactual assessment was carried based on provided administrative data, respectively
conducting the Difference in Difference and Propensity Score Matching in order to compare targeted
schools (the treated group) in Bacău and schools in a control group (from Bacău and six schools in Galați
county) on indicators monitored by the Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Pre-university
Education (RAQAPUE) internal evaluation reports and SIIIR available data.
The variables used are:
• Enrolled students
• Schoolchildren with uncompleted school records
• Schoolchildren completing their graduation requirements by the end of the year
• Schoolchildren repeating grades
• Schoolchildren with SEN
• Roma schoolchildren
• 8th grade graduates
• Schoolchildren with graded abobe 5 at National Evaluation (8th grade).
As presented in detail in Annex 3, the counterfactual analysis was carried out for the entire population (the
entire treated and control group of all schools covered in Bacău and Galați) but also for a sub-group of
schools. In the latter case, in order to have a much better picture of the differences between groups, we
eliminated some of the 51 schools with a number of pupils above the margin of +/- 10% compared to the
number of schoolchildren enrolled in Galati schools. The objective of this second scenario was to compare
two more similar groups (treated and control) and thus underline better QIE impact.
The results of the counterfactual analysis were triangulated with the qualitative data collected with a view
to explain the net effect identified.
Exploratory data analysis
Data recorded by UNICEF and implementation partners concerning activity implementation and outputs
(i.e., participants in training, parental counselling and parental education), as well as a number of key
variables among data collected by the Institute for Educational Sciences (IES) on children at risk and
vulnerable children enrolled in the targeted schools were analysed using descriptive statistics (frequency
distribution, correlations). The variables selected for the analysis correspond to indicators in the
evaluation matrix regarding school results, obstacles in participating in school, family environment and
parents’ attitude towards school.
Surveys
5 surveys were conducted as follows:
1. a computer assisted web interviews (CAWI) survey with all headteachers in the 51 schools where
QIE was implemented
2. a CAWI survey applied to all teachers in the targeted schools
3. a CAWI survey applied to all kindergarten teachers in the targeted schools
4. a CAWI survey applied to a sample of 741 (241 more than initially envisaged)
children/schoolchildren, conducted in most schools.
21
5. a CAPI survey with a sample of 450 (200 more than initially envisaged) parents of schoolchildren,
conducted in all schools.
No sampling was necessary in the case of the first three surveys, as they covered the entire population of
the respective target group. The sampling for the survey among parents was carried out on the database of
10,727 parents participating in parental education classes, provided by Holtis, as project partner. The
sample was selected randomly, and survey results have a confidence level of minumum 95% and lower
margin error than 5%. The survey for children was exhaustive, but representativity of schools was ensured
(schoolchildren from all schools participated in survey and ruban-rural distribution was ensured).
The questionnaires used for the purpose of the 5 surveys are inserted in Annex 4. The results of all 5
surveys, divided by gender, school level (primary/secondary) and location (urban-rural) are inserted in
Annex 6.
3.3. Qualitative methods
The evaluation was based on the following qualitative methods: desk-based research, case studies,
interviews and focus groups involving professionals in schools, headmasters, parents and pupils, local
stakeholders, county stakeholders, national stakeholders from public authorities and partner NGOs.
Extensive desk research was carried out, involving the summary, collation and/or synthesis of existing
documents such as (for a complete list please see Annex 10):
• National laws, policies, action plans etc., county and local strategies
• Rapid assessment of the social, health and education status of children and adolescents and their
families in one county (Initial Assessment) to inform modelling in “Social inclusion through the
provision of integrated social services at community level”
• In-depth assessment of the social, health and education status of children and adolescents and
their families in one county to inform modelling in “Social inclusion through the provision of
integrated social services at community level” (2014)
• Independent mid-term review of the whole modelling project (2016)
• UNICEF programme materials, such as country programme documents, strategies, project
proposals and reports to the donors and documentation.

The desk-based research contributed to a deeper understating of the activities carried out and their effects,
the context of the evaluation and thus constituted an important source for reconstructing QIE achievements
and triangulating evidence collected through the remaining data collection tools.
At national level 10 interviews were carried out, with UNICEF, project partners (The Institute for
Educational Sciences (IES), The Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Pre-academic Education
(ARACIP), Step by Step, Holtis, Împreună Agency), Ministry of Education and Research (2 interviews),
World Bank and representative NGOs (2 interviews) (see Annex 4 for interview guide and Annex 5 for
participants list).
At country level 2 interviews with CSI and CJRAE were conducted, as well as 1 focus group with county
coordinators (see Annex 4 for interview guides and Annex 5 for participants list). The purpose of
interviews and focus group was to collect evidence in line with the evaluation matrix and triangulate them
with a view to formulate rigorous findings and conclusions.
Case study was a key methodological instrument applied in the framework of this evaluation, as part of the
mixed-method approach. Case study is the main method applicable in the case of theory-based evaluation
and brought added value in this case as it allowed to zoom-in on cases at school/community level and thus
assess what activities worked, for whom and how the context influences the outcomes expected and
obtained. The cases selected are representative for the 51 schools participating in QIE and, consequently,
the results of the case study are generalizable at project/QIE level.
22
Based on the quantitative data at disposal, collected from school annual reports, and on qualitative data
(good and less good examples mentioned in the 2015 in-depth assessment and project documents), the
selected schools take into consideration different dimensions:
• schools from 4 rural communities and 2 in urban
• schools with different rates of school participation (absences) and school dropouts in 2014-2015
• schools with different ethnic structures
• good and less good practices identified in the scoping interview
As a result, the following schools were part of the multiple case study:
7. Şcoala Gimnazială Zemes (high number of roma children, and very high number of absences, but
no children reported to dropout)
8. Şcoala Gimnazială Horgeşti (high number of absences, high number of children dropping out of
school, but considered a good practice by some QIE partner organisations)
9. Şcoala Gimnazială Frumoasa, Balcani (low number of absences, no children reported to dropout,
considered a good practice by some QIE partner organisations)
10. Şcoala Gimnazială Colonești (high number of absences, no children reported to dropout,
considered a less good practice by some QIE partner organisations)
11. Şcoala Gimnazială Nr. 2 Targu Ocna (high number of absences, but no children reported to dropout,
considered a good practice by some QIE partner organisations)
12. Şcoala Gimnazială "Dr. Alexandru Safran" (moderate number of absences, no children reported to
dropout, considered a less good practice by some QIE partner organisations)
The 6 case studies21 carried out were based on the following instruments (see case study instruments
inserted in Annex 4 and Case study reports in Annex 7):
o 6 focus group with teachers (one FG for each case, carried out face-to-face or online)
o 6 focus group with children (one FG for each case, carried out face-to-face or online)
o 6 focus group with parents (one FG for each case, carried out face-to-face or online)
o 13 individual interviews with teachers (roughly 2 interviews with teachers for each case,
carried out face-to-face or online)
o 11 individual interviews with kindergarten teachers (roughly 2 interviews with
kindergarten teachers for each case, carried out face-to-face or online)
o 6 interviews with headmasters (1 interview for each school in the case study)
o 5 interviews with parental educators (roughly 1 interview for each case – in some cases
teachers are also parental educators)
o 3 interviews with school counsellors (in schools where there was a school counsellor)
o 1 interview with school mediator (in Horgesti)
o 2 interviews at the community level with representatives of the mayor/city-hall as
institution involved in the school management (where possible)
o interviews with 1 dropout, identified in the communities (only in Zemes)
Applying a variety of instruments strengthened the external validity of the case study and its contribution
to the evaluation findings and conclusions.
3.4. Methodological limitations to the evaluation
The evaluation was undertaken during the crisis triggered by COVID pandemic, which had important
implications for the education system in Romania. Switching to on-line schooling and the uncertainty
regarding the possibility of returning to school created a context less conducive to evaluation. However,
the methodology planned could be applied to a very large extent. Most instruments were deployed on-line
21 See Annex 1 for details on the methodology applied for case studies selection.
23
(and in this respect on-line schooling helped evaluation as the stakeholders involved already had a degree
of understanding and were used to working with virtual communication platforms).
Face-to-face data collection was carried out in open air, using the September 2020 “window”, when school
began and the second pandemic wave had not started yet. The only changes to the methodology relate to
the approach taken to survey among parents and children. Initially planned face-to-face, these were
ultimately carried out by phone and on-line, however, ethical considerations were respected (i.e., children
received the survey link via schools and parents and could not fill it out without parental consent). To
counteract this methodological change, more answers than initially planned were collected, and
representativity of answers was ensured (by school, and location, i.e., rural/urban). At the same time, only
one focus group (instead of two) per case study with parents and children was carried out but this did not
affect the evaluation validity as multiple triangulations was ensured.
Where baselines were not available, administrative data was used or questions in the survey were
formulated in such a manner that progress is indicated (in 2020 compared to 2015). For example, changes
of attitude, values and awareness, at the level of teachers, children (including adolescents) and parents
were very difficult to measure, as there is no baseline on these dimensions.
Effects on vulnerable children, as sub-target group, could be assessed quantitatively to a more limited
extent. The database of vulnerable children constructed with teachers’ support in the framework of QIE
registers 8.130 schoolchildren, on average 2000 / school year. There is a complete set of data (namely 8
questionnaires or 2 questionnaires per child per school year for each of the 4 years covered by the project)
only for 43 out of the 8130 schoolchildren. For a similar number, 6 or 4 questionnaires out of 8 were to be
found in the database. In this context, we analysed the improvements in the situation of vulnerable children
as a group, i.e., we compared the situation of monitored vulnerable children in the school year 2014-2015
to their situation in 2018-2019. We further triangulated these results with qualitative data collected in the
framework of case studies. At the same time, information referring to Roma children and schoolchildren
could be collected only indirectly, from teachers, headteachers, mayors, as participants to focus groups did
not declare themselves as of Roma ethnicity.
The available administrative data on schoolchildren/children were not disaggregated by gender in all
cases. In order to counteract this state of affairs, all primary data collected was disaggregated by gender
and gender-differentiated analyses were carried out.
Observation in schools (attendance to classes and observation of children and children-teacher interaction
dynamics) could not be undertaken as it was forbidden by law during pandemic times.
The risk of bias was, though, limited, as multiple triangulation was ensured during secondary analysis and
findings of the evaluations are based multiple data sources: documents, quantitative data analysis and
survey results.
3.5. Ethical considerations
Along the data collection, analysis and reporting, in order to ensure the integrity of evaluation, special
attention was paid by evaluators towards respecting the ethical standards of UNICEF, as presented in the
“Procedure on Ethical Standards in Data Collection, Evaluation and Research “ and “UNICEF Procedures for
Ethical Research Involving Children”, particularly concerning: the harms and benefits, informed consent,
privacy and confidentiality, payment and compensation, conflict of interests (for more details see Annex
12).
The instruments and methodology to be used for data collection, as well as the evaluation report as such,
underwent an external review by independent experts (inserted in Annex 11).

4. Main findings – Relevance
4.1. EQ 1. Are the activities and outputs of the modelling project consistent with the overall
goal and its objectives?22
According to the project documents, the Quality Inclusive Education Package (QIE) as part of the “Social
inclusion through the provision of integrated social services at community level” model, contributes to
UNICEF's mission, i.e. to support the advancement of the rights of vulnerable children, including Roma
children, to inclusive education, basic health, education and social protection services in Romania, to be
fulfilled together with the Minimum Package of Services (MPS)23. Focused on education, QIE addresses, at
the same time, the development of quality education and school participation for all children, especially of
children in vulnerable situations.
The project is based on a detailed analysis of the social and educational context of child vulnerabilities in
Romania, with relevant statistics that emphasize the communities in major deficit in terms of achieving
children's rights to education, inclusion and equity. As mentioned in the mid-term evaluation report of
UNICEF24 and confirmed by the data collected through the interviews with UNICEF partners for the
implementation of QIE, from the design phase, ensuring the relevance of the interventions for target groups
in relation to their real needs, very different from one community to another.
The analysis of project documentation, in particular project proposals and progress reports, reveals that
the main objectives25 and directions of QIE activities are constantly addressed and are relevant in
relationship with the UNICEF`s integrated intervention model. The concentration of QIE interventions
around the school as a complex and essential structural resource for the community gives this component
an increased relevance.
In-depth interviews with UNICEF partners highlight the fact that QIE capitalised to a large extent on the
experience of previous projects, i.e. School Attendance Initiative (SAI), in developing the model’s theory of
change and in its implementation. Consequently, on tested previous experience, The outcomes, the target
groups of the intervention at all levels (system, community, family, school, child / schoolchild) and the 6
key components of the intervention (School Management, Teaching and Learning Methods, Role Models,
Early Education, Parenting Support, Micro-grants) were adequately defined or created. The implementation
of the project with the support of partners with national experience in the areas covered by QIE (most of
them having experience also with the previous model, i.e. SAI), has the major benefit of a good
substantiation of problems and needs of target groups; that, in turn, creates the premises for a relevant
response and the necessary flexibility in design and implementation phases. Moreover, the continuity of
activities and approaches creates positive premises for further development of relevant and efficient public
policies by the responsible actors.
The project documents and interviews mention that each component of the intervention acts transversally
(all levels) and that there was a progressive development of the theory of change (see answer to EQ2),
based on regular annual assessments.
The evaluation identified a strong focus on actions regarding the school as the main agent of the proposed
change, compared to the typology and scope of actions located strictly at the level of community
representatives. The interview with UNICEF representatives clarifies the fact that the initiator assumes an
approach that focuses the interventions on current school activities26, without additional curricula and in
line with recent curricular developments.
Qualitative and quantitative evidence collected by the evaluation on QIE stakeholders (pupils, parents,
teachers and support staff, headmasters, stakeholders at county and national level), show that all

25
components and activities implemented in their framework have had since the outset a high level of relevance
for the identified needs at the level of the target groups. We briefly present the main research data that
substantiate this overall finding:
• Relevance of QIE relative to the general level of addressability, i.e. all schoolchildren, with special
attention to schoolchildren at risk of dropping out, regardless of the area of residence:
Data from the survey with educators, teachers and headmasters show that, in most cases, the profile of the
groups / classes / schools lead to the need of adapting the curriculum and management to a different and
challenging context. In the overall project context, focused on quality of the educational act, particular
vulnerabilities of children/schoolchildren were also considered in designing and implementing QIE
activities27.
Most schools (approx. 80%, according to headmasters participating in survey) face situations of school
dropout or major absenteeism. About 6% of the schoolchildren participating in the survey say that they
had considered dropping out of school, the trend being more obvious in the case of boys from urban area.
Qualitative research revealed corrective aspects of the component - inclusion for all. For example, one
parent stated that, unlike the differentiation (considered unfair in his case) common in social interventions,
in QIE “all children and parents were equal” (in the sense of benefits and participation in activities, without
applying positive discrimination).
• (Continued) Relevance of objectives, respectively of QIE’s activities in relation to the needs / risks
acknowledged at the level of pupils, parents and teachers, of the school management and of the
community representatives - responsibilities and needs of education / training / support.
Parents and schoolchildren participating in the survey are similarly aware of the need for higher education
in order to be successful in life: less than 1 % of schoolchildren participating in the survey consider that
education is not important, about 10% consider that 10 grades are enough, 20% aspire only to high school
/ vocational school and about 70% want to pursue higher education. Regarding the responsibility for
children's school participation, parents (99%) consider that the family has the main responsibility (i.e.
confirming the relevance of parental education), then teachers (94%) (i.e. confirming the relevance of
activities directed at this target group) and to a much lesser extent an important role is assigned to: the
school counsellor (37%), the priest (34%), the school mediator (31%) and to local authorities (7%).
According to the schoolchildren surveyed, the primarily responsible are the parents and the schoolchildren
themselves (approx. 65%). Parents are of the opinion that largely the family (99%) and school (94%) are
responsible in this case28.
From a managerial perspective, the first three considerations underlying the school’s decision to
participate in the project were (in this order, according to headmasters): that the programme provided
supports the improvement of quality in education, that they were seeking solutions for pupils / children at
risk of school dropout and the fact that the programme came with a complete package of measures.
Qualitative data show that a specific need was to increase visibility in the community and to overcome
inter-institutional difficulties in the community or in relation to the "center", i.e. town hall and County
Inspectorate. Compared to the urban area, for rural schools it was significantly more important that QIE
could support social inclusion at school level, obtaining additional resources for schools (i.e. this being a
need expressed also by community leaders especially the mayors) and solving some of their administrative
problems / difficulties.
• Relevance of activities in relation with the types of measures addressed by the intervention -
counselling / consultancy, training, relational / interpersonal learning, educational activities
Pupils consider that in order to overcome the difficulties / risks, they need extra / adequate help at school,
attractive extracurricular activities and exchange of experience, friendly teachers and more understanding
27 According to educators, teachers and headmasters, the main vulnerabilities of children / pupils come from situations
related to commuting to school, precarious socio-economic situation or pupils whose parents are working abroad for
an indefinite period of time and, less frequently, from such situations as belonging to ethnic minorities, repeating
grades, having disabilities, having addictions or committing acts of serious violence. At the elementary school level (i.e.
school classes V to VIII) there is an increase in the frequency of situations of remigrant schoolchild/children or
schoolchild/children with addictions, compared to previous levels of education.
28 See question 15 in the survey among parents. Multiple choice was permitted.
26
for pupils who are different. In fact, the most appreciated activities were trips and visits to other schools
within the microgrants and meetings with role models.
After overcoming the initial reluctance to participate in parenting education activities, parents gained a
very positive perspective towards the project. Qualitative research data frequently capture the confessions
of parents who initially invoked the lack of time and then would not want the parental education meetings
to be over.
From the perspective of school needs, according to teachers' perception, the most useful activities are
considered, in this order: microgrants, didactic training, technical assistance for microgrants, training in
parenting counselling and parenting education. Headmasters and teachers offered the strongest
appreciation of measures related to process management and the development of school ethos and climate,
rather than those aimed at functional management: clarification of educational interventions to reduce the
risk of school dropout of schoolchildren from vulnerable groups, clarification of the situation of each school
pupil at risk, diversification of types of activities (school and extracurricular), development of work teams
at the school level, increasing participation of schoolchildren from vulnerable groups in educational
activities, development of parenting counselling services at the school level, exchange of good practices
between schools, diversification of educational resources (teaching materials needed to work with pupils),
development of a friendlier school climate, increasing the prestige of the school at the community level,
developing friendships / mutual support between pupils, diversification of the school / curricular activities
types and the development of teachers didactic competences focused on children at major risk of dropping
out.
At the local community level, follow-up activities to parenting education sessions / workshops - in which
groups of pupils and parents carried out voluntary and charitable activities in the community- were identified
as being the most relevant.
• The relevance of the activities in relation to the scale and resources needed to achieve the objectives
From this perspective, most teachers and headmasters consider that the most relevant activities were the
teacher training activities in the area of teaching skills (early education, primary and secondary education),
parenting activities, successful role models, increasing self-esteem and motivation for learning, skills
development activities in the area of parenting, the contest "Joy of learning".
Regarding the activities addressed to school management, the most relevant sub-activities were the
trainings carried out during the annual school visits and those developed during the regional workshops.
According to the research data, all categories of activities were relevant to QIE objectives in terms of types of
participants directly or indirectly involved - pre-schoolchildren and pupils, teachers, headmasters and parents.
Most of activities targeted teachers, which is normal for interventions carried out in school as change agent:
training for teaching skills, transdisciplinary skills, microgrants, training and parenting activities. The
qualitative data collected from the level of school communities, subjects of case studies emphasize that the
QIE implementation period was very intense and packed with diverse elements, “with guaranteed fears
and satisfactions” (microgrant coordinating teacher), in which the teachers participating in the project
have discovered more types of interventions and where the headmasters were involved in all components,
which allowed a better management of activities.
Some additional activities were needed in order to reach the set objectives
According to the mid-term evaluation report of the integrated community model in Bacău29, from the initial
phase, QIE has already presented its first promising results. The qualitative data, collected throughout the
current evaluation, confirm that simply identifying, in an adequate manner, problems and needs at the level
of each school (i.e. trough the initial external evaluation carried out by ARACIP) has provided more in-
depth information than an overall needs analysis at the level of all communities involved and allowed for
rapid interventions from the beginning in the case of children at risk.
According to the project implementation partners, extending the target group to all pre-schoolchildren and
schoolchildren, as well as introducing a child-centred approach, i.e. focus on both quality and inclusion,
thus considering all, not only vulnerable children, was a challenge even though most knew and
implemented the previous model (SAI). They also needed to find the right solutions to new situations such
as: the inclusion of other 6 schools later on in the project, increasing the number of training beneficiaries,
29 The Romanian Academy, the Research Institute for Quality of Life, Interim evaluation of the “Social inclusion through
the provision of integrated social services at community level” model (October 2014 – December 2016),
27
extended activities and increased resources. For example, according to the representative of the
organization that implemented the preschool education component, even if the number of core schools of
the intervention was 51, in fact the number of kindergartens / in which the implementation took place was
156. These realities led to an increase in the number of activities and resources involved.
The large number of types of activities implemented and their complexity have created management
challenges at school level. In this context, the training and consulting sessions of the school headmasters
represented the “binder of all the components of the project” (according to a representative of the
organization that implemented the management component).
An initially unplanned activity, although its results were targeted by the microgrants component, was the
technical assistance for developing project applications, which was implemented at the request of schools
which were considering different types of projects.
Following the TOC analysis, more precisely the analysis of the relationship between, on one hand, the
identified problems and the solutions proposed by QIE and, on the other hand, the activities programmed
within the implemented package, we have identified complex aspects that would have required additional
activities. For example, issues30 such as the lack of horizontal cooperation between different sectors at
community level (i.e., child protection, social, health, local governance, education), the inadequate
management of social and ethnic diversity frequently encountered in many communities or the lack of
systematic and sustainable approaches towards integration of children with disabilities at community level
would have benefited of specific QIE activities such as methodologies, tools and trans-intervention procedures,
coherent with activities carried out under MPS component of the model. .
The desk research on the project documents reveals that, in addition to interventions at school, family and
community levels, the QIE package includes monitoring and evaluation activities which provide the
necessary evidence to adjust activities, but also to review or develop relevant public policies in order to
increase education quality and school participation in the Romanian system of education. Monitoring is an
essential type of activity for the regular adjustment of the intervention, so that it can be replicated in other
communities. Adjusting TOC during the intervention had the advantage of adapting to different types of
schools and communities, but it has made the monitoring process for documenting the intervention more
difficult. The primary qualitative and secondary data used by this evaluation support the need to amplify
the activities of monitoring the quality of interventions at child level.
According to qualitative research data, meeting the needs of members of the school community requires
additional interventions in the following areas:
• Extending and adjusting the training programme for distinct groups of teachers - for example
entry-level teachers or teachers with insufficient initial training and with topics that complement
the courses supply - for example in the arts curricular area (for teachers) or ICT for digitization;
• Continuation / increase of teacher training (not courses) with activities directly aiming the
development of soft skills (e.g. communication and interaction with schoolchildren);
• Activities for experiential learning (i.e., learning through experience) of inclusive approaches for
teachers, in particular to accommodate large differences between pupils (poor performance / high
performance, typical schoolchildren / schoolchildren with SEN);
• Continuous support activities (mentoring / coaching) for kindergarten teachers as regards
counselling children and families facing intersectoral (child protection, social, health) problems;
• Support activities (supervision) for parental educators, to mobilise parents’ participation in
parental education sessions and to manage difficult cases in this regard;
• Activities to ensure the continuity of parents' involvement in their children's long-term lives - for
the critical periods of puberty and adolescence;
• Activities at the level of local authorities to raise awareness on educational issues in the
community - for example in order to optimize the transition from secondary school to high school
(social scholarships for at-risk schoolchildren admitted to high school, providing transportation
where the high school is in other locality) or to the continuous participation of the parents in the
parenting education sessions.
Overall, in order to cover the size of the target groups addressed by the QIE objectives, the outputs were
multiplied for each group, i.e. the number of sessions / actions and/or the number of participants were
increased. As for vulnerable children, it is not clear enough to what extent the tools for identifying child
30 UNICEF, Quality Inclusive Education Model’s Theory of Change
28
vulnerabilities (AURORA) and the Dropout Risk Assessment Sheet used in QIE schools are complementary,
or to what extent a correlation with the AURORA methodology at school level is desired.
According to qualitative research data, meeting the needs of school community members requires
supplementing the outputs/results in the following areas:
• Development of (case) management mechanisms to ensure that a child at risk receives all
necessary support;
• Development of more materials to promote the necessary change in educational practices –
customised / practical / applied to actual situations, with examples relevant to the specific
types of community needs;
• Additional teaching support materials - major need especially in rural areas and for
kindergartens;
• Creating an online platform through which educators can see the activities of other educators,
to improve peer learning;
• Additional mechanisms for cooperation with local institutions (with the mayor's office) and
more applied cooperation with social assistance services.
Consulted stakeholders agree that activities and outputs were of the necessary quality to ensure
achievement of objective
All stakeholders largely agree that QIE activities and outcomes have the necessary quality to achieve the
proposed objectives, and the integrated approach and human resources such as school counsellors and
headmasters make a difference when it comes to the goals of inclusion and quality in education. It is also
agreed that QIE implemented targeted schools as a whole within the community context and did not focus
on teachers, only.
According to interviews carried out, QIE transformed the concept of “child-friendly school” in a
responsibility of the school. The interviews with stakeholders from all levels highlight that an important
quality of the intervention in terms of relevance is that it has developed broad contexts focused on learning
and collaborative interactions between traditionally separate groups (pupils, teachers, parents, institutions
such as ARACIP), which have generated a redefining of this relationships for the benefit of the child. Moreover,
adapting the intervention during the process was the optimal solution (alternative to standardizing the
intervention) for addressing the local identified needs.
4.2. EQ 2. To what extent has the modelling project been developed and implemented in
line with the key criteria for model projects?
The answers to this evaluation question will directly contribute to knowledge creation and management at
UNICEF level as regards the design of and implementation lessons learned on modelling projects. Taking
into account the innovative character of modelling projects, increased attention needs to be paid to its
initial design (including the problem/needs assessment based on which the intervention logic,
implementation strategy and targets are set) as well as to its monitoring during implementation, aimed to
quickly react to changes in the project context, target group, partnerships. The analyses to be undertaken
will take into account the criteria defined by UNICEF for modelling projects (inserted below), and the
indicators formulated for each of these criteria as inserted in the next column. The assessment will be based
mostly on project documentation and qualitative data collected through interviews at national and county
level.
Criteria defined by UNICEF for modelling projects:
1. The existence of a clear Theory of Change. 1.2. The level of clarity and the existence of a common/
shared understanding of the ToC among partners and stakeholders
2. The existence of a baseline for the evaluation of the model. The extent to which the existent
baseline is useful for the present evaluation
3. The extent to which all relevant partners were involved in the design and implementation of the
model.
4. The involvement of appropriate human resources in the implementation of the model, according
to the objectives set.
5. Existence of a resource management plan (general, referring to human, financial, organizational
resources) developed by UNICEF and partners, with a view to scaling up the model.
29
6. The existence of a monitoring and evaluation system and a documenting plan/strategy for the
model. Existence of evaluations and documenting papers
7. The existence of a termination and exit plan/strategy
8. The existence of a dissemination plan/strategy
9. The extent to which human and child rights are represented in all existing model plans/strategies
Criterion 1. Is there a clear theory of change of the model, outlining main hypothesis, inputs, objectives
and expected results that are conducive to a scale-up?
As presented also in the previous chapter, the theory of change of QIE is, to a large extent, adequate. Needs
and problems were extensively identified, at all levels (education system, community, families, schools,
children), building on previous similar interventions and extensive experience of UNICEF in Romania.
Ultimate, long term and medium-term outcomes were formulated in ToC provided as annex to ToR, as well
as short-term outcomes at school / preschool, family, individual and community level. Preconditions and
assumptions were identified, and the evidence collected, presented in the next chapters, validate their
realism. No explicit risks were identified in the design phase but they were swiftly identified and mitigated,
to the extent possible, in implementation (e.g. institutional instability at county level).
Adjustments in the design of QIE, in terms of activities and how components complemented each other
were meant and to ensure that resources are uses in the most effective way, by addressing as specifically
as possible the needs at the levels involved, particularly for schools, teachers and schoolchildren, but also
communities.
The most significant adjustment brought to the ToC refers to a shift in focus, from “enhanced participation
to education of the vulnerable groups of children” to “quality education”, which contains the element of
“inclusion”, but is beneficial for all, not only vulnerable students. Absenteeism and dropout have remained
key outcomes to be achieved, and UNICEF’s interventions at school, community and policy level are directly
linked and can contribute in this regard.
Criterion 2. Was there a baseline established initially, or in early stages of the implementation to
assess progress against expected results?
A thorough “In-depth assessment of the social, health, and education status of children and their families
in target areas of the Bacău county” was carried out before the QIE started implementation. The assessment
covered 19 indicators on three dimensions (school attendance, transition to high-school and adulthood and
infrastructure: schools' functioning authorization), for which data was collected from administrative
sources (at school level – for the 45 schools initially part of the project) and/or trough questionnaires from
parents and children.
The assessment could be partially used for the purpose of this summative evaluation, for which
administrative data for the same or similar indicators could be collected and used. The values of indicators
constructed based on data collected from representative samples of children and parents could be used to
a very limited extent, as the later evaluations could not apply methods on the same sample as for the in-
depth assessment (although questionnaires were aligned, as much as possible, to previous sets). The mid-
term review made a modest contribution in the direction of a baseline adjustment, with a view to facilitate
monitoring and evaluation of effects and impacts. Baseline data for the 6 schools later introduced in QIE
were not collected.
Criterion 3. Were all relevant partners involved in the design and implementation of the model?
Based on evidence collected, partnership, communication and coordination at national level functioned
smoothly and contributed greatly to QIE’s success.
Project partners met regularly and this contributed to aligning (time and content-wise) activities to be
implemented in schools under each component (while still preserving the identity of each partner)31. A
coordination mechanism was not in place under the project preceding QIE, and thus it was constructed and
evolved during project implementation. At a later stage in the project the QIE platform (www.qie.ro) was
created, with major added value from several perspectives, including communication and coordination
31 Based on interviews carried out with project partners.
30
among partners, but also the implementation of QIE/QIE transition activities as well as monitoring and
evaluation (at activity level). Having such a platform was a key lesson learned under QIE.
At national level the model Steering Committee (covering both MPS and QIE) met twice a year, and was an
important vehicle to ensure the involvement of national stakeholders, including MoNE, but also to
communicate on development at local level, results and build towards scaling up. One noteworthy aspect
is the participation of Students Council in the Steering Committee; in this manner the voice of children
could be heard, in line with UNCEF principles.
At local level participants to interviews and focus groups organised underlined the involvement of teachers
and headmasters in the refinement of the project design, for all components. Involvement was not uniform,
certain schools being more active and open compared to other, however, it increased in many cases when
results become visible. At this stage also the interest of other schools to participate in QIE was expressed.
A similar dynamic was visible in cooperating with local authorities.
At country level partners were involved, but communication and coordination with the Country Council
was more constant. The frequent changes at the level of School Inspectorate affected to a certain extent the
partnership with this key education institution.
Criterion 4. Are there any clear specifications related to the human resources required for the
implementation of the model?
The evaluation did not identify a specific analysis and clear specifications related to human resources
required for the implementation of the model. This can be explained by the fact that QIE partners are the
most relevant and qualified, and in many cases, pioneers in the areas covered. They ensured the necessary
human resources and had the capacity to address arising needs with a certain degree of flexibility, e.g. the
“Împreună” Agency extended its activity to non-discrimination an all grounds, not only on ground of
ethnicity and delivered technical assistance for grant applications.
Evidence collected strongly suggest that the country coordinators have had a pivotal role in QIE’s smooth
and successful implementation. The support they made available to schools in implementing all activities
under all components preserved the integrated character of the interventions, facilitated synergies and
contributed to activities sustainability after project closure. Maintaining the position of “county
coordinator” in scaling up QIE, and select the most suitable persons for this role, will be a necessity for its
success.
The complexity of the project also requires sufficient human resources in terms of coordination and
management, at national, country and project/component level. QIE evaluation reinforces and underlines
even stronger the need to have sufficient school councillors in place to cover the schoolchildren’s needs,
particularly in vulnerable and remote areas.
Criterion 5. Is there an analysis and estimated resources (human, financial, organizational) for
scaling up?
Extensive analyses have been carried out to scaling up QIE32. The analyses took into consideration activities
to be carried out as well as types of expenditures (e.g., core activities such as parental education, teachers
training, organisational costs for meetings necessary to prepare model implementation, management costs,
facilitators etc.). Calculations were made also per unit of target audience (e.g., student, parent, teacher) but
also by year, (i.e. how much scaling up would cost in the first year) and as percentage of MoE budget, to
underline the cost effectiveness of the model (see answer to EQ11 for more details).
Criterion 6. Is there a clear monitoring and evaluation mechanism of the model, ensuring proper
documentation of progress and lessons learned?
A monitoring system allows the on-going / regular data collection and examination of the inputs, outputs
and results of a public interventions and provides the management with input for decisions to be taken and
ensure efficiency and effectiveness. The monitoring process oversees the general progress of supported
activities, facilitates the comparison of performance against targets, and, when former departs from the
targets initially set, identifies problems and proposes solutions / corrective actions.
Although a wealth of data (qualitative and quantitative) was produced during implementation, for each
project component33, the strategy of QIE was to focus on the flexibility of the intervention and

31
implementation as such, and not necessarily on a strict monitoring through a fully-fledged indicator system
(e.g. based on indicators for which data was collected at school level in the “In-depth Assessment of the
Social, Health, and Education Status of Children and their Families in Target Areas of the Bacău County”
mentioned above). A limited number of QIE related indicators was set up in documents related to funds
obtained from donors and in this case baselines and targets are missing. UNICEF aimed to ensure
monitoring and evaluative data on schools’ progress through ARACIP’s external evaluations. These have
been carried out in the first part of the project but were not repeated, regularly or at the end of the project.
Therefore, they could not be used for a before-and-after analysis.
However, the evaluation found that reports produced in the framework of the project (by partners and
particularly by county coordinators) contain a wealth of information very relevant and useful for assessing
results and take corrective measures, if needed. County coordinators reported regularly on the activities
undertaken and monitoring visits at local level have been frequently carried out by both county
coordinators and UNICEF responsible personnel. Regular reports were issued for the overall model, for the
donors involved and to feed into the works of the Steering Committee34.
The evaluation has identified noteworthy set of materials prepared to document QIE. Additional to
comprehensive documents covering both QIE and MPS, i.e., “Documenting the Bacau model” and the Mid-
term Review Report, a “QIE Manual” and a “Good practice collection” were elaborated. The former presents
activities implemented, as well as developments, challenges and obstacles encountered. The former is
developed by country coordinators and presents a number of concrete cases/activities, for each
component, selected on a clear set of criteria. Both materials could have been used to better disseminate
QIE, its activities, benefits and lessons learned (see criterion no. 8).
In this context, carrying out separate summative evaluations for MPS and QIE might have disadvantages
from the perspective of the overall model assessment, but it contributes significantly to the adequate
documentation of both components, and thus of QIE.
Criterion 7. The existence of a termination date and plan
QIE termination date was clear and a dedicated exit strategy for the project was put in place already in
2017. Exit elements were put in place also in documentation for donors involved35.
Technical actions within the reach of UNICEF and its partners were planned for the years 2018, 2019, 2020,
in the framework of a “phasing down / phasing over approach”36. For 2018 a more concrete set of actions
and action plan was developed and discussed in dedicated meetings. There is no evidence that the exit
„strategy” was adjusted during the project lifetime (i.e., in 2019 and 2020), to take into account the
experience gained in this process in 2018.
Criterion 8. The existence of a dissemination plan/strategy
In terms of communication and dissemination, the overall modelling project (including both QIE and MPS)
contained a third, cross-cutting component, i.e., Communication and Advocacy. A Communication Plan (for
both QIE and MPS) was drafted as part of the EEA and Norway grants projects, financing the modelling
project.
Several types of dissemination activities were planned in this context (e.g., launching events, important site
visits, including of UNICEF Romania Goodwill Ambassador and media representatives, paper and video
materials, Human Interest Stories etc.). However, the Plan does not contain QIE specific dissemination
activities, and key messages defined are MPS-related.
Based on interviews and documentary review, the evaluation identified an important number of
communication and dissemination initiatives rolled out for QIE by UNICEF and/or project partners, e.g., a
dedicated brochure was developed, specifying its main objectives, partners, and financial strategy; HOLTIS
widely promoted parental education classes, nationally and locally, trough relevant educations bodies and
institutions but also mass-media.
However, evidence collected indicate that there is room for improvement as regards promoting more
extensively QIE activities, philosophy and results, particularly as they were perceived as highly relevant
and successful and were continued in other settings by project partners or other entities, particularly NGOs.

32
Overall, QIE was not very visible in the wider context of UNCEF overall and MPS-related communication
endeavors.
Criterion 9. The extent to which human and child rights are represented in all existing model
plans/strategies
Please see the answer to EQ 4. “Are all processes based on a child/human rights approach? Are any age
and gender issues considered in providing the services?”
4.3. EQ 3. To what extent is the modelling project relevant to national policies and
programmes and cross-sectoral strategies?
According to project documents and data resulting from interviews with stakeholders at national and local
level, the criterion of relevance of QIE objectives, activities and results in relation to the European framework,
and with strategies and legislation at national level, is satisfied to a very high extent. Three elements specific
to the context and framework of this project contributed to the relevance of QIE: (i) the UNICEF’s vision
and significant role, as the organization is connected at international level with European humanist and
common values in the area of education; (ii) the wide perspective and significant national and international
experience of UNICEF’s partners in the project and (iii) the traditional partnership of UNICEF with the
Ministry of Education in developing and implementing educational policies, as well as partnerships
established before and during the development of the project with relevant institutions at national level
(Ministry of Education, Ministry of European Investments and Projects, IES, ARACIP) and local (CSI, CJRAE,
local authorities).
Alignment of QIE with the objectives of the relevant European framework and conclusions and
recommendations for Romania under the European Semester
In order to enhance cooperation at European level in terms of policy formulation, the Education and
Training 2020 Framework sets out, among its four common objectives, to improve the quality and efficiency
of education and training and promote equity, social cohesion, and active citizenship. It also supports the
achievement, by 2020, of the following benchmarks at European level: at least 95% of children should
participate in early childhood education and the rate of early leavers from education and training aged 18-
24 should be below 10%37.
Recent developments at EU level outline the need for early intervention and a preventive approach, to
reduce the risk of poverty and social exclusion and to ensure access and participation in school:
• Recommendation on Investing in children breaking the cycle of disadvantage (2013) stresses the
importance of early intervention and an integrated preventative approach and to develop
integrated strategies for improving access to affordable early childhood education and care
services, provide adequate income support such as child and family benefits, which should be
redistributive across income groups but avoid inactivity traps and stigmatisation, support
children’s participation in extra-curricular activities and in legal decisions affecting them.
• Council Recommendation on promoting common values, including education and the European
dimension of teaching (2018) stresses the importance of inclusive education for all Learners,
notably by: including all Learners in quality education from early childhood and throughout life;
providing the necessary support to all Learners according to their particular needs, including those
from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds; enable educational staff to promote common
values and deliver inclusive education through promoting initial and continued education,
exchanges and peer learning and peer counselling activities as well as guidance and mentoring for
educational staff.
• In December 2017, the European Council, European Parliament and the Commission endorsed the
adoption of the European Pillar of social rights. The agreement highlights the importance of the
social, educational and cultural dimensions of EU policies for building a common European future.
The European Commission has also been implementing a wide range of actions in this field, such
as the establishment of an ET 2020 Working Group on Promoting Common Values and Inclusive
Education, which has produced a concise online compendium of good practices in this field, and an
37 The later less relevant for QIE as it focuses on pre-school, primary and secondary education.
33
initiative involving positive role models to promote social inclusion, and to prevent exclusion and
violent radicalisation among young people.
• Council Resolution on further developing the European Education Area to support future-oriented
education and training systems (2019) invites the member states to continue the engagement
towards inclusive and high-quality early childhood education and care systems, foster actions to
promote key competences and inclusive, high-quality education for all.
In the framework of the EU 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, specific targets have
been set at national level, including: reducing early school leave (maximum 11.3% by 2020), increasing
pre-school participation rates of children (at least 95% of children aged 4 years and age for compulsory
primary school enrolment should benefit from pre-school education), increasing the educational
performance of schoolchildren in the compulsory schooling system (the percentage of individuals aged 15
with low literacy, mathematics and science should be at most 15%).
During the European Semester, based on monitoring a set of strategic indicators, the European Commission
formulated recommendations to Romania to address urgent challenges. Between 2014 and 2019, ensuring
and providing access to quality and inclusive education was a constant of the Commission’s Recommendations,
starting with early education, especially for Roma and children in rural areas. According to Country Report
2019, Romania made limited progress in addressing the 2018 country-specific recommendations in terms
of access to quality education: low participation in early childhood education hampers the development of
cognitive and social skills; early school leave remains high, and attainment levels in basic skills are low and
not improving. At the same time rural-urban disparities persist and vulnerable groups, including the Roma,
continue to have limited access to quality inclusive mainstream education; access to quality and inclusive
education is highly insufficient; an integrated approach to prevent early school leave is still missing.
Teachers’ ability to apply a learner-centred approach are not sufficiently developed while teachers in rural
areas are much more likely to lack the necessary qualifications. In addition, the school funding model and
teachers’ merit allowances are not sufficiently geared towards improving the outcomes of disadvantaged
schools and schoolchildren.
In view of the above, we consider that the purpose of the QIE project, together with the values proposed and
the objectives assumed, are fully aligned to these European coordinates and respond to the challenges and
recommendations of the country, as detailed below38:
• The Quality Inclusive Education Package targets at the same time, the development of quality
education, and the school participation for all children, especially for those vulnerable.
• The fundamental objective is that every child would be able to participate, to learn at their
maximum potential and be properly prepared to succeed in the labour market and be an active
citizen. A second objective is to accelerate the efforts to ensure the right to education to all children,
especially those vulnerable, by improving the quality of teaching and school administration, and
to mobilise schools, families and communities to support the school attendance and development
of each child.
• QIE comprises child-centred interventions at the school, family and community levels, having
universal character, so that all children and schools can benefit from the interventions. It mainly
considers the equity, applying especially to the most under-privileged children and disadvantaged
school units.
• More specifically, QIE emphasizes the following aspects: improving the capacity of school
management and teachers to support each child according to their needs; improving teaching
methods and tools; creating partnerships with families and schoolchildren and developing
parental skills; mobilising communities to support education; improving non-cognitive skills and
the motivations of children; encouraging diversity among schoolchildren, regardless of gender,
ethnicity, religion, disability and socio-economic status.
The common values promoted by these trends at European level are reflected in the project – namely
respect for human/child rights, cohesion, diversity, fairness and non-discrimination, as well as the fact that
the project operates with the broad concept of inclusion and specifically addresses the group of disadvantaged
children and schoolchildren from rural areas, respectively Roma. On the other hand, in line with the concrete
support directions developed by the Commission, QIE aims to intervene by deploying an integrated
38 Inclusive Education in Romania UNICEF Qualitative Inclusive Education Package
34
approach at all levels – family, school, community. The project aims to test intervention tools to support
practitioners (such as good practice for teaching and positive role models).
Alignment of QIE with Sustainable Development Goals
According to UN Sustainable Development Goals, the reasons for the lack of quality education are caused
by inadequate trained teachers, poor conditions of schools and equity issues related to opportunities
provided to rural children. In the perspective of 2030, the major objectives include: ensuring that all girls
and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and
effective learning outcomes; ensuring that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood
development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education; eliminating
gender disparities in education and ensuring equal access to all levels of education and vocational training
for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous people and children in vulnerable
situations.
Education 2030: Incheon Declaration and Framework for Action details these objectives by proposing
strategic approaches, targets and indicators. The document emphasizes the following aspects, embedded
in QIE, too:
• An integral part of the right to education is ensuring that education has a sufficient quality to lead
to relevant, equitable and effective learning outcomes at all levels and in all settings. This requires
relevant teaching and learning methods and content that meet the needs of all Learners, taught by
well-qualified, trained, adequately remunerated and motivated teachers, using appropriate
pedagogical approaches and supported by appropriate information and communication
technology (ICT), as well as the creation of safe, healthy, gender-responsive, inclusive and
adequately resourced environments that facilitate learning.
• In order to achieve inclusive education, policies should aim to transform education systems so they
can better respond to learners' diversity and needs. This is the key in fulfilling the right to
education with equality, and it is related not only to access, but also to participation and
achievement of all schoolchildren, with special attention to those who are excluded, vulnerable or
at risk of being marginalised.
In line with these internationally relevant documents, the QIE project is based on a philosophy that promotes
ensuring the right to education for all children and adolescents through early interventions, in a preventive
and integrated way, with responsibility and quality at all levels and carefully for all types of vulnerabilities in
a proactive way. The relevance of QIE in relation to strategic directions of Education 2030 is achieved
through its specific objectives and interventions, i.e. its components aim to ensure the participation of all
children and adolescents, a quality education, starting with early and continuous education, in
kindergartens and schools where management, teachers and school counsellors are prepared to provide
quality support to each child/schoolchild, according to their needs and taking into account their complete
environment (family and community). Also, at the level of the education system, QIE aims to contribute to
the development of national legislation so as to ensure that interventions are focused on child, in
accordance with this philosophy.
Alignment of QIE with national strategies, policies, legislation in place or proposed
In the context of EU 2020 Strategy and the new framework of EU Structural Funds for 2014-2020, the
Romanian Government has started developing cross-sectoral strategies aimed at combating poverty, social
exclusion and school dropout.
National strategy for the reduction of early school leave is grounded on the concept of integrated response
from the policies and services in all relevant areas (education, health, social protection etc.) with horizontal
and vertical coordination between relevant public and private actors.
• In the education field, the strategy provides access to education and quality education for all
children. The programmes proposed in this pillar aim at increasing enrolment rates in early
education, primary and lower secondary education. In the context of the extension of participation
to education, special attention will be paid to early education and to the progressive extension of
pre-school education (3-5 years) to achieve an almost universal enrolment rate and a substantial
increase in the number of children (particularly those aged 2-3) that can access pre-school care
and education services, including services that increase parental involvement in children’s
education. Additional results on Enrolment in primary and lower secondary cycles are also
proposed to address learning outcomes asymmetries for the four selected target groups: children
35
aged 11-17, especially those in precarious economic environments in rural areas, Roma children
and other minority groups. The central aim of this pillar is to substantially improve the quality of
primary and lower secondary education.
• The strategy also provides measures that ensure completion of compulsory education by all
children. This pillar promotes the development of early detection and intervention systems;
consolidation, extension and customization of counselling services and the introduction of
mechanisms to promote schoolchild-centred educational programmes as well as other types of
retention programmes in system. This pillar is designed to ensure the educational success of all
children, including children in socially marginalized and at-risk groups, ensuring equal access to
opportunities, rights and services in the educational field.
Designed in line with these strategic directions, the QIE model responds to challenges identified mainly by:
• placing QIE into an integrated package of services (education, health and social protection)
covering the widest possible range of child and adolescent needs. At the level of the QIE project,
interventions address all the children’s needs in terms of education, developing various
child/schoolchild approaches focused on managerial, pedagogical practices, school counselling,
parental education and community activities.
• coordination and collaboration in the interests of the child of a wide range of local professionals
and institutions; QIE specifically connects teachers from preschool to high school, school
counsellors, school mediators, headmasters, parental educators.
• targeting all children and adolescents in the community and also providing the specific support
needed to those from vulnerable groups.
• increase the access/searching and participation of regular children in education by identifying the
vulnerabilities of the child at pre-school level and ensuring the retention of school and increasing
graduation rates by monitoring schoolchildren at risk of dropping out.
• the opportunity for all children to benefit from pre-school education and the creation of inclusive
schools focused on the quality of education.
• raising awareness in families of the child’s interest and family involvement in educational
activities, ever since kindergarten.
Strategy on poverty reduction and social inclusion 2016-2020 explicitly states that the government’s goal is
ensuring equality opportunities in terms of quality education for all children. Specific goals include
improving the early childhood education and care system, increasing participation rate and improving
outcomes for all children enrolled in primary and secondary education, increasing access to quality
education for children from vulnerable groups.
• More specifically, increasing access to and success for Roma children remains a key objective.
Enhancing the capacity of teaching staff to effectively deliver inclusive education to Roma children
and abolishing the segregation of, discrimination against, and negative stereotyping of Roma
children in schools represent the key actions to address these critical issues.
• Increasing access for children from marginalised areas represents another critical topic. Compared
to urban areas, many rural schools are disadvantaged in terms of human resources, infrastructure,
funding and accessibility. There are also disadvantaged schools in marginalised urban
environments.
QIE package responds to these priorities in particular by:
• designing and implementing interventions in the most disadvantaged areas, with priority in
selecting disadvantaged communities and schools according to relevant sociological criteria. Thus,
the target group of the project is mostly in rural areas or in marginalised urban areas.
• conducting proactive identification of vulnerabilities with an educational risk impact at the level
of children/schoolchildren and kindergartens and schools stand for adaptation of interventions to
specific needs.
• conducting family and community awareness of the best interests of the child and their
mobilisation to support education and reduce the risk of dropping out, especially for vulnerable
groups.
• developing various school and extracurricular activities with the participation of all
schoolchildren, including those from marginalised groups due to social, economic or ethnic causes.
36
• identifying the needs and vulnerabilities of children/schoolchildren and providing services
contributes to facilitating all children’s access to early education and completing compulsory
education cycles (with adequate acquisition of the skills set out in the school curriculum).
• increasing the capacity to provide quality educational services at local level through the
involvement of teachers, parents, local authorities, including the school counsellor and school
mediator, even if an optimal number could not be ensured for these two professional categories
(essential for the issues addressed);QIE allowed awareness of the role of the school counsellor and
mediator in the school and local community, respectively introduced parental education practices
in the community and developed the role of parental educator.
• assessing local educational needs and improving the pacification and use of resources for
inclusive education at all levels (local, regional and national).
• ensuring better guidance, supervision and school monitoring by the county authorities.
The general objective of the National Strategy for Protection and Promotion of Children Rights 2014-2020 is
to improve the access of all children to quality services by increasing children's access to education,
development of facilities for recreation and leisure activities for children, increasing the quality of
education services, increasing the quality of human resources in social services, education and health for
children. Regarding the second general objective, respecting the rights and promoting the social inclusion
of children in vulnerable situations, the strategy provides measures to:
• increase access to education, health and social services for children in rural areas;
• integrate social, health and education services that are accessible and accessible to children with
disabilities and their families;
• increase the educational inclusion of children with disabilities and/or special educational needs;
facilitating Roma children access to social, educational and medical services;
• eliminate any form of segregation in all forms of education.
As part of their successive partnerships agreements, the Government of Romania and UNICEF
demonstrated commitment to review and adjust policies promoting children and their families’ well-being,
including through the priority objectives set in the 2014-2020 National Strategy for Protection and
Promotion of Children’s Rights. These opportunities facilitated the Alignment of the National Strategy with
EC and UN Committee on the Rights of the Child Recommendations39. Designed in line with the values
promoted by UNICEF at international level and concerned about maintaining a balance between universal
intervention aimed at promoting the well-being of all children and interventions specific to vulnerable
groups, QIE Package responds to the objectives of this strategy in particular by:
• placing QIE into an integrated package of services (education, health and social protection)
covering the widest possible range of child and adolescent needs; at QIE level, interventions
address all children’s needs in terms of education, developing various child/schoolchild-centred
approaches, involving a wide range of local professionals and institutions: teachers from preschool
to high school, school counsellors, school mediators, headmasters, parental educators.
• targeting all children and adolescents in the community and also providing the specific support
needed to those from vulnerable groups.
• increasing the access/searching and participation of regular children in education by identifying
the vulnerabilities of the child at pre-school level and ensuring the retention of school and
increasing graduation rates by monitoring schoolchildren at risk of dropping out.
• the opportunity for all children to benefit from pre-school education and the creation of inclusive
schools focused on the quality of education.
• the orientation of the project’s actions towards improving non-cognitive skills, positive self-
esteem and child motivation to produce effects with direct impact at individual level.
• raising awareness in families and community on the child’s best interest, development of parental
skills and family involvement in educational activities, ever since kindergarten.
• increasing the quality of education, from preschool to high school, through appropriate teacher
training in a spirit of respect for diversity and combating discrimination and segregation, by
providing methodologies and teaching tools, for the development of a healthy and stimulating
environment for each child.

National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 includes, among others, measures in the field of education. Under the
pillar culture and non-formal education, the specific objectives of the strategy are to ensure access to formal
quality and non-formal training and education for all adolescents and young people; improve the non-
formal education offer; raise young people’s interest in participating in non-formal education activities;
ensure more practical relevance of the skills acquired through formal and non-formal education.
QIE package is relevant to this strategy in particular by targeting its actions towards improving non-cognitive
skills and child motivation, and encouraging diversity among schoolchildren, regardless of gender, ethnicity,
religion, (dis) ability and socio-economic status. The related activities were in the area of non-formal
education – extracurricular activities proposed by micro-grants and positive role models acts — had a very
high relevance and direct impact at the level of the schoolchildren.
Romania’s National Roma Integration Strategy 2015-2020 defines the roadmap for public policies in the
area of the social inclusion of the Roma. It aims to gradually eliminate poverty and social exclusion by
devising policies in the areas of education, employment, healthcare and housing. The involvement of the
Roma themselves is seen as crucial, as well as awareness raising and promoting the fight against
discrimination. The strategy’s goals include ensuring that Roma children go to school, with a special focus
on girls, and combating segregation in schools. Regarding the specific objectives of the strategy in the field
of education, these are as follows:
• reducing the educational development gap (knowledge level) and school attendance gap, at all
levels of education (pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary, upper-secondary, tertiary) between
Romanian citizens belonging to the Roma minority, including traditional Roma communities, and
the rest of the population.
• promoting inclusive education and reduction of discrimination and segregation in schools on
grounds of ethnicity, social status, disabilities or any other criteria which affect children and young
people belonging to disadvantaged groups, including the Roma people, through the establishment
of an effective detection, monitoring and prompt intervention system for eliminating incidences of
school segregation and supplementing the current legislation on combatting segregation with
sanctions and compulsory actions for cases of school segregation.
• increasing school participation and school performance of Roma schoolchildren.
• developing the Roma ethno-cultural identity through education, in accordance with national and
EU legislation.
• ensuring and extending the study of the Romani language and, if necessary, of Roma history and
traditions at all educational levels, where there is sufficient demand, including for Roma
schoolchildren admitted on distinct lists at high schools and universities.
In particular, the QIE package responds to these objectives by:
• the addition of interventions with particular attention to vulnerable and at risk of dropping out
groups, including Roma children and schoolchildren. According to research data, more than 20%
of teachers work with school groups that include Roma schoolchildren.
• the inclusion of the school mediator in Roma communities in the working teams to facilitate the
provision of the package of services within them.
• promoting quality inclusive education through a dedicated package designed to address the
vulnerabilities of the child at school, family, community and national education level.
• increasing pre-school enrolment and regular and successful school attendance through early
identification of schoolchildren at risk of dropping out, with particular attention to Roma children,
especially girls, and organising educational and counselling activities dedicated to them.
• targeting activities towards the specific objective – encouraging diversity among schoolchildren,
regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, (dis)ability and socio-economic status – with expected
results at the level of the child’s self-esteem: reducing the level of discrimination of Roma
population and increasing the autonomy of Roma families and adolescents by: providing
pedagogical kits on socio-emotional skills development and teacher training to use them;
performing demonstration lessons for the use of pedagogical kits on self-esteem development;
developing the methodology for selecting positive role models for developing self-esteem; training
of members of Community teams in working with the Roma population.
In synergy or coherence with the National Strategies, ESIF programming period for 2014-2020, as well as
with other programmes in place during the implementation of the QIE project, they bring to the fore
measures to ensure the quality, equity and relevance of the education to which the QIE approach is aligned:
38
• Education programme funded under the EEA Financial mechanism 2014-2021 provides supports
to Enhancing the quality and Relevance of education and training in the beneficiary countries at
all levels of education and professional development of teachers.
• Education, Scholarships, Apprenticeship and Youth Entrepreneurship Program (ESAYEP), 2014-
2021 will contribute to the development of human capital and knowledge base through: improved
skills and competences of educational experts (school inspectors, teacher trainers, counsellors),
improved quality of vocational education and increasing the organizational capacity of institutions
to ensure effective inclusion of Roma children.
At local level, the project took into account priorities/objectives in the field of social inclusion, education
and health established by two important strategic documents adopted:
The sustainable development strategy of Bacău County 2010-2021 which provides for increased access to
social, health and educational services and basic utilities. Two of the objectives of the Strategy relate to
education: increasing social inclusion by increasing access to health and education services in rural areas
and facilitating access of children deprived of parental care, foster care centres and members of families
affected by migration to quality educational services and social programmes, improving infrastructure and
quality of provision of education services, reducing and preventing school drop-outs in particular in rural
areas.
• The county strategy for the development of social services 2014-2020 which has the following
directions of action: ensuring the well-being of the child in the family environment, guaranteeing
the rights and social inclusion of children in vulnerable situations, continuing the transition from
institutional to community care, eliminating all forms of violence against the child and promoting
child participation in community life. The specific objectives of this strategy aimed, inter alia, at:
improving the access of all children to education, promoting children’s access to recreational and
leisure activities, increasing the capacity of beneficiaries to access and use integrated community
services addressed to children and families, developing and implementing a system of evaluation
and monitoring the observance of children’s rights.
By focusing its interventions on increasing access to education and reducing the school dropout of all
children, especially those from vulnerable groups, i.e., local capacity of institutions for inclusion and
educational quality, QIE package is relevant for the strategic objectives identified at county level, thus
contributing to the social inclusion and development of people from vulnerable groups.
Qualitative research data involving representatives of public institutions with competence in education at
national and county level confirms the relevance of QIE package in relation to national documents and
development trends of educational policies. In this regard, QIE is considered as very connected to all
national strategies and very well anchored in the National Strategy for the reduction of early school leaving,
both through the majority target groups – socially, economically, ethnically disadvantaged people from
rural areas, but also by carrying out activities aimed specifically at early education and recognising
differences and ensuring equal opportunities for all children.
At national level, relevant actors consider introducing the objectives and practices validated under QIE into
legislation and in the rules guiding the education system. For example, MoE is interested in finding
solutions for increasing the number of school counsellors, reducing the school counsellor’s workload,
developing a master’s program in teaching, developing a curriculum on inclusive education/non-
discrimination. At the same time, QIE’s approaches in terms of teachers training was taken up by “CRED”,
a strategic project aiming to train 55,000 primary and secondary education teachers at national level.
QIE is also complementary with projects such as ROSE40 – aimed at reducing dropout in upper and tertiary
secondary education but also with World Vision projects at objective level, i.e., they both have a child-
centred approach and target schools but with a view to generate the child’s overall well-being (education,
health, family, resources, leisure and community). Complementarity was identified also with RENINCO
projects, i.e., a network that gathers several associations from education that deals with inclusive
education, with targeted interventions for the management of ESCs and the risk situation or with the
INSCHOOL project which focuses on schools with Roma children.
At Bacău county level, QIE’s best practices in training managers in education are the basis of an initiative
to develop a mentoring project in schools and inter-schools; complementarity of QIE interventions in

relation to the PartNET Association project aimed at training headmasters in which 14 schools from the
county participate.
Also, case studies carried out in six communities where QIE was implemented reveal that QIE’s activities
were considered compatible with any type of intervention aimed at promoting inclusive practices and
quality enhancement in schools:
• According to the experience and perception of headmasters, QIE is considered a complementary
project with other (national or international) programmes benefiting from the school, with the
institutional rules and practices in force: they correspond in terms of objectives, but they are
addressed through different activities. In this respect, the perception is that, being a project
initiated by UNICEF, it is distinguished from other projects by focusing on attracting children to
school by organising various activities, on personal development and improvement of human
relations; unlike other projects, QIE has a holistic approach to needs.
• Among the projects carried out in the schools concerned and which were considered
complementary to QIE’s interventions, are mentioned: the CRED teacher training project aimed
exclusively at the teaching area of the professional role41; projects implemented by the Red Cross
offering educational activities and adjacent hot meals for children and tablets for activities in the
classroom; infrastructure projects obtained by accessing European funds and NRDP funds,
programmes developed by UNICEF and OPHC offering educational vouchers for
primary/secondary and kindergarten pupils, provided that schoolchildren attend courses (e.g. the
dropout rate was 0 % in the last 2 years in Colonesti); projects implemented by Terre des Hommes
for the development of resources for sports practice (sport field, gymnasium); projects
implemented by OvidiuRo to equip kindergartens and develop the competences of preschool
teachers; Erasmus+ projects on the mobility component.
• The activities of the QIE package are considered to be aligned/complementary with a series of
actions carried out in the local community for people from vulnerable groups, of volunteering
together with the Roman Catholic Church in the village of Frumoasa, charitable (Colonești),
supporting victims of domestic violence, especially women / mothers (Colonești).
• QIE’s activities shall also foster complementarity and synergies with other interventions, as a
result of the skills developed in this intervention (in particular, but not only technical assistance),
the school management teams have accessed additional funds for school infrastructure (Zemes
School, funding Terre des Hommes) for rehabilitation (School Zemes, ROR funding) to participate
in a mobility project in the field of school education (Frumoasa School – ERASMUS).
4.4. EQ 4. Are all processes based on a child/human rights approach? Are any age and gender
issues considered in providing the services?
Promoting child rights has been, from the outset, at the core of the Quality and Inclusive Education Package.
The integrated intervention package includes child-centred interventions at school, family and community
levels, developed on the basis of previously tested interventions. According to the project documents, the
educational package is universal in the sense that all schoolchildren and all schools can benefit from these
interventions. The QIE package also addresses equity, as it pays considerable attention to quality education
for all, especially for the most vulnerable children and the most disadvantaged schools.
The child rights approach was embedded already in the project ToC,42 stating that QIE is developed in an
integrated manner, by adding education interventions to social protection, health and child protection
interventions. The education component addresses bottlenecks and barriers to participation and retention
in education for children and adolescents at risk. Special attention is paid to working closely with teachers
to ensure that: the right to education of every child is observed without discrimination. The ultimate
outcome is directly related to children’s right to education (Art. 28 of Convention on the Rights of the Child):
“All children are enjoying their right to education, are completing compulsory education and are equipped
with basic academic, social and life skills.”
The solutions developed through ToC address, at all levels of intervention (from system level to individual
level), issues related to equity and human / child rights associated with inclusion: raising authorities'
41 CRED trainings were delivered, though, beginning with the last year of QIE intervention (2019).
42 UNICEF, Quality Inclusive Education Model’s Theory of Change
40
awareness regarding access to quality inclusive education, especially for vulnerable children and
adolescents; involvement of professionals from other systems that can contribute to reducing school
dropout; promoting role models in different professions for the inclusion of Roma schoolchildren in
schools; involving parents in school life and their children education in regard with the importance of
education and promoting the best interests of their child; training of teachers and headmasters in specific
curricular areas - inclusive education, use of Romanian language; community promotion and training of
school mediators and counsellors.
At the same time, through its impact at the level of public policies, ToC addresses changes at the level of
national strategies and relevant standards from the perspective of ensuring the right to quality education
for each child, such as: Early Education Strategy, Early School Leaving Strategy, Funding formula, Parenting
Education Strategy, Rome Inclusion Strategy, Child Rights Strategy, school curriculum, school dropout
definition, teaching methods & standards, school management methods & standards, school counsellor
standards, school mediator standards.
In line with the project ToC, all activities implemented in the framework of the project had a child rights
approach, particularly from the perspective of Art. 28 of Convention on the Rights of the Child (i.e., the right
to education) as well as in accordance with the SDG No.4 – Quality Education, but also, at least indirectly,
from the perspective of the right of being protected from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or
abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation (Art.19) and the right to express their
views freely as well as of thought, conscience and religion. Parental education also contributes to parents’
responsibilities and duties to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child,
appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the Convention.
The Convention on the Rights of the Child states that all States Parties “shall take all appropriate measures
to ensure that the child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the
status, activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs of the child’s parents, legal guardians, or family members”
(Art.2, (2)). In this context, QIE had activities directly promoting inclusion, non-discrimination, tolerance,
the rights of the child, but also set an example in implementing these values. Respect for children’s rights
is confirmed by headmasters (89.19 %), as they believe that the rights of the child have been respected by
and in the project. This is confirmed also by a majority of teachers participating in survey (63.44% “to a
very large extent” and 25.81 % to a “large extent”) but also in interviews and focus groups. Stakeholders
consulted consider that promotion of diversity and equity were among the key gains of the intervention.
Vulnerable children were involved in all school and extracurricular activities, which ensured inclusion and
non-discrimination.
The trainings and exchange of good practices among teachers and pre-school teachers were organised in
line with the Article 29 of the Convention, which states that „education must develop every child’s
personality, talents and abilities to the full. It must encourage the child’s respect for human rights, as well
as respect for their parents, their own and other cultures, and the environment”, and in order to achieve
these goals, children must have well-prepared teachers who can push them to perform. Also, in order for
the children to develop their skills but also to enjoy themselves, play and take part in a wide range of
cultural and artistic activities (in line with Article 31 on leisure, playing and culture), e.g., they participated
in “Joy to learn” contest, and in exchanges among schools.
The interviewees engaged in the evaluation process pointed out several aspects regarding the compliance
of the project with the child and human right approaches as well as a differentiated approach for girls and
boys. In this regard, it is important to notice that all school headmasters participating in survey, as well as
at least 85% of teachers, agreed that the project respected the child’s rights in accordance with the national
and international laws and practices.
In terms of a differentiated approach for girls and boys, equal and non-discriminatory participation in all
activities was ensured.
Children's rights and, to a more limited extent, the gender dimension, were addressed in training sessions,
monitoring visits and exchanges of experience, as confirmed by some project partners and regional
coordinators. In terms of identifying and monitoring, it is important to mention the Early Warning System
developed by IES, as project partner, for assessing the profile of schoolchild at risk of dropping out of
school. The fiche collects data disaggregated by gender and by all categories of vulnerable children
recognised in MoE methodologies.
41
Child rights-related activities were carried out also with the support of micro-grants, e.g. “I want to learn
in a friendly school” in Dr. Al. Șafran lower secondary education school. As one schoolchild participating in
a focus group stated, “The most beautiful activities were related to human rights and non-discrimination.”
Gender is considered to a more limited extent in providing services under QIE, although they might be
needed, in line with the findings on impact presented in next sections. The overriding principle was non-
discriminatory participation of children in project activities; activities promoting tolerance and non-
discrimination directly addressed the issue of gender equality. In activities indirectly reaching children
(e.g., teachers training), concepts of equality, including gender equality, were embedded. Overall, at school
level, in some cases counselling activities were personalized for girls/boys. As one counsellor stated: “The
schoolchildren were pleased that there was someone they could talk to and who could listen to them; we
addressed important topics for girls/boys, and the relations between children have improved.” This
underlines again the need for some differentiated approaches by gender, as argued in the “Impact” section.
The services provided under QIE consider age-related particularities only in the sense that the intervention
addressed in different components the pre-school, primary and secondary education levels. Otherwise no
specific activities by age were developed and implemented.
5. Main findings - Effectiveness
QIE aimed to promote schoolchild-oriented teaching, thus, to transform the involved schools in more friendly
and inclusive establishments and to develop school management. These changes would create the necessary
premises for quality inclusive and equitable educational services for all children, especially for those who are
vulnerable. In this respect, the intervention aimed to facilitate school’s collaboration with family, to provide
support for parental education and to contribute to the development of non-cognitive skills.
Overall, as regards effectiveness, the key stakeholders directly participating in the implementation of QIE, i.e.,
headmasters, pre-school teachers and teachers consider that the objectives of the intervention have been
achieved to very high extent.
The evaluation identified a wider range of effects produced by QIE, which can be classified as follows:
• Direct effects, observed based on relevant data collected from individuals involved in the activities
conducted under QIE package, thus directly determined by the participation in these activities, i.e.,
children in micro-grants activities;
• Indirect effects, referring to consequences or “spill-over” effects, which can be observed in certain
intervention areas.
In terms of attributability (i.e., the level of QIE influence), direct effects observed can be related to UNICEF
interventions but also to practices, local communities, school and beneficiaries of the package (headmasters,
teachers, educators, schoolchildren and parents). Thus, activities developed under QIE needed to create
synergies to reach UNICEF’s mission and, consequently, to be organized around the local community, school,
partners, teachers in order to become effective solutions to a complex problem caused by several factors.
In line with the methodology agreed in the Inception Report, the first set of effects are presented under
“effectiveness” criterion, while the second set of effects are detailed under “impact” (chapter 8).
5.1. EQ5. Did the interventions of the QIE project address the needs identified at the level
of children and families in the communities involved, including the most vulnerable (at
high risk of dropping out) children and families?
Effects at the level of children
The effectiveness of QIE intervention at the level of children is given primarily by schoolchildren’s degree of
participation in various activities implemented43. For example, Step-by-Step activities, implemented between
August 2015 and August 2017, provided trainings for educators, that indirectly influenced 3.120 pre-
schoolchildren who have improved their school participation in terms of involvement in the activities
developed by educators and constant participation. “Asociația Împreună” (Impreuna Association) supported
3 pupils and youth associations and 45 pupils as to become peer mentors. The reports from donors show that
2.855 pupils from 15 schools (according to donor French Committee for UNICEF final report), 16.000 pre-
43 See Annex x. for a complete set of information on activities, outputs and results achieved by QIE.
42
schoolchildren and schoolchildren (according to donor Norwegian Financial Mechanism final report) and
22.000 schoolchildren (according to Swiss National Committee for UNICEF final report) receive better quality
educational services and they have increased their self-esteem.
The evaluation identified, based on evidence collected, that participation in extracurricular activities
organized by QIE contributed to pupils’ development as they acquired socio-emotional and life skills (e.g.,
establishment of goals, team work, time management, prioritization, problem solving, analytical thinking,
leadership, public speaking and other). Extracurricular activities contributed to an improved perspective of
pupils on their school as well as to an increase in their self-esteem, and of their sense of belonging. Through
such activities, children discovered new interests and activities that could be transformed into representative
domains for their future44.
An overwhelming majority of the stakeholders involved in the evaluation consider extracurricular
activities (and micro-grants) highly relevant and necessary. At the level of the intervention, headmasters
who participated to the survey argued that QIE addressed in an adequate manner the educational needs of
beneficiaries. In this context, most managers mentioned “diversification of extracurricular activities” as an
important need (i.e., in urban areas, 69.44% of managers participating in survey attributed a “very high”
importance to this need).
At school level, extracurricular activities have been supported by micro-grants, but also by the teacher’s
training component "on transdisciplinary and extracurricular activities”. Through this component,
teachers were provided with contexts to learn actual methods through which they can transform the school
into a friendly space, with an open, secure atmosphere, a school open to suggestions, a welcoming and
motivating space that embodies the child’s "self-esteem". In these face-to-face activities teachers practiced
project designing along with children, resulting in significant products that gave them the joy of
involvement and satisfaction of success" (QIE Manual, pp10-11).
In the first 3 years of QIE, 13.033 children, 4.758 parents and 1.270 teachers benefited from the activities
financed by microgrants, as shown in the table 2 below. Extracurricular activities are, in most cases, linked
to important events of the year (1st of June, 1st of March, Easter, etc.).

Expanding children’s horizon is a key benefit of the microgrants, i.e., pupils were taken out of their
community and exposed to more developed context, an experience inspiring new interests and activities
that could be transformed into future interest and career paths. Another added value mentioned in several
interviews and focus groups are learning guides developed based on school trips experiences (e.g., on
healthy nutrition).
Survey results support these findings, i.e., 62.00% of schoolchildren in the dedicated survey participated
in extracurricular activities and “school trips” and “first aid activities” are among the most popular, thus
most effective, activities in this category (see figures 3 and 4 below).

Moreover, teachers at pre-school level, both in urban (70%) and rural areas (75%), consider that a special
element of the EIC intervention was the “diversification of the types of extracurricular activities”.
Data collected in the framework of the case study identified a large number of extracurricular activities
considered good examples and, thus, largely effective. We present the most important in the box below.
Good examples of extracurricular activities
Balkan Frumoasa Secondary School (Scoala Gimnaziala Frumoasa):

parents is a type of involvement that is expected to create positive effects in terms of child’s well-
being and education.

The approach taken for developing projects for micro-grants implementation had a contribution to their
success. The microgrant evaluation sheet includes the criteria related to the correlation of topics relevant
to the school curriculum from the perspective of learning experiences valorisation (Microgrant Evaluation
sheet).The benefits for schoolchildren were acknowledged at the socio-emotional level, interaction and
teaming pointing out the dimensions of a quality Curriculum, as defined by Philip Stabback (2016, p.19-
20) in the UNESCO document "What Makes equality Curriculum". In this line, the author refers to inclusion
and differentiation (in the sense of differentiated learning), promoting new roles for teacher, from ‘I am
here to teach’ to ‘I am here to lead and enable effective learning’. “With this approach come new,
personalized teacher-schoolchild relationships in which the teacher recognizes values and teaches to
differences between schoolchildren, encourages effective learning in each individual, and promotes
discussion, inquiry and curiosity”.
Effects at the level of vulnerable children
With teachers’ support, IES registered 8.130 vulnerable schoolchildren in the 51 schools supported, on
average 2000 / school year or 400 / participating school / year. The yearly number decreases, though, each
year, from 2.507 in 2015-2016 to 1.635 in 2018-2019.
Based on data collected through surveys to validate data in the school annual reports, a high number of
pupils at risk/defined as pupils from a vulnerable environment45 is prominent among both girls and boys,
as presented in tables 3 and 4 below:
Table 3. Teachers' perception on the existence of vulnerable female schoolchildren
45 We define vulnerable children according to the following described categories, depending on the risk factors that
influence learning outcomes: Roma schoolchild/children, schoolchild/children from socio-economically
disadvantaged backgrounds, schoolchild/children with parents abroad, disabled schoolchild/children,
schoolchild/children from refugee families, remigrant schoolchild/children. The educators surveyed have all
categories of preschoolchild/children, except for refugee children.

As noted, there is a similar distribution on the categories of vulnerabilities for both girls and boys. The rural
environment is associated with several dimensions of vulnerability (family education level, family
economic level, etc.); it is shown that in Romania the level of quality of education is lower than that in urban
areas.
Therefore, as can be seen in the figures above, there is a large proportion of children with low economic
levels (125.19 girls and 160.25 boys), families with parents going abroad (50.3 girls and 90.38 boys),
children with disabilities (6.12 girls and 4 boys). It could be concluded that these reflect vulnerable
children. However, the vulnerable environment, as perceived by teachers, varies, even if it is in different
ways.
Teachers at preschool level confirm that at the level of kindergarten there are all categories of vulnerable pre-
schoolchildren (see the figure 5 below).

With regard to schoolchild involvement, the situation was identified as delicate by all stakeholders
consulted, especially at pre-school level. As foreseen by QIE design, it is very difficult for the school to
differentiate between vulnerable pupils/schoolchildren and those who are not at risk when activities are
organised. In this regard, 70.37% of teachers at the preschool level stated that they involved all pre-
schoolchildren in the organized activities, 1.85 % only vulnerable children, and only 18.52 % put more
emphasis on vulnerable pre-schoolchildren.
Evidence collected through case studies and focus group at county level confirm important effects among
this target group. For example, in “Dr. Al Safran” Secondary School in Bacau, a visible effect during the
implementation of the intervention package was a greater involvement of vulnerable children in
extracurricular activities. In the opinion of the school counsellor, these activities contributed to keeping
schoolchildren at risk of dropping out within the school. It is noted that teachers rethought the tutoring
class, which took on significance in the school, identifying its importance in relation to schoolchildren.
Working with parents was another key element that helped avoid school dropout, especially among
vulnerable schoolchildren. Basically, the mentality and vision of the school has changed towards these
schoolchildren who are no longer invisible and for whom there is a concern regarding their integration,
even if not in the form of complete programmes centralized at school level.
From case studies carried out during the evaluation (Horgesti Secondary School, Dr. Al Safran Secondary
School, Zemes, Secondary School no. 2 Tg Ocna, Balkan Frumoasa Gymnasium), we can draw the same
conclusions. The effects identified in the case of vulnerable children are:
• Increased motivation for learning and well-being at school (“The teachers taught us how to behave
with each other, and when we come to school, we feel good with each other”, “we worked a lot in
teams when we went to school, because now we do it online”, “I learn a lot more when I am in a
group”, “some teachers explain us more about the meaning of information in materials and
textbooks” – Frumoasa Secondary School)
• Parents are more supportive of school and extracurricular activities and more open on more
intimate topics with them ("Encourages me more with school", "they left me on the trip", "my
mother is more open with me", "my parents did not want to attend those meetings for parents, but
I would have liked to go (smiles)” – Frumoasa Secondary School)
• Better understanding of your own community and learning in the community, along with different
groups of people – their own parents, the elderly, poor families, children of other
48
ethnicity/confession – following activities in micro-grants ("I liked the activity the most in which
a young Roma person who was discriminated against as a child talked about how he felt and what
helped him", "I made March amulets and with the money obtained from their sale I helped the
needy ”,“ we sold the icons painted by us and that's how the children who would not have allowed
themselves came on the trip ” – Frumoasa Secondary School)
• Understanding the concepts of tolerance and diversity, non-discrimination, following
transdisciplinary or counselling activities, e.g., on human rights or violence issues (Frumoasa
Secondary School)
• Development of non-cognitive skills such as artistic, communication and teamwork, help,
entrepreneurship, self-knowledge and inter-knowledge – in the framework of extracurricular or
counselling activities in which topics related to risk behaviours for pre-teens (alcohol use,
smoking, inappropriate Internet use, etc.) were addressed.
• Regarding children from vulnerable groups, the teachers interviewed mention a better integration
into the community and school as a result of their participation in extracurricular activities
organized through microgrants where they felt valued for their various talents. According to all
teachers interviewed, they see an improvement in school outcomes of vulnerable pupils and a
more positive attitude towards learning, as confirmed by a schoolchild’s statement (8th grade): “I
noticed that from our class (eighth grade) most of them want to go to college, and most of them
now want to go to high school at least." (Frumoasa Secondary School).
Effects at the level of parents
The family’s role in education is undeniably recognized by all studies; therefore “parental interest in
children’s activities at school is correlated with children’s higher academic motivation and increased
satisfaction with life (OECD, 2017). Putnam argued that if he were to choose 10 % budget for school or 10
% to increase parental involvement, he would choose the involvement of parents. Bogenschneider and
Johnson mention that when parents were involved in teens schooling, there were benefits for both boys
and girls, as parents’ involvement is positive even when parents do not have studies, even in the situation of
vulnerable children. Therefore, the parental component is justified and beneficial to supporting the
objectives of QIE package. The parental component had two dimensions: parental education developed by
HoltIs partner and parents’ counselling component supported by IES.7
The parental education component aimed to train parental educators to support, at their turn, parents to
improve their parenting skills, with a view to better support children in their development and quality of
life. At the level of the entire projects, 296 parenting educators were trained, 967 groups of parents, 1426
support groups and 7.077 meetings were organised, involving 10.727 parents and indirectly affecting
17.799 children.
The positive effects of parental education are firstly reported by parents themselves, as involved in the
survey carried out and the focus groups organized in the framework of the case studies. As for the former,
parental education is the first factor that helped the parents the most to support their child/children to
participate in school (see the figure 6 below), followed closely by the meetings with teachers (organized
under or independently of QIE). Teachers consulted in the framework of the evaluation confirm the effects
of parental education as 55% of them consider that parents understand better and support more their
children in general and with their homework.

At the same time, most parents (80%) acknowledge that spending more time with children, supporting
them at school and an increased communication with teachers are important aspects in children’s
development. An overwhelming majority also agree that parents have the main role as regards children’s
participation in education. Still, 32% of parents argue that they still don't know how to communicate with
their children, while only 13% consider that they have learned such skills see (figure 7 below). This can be
explained by the fact that they did not practice the new competences gained and, as time went by, they have
regressed in this regard.

However, parents are also of the opinion that, in order to succeed in life, most parents (77.78 %) consider
that their children need to graduate university, while only 18.18% refer to high school, and 3.03% to
vocational school. The percentages are similar in rural and urban areas. The low percentage considering
vocational schools as the educational level necessary for life success may be explained by a still limited
50
extent to what parents internalized certain ideas and behaviours developed during parental education
sessions, i.e., on child uniqueness.

Effects at the level of school management
The school management development component of QIE package has been created in order to facilitate the
development of quality, inclusive and equitable services for all children, especially for those who are
vulnerable; to strengthen school collaboration with family and offer better support for parenting education
and development of non-cognitive skills.
Headmasters of all 51 schools involved in QIE benefited of training, as well as some members of the
“management team “, i.e., members of staff involved in project development and coordination. In total 239
participations in training session of this level are recorded. The information extracted from the IES
database show for the first semester of each year the following participation in trainings:
• in 2016-2017 - 44 trainees (37 headmasters and 7 project coordinators),
• in 2017-2018 - 44 trainees (37 headmasters and 7 project coordinators),
• in 2018-2019 - 45 trainees (39 headmasters and 6 coordinators).
For the second semester the same database shows that there were:
• in 2016-2017 - 52 trainees (12 coordinators and advisors and 40 directors)
• in 2017-2018 - 48 trainees (41 headmasters and 7 coordinators and advisers),
• in 2018-2019 - 50 trainees (5 counsellors and coordinators and 45 directors).

about managerial aspects; drafting managerial documents; learning to give feedback to teachers;
encouraging teacher-pupil communication; encouraging communication between teachers and parents;
encouraging communication between teachers and facilitating teamwork between specialists (see figure 8

Effects at the level of teachers
The didactic component of QIE has included among others trainings addressed to teachers. The name of
the programme is “Curriculum in context. Teaching adaptations for schoolchildren at risk of dropping
out”46.
There are 169 graduates and teachers in the IES database. The table 6 below shows the number of
participations to trainings for each school year and their total number:

The results perceived by teachers after participating in training courses are related to learning attractive
teaching methods (76.44% of total number of teachers participating to the survey) and improving teaching
skills (61.78% of teachers). Only 17.80% said that they had already known the information provided by the
courses. An important effect registered by teachers participating in training organized by QIE is learning to
develop differentiated learning strategies (confirmed by 49.21% of respondents). According to teachers,
other effects of their participation to courses were related to the following aspects: introduction of new
methods, understanding the needs of schoolchildren and increasing the attractiveness of lessons. Only
6.84% of teachers consider that they have not changed many things, so the participation had no effect or
impact at their level (see figure 10 below).

As a self-assessment, within the survey teachers had to choose the most important aspect of their work in
relation with the teaching activity and their pupils. This question is very important due to the fact that it
makes the respondents be aware of the elements that a teacher must take into account in relation with
their pupils (question 32, see table 7 below). In this respect, most of the teachers (58.31%) selected as key
element "their confidence that every child can succeed”.

The general perspective of the stakeholders consulted in this evaluation leads to the idea that all activities
carried out in the QIE package have, at least partially, met their objectives. However, regarding the
improvement of classes quality as a result of teachers' participation in the training component, contrary to
what teachers say, 43.96% of pupils consider that "nothing has changed with teachers and classes" while only
16.62% of them say that "lessons are more interesting”. In this regard, an important answer given to open
questions in the survey among schoolchildren is: “the classes are boring and monotonous because there is
no extra activity and we are not allowed to use the mobile phone in class” (question 30, schoolchild survey).
However, 51.77% of pupils consider that the statement “teachers help pupils when they ask for help” is true to
a large extent and, further, 41.98% consider that the statement “I get help from teachers if I have problems”
is true to a large extent (question 32, schoolchild survey).
Effects at the level of kindergarten teachers
At the European level, “early childhood education and care (ECEC) has been a growing priority in many
Member States”47 and an essential component that can decrease the inequities coming from the family
situation. Moreover, “participation in early childhood education and care is also found to enhance
children’s emotional, behavioural and social development. These non-cognitive skills and competences are
not necessarily reflected in a child’s educational attainment or their academic achievements, given that the
current approach towards testing in schools is entirely based on cognitive skills and performance.
Notwithstanding these considerations, it is widely recognized that non-cognitive skills and competences
are essential to the individual’s further development, not least because of their contribution to learning in
school and outside it – which is then translated into improved labour market outcomes” (Carneiro and
Heckman, 2003).
47 https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/14194adc-fc04-11e7-b8f5-01aa75ed71a1
55
Similar to the findings for cognitive skills, non-cognitive skills cannot be seen separately from other factors
shaping child development. Family background again proves to be the main determinant, i.e., academic
research suggests that children from disadvantaged backgrounds have less developed social and emotional
skills than their counterparts (Chevalier et al., 2006; Guerin, 2014).
As a result of their participation in trainings, teachers in preschool education have changed certain
elements of their approach in class. In this regard the majority of teachers say that they have introduced
new teaching methods in their practice (76.04%) (see table 8 below).

The peer learning activities were considered by the majority of the teachers to be useful “to a large extent”
(53.13% participating in the survey), confirmed by most teachers consulted in focus groups organized for
the case studies. Evidence collected also indicate that one-to-one learning activities were continued “to a
large extent” (46.32%) and “to a very large extent” (10.53%).
Other benefits that were identified by teachers are related to: "Integrating approaches specific to
alternative education in the educational act, in the benefit of children and their families", "improving
communication and teaching skills", "exchange of good practices, ideas between colleagues participating in
the project", “identifying the needs of children”, “children having equal opportunities” and “all children
having the right to education”.
Other evidence regarding early school interventions made available by Step-by-Step demonstrate the
effectiveness of the component (i.e., participation of pre-school staff in the QIE project was achieved in a
gratifying percentage (77%), participation in training programmes indicates results such as learning new
teaching methods (74%), improving teaching skills (70%), appropriating differentiation strategies (59%),
objectives specifically pursued in courses.
In this QIE component, the changes from early school education intervention indicated in practice include
in teachers’ opinion based on survey carried out, introduction of new teaching methods (76%), paying
attention to how children learn (52%), more attractive lessons (51%). A greater impact of training courses
was registered for rural staff compared to urban staff. A large number of respondents appreciated how
resources complemented the methods, increased attractiveness by choosing other teaching strategies. For
9.4% of respondents the resources were interesting but inadequate for use in pre-school groups, which is
surprising (open materials were distributed with multiple opportunities for use). We would appreciate that
participation in peer learning activities was high (over 80%) and continued after the project was
completed, which proves the sustainability of the intervention.
5.3. EQ 7. Which parts of the modelling project/QIE component are most and least
effective? What factors explain the success?
Each component of the QIE was planned and implemented in line with the project Theory of Change, with
a view to contribute to the impacts expected. Quantitatively differentiating between the outputs, outcomes
and especially the contribution of each component to the project overall effectiveness was not possible. On
the other side, the components are very different and thus difficult to compare. Thus, the answer to this
evaluation question was formulated qualitatively, based on the perception of all stakeholders involved.
More effective components are those who contribute to a larger extent to the change triggered
(quantitatively/qualitatively).
At the level of QIE package there are several implementation models that can be considered successful. We
can name here: various dimensions of the intervention that have been successful in some schools - and
these components have been identified in the case studies; also, we can identify successful theoretical
models - discovered in the vision of the strategic partners (e.g., Ministry of Education); or successful
activities at the intervention level.
In this context, there are three key issues to be further considered:
• the successful intervention model according to the perception of the actors involved (headmasters,
teachers, parents, pupils);
• results defined as outcomes within the intervention, considered by the participants to be
successful;
• number of participants.
Therefore, on one hand, we will analyse the balance between perception and involvement, and on the other,
the changes produced in organizations both in terms of behaviour and mentality.
57
Last but not least, a success model can be analysed from a quantitative perspective, referring to the one
activity that is considered the most relevant. Moreover, a success model can be analysed in reference to the
activity, component that achieved the most effects, or the one that had the most visible impact on
supporting learning and reducing early school dropout.
Therefore, the analysis will address horizontal aspects (each implemented intervention vs. actors
involved), but also vertical aspects, at the organizational level. According to the QIE partners’ perspective,
a success model is closely related to the needs of the organizations and with the changes produced at the
level of stakeholders/key actors that can lead to the implementation of successful strategies regarding the
management of elements / crisis situations.
Based on the premise that a success model is the model that achieved its objectives and it is the most
popular among the involved actors, thus, analysing from a horizontal perspective that captures the
participants' perception, the answers with the highest frequencies (%) on each category are:
Category of What activity did you like the Precent (%) The component

One of the most frequently mentioned components of QIE package was the microgrant, followed, according
to teachers’ perspective, by transdisciplinary teaching. Both examples are considered new/innovative
activities by teachers. Moreover, from their perspective, microgrants are excelling due to their ability to
personalize the measures addressed to the identified needs. Basically, QIE focuses directly on the most
specific, relevant needs, this fact being confirmed by the management of the schools participating in the
intervention.
At the same time, we can observe that in rural areas teachers consider that parental education is more
important given the parents’ low interest in children’s education, the lack of appreciation towards the
usefulness of education, the adverse social context, in most cases, due to the poor labour market
integration.
Therefore, in a context in which the school does not have a direct link to the labour market, the need of
parenting education regarding school participation is much more necessary. Furthermore, the existence of
successful role models for schoolchildren can motivate them in both urban and rural areas.
The teaching component contributes to the development of teachers' professional skills and, compared to
their initial training, is especially focused on new areas, as: transdisciplinary elements and development of
abilities to organize new and various non-formal activities. These elements can help teachers to identify
strategies that can lead to an effective management of vulnerable schoolchildren.
As no mandatory targets on participation were embedded in the design of QIE package, each activity had
different levels of participation. Thus, it is possible to identify as an element of success the
components/activities that had a very large number of participants:
• training of educators in proportion of 100%;
• microgrants that produced effects on 13.033 children, 4.758 parents and 1.270 teachers involved;
• participants in parenting education sessions: 58 schools, 296 parental educators, 10.727 parents
involved (out of which 27% men), 1.182 teachers involved, 1.426 support group meetings, 17.799
impacted schoolchildren, 7.077 educator-parent meetings (HOLTiS);
• 80.6% of the teachers participating in the teaching component completed the course, 99.1% of
them capitalized the developed competencies in classroom and 74.9% of teachers presented and
disseminated the information at school level;
• Parental counselling: in the 2017-2018 school year, 13 schools counselled 218 parents (166
women and 52 men), and in the 2018-2019 school year there were 19 schools that counselled 262
people (213 women and 35 men); the training component for parental counselling was
represented as follows: in 2017-2018 school year there were 34 teachers (74%) and in 2018-2019
there were 28 teachers who promoted and completed the courses, meaning 83%; a total of 142
activities took place in the period 2018-2019.
We observe thus that the training of teachers conducted by the partner Step-by-Step was performed for all
educators from the schools where the QIE package was implemented. This is beneficial not only according
to the analysis of the component in itself, but also because, due to this type of activities, a professional
network of educators with certified skills was developed. Moreover, the participants were discovering the
education system/process from a unitary perspective towards development, which was a benefit for pre-
schoolchildren. Therefore, the professional community of educators gather around the same ideas, and this
can facilitate a greater involvement in the strategies identified for the management of vulnerable children.
In terms of microgrants, they have been successful models both as regards activities implemented in and
outside the school. Microgrants also addressed the particular needs of the school, including the lack of
material resources (for example, through microgrant, Dr. Al. Șafran Secondary School from Bacău bought
tablets, and before the pandemic, the schoolchildren had used them in class). Another added value was that
the school management learned that the organizational development process can be facilitated through
projects, by accessing funds according to the identified needs.
Teachers in rural areas identify the component of parental education as a model of success, and from the
level of output analysis the component is very generous in covering parents as key human resources in
59
supporting school participation. At a practical level parental education was more difficult to be
implemented due to the reluctance of the two partners, schools and families, to collaborate. Obviously,
collaboration can be hindered by a number of other factors, most of which are uncontrollable (for example,
parents' working abroad, material difficulties or lack of time for a teacher to build a stable relationship with
the parents, on the basis of collaboration, not imposed by the school authority). The case studies show that
27% of all participants in parental education trainings were men.
The training activity component implemented by the IES partner is seen by teachers as a successful
measure, although only 80.6% of them completed the course. The pass rate of the didactic course can be
explained by technological barriers (the trainees had to upload homework on the platform), lack of self-
management (lack of organization led to deadline omissions), personal issues (non-participation in the
final evaluation according to the methodology of the Ministry due to personal or family problems). From
the interviews, the IES partner did not identify participants who did not complete the training due to
inability to solve the required tasks. Furthermore, the participation in trainings for teachers is validated
through transferable professional credits. This is important because there is a mandatory requirement for
teachers to accumulate 90 credits every 5 years. Thus, the existence of these factors or constrains which
could not be overcome seems much more plausible than the lack of interest or insufficient development of
skills, because, according to the analysis, there can be identified the premises of a demonstrable extrinsic
motivation.
In regard to the case studies, we are going to address the following two components:
• to what extent the elements identified as successful can be found in the given examples (if the case
studies confirm the same components);
• if at the school level there are other additional dimensions that have been identified as successful
(if the organizational needs formulated individually for each school have led to other components
of the QIE package).
The case studies include in the evaluation were:
• Horgești Secondary School
• “Dr. Al. Șafran” Secondary School from Bacău City
• Zemeș Secondary School
• No. 2 Tg. Ocna Secondary School
• Frumoasa Secondary School
• Colonești Secondary School

According to the overall teachers’ perspective, the training for teachers, certainly, represents the most
successful activity, with one exception, namely the Zemeș Secondary School, where teachers considered
that the novelty elements were missing from these trainings. At the same time, microgrants remain the
activity most appreciated by schools.
According to the case study from the Frumoasa Balcani Secondary School, the initiation of parents
'participation in extracurricular activities, in parenting education and counselling sessions, the
involvement of the local administration (e.g. for financial support of schoolchildren's travel to activities
outside the locality, or collaboration with the school mediator), carrying out actions through microgrants,
teamwork of teachers and others would not have been possible without the support activities for the school
management that provided structure and trust. At the same time, "The school's perspective on vulnerable
children has changed, because we have become more aware than ever that we must be close to this category
of children emotionally, socially, trying to find solutions to the problems they face ... I had not known the
story behind the child before I did so many activities (…)” (headteacher).
Although they are in minority, we will make a brief analysis of the less appreciated aspects of the QIE
package. The successful activities were not the same in all schools and the same success patterns did not
have the same impact for all covered schools. There are also areas where the QIE intervention package did
not penetrate the educational environment or where it produced only effects, but not a visible impact (see
Chapter 8. “Main findings – Impact” for a classification of schools and how, depeding on their profile and
particularities, impact might be more or less visible).

The respondents of the teachers’ questionnaire have participated in all types of activities developed within
QIE package (see table 11 below), as follows: as in the case of headmasters, teachers consider that the most
useful activities are microgrants. Secondly, taking into consideration the importance given to each activity,
the teachers chose, after micro-grants, the transdisciplinary trainings (49.86% of all interviewed teachers).

The interviewees confirm the evidence collected through surveys, and consider that the most beneficial
components of QIE were microgrants (89.47% of the interviewees) and trainings for teachers on the
transdisciplinary dimension (86.84% of the interviewees). Regarding the still necessary activities for the
school in order to ensure the access and participation of all children in the educational act (question 24),
the most appreciated activity (59.4% to a large extent, 16.22% to a very large extent) is parental
counselling. The IES partner also trained mediators and school counsellors at the training course for

5.4. EQ8. Are there any unplanned outcomes worth considering for filling in capacity gaps
and/or addressing remaining bottlenecks?
Unplanned results can be identified both at the level of activities that have been recognized as successful,
as well as for those that have transformed the mentality and the organizational climate. The sources of
information for the answer to this evaluation question are the surveys addressed to pupils, parents,
teachers and headmasters, but especially case studies and qualitative methods of data collection.
Summarizing, from the data analysed, the unexpected outcomes (i.e., beyond the level expected/reasonably
to be expected for QIE) at school level are the following:
• reinterpreting the teacher’s role (the teachers were no longer limited to formal activities, but by
implementing non-formal activities they rediscovered the educational values and their added
value in the educational process. At the same time, the development of transdisciplinary lessons,
related to the theoretical aspects of the lessons, have given new nuances to the teacher’s purpose,
which should not be limited to the dissemination of information)
• valorisation of teachers and validation of their activities (teachers have regained confidence in
themselves, they have acknowledged the fact that there are still schools with children at risk and
that they can share practices, exchange experience, participate in the development of professional
networks that need to manage pupils at risk);
• participation of many fathers and grandfathers to parental education activities;
• rethinking the school as a solution, not a blockage (the pupils at risk have largely understood that
everybody should get involved, especially they themselves, in order to succeed through education).
Furthermore, we present the most relevant examples from the case studies that have been developed in
the following schools: Horgești Secondary School, Dr. Al. Șafran Secondary School from Bacau municipality,
Zemes Secondary School, no. 2 Tg. Ocna Secondary School, Frumoasa Secondary School, Colonesti
Secondary School.
In Horgești, as unexpected effects, we have identified the increased self-confidence of teachers, beyond
knowledge gained in the project and changes reasonably to be expected for this type of school (see chapter
on “Impact”). In Zemes positive elements regarding the school’s culture could be observed, mainly because
teachers consider that the school became a second family for them. At Coloneşti Secondary School teachers
mentioned certain unexpected outcomes of the interventions (e.g., One interviewed teacher said “I
developed my ability to speak in public and managed to overcome my emotion and to discover myself.”).
As well, mothers were encouraged to denounce abuses and domestic violence, so they are asking for orders
of protection from the local authorities (an increased self-confidence due to parenting courses and
discussions with other parents, teachers and local representatives).
In Bacau, at Dr. Al Safran Secondary School, the relationship with the community has been maintained and
the enhanced visibility of the kindergarten became obvious during the data collection phase. The fact that
the participants developed activities within mixed teams (teachers from rural and urban areas) constitutes
an added value of the intervention. Moreover, a system of sharing information and experiences is still used
within the school. The professionalization was achieved in a percentage of 80 % for kindergarten teachers
and to a lower extend for teachers. At the same time, the relationship between teachers has been
strengthened and the approach through activities has changed.
Among the unexpected effects registered, the interviewees mentioned:
• Increased self-confidence of parents and changed expectations regarding their involvement in
children’ education (the mothers have expressed their expectation that fathers will participate in
parenting and counselling sessions in a greater numbers);
• Developing friendships between teachers as a result of the activities that they have attended
together (training courses and extracurricular activities or project management activities);
• Changes at a personal level for the involved teachers;
65
• Following the parental counselling component of the project, Frumoasa Secondary School could
include in the organization chart ½ the position of educational counselling, which was covered by
the teacher who was initiated in this field through the trainings conducted during the
implementation of the project;
• Imposibility to solve two cases of school dropout48 (one girl and a boy in the same Roma family),
despite frequent intervention and communication with the family. The family has more children
in school, but in the case of the two older ones the family and the school could not counteract their
decisions, i.e. the daughter got pregnant, got married and went to another locality and the boy has
to work to supplement the family’s income. Such situationas are identified in as causes of drop-out
in Chapter 8. “Main findings – Impact”.
• The following acquired skills have proven their value over time and in current learning situations
(online learning) that could not be anticipated (due to the context of the COVID pandemic):
development of decentralized education scenarios at school level, complex organization of
activities, writing projects for funds/ for health materials procurement, teamwork, teachers’
ability to use technology and establish priorities in teaching and learning processes for vulnerable
pupils, good relationships between schoolchildren that facilitate distance learning, partnership
with families in learning, capacity to manage local community difficult situations.
• CSI took over some of QIE activities in other application developed to obtain funds from different
sources (for more details in Chapter 8. “Main findings – Impact”).
6. Main findings – Efficiency
6.1. EQ 9. Does the modelling project use resources in the most economical/efficient manner
to achieve expected results?
In order to answer this evaluation question, we conducted a budget and costs analysis and a simple cost-
effectiveness analysis, using data provided by UNCIEF, including the costing analysis realised by ISE on the
basis of QIE package budget for 2015-2017. The objective of the analysis was to identify average unit costs
comparable to other unitary/standard costs of similar interventions. The qualitative evaluation (based on
interviews and case studies) has been used to understand the dynamics between provided and needed
resources of all types.
Based on existing data, QIE used its budget in an economical way, with smaller unit cost compared to other
intervention in the field of education and aiming at increasing access and participation to school, school-
family relations, as well as developing teachers’ capacity to implement effective teaching and learning
methods, their management and leadership skills and many other.
According to data provided by UNICEF, the total amount allocated to implementing partners in the period
2015-2018 is RON 11.9 million. Converted to Euro, taking into account the average annual exchange rate,
the total budget of the QIE package is EUR 2.6 million (see table 13 below).

* Management cost for ISE have been divided proportionally among the components
** The budget for 2018 includes both the budget for QIE package and the budget for the transition
to the new UNICEF intervention in the field of education.
The amount of RON 12 million includes the management cost of implementation partners – 15,64%
overall. Among partners and from one year to another the management costs vary significantly, taking into
account the nature of the activities and the partners’ needs. This is comparable to the average indirect costs
of programmes funded by the EU and Norway and EEA grants, between 10% and 20% of the direct costs.
Overall, this proportion shows a very good distribution of costs, with the large majority of the budget
allocated to activities directly linked to the planned results, but with sufficient attention for
management and coordination to ensure quality and timely implementation of the activities.
The amount of RON 12 million also includes the contribution of the implementing partners – 4,77% overall
– with significant variations among partners and from one year to another, taking into account the nature
of the activities and the partners’ needs.
The amount presented does not include the management costs of UNICEF for QIE package, that cannot be
easily separated from in UNICEF’s core budget. However, these costs are overall a small part of QIE’s
budget. Moreover, the amount presented does not include the budget for analysis and research conducted
by Împreună Association in 2016 and ISE in 2018 in order to support the advocacy and transition process
(costing analysis and further research for up-scaling the intervention model and the needs of assessment
for supporting the transition to upper secondary level).
On the other hand, the budget for 2018 includes both the budget for QIE package and the budget for the
transition to the new UNICEF intervention in the field of education. Taking this limitation into account,
in order to calculate an average cost of QIE/school we simulated the 2018 budget without the
transition elements, based on the 2017 budget and considering 50% of the budget for early education
within the core QIE budget for 2018 (and the other 50% for the transition). The overall amount of QIE
budget in four years of implementation is under RON 10.4 million (under EUR 2.4 million). The proportions
for the management (indirect) costs and the contribution of the implementing partners remains the same
in this simulation and findings regarding the good management of these costs are maintained (see table 14
below).

* Management cost for ISE have been divided proportionally among the components
This budget represents an average cost of EUR 11,220/school/year and EUR 8,815/school/year
without the component for parental support. This is significantly lower compared to the average
amount/standard cost that the European Commission assigned in 2018 to one Romanian school
implementing an Erasmus+ partnership in education (i.e., EUR 16,50049). If the expenses for project
meetings in other countries are deducted from this Erasmus+ standard cost, the amount left for project
implementation, locally, is approximately EUR 10,000/year. This comparable to QIE’s budget, however, the
activities carried out in these projects do not cover such a wide range as those in the QIE package and do
not involve such a high number of pupils and stakeholders. The Erasmus+ standard costs do not cover
activities related to parental education, and thus they are more comparable, and higher, than the EUR

According to UNICEF reports to donors, QIE contributed to ensuring better quality and ensured
inclusiveness of the school education for over 22,000 children, from kindergarten to the 8th grade. This
represents an average cost of EUR 105/child or schoolchild for the entire implementation period of
QIE (taking into account that some children benefit from QIE several years). This is about six times less
than the average unit cost for each child or schoolchild supported by the RO10-CORAI programme
(“Children and young people at risk and local and regional initiatives to reduce national inequalities and
promote social inclusion”)50 funded by EEA Grants 2009-2014. Projects funded by the European Social
Fund, through the Operational Programme Human Capital (OPHC) 2014-2020, planned to use over
EUR 2,500/beneficiary children /schoolchildren, over 20 times more than QIE in order to prevent
and fight school dropout in projects targeting 76.656 children and pupils (including high school
schoolchildren). The comparison has limitations, because QIE intervention is unique and the interventions
funded by RO10-CORAI and OPHC programmes are very diverse, including both educational and social
support. However, the large difference between the two interventions shows a good use of financial
resources for the implementation of QIE package reported to the overall results achieved regarding the
number of schoolchildren supported on their educational path and prevented from dropping out of school.
A budget of RON 4,98 million, including indirect/management costs (about EUR 1,1 mil.) was allocated to
trainings for teachers and headmasters (the third component of QIE on teaching and learning methods,
focusing on training teachers and, trainings for headmasters and training on fundraising under the first

68
component, trainings for diversity in schools under the third component of QIE and trainings for
kindergarten teachers under the early education component). Considering the total number of teachers
and headmasters participating in trainings, the average unit cost for training teaching staff in QIE is
under RON 2,000/person (about EUR 435/person). This is considerably lower than the RON
3,574/person (EUR 763/person), the costs planned by the Ministry of Education within the strategic
project CRED implemented within the Operational Programme Human Capital (OPHC) 2014-2020.
QIE’s budget for training teachers is close to the budget allocated for preparing and delivering trainings for
teachers under the Erasmus+ Programme: EUR 305/person for training preparation and delivery,
excluding costs for participants travel, accommodation and meals51 (included in QIE’s budget).
Overall, interviewed stakeholders and beneficiaries, including UNICEF’s implementing partners,
headmasters and teachers involved in the package implementation (including micro-grants) agree
that resources have been used to their maximum potential. Consulting all interested parties, the
evaluation team didn’t identify any output or outcome of QIE that could have been achieved with less costs.
Moreover, the overall feedback from UNICEF’s implementing partners, headmasters and teachers involved
in the package implementation was that small budgets have been used to generate all expected results.
Microgrants have been particularly appreciated by all interested parties as a good way to use small
amounts of money to generate outcomes at the level of teachers (that learned and practiced new and
different ways to teach, based on direct children experience in activities outside the school premises) and
at the level of children. The majority of respondents from schools claim that the necessary resources were
mainly available and adequate to support their short-term goals. As an example, in Tg. Ogna, the trip
organized in Brasov (where children visited the oldest Romanian school and the zoo) was a proof of
efficient utilization of resources for schoolchildren’ benefit. Other resources provided were considered
useful: books for teachers and schoolchildren (the story booklets designed by Împreună Association,
guidelines for kindergarten team - Fundamental landmarks in the development of children aged 0-7 years),
a tablet for the school counsellor, useful for working with schoolchildren etc.
On the other hand, case studies show that in the first years of QIE implementation most funds in the
microgrants were used by schools to buy teaching materials that schools did not afford with budgets
allocated by local authorities. This contributed to teacher’s progress in improving their teaching methods
and practices. Other purchases from microgrants included books for the Reading Club, financing the
development of infrastructure (internet access) etc.
Case studies also show the headmasters and teachers felt that having enough funds and material resources
to organize their activities, although these resources are not large, is extremely important for their capacity
to do their job without additional, unnecessary stress. In Zemeș, for example, all interviewed teachers and
the school manager consider QIE highly efficient, with needed activities organised in time, but without the
feeling of funds shortage that is too often the rule in the budgetary management of the school. Although all
teachers underlined the importance of knowledge, trainings, new teaching methods and opened channels
for communication with parents, they also stressed the importance of having enough teaching materials
and the necessary equipment to implement the new teaching methods learned in trainings.
However, material shortcomings are still present in the schools participating to QIE package, including lack
of space and adequate furniture, problems related to missing textbooks and some other teaching materials,
as underlined in Horgești and Tg. Ogna case studies. Shortages in human resources, especially school
counsellors and school mediators also affect the schools, and they can have an influence over the
effectiveness and sustainability of QIE package.
If considered separately, the costs for training kindergarten teachers are with 40% lower than costs for
training teachers at the primary and lower secondary school levels. Interviews show there are no important
differences in the training logistics and organisation activities, but training objectives and curricula
generated short learning programmes for training early school teachers with an impact on costs. This is
more related to the training objectives and curricula, and there are no specific elements that show that
lower costs for training early school teachers are related to a high efficiency approach.
6.2. EQ 10. What is the value added (in terms of financial value) of the modelling project?
In order to answer this evaluation question, we focused on the additional funds made available to schools
through the projects granted as a result of the Technical Assistance support received from the project
51 Erasmus+ Programme Guide for 2018.
69
partners. We triangulated the quantitative data with qualitative information from case studies in order to
assess the sustainability and potential for future positive development related to the financial added value
of QIE package.
From the point of view of the financial added value the investment in technical assistance for schools has
been recovered by schools that have been successful in fundraising activities. Case studies show that school
representatives remain motivated to access funds for activities similar to QIE and if they are successful the
financial added value of QIE can increase in the future.
In total, 55 community teams including two teachers (often one of them being the school manager) and one
representative of the mayoralty participating in technical assistance activities including trainings for
fundraising and customized support for project proposals elaborated to further answer the funding needs
of schools. The budget for technical assistance was RON 581,610 (EUR 126,152), taking into account
the adjustments needed for the 2018 budget.
In total, the County School Inspectorate Bacău and nine schools participating in QIE raised
approximately52 RON 865,000 (EUR 158,800) through projects written with the support of the technical
assistance team, therefore surpassing the investment in technical assistance in the first year after QIE
ended its implementation.
Seven other schools applied for Erasmus+ funding in 2019 and obtained good and very good scores for
their project proposals (although they were not awarded funding from their first attempt). In total, the
seven schools elaborated project proposals and application for over EUR 190,000. They developed further
their capacity to fundraise, adding practical experience to the training and consultancy received from
Împreună Association. The application for funds is a learning process for schools and they are progressing
and they have had success in a highly competitive context: the calls for Eramus+ funding. On the other hand,
although their capacity to access funding has been raised, schools are not able to apply for many other
funding sources without the support of the local authorities. Even though they were invited to participate
in the trainings, the local context affected the possibility of a real partnership between school and the
mayoralty in many localities.
Case studies show that the schools that submitted applications for Erasmus+ funding and have not been
awarded funding from the first attempt are still motivated to improve their application and to submit them
again. Some headmasters consider that microgrants and the process to access funds from Terre des
Hommes, provided for school infrastructure, have also helped in developing schools’ capacity for
fundraising in the future. Several schools participating to QIE package are also part of the EduNetwork due
to the competences on project development acquired through technical assistance. The fact that
headmasters understood the process of fundraising and project management and are not
discouraged by the first rejection of a project proposal allows us to anticipate that fundraising
efforts will continue in the schools that benefited from technical assistance.
6.3. EQ 11. Are the cost implications for scaling up considered?
In order to answer this evaluation question a costing analysis has been undertaken. For this purpose, we
take into account the estimations made by UNICEF on the costs for scaling up QIE.
Cost implications for scaling up QIE have been considered; UNICEF used the financial analyses in order to
advocate for scaling up the model, taking into consideration that (a) scaling up the model at national level
requires less than 2% of the budget of the Ministry of Education in the first year of implementation and less
than 1% every year afterwards and (b) the model can be rolled out and scaled up partially, starting with
the most disadvantaged schools and / or counties. In this case, unit costs for budgeting estimation at school
and county levels are available.
UNICEF paid special attention to advocacy in order to roll-out QIE in other schools and counties and to scale
up QIE at national level.
According to UNICEF’s costing model, the cost of implementing the Quality Inclusive Education package is
of EUR 84/schoolchild per year during the first school year of the package implementation and then
of EUR 32/year in the following years. In the first year, this budget needed to implement QIE at
52 The approximation is generated by the exchange rates used for this analysis, considering some projects have official
budgets in EUR and others in RON and they are funded in 2017, 2018 and 2019.
70
national level, covering all schoolchildren in early education, primary and lower secondary levels
of school, represents only 1,97% of the budget of the Ministry of Education and 2,49% of the budget
allocated by the Ministry for preuniversity education. The budget needed is estimated at less than half of
the aforementioned amount from the second year of the QIE package implementation at national level:
0,92% of the budget of the Ministry of Education and 1,17% of the budget allocated by the Ministry for
preuniversity education. This costing estimation takes into account components on school management,
teaching and learning methods, promoting diversity in schools, early education and microgrants. A
decreased training need occurred as different from the first to the second year, after the initial
implementation of the entire package. Moreover, the costing model anticipates the budget for coordination
will be optimised after the first year of implementation.
For the scaling up of components dedicated to school management and to teachers (teaching and learning
methods) the estimated investment needed is EUR 13/schoolchild per year in the first year of
implementing quality inclusive education activities. At the school level, the estimated investment needed
is EUR 4,617 for the first year of implementation. If considering other years for the implementation (after
the first year), the investment at the level of each school is about EUR 3,100/year for the components
dedicated to school management and to teachers.
For the promotion of diversity in schools, using role models, the estimated investment needed is EUR
10/child per year in the first year of implementing quality inclusive education activities and EUR 3/child
per year starting with the second year of implementation, including a county and a national monitoring and
evaluation research on the impact of the programme every year.
For early education, the estimated investment needed is EUR 25/child per year in the first year of
implementing quality inclusive education activities and EUR 7/child per year starting with the second year
of implementation.
On the parental education component, a parenting course cycle (10 sessions) is estimated to EUR
25/parent. Parents could attend a new parenting courses cycle when their child enters a new educational
cycle. Training the parenting educators, which can train in time hundreds and thousands of parents, costs
EUR 280/trainee.
Several elements of QIE package can be implemented separately, according to school needs. The
components of the Package can be implemented progressively, starting from disadvantaged schools and /
or counties, with a high level of absenteeism and school dropout. Unit costs have been developed to
support budgeting for rolling-out different components, according to the table 16 below.

* The costing model has been developed in USD, but taking into consideration funding opportunities
in Romania, the estimated costs have been converted to RON and EUR using the average exchange
rate for 2018.
The main funding source considered for scaling up the model is the state budget. Local budgets can be also
used for components or parts of components as the microgrants, parental support, meeting, exchanges and
the endowment needed by schools. However, taking into account the challenges the state and local budgets
are facing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, risk related to scaling up funding from national budgets have
been increasing in 2020.
For rolling out and piloting further while scaling-up until reaching national coverage, the main funding
sources are the EEA and Norway Grants and the European Social Fund. It is very important to underline
that the Operational Programme Employment and Education 2021-2027 includes a priority for the
prevention of early school leaving and raising access and participation of disadvantaged children and youth
people to education. Therefore, a larger budget will be available in the next multiannual programming
period for quality inclusive education activities.
7. Main findings - SUSTAINABILITY
7.1. EQ 12 Are the interventions modelled likely to continue when external support is
withdrawn?
In order to answer this evaluation question, the evaluation team assess the extent to which the necessary
preconditions were put in place for project continuation, after QIE was completed:
The stakeholders (at school and county level) have the understanding and capacity to continue QIE
activities
Research data collected at school and local levels show that stakeholders generally have an adequate
understanding of the need to continue all activities proposed by the project. Their unanimously expressed
perspectives show that they acknowledge the importance of the continuation of the activities and, at the
same, the need for continuous support in carrying out some of them.
From a conceptual perspective, the interviews conducted at school and county levels reflect a good, broader
understanding of the concepts of inclusive education and quality in education. According to the case studies
carried out, at school level, as a result of the focus on the concept of inclusion for all children within all
project activities, the evaluation identified an „all-encompassing perspective” i.e., a teacher explicitly stated
that “it is no longer just about children with SEN” and a parent who felt that “all children and parents are
equal” (in the sense of benefits and participation in activities, without positive discrimination)”. However,
at a more subtle level, interviews and focus groups with schoolchildren, parents and teachers capture
attitudes of segregation or denial of vulnerabilities in communities (which are also reflected in the school
community), especially by ethnic or socio-economic criteria. This aspect indicates that a continuation of
72
long-term school practices is necessary for an adequate understanding and application of the non-
discrimination concept to be maintained.
Also, in terms of the quality of education, the analysed qualitative data show a broader understanding of the
concept, beyond attendance and academic results, which includes the importance of the learning climate,
the support provided in the family and school, the motivation and participation of schoolchildren in
learning, of progress as success. As one headmaster mentioned during an interview: "I understand that
every child has a story and that school must go beyond education". This new attitude and vision are also
emphasized by the interviewed CSI representative who states that schools have taken up the concept of
"friendly school" (which involves attention for each child, openness to the community and pleasure in
learning) among their responsibilities, and committing in this direction in the institutional development
plan.
According to the data, all headmasters realize that (see figure 14 below), following the implementation of
QIE, ensuring access and participation of children / pupils to quality inclusive education does not happen
unconditionally and it involves the continuation of activities, firstly by writing projects / funding
applications addressed to this topic, support through counselling and mediation for children belonging to
vulnerable groups, development and application of teaching strategies adapted to children belonging to
vulnerable groups, organization of various school and extracurricular activities, with the participation of
all schoolchildren and involvement of parents in school activities, actions to improve communication with
all parents, the involvement of school in partnerships at the community level, the support of children in the
community, the development of parenting skills for parents.

According to the members of the school community, there is sufficient determination and experience to
continue and improve existing practices regarding (i) the diversification of the offer of school and
extracurricular activities that motivate and involve all schoolchildren, (ii) the use of teaching strategies
adapted to the needs of schoolchildren from vulnerable groups and (iii) in the area of strategic
management, with an emphasis on reducing dropout and increasing school participation.
At the same time, over 70% of headmasters say that (see figure 15 below), while there is an increased
interest in continuing the activities, the capacities and resources of schools are variable or insufficient for
further development and facilitation of involvement of parents in school activities, actions to improve
73
communication with parents of children from disadvantaged groups, involvement of the school in
partnerships at community level, parenting education and parenting counselling activities, counselling and
mediation support services for children from vulnerable groups, project writing activities / funding
applications. This indicates that further resources and interventions are needed for continuing the activities
initiated by QIE, for maintaining and further strengthening the results obtained and for achieving a long-term,
solid impact.

The case studies highlight the risk that school actions will no longer be supported by local authorities when
the political party is changed (following local elections), due to other mayoral priorities and a limited
understanding of the role of education and the school's strategic priorities. We also identify a risk steaming
from an insufficiently developed normative framework for regulating the standards, obligations and
responsibilities for the implementation of inclusion in schools. Interviews with school headmasters,
teachers and school counsellors highlighted normative deficiencies especially related to the integrated
management of educational support services for vulnerable schoolchildren (lack of options, transitions
difficulties between institutions, insufficient number of support staff), or ensuring flexibility to their
curricular route (possibility to add or give up teaching activities, flexible evaluations, etc.)
The human resources involved in the project continue activities beyond its completion (trained
teachers and headmasters are still present in the schools)
The evidence collected, including the case studies, indicate that the schools where QIE interventions are
most likely to be sustainable are those in which the headmaster and teachers are from the locality or
proximity, have a long experience in the school and do not intend to move to another school.
The stability of human resources who benefited from training activities remains a major risk for the
sustainability of the entire QIE intervention, not only of the training activities. The absence of specific
norms related to this aspect contributes to this risk, together with the low attractiveness of the profession
of teacher or school counsellor, especially in rural areas, and the political instability that triggers the
instability of school management functions. According to the integrated approach of the project, the
intervention targeted the wider school environment - including families and the community, with the
psychological and psychosocial aspects involved, however, considering the centrality of teachers in the
framework of QIE and for its success, the obtained effects might not be maintained if teachers migrate from
one school to another.
Although the project has clear results in terms of developing the teams of teachers in each school, in real
terms the project has generated little (otherwise not expected) effect on stabilizing the teaching staff in the
school (as an indirect effect fostering sustainability). The evaluation identified several cases in which
74
dedicated teachers have left the school due to procedures for school recruitment in place, the following
year after participating in QIE activities. The decisions on teacher mobility are not under the responsibility
of the school and the effects created by the deficient regulations are felt especially by vulnerable schools -
usually schools with a small number of pupils in rural areas. For example, in one case, despite the fact that
most teachers are local and attached to school, the school headmaster mentions the risk that human
resource mobility may not be stopped due to existing staffing rules (that do not take into account local and
individual needs (the distance / costs of commuting).
In addition to job instability, a major risk to the sustainability of outcomes is the fractional workloads of
teachers and school counsellors (who teach / have counselling activities) in several schools, sometimes
facing difficult commuting schedules from one place to another. At national and county level, especially in
rural areas, the number of school counsellors and school mediators is low (some of the schools included in
the project did not have this support staff), with overloaded rules, which jeopardizes counselling / support
activities specific to inclusion.
New knowledge and tools developed under the project continue to be implemented after project
completion.
From an institutional point of view, each school included in the project has developed an Institutional
Development Plan with an emphasis on school access and participation through inclusion and educational
quality. From this perspective, according to the interviewed headmasters, most of them feel committed to
the vision and objectives of the QIE package. But the situation varies greatly in terms of strategic
management. The case studies show progress in several schools in this regard, but it is necessary to
continue the consulting / mentoring process in order to institutionalize these systematic planning
practices.
Evidence collected indicate that the activities carried out within the project and the long duration of the
intervention (2014-2019) created emulation in schools, developed trusting relationships within and
between target groups (especially schoolchildren, parents, teachers, managers). In this context, the
teachers and headmasters involved in the project have developed an attachment to the school and the
community and a commitment to the goal of quality inclusive education. Therefore, most activities related
to strengthening learning culture and environment are likely to be sustainable (see Q38 in teaches survey).
The interviewed teachers state that they have increased and improved their repertoire of teaching
methods, that they continue to use them and the skills of adapting the curriculum to the cases of vulnerable
pupils and digital skills are very useful, even more in the current context of teaching-learning-assessment
online. One of the methods most frequently mentioned as continuously learned and used by teachers in
preschool, primary and secondary school levels is learning through games, especially in the form of
dramatization. The risk identified by teachers regarding sustainability is the loss of energy and the context
of group emulation to “do activities differently” (which is already happening due to isolation for the
pandemic control).
The pedagogical resources developed or offered within the project by the project partners (from course
materials to teaching materials / kits, musical instruments and consumables for scientific experiments),
are considered very useful (see figure 16 below), thus contributing to the sustainability of QIE actions. In
particular, kindergarten teachers mention the endowments received in the project (teaching and technical
means, including materials received in the other components of the project – e.g., kits related to the
diversity concept) as being necessary in their pedagogical activity after the end of the project.

The trainings (for early education, management, teaching methods and techniques, transdisciplinary
approach, parenting education, parenting counselling) have generated for most of the teachers, interest
and determination for professional development for inclusion (even related to specific interventions in this
area), which demonstrates sustainability of all training activities.
Teachers, especially preschool ones, say that there is an increased willingness to continue peer learning
and to share experiences (see figure 17 below). In this sense, the sharing of QIE experiences in methodical
circles is an element that continues to promote the results in school and facilitates the implementation of
these type of activities in other schools.

Regarding sustainability of effects at the level of pupils, teachers mentioned that the most relevant activities
for pupils (i.e., success role models and extracurricular activities such as excursions and visits under
microgrants), are the least likely to continue, without financial resources and support. Mixed sustainability
perspectives can also be estimated in relation to attention paid in school to smaller groups of
schoolchildren who express their educational needs in a more subtle and discreet manner. As it is
highlighted in one case study, in a school where most schoolchildren are competitive and oriented towards
academic performance, the needs of schoolchildren with poorer results and schoolchildren from
economically disadvantaged communities tend to be overlooked by teachers ((focused more on
performance and competitions).
Parenting education, although considered by all respondents one of the most effective and appreciated
activity, remains complex and sometimes challenging, as it requires distinct time and support in managing
76
difficult cases (of parents), Teachers who have developed skills as a parent educator report in interviews a
high overload determined by the various components of their professional role, hence the limited ability to
continue working with parents without support and guidance.
Relationship built between schools and parents and other members of the community is maintained.
Case studies have shown that parenting activities and training for parenting have positively changed the
perspective on parents and on the teacher-parent relationship. Moreover, in some cases, the parents who
participated in the parenting groups formed consolidated group and continued to communicate (directly
and online, on Facebook) after the end of the programme. The risk identified by a headmaster is that the
relationship with the parents will become formal again, after such a long break of face-to-face interaction
in the school space (in the context of the pandemic).
Overall, funds are secured (national budget and or/EU funds) for the project continuation
According to the vast majority of opinions expressed, it is very unlikely that the comprehensive approach - on
all components of the QIE model - will be sustainable in schools, without additional allocation of human and
financial resources. According to the data provided by the case studies, susceptible to have low
sustainability are: parenting counselling activities - due to the lack or insufficiency of human resources in
relation to the needs, extracurricular activities such as trips / visits (which was considered one of the most
relevant activities in pupils' perspective) - due to the insufficient financial resources and trainings in the
area of management skills or inclusion - due to low / lower quality offers at DCH level and limited financial
resources of teachers.
Regarding the availability of financial resources for sustainability, the process of ensuring funds at local
level is complicated, it depends on local budgeting, other investment projects and the political decision on
investments at the county level. The survey participants and interviewees stated that they had failed to
identify the sources of funding needed to continue the full implementation of the model after the
withdrawal of UNICEF support. They mention that microgrants have been a very relevant / valuable
resource component in relation to the specific needs of each school and that it will be difficult to find
equivalent resources. The main sources identified by managers, especially for the continuation of non-
formal activities with schoolchildren and exchanges between schools - are the local budget or funds
attracted from the local community.
Although the lack of financial resources remains a risk factor for the sustainability of certain components
of the package, some of the gaps mentioned above could, for example, be covered by national programmes.
It is also necessary at the national / central level to make full use of all available regional, national and EU
funding mechanisms and programmes, such as Erasmus +, the European Social Fund Plus, the European
Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), InvestEU and the new opportunities under the Recovery and
Resilience Facility, towards fostering sustainable investment in equitable and inclusive education and
training in order to promote educational success for all.
Measures have been taken to roll-up the model
The case studies highlighted several types of measures that were implemented in order to continue QIE
interventions:
• The management team continues to develop action strategies for the school and to write
projects to attract resources in the new context of distance learning (at the time of the
interview the priorities were health and digitization needs).
• The school board proposed that parents take the initiative to organize parenting groups and
the school counsellor continues the distance work.
• Parenting educators have included and used elements of parenting education during meetings
with parents in the classroom.
• Local representatives support activities carried out within the QIE package and similar
activities, especially those linking the school to the community, such as the community
festivals (country celebration) and visible non-formal activities.
Regarding the feasibility, timeliness and risks of extending the QIE model, the following issues were
identified in interviews with national stakeholders and project partners:
• One possible way to replicate the model at the national level would be to address parenting
education and extracurricular activities as priorities for preventing and combating early school
77
leaving - in the form of grants that aim for both objectives or multiplied by an uncompetitive
Ministry of National Education project.
• The sustainability of QIE intervention is ensured by documenting proposals / recommendations
to improve the legislation on certain levels. Recently passed legislation that regulates the delivery
of the minimum package of services (MPS) in Romania, at least indirectly supports the replication
of QIE.
• The current legislative changes that address the workload of the school counsellor, will contribute
to the sustainability of the project in the area of counselling interventions.
• Addressing through normative acts several factors that contribute to school dropout could be
replicated(i.e. flexible training methodology, combining school-based training with cluster-based
training, monitoring tools and simple procedures for applying these tools, programs of initial and
continuous training of teachers to approach the relevant noncognitive / relational competences,
of organization and feedback in learning, the didactic competences of adaptation / curricular
flexibility and the technical / applied competences for writing and project management)
• The Ministry of National Education plans, when developing projects for obtaining European funds,
more sustained interventions at school level, depending on the identified need, with types of
activities similar with those from QIE interventions.
• Challenges in scaling the intervention at national level due to major urban-rural differences
(different needs, different priorities, different costs in different types of schools) and the
difficulties to develop a clear typology of schools in Romania (by the MNE).
• Frequent policy changes, at local level (for the promotion and implementation of interventions)
and at national level (for programme, decision-making and legislative coherence), create obstacles
in extending the intervention.
• The main risk regarding the sustainability of the effects of QIE intervention is at the school level.
Schools are dependent on the headmaster from a development point of view and the key is an
active, open role of the headmaster and a motivated work team. For this result, the coaching or
mentoring processes through which the management is accompanied on a long-term basis to make
the proposed changes are identified as essential. The sustainability strategy of this process could
be to redefine the role of CSI with a focus on guidance and monitoring (which is deficient at the
system level).
• The role models component has an important impact at the level of school culture, the tools
developed within it being included in the IDP and the pedagogical kits on the topic of diversity
being frequently used especially by preschool teachers.
• The strategy for sustainability regarding the parenting education component could consist in
granting an accreditation for parenting educators (after the first session with parents and the
requirement for further training / supervision), involvement of local authorities (to ensure funds)
and CSI taking over the monitoring process.
• For the early education component, a replication is currently taking place in Brașov County; at
national level replication would require a coordination effort on the part of the central authority.
• The training for teachers component, which included teaching and learning methods, and the
entire QIE experience inspired the design of the largest teacher training project in Romania –
CRED: the training model (face to face / online), platform, training modules; the component of
interventions in schools specifically addressed to schoolchildren at risk of dropping out.
7.2. EQ 13. Is the modelling project replicable? Are any adjustments of the model needed for
replication?
The answer to this evaluation question draws on the collected evidence and findings issued under all
previous evaluation questions. As such, the replicability analysis and subsequent recommendations refer
to:
1. Actions already taken to replicate or scale-up QIE package or its components.
78
2. Requirements for QIE replication: needed human resources (including capacity building, management
and coordination at national and country level), needed continuous training and their costs (according
to answer to evaluation question 11), legislative changes, institutional changes, and administrative
changes needed, possible risks and best mitigation measures.
Initiatives including almost all QIE components show that replication is possible at local and national level.
However, replication at national level of the entire QIE package in the immediate future is less probable
given the challenges faced by schools and the school system. The replication of QIE components as separate
initiatives at local or national level is, nevertheless, possible with minimum adjustments and has been
started already by UNICEF, its implementing partners, the Ministry of Education. QIE replication can be
successful if connected to a human resource policy and development programme for the pre-academic
Education.
Scaling-up nationally the QIE pilot package has been an explicit objective of UNICEF and its partners since
the beginning of the implementation. The advocacy plan includes activities on three levels:
• gaining support from decision makers at national level, but also from teachers, schoolchildren,
parents and other stakeholders;
• using this support to advocate for legal, institutional and administrative changes needed and for
budget allocations needed for replicating QIE package or its components;
• county education institutions for implementation, building on the experience from Bacău and
shared by the County School Inspectorates and the County Centre for Educational Resources of
Bacău.
From the perspective of target groups, the advocacy strategy has three types of stakeholders: (1) the
general public interested in school activities – teachers, schoolchildren and their parents, (2) local and
county authorities and other organisations able to replicate QIE at local level and (3) national
authorities/decision makers.
In relation to the first target group, public support for all advocacy activities was created using public
personalities (athletes and artists) as ambassadors and sharing impact stories. Events in schools across the
country, organised by UNICEF’s partners, contributed as well to rising awareness and building public
support for QIE replication.
In relation with the second and third target groups, in their dialogue with national and local institutional
stakeholders, UNICEF and its partners used evidenced-based advocacy materials and messages, including
a costing model estimating the needed budget to roll-out QIE in schools and to scale it up at national level
(see answer to evaluation question 11). When designing QIE package, a specific focus was placed on
identifying resources already existing in the system of education and avoid creating new positions and
generating corresponding costs associated with additional human resources. Instead, at all levels the existing
institutional structures and human resources have been adjusted for the implementation of QIE and its
scaling up. This approach was planned in order to sustain the ownership of the existing institutions at all
levels (from the Ministry of Education to each school involved). Thus, the costing model and other advocacy
documents include data useful at school, municipality or county level, supporting local initiatives to
replicate the model. On the other hand, the advocacy documents, including budget scenarios, inform
national authorities on the needed actions and financial allocations scaling-up nationally the QIE pilot
package or just some of its components.
From the perspective of their scope, advocacy activities of UNICEF and partners included two approaches:
• the promotion of the entire QIE package, as in this piloting phase in Bacau, a comprehensive model
addressing holistically all stakeholders involved in children education and
• rolling-out components of QIE in other projects and scaling them up through strategies, laws and
regulations proposed to national decision makers.
The case studies shows that replication of QIE in other municipalities and counties would be beneficial for a
quality, inclusive education, given the holistic approach of the intervention and that most QIE components can
be replicated as designed by UNICEF and partners (with no important adjustments needed). Moreover,
teachers appreciated that the teaching style promoted in QIE could be standardized at the level of all
schools, including in rural areas.
However, the cases studies from schools show how results at the level of each target group (children,
teachers, parents, the school manager) are supported by different activities under different
components (e.g.: teachers’ approach to school and their stability is connected to the activities targeting
79
teachers, but also the school manager; the improved relationship between school and community is due to
activities targeting the school manager, parental education and microgrants activities etc.). Therefore, one
of the lessons learned is the need to implement, in the same school, complementary activities from
different QIE components.
On the other hand, data collected at county and national level show that rolling-out and/or scaling-up
components of QIE is more realistic and feasible than aiming for the replication of the entire package at
once. Several important steps have been made during QIE implementation and after June 2019 in order to
ensure separate replication of different components:
• Important elements of the component including trainings for teachers and some elements
from the microgrants component have been replicated in the large project implemented by
the Ministry of Education: “Relevant curriculum, open education for all” (“Curriculum relevant,
educație deschisă pentru toți”) – CRED, funded by European funds (Operational Programme Human
Capital). The project includes the development of a public policy, revised methodologies used in
schools, the publication of Open Educational Resources and training for 55.000 teachers in order
to empower them to use available resources and new teaching methods.53
• The project also includes a budget for tailored support for children at risk of dropping out, in
selected pilot schools. Although this is not replicating microgrants, because the granting
procedures are not used, similar support (services and educational materials) are available for
2.500 children in pilot schools through CRED project.54
• Important elements of the early education component have been replicated in the large
project implemented by the Ministry of Education: “Early Quality Inclusive Education”
(Educație Timpurie Inclusivă și Calitate) – ETIC, and funded by European funds (Operational
Programme Human Capital). Inter-ministerial cooperation has been strengthened within the
project framework and the National Support Committee for Early Childhood Education and
Care has been established. The project aims at implementing the specific curriculum for the
preschool education, it also includes a unitary training programme for teaching and non-teaching
staff, as well as the piloting of the teaching resources related to the specific curriculum for the
preschool education in the kindergartens and nurseries from four counties (Alba, Dolj, Galati,
Suceava) and the city of Bucharest.55
• The draft Strategy for Early Childhood Education and Care has been drawn up by the Ministry
of Education with support from UNICEF and the contribution of Step-by-Step Centre for Education
and Professional Development. UNICEF and Step-by-Step involvement in the development of the
strategy ensures the replicability of the early education component of QIE.56
• Step-by-Step is implementing projects similar with the early education component of QIE in
different counties and in Bucharest.57
• The role models component has been replicated and promoted at national and
international level by UNICEF and the Community Development Association “Împreună”
with funding from Erasmus+ Programme. The project implemented in 2018-2019 at promoting
common European values of diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination and social inclusion through
education by setting up a network of role models acting in schools, high schools and communities
in Constanta and Bacau counties. The project showcased selected success stories from vulnerable
youth and adults that succeeded in their professional life through education. It also included a
seminar for teachers in order to enable and empower them to use tools promoting diversity in
schools.58
• UNICEF is promoting the QIE values, especially the inclusive education, by supporting the
National Commission for Desegregation and Educational Inclusion. Regulation on the works

of the commission have been adopted in February 2019 and the methodology for monitoring
school segregation was adopted in December 2019 with UNICEF assistance.
• The parental education component of QIE has been replicated by HoltIS in numerous
communities with European funding through the Operational Programme Human Capital59.
Methodologies for parental education have been developed and promoted by HoltIS and
international partners with European funding through Erasmus+ Programme.
• Moreover, at national level, HoltIS and UNICEF have been involved in drafting the National
Strategy for Parental Education, with provisions allowing scaling-up national activities from QIE
package. However, the strategy has not been adopted by the Romanian Government, although
initially taken on board by the Ministry of Education. Protests from conservative stakeholders in
February 2020 determined the Ministry of Education to postpone formal approval of the
strategy.60
Two other advocacy results allow the replication of QIE at local level, in pilot schools, and/or the
replication of QIE components in the next years with the support of European funds. In July 2020 the
Romanian Government adopted a Decision on ‘pilot schools’ and in the following months (July-December
2020) special regulations and methodologies were adopted for these schools. The new policy allows
replication of QIE or of QIE components (in different combinations) as a pilot/testing initiatives for future
public policy at national level. These pilot initiatives will be able to include replication of all QIE
components, including replication of the component targeting headmasters (the only one that have not
been replicated yet in other initiatives). At the same time, European funds will be available within the
Operational Programme Employment and Education 2021-2027 and the National Programme for Recovery
and Resilience for initiatives within these schools for the prevention of early school leaving and raising
access and participation of disadvantaged children and youth people to education. However, taking into
account COVID-19 impact on the education system, as well as the resistance to change (especially at
management level in some schools61) makes the replication of QIE in all schools less probable in the near
future. On medium term, the support of the Ministry of Education for the model is a favouring factor.
Thus, initiatives including almost all QIE components show that replication is possible at local and
national level. However, replication at national level of the entire QIE package in the near future is
less probable because of the resistance to change within the system, budget challenges (taking into
account that basic needs are not covered in all schools) and, since 2020, the huge challenge generated by
the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering needs at the level of schools, rolling-out and/or scaling-up QIE as a
complete package in a large number of schools depends to a great extent on the support available for
schools at national and county level. Taking into account the scale of the school network in the country,
rising the capacity to support QIE implementation at the level of county institutions (County School
Inspectorate - CSI and County Centre for Resources and Educational Assistance - CCRAS) is essential.
QIE or QIE components replication in pilot schools need to take into account the prerequired steps that
proved important for the effectiveness and impact of QIE including:
• risks and needs assessments at school level;
• ensured support from school management, the school community (teachers, schoolchildren
and parents), local authorities;
• integrating teachers training and counselling in short-, medium- and long-term human
resources development plans at school level, based on the local level risks and needs
assessments;
• using existing open educational resources.
On the other hand, for replicability, the problems faced in QIE implementation in the first year need
to be overcome. Experience from schools analysed for case studies shows that trainings for teachers and
headmasters are better received by these target groups if they are integrated with the lifelong training
programmes and not considered an additional and separate activity. Other risks in replicating QIE are
related to the number of available teachers and the workload of teachers and school counsellors (often
working in several schools) and headmasters when considering implementing extra-curricular activities

at national and local level.
81
included in the package (e.g.: parental education, organising extra-curricular activities within
small/microgrants projects etc.). While QIE provides tools to organise better lifelong training for teachers
and extra-curricular activities, this idea needs to be well communicated and integrated in the management
and implementation at school level, substituting formal and ineffective activities with more substantial and
effective ones.
Therefore, QIE replication can be successful if connected to a human resource policy and
development programme for the Pre-academic Education, including:
• measures to motivate and incentivise teachers and school counsellors to work in disadvantaged,
vulnerable and remote communities;
• professionalisation of headmasters, based on dedicated lifelong trainings and other methods
(including experience exchanges, technical assistance etc.);
• the reform of the policy on lifelong training for teachers, taking into account that many trainings
and activities reported by teachers in their portfolio are hallow shells;
• improving initial training for teachers, based on a better-defined career path for undergraduates
and master schoolchildren in different fields/departments (literature, maths, sciences, etc.).
Concerning parental education, there are no clear legal barriers to its development, but a strategy is needed
for scaling-up nationally parental education activities in a systematic way and in order to secure funding
for these activities. The proposal of the National Strategy for Parental Education has been contested
by conservative stakeholders and the risks faced by parental education plans and activities are
connected with public opinion on family, gender stereotypes. Replication in these cases is conditioned
by the implementation of strong communication campaigns.
7.3. EQ 14. What are the lessons learned at each level of intervention that should be
considered for implementation and further replication of the modelling project?
The main lessons learned identified by this evaluation, based on the findings presented above as well as on
findings presented under Chapter 8. Impact, are:
• For a sustainable change to be ensured, activites implemented under QIE need to be delivered on
a continuous basis, for a longer period of time and at higher intensity (i.e., higher volume to cover
all needs in medium-long run). For the latter, the necessary preconditions for proper
implementation should be also considered, i.e., sufficient and adequately capacitated teachers and
managers/headmasters, adequate workload of school counsellor, etc. as presented above under
“Sustainability”. Rolling out QIE needs to envisage more grants and more activities targeting non-
discrimination and tolerance. The former has an important contribution to opening up the school
to parents and the community and improve school attractiveness as well as improved non-
cognitive skills with impacts on child development and success in life. The latter needs to be
maintained for a longer period of time to break discriminatory mentalities and attitudes still
manifesting in Romania, particularly as regards the Roma community.
• A number of additional activities and outputs are also important and should be considered when
the implementation of the model is continued and rolled out:
o Extending and adjusting the training programme for distinct groups of teachers - for
example entry-level teachers or teachers with insufficient initial training and with topics
that complement the courses supply - for example in the arts curricular area (for teachers)
or ICT for digitization;
o Continuation / increase of teacher training with activities (not courses) directly aiming
the development of soft skills (e.g., communication with schoolchildren);
o Activities for experiential learning of inclusive approaches for teachers, in particular to
accommodate large differences between pupils (poor performance / high performance,
typical schoolchildren / schoolchildren with SEN);
o Leadership training for school headmasters;
o Continuous support activities (mentoring / coaching) for kindergarten teachers as
regards counselling children and families facing intersectoral (child protection, social,
health) problems;
o Support activities (supervision) for parental educators, to mobilise parents’ participation
in parental education sessions and to manage difficult cases in this regard;
o Activities to ensure the continuity of parents' involvement in their children's long-term
lives - for the critical periods of puberty and adolescence;
82
o Activities at the level of local authorities to raise awareness on educational issues in the
community - for example in regard to optimizing the transition from secondary school to
high school (social scholarships for at-risk schoolchildren admitted to high school,
providing transportation where the high school is in other locality) or to the continuous
participation of the parents in the parenting education sessions (conditioning the social
support by this participation).
o Courses certification so that teachers can use the credits obtained to meet the
requirements of career development;
o Development of materials to promote the necessary change in educational practices –
customised / practical / applied to concrete situations, with examples relevant to the
specific types of community needs;
o Additional teaching support materials - major need especially in rural areas and for
kindergartens;
o Creating an online platform through which educators can see the activities of other
educators, to continue / improve peer learning.
• QIE’s success is strongly influenced by its integrated character. While this evaluation recognizes a
customized or component by component roll-out of the model as possible and, depending on
school’s needs, even advisable, rolling out QIE should maintain the approach of targeting all
stakeholders and factors influencing quality inclusive education. As regards vulnerable categories,
it is essential that health and educational and social services act concertedly (in line with the new
law regulating the minimum package of services), to improve in an efficient and effective manner
their participation in school and, in long-run, preparation for the labour market and a satisfying
live.
• In order to manage the complexities of implementing an integrated model such as QIE, relevant
governance structures need to be strengthened (possibly in coordination with governance
structures provided under the new law regulating the minimum package of services). A strong
national management team needs to be put in place at MoE level, as well as adequate monitoring
and reporting procedures to regularly follow and assess the project/components implementation.
Regional coordinators are indispensable, at least in a first phase, from a monitoring but more from
a support perspective. Sufficient capacity at Country School Inspectorates needs to be ensured, as
(effectively and sustainably) rolling out QIE implies embedding its activities and approaches in
existing control and monitoring procedures and practices. Training and continuous support to
school headmasters should be available and remain the “binder of all the components of the
project” in the rolling out phase, as these stakeholders have been identified by the evaluation as
key to QIE’s success. In the same vein, capacity at school level to genuinely identify the school needs
and plan/implement relevant activities, thus to elaborate and implement a quality school
development plan should continue to be a focal point of the intervention.
• For the necessary competencies to be built and maintained, teachers and educators training need
to be continued. Teacher training should be applied/experiential, organised for distinct groups -
for example entry-level teachers or teachers with insufficient initial training (level groups); cover
topics that complement the courses supply - for example in the arts curricular area (for teachers)
or ICT for digitization; be extended to digital and soft skills. Further on, a monitoring/mentoring
mechanism should be put in place, using existing resources and models (e.g., as implemented
under WB project, ROSE).
• The model will be only partially effective if a number of challenges, internal or external to the
education system, are not tackled:
o Local economic development, or mobility schemes that could create jobs for parents, as
well as a clear interlinkage between social incentives and school participation;
o Quality of initial training and level of remuneration for teachers entering the system;
o System in place to occupy teaching positions and the mobility of teaching staff in Pre-
academic Education, as well as performance-based remuneration schemes that would also
ensure that adequate human resources are maintained in vulnerable schools.
o Rationalization of the school network, i.e., organising schooling in the central school of the
commune, by ensuring transportation for children and a hot meal, for a more efficient and
effective educational act.
o More freedom and responsibility at school level, for managing the school resources and
appointing teachers as well as more attention and support to vulnerable schools in order
83
to provide them with the necessary support to reach the same objectives as less
vulnerable schools.
o Development of school counsellors and parental educators’ networks to be adequately
supported.
o Clear support for performing vulnerable children for continuing school, in the form of
scholarships and other interventions (e.g. disbursement of rent, transport, book costs).
o Stability in the entire educational system, i.e., less frequent changes in managerial
positions at all levels.

and scale up such a model?
Please see chapter 9. Conclusions and recommendations.
8. Main findings - Impact
8.1. EQ 16. What change did the modelling project determine or influence at the level of
beneficiaries (children and their families), communities, professionals, public administration
– at local, county and/or national level?
In order to answer the evaluation question, a mixed method approach was applied. The impact on all
schoolchildren in schools was assessed based on a counterfactual approach (as explained in detail in Annex
3). Change at the remaining levels of the ToC (school, parents, teachers, headmasters) was assessed based
on quantitative and qualitative data collected, including focus groups with parents and children (in the
framework of the cases study). Where possible data collected and analysed was disaggregated by gender.
Impact on all schoolchildren in schools
In general, the evaluation found that QIE triggers the expected changes in terms of increased
participation but also improved atmosphere, i.e., better communication and collaboration, in
school.
Based on the results of counterfactual analysis, in the first scenario (i.e., comparing all 51 schools in the
project with the 6 schools in Galati), a positive evolution is evident in QIE schools compared to schools in
Galati. More schoolchildren are enrolled, the “number of schoolchildren enrolled at the end of the year” and
the “number of graduating schoolchildren” are higher and the number of “schoolchildren repeating grades”
is lower for the project schools compared to schools in Galati (see figure 18 below). In the 51 schools
participating in the project also a lower number of schoolchildren with SEN and Roma schoolchildren is
reported. However, less schoolchildren in schools participating in the project are 8th class graduates, or
have grades >5 at the National Evaluation and less schoolchildren are schoolchildren with uncompleted
school record.

These results are almost exclusively determined by positive changes in girls’ situation (as evident from the
figures 19 and 20 below), although a major positive change is evident in terms of number of male
schoolchildren repeating grades. Still, the number of schoolchildren with uncompleted school record is
significantly larger among boys than among girls. On the other side, more boys than girls have grades higher
than 5 at the national evaluation. These results might actually ask for particular approaches to increase
school attractiveness for boys in the future.

When the counterfactual analysis is carried out for similar groups of schools (2nd scenario), QIE’s
positive results become more evident (see figures 21, 22 and 23 below). More schoolchildren are
enrolled in the QIE schools, are registered at the end of the school year and complete the school
year. In this scenario, there was a slight decrease in favour of schools in Bacau for the number of
schoolchildren repeating grades. The differences in terms of schoolchildren with uncompleted school
record, schoolchildren with SEN, and with better school results are significantly smaller as compared to
the general scenario.

Overall, QIE most important and direct impacts are observed at the level of overall collaborative
atmosphere in school. Headmasters participating in the survey (see figure 24 below) consider that most
important impacts determined by QIE on schoolchildren are a better collaboration with teachers, better
collaboration among themselves, a better performance in school and, ranked only the fourth, a reduced
number of absences. A decreased intention to drop out was also perceived as well as better collaboration
with parents and understanding concepts as uniqueness and diversity (the latter to a more limited extent.
At the same time, school teachers consider that most important impacts determined by QIE on
schoolchildren are (in this order) a better collaboration among themselves, understanding concepts as
uniqueness and diversity, followed by (to a more limited extent- 36-37%), an increase of interest to come to
school; consequently, they recorded a more limited number of absences and intentions or cases of drop out
decreased, but only to some extent (16%).

Based on the quantitative and qualitative evidence collected, QIE also contributed to an increased
importance given to school, as success factor in life, both for children and parents. Children
participating in the survey (see figure 25 below) consider that most important impacts determined by QIE
on themselves are (in this order) an increased understanding of importance to study for succeeding in life
to be ensured and to have a job, but also of the uniqueness of each child and importance of tolerance. While
children agree to almost 60% that it is enjoyable to work with classmates, a limited number indicate a better
collaboration with parents, and a closer involvement with school on parents’ side. This evidence indicates
that activities targeting parents (parental education and counselling, but also mini-grants for activities
involving parents) need to continue for a true and irreversible change to be produced in this regard. On the
other hand, while many children understand that school can be enjoyable, friendly (65%), only 16%
consider that safety in school has increased lately.

Absenteeism and drop out
School managers identified as main causes of absenteeism and drop-out (1) the material circumstances of
the family and (2) family social circumstances, which confirm the influence of external socio-economic
conditions on children participation in school and the need of economic measures with effects locally as
well as closer collaboration and better social services including at local level. Participants to surveys
perceive the lack of motivation to learn as a third cause of absenteeism and drop-out, which may indicate
both a limited success of parents and school to address this matter, in the wider societal context, as well as
the need of early education and ensuring performance at each educational level. To some extent commuting
in order to come to school and a conflictual environment in school also play a role. Evidence collected
indicate reasons for absenteeism and drop out were to a large extent similar in the 2019/2020 school year
compared to the 2015/2016 school year.
Absenteeism is explained by children participating in survey mainly as a result of household chores (see
figure 26 below) they are responsible with at home, but in their view, they miss school also because the
tests/end-of-semester final test papers/exams are too difficult. Schoolchildren also name financial
problems and lack of support (at home and in school) with homework as secondary causes of missing
school, causes that also determine a certain dislike to learn (2%). A very limited number (below 1%)
declare that they have to work daily, with or without parents, or that have an older sibling who dropped
school. This is in line with the image sketched by the counterfactual analysis and case study except
particular communities such as Horgesti/Sohodor. Although teachers do not consider that absenteeism and
drop out are in any way triggered by an insufficient support from their side, this cause is mentioned as
being still important compared to major absenteeism causes. Thus, children feel the need to be more
supported in this regard (including by teachers). A majority of “other reasons” for missing school refer to
health problems. Schoolchildren participating to survey mention also family problems (i.e., they need to
take care of grandparents and younger brothers – 3 cases), extracurricular activities they take part in (2
cases) and lack of internet infrastructure or reach (5 cases).

A very limited number of children report that they thought about dropping out of school (6%), but 33%
have colleagues who are not coming to school anymore. On the other side, all evidence collected indicate
that school drop-out is more widespread in the last years of secondary school, when children move towards
high school/vocational schools. Qualitative evidence collected through interviews and focus groups also
indicate that the dropping out phenomenon is slightly higher among girls of Roma ethnicity (as reported
by teachers and school headmasters). On the other side, in Horgesti/Sohodor the schoolchildren graduating
8th grade with the best results are a representative of this category. The support of the family had a major
contribution in this regard.
In order to permanently come to school, children are of the opinion that they need, in this order, extra-
curricular activities organised outside regular classes (29%), friendlier teachers (27%), more understanding
for children with particularities (20%), support to better understand the lessons content (19%), but also more
emotional support from school counsellors and parents (13-14%).
The case study confirms to a large extent the results of the survey but, more importantly, allowed for
nuanced effects to be observed in different types of schools. The 6 schools analysed in the framework of
the case study may be divided into three categories:
(i) schools in urban areas (Tg Ocna no.2, “Alexandru Safran”),
(ii) schools in rural areas but in the proximity of urban area (Zemes), and
(iii) schools in rural, remote areas (Colonesti and Horgesti).
The distance from urban areas makes in most cases a difference to the economic development of the
commune, as inhabitants may have easy access to jobs in the near-by city. Frumoasa-Balcani is a good
example school, in a rural area not close to urban zones (Bacau, Piatra Neamt or Buhusi). The difference in
this case is made by the level of economic development of the commune. Colonesti and Horgesti face similar
challenges in terms of access to economic resources, however, while migration plays a role in all schools
analysed, in Horgesti/Sohodor migration triggers the high number of absences and drop out (next to poor
economic situation of inhabitants (reported by the city/commune-hall as of Roma ethnicity). Local
authorities in these communes focus less on economic development of their commune/village, although
they may give particular attention to participation in school, e.g., in Colonesti social subventions are
conditioned to school participation.
In communes such as Horgesti/Sohodor and Colonesti, where several root causes of absenteeism and drop out
manifest, QIE had positive effects but in order to obtain significant, long lasting change at child level the
intervention needs to continue at an even higher intensity, and to be complemented with strong social and
economic measures. Having all relevant local actors aligned to support a long-term goal would also make a
90
difference. For example, the local church in Horgesti/Sohodor strongly supports the community to meet its
short-term needs, however, this support might come at the expense of a more sustainable development of
children in the commune.
All in all, the evidence collected through the case study and by comparing schools assessed indicates that,
while all QIE components are relevant and contribute to long-lasting changes, their intensity may be
calibrated based on the particular needs of the school. In all schools, but particularly in category (i) and (ii)
schools, schoolchildren reported improved abilities to communicate, socialize and connect and an improved
self-esteem. Besides this intensified engagement process, some academic achievements were described as
being visible: schoolchildren seem to be ”more focused in school, and have a higher level of self-regulated
learning”. Better school results were also positively influenced by equipment purchased through mini-
grants, which allowed for certain classes to become more attractive due to a more applied teaching style.
In Horgesti/Sohodor good school results, particularly in the last years of the secondary cycle, are rather
motivated by the possibility to finalise a vocational school and to emigrate as soon as possible.
Perception on formally recording absences
The evidence collected both through qualitative and quantitative instruments indicate that there is a
certain level of non-recording absences, i.e., absences are recorded to a medium-large (but not very large)
extent (as reflected also by the figure below). Situations where absences are not recorded or recorded to a
more limited extent occur when e.g., children are away, with parents, for work (locally or outside the
country), for a short period of time (i.e., 2 months during autumn); similarly, not all absences are recorded
when children accompany parents abroad for longer, but indefinite, periods of time, in order to avoid
having them repeat the grade or build towards a drop out case. Reportedly, vulnerable pupils rather fall in
these categories, for which absences are not fully reported, as they are also part of the categories leading
to such circumstances. Migration plays an important role, here, as identified in the case studies (particularly
Horgesti/Sohodor where migration at village level is massive).
As per figure below, 60% of children participating in the focus group are of the opinion that absences are
recorded in most cases by teachers, while 18% are of the opinion that recording all absences is rather the
exception. Situation from the perspective of children seems more problematic in urban areas. At the same
time, girls seem to consider that recording absences happens less that it should, compared to boys. Overall,
more parents (80%) consider that absences are recorded (see Q17, survey among parents).
Case studies in Tg. Ocna, Zemes, Frumoasa and Colonesti indicate both that all absences are recorded, and
also some positive effects in this regard. In Frumoasa, between 2014 and 2019, according to the Internal
Quality Assessment Reports, a decrease in absences per schoolchild from 7.4 to 5.2 (total of motivated and
unmotivated absences) was observed. The positive evolution of the process of participation in school
activities is obvious: while the number of motivated absences has remained constant, the number of
unmotivated absences has decreased by half.
It is important to underline that based on evidence collected in interviews and focus groups, UNICEF
contributed to a better recording of absences, and, in the limit of the current situation in Romania of drop-
out cases.
Impact on schoolchildren at high risk of dropping out
QIE targeted all children, including vulnerable children, in line with the “child-friendly school” concept.
Improving school’s capacity to monitor vulnerable children is important from a strategic planning
perspective, i.e., headmasters adequately identify the schools needs and design interventions accordingly,
and also from the perspective of school performance in terms of inclusiveness.
The evaluation did not identify evidence that the monitoring tool developed in the framework of QIE (i.e., the
Early Warning System) was used beyond project completion. Interviewees rather refer to already existing
monitoring practices, in place for reporting to the School Inspectorate, in the annual school report and thus
also to the Ministry of Education, or to the Aurora database, built and used in the framework of the
complementary UNICEF project, i.e. Delivering a Minimum Package of (Social) Services, in the same county.
91
As mentioned before, in the section covering “limitations” to this evaluation, the database of vulnerable
children constructed in the framework of the project with teachers’ support registers 8.130 schoolchildren,
on average 2000 / school year (the yearly number decreases, though, each year, from 2.507 in 2015-2016
to 1.635 in 2018-2019). Out of 8130 schoolchildren, only for 43 there is a complete set of data (8
questionnaires). For a similar number 6 or 4 questionnaires are to be found in the database. In this context,
we analysed the improvements in the situation of vulnerable children as a group, i.e., we compared the
situation of monitored vulnerable children in the school year 2014-2015 to their situation in 2018-2019.
The data base does not contain information regarding vulnerable children who abandoned school.
The analysis of data revealed that the only improvement among vulnerable children relates to the number of
children with uncompleted school record– by the end of the 4th project year no vulnerable child monitored
was in this position anymore. Situation seems to have slightly declined in terms of number of vulnerable
children completing their graduation requirements by the end of the year and of those repeating the grade, as
well as regarding school results. Evidence collected at local level indicates, though, that in some cases school
results of vulnerable children slightly improved (in Horgesti, Frumoasa). Overall, due to increased attention
paid to vulnerable children by the school headmaster and teachers, in closer partnership with parents (as
a result of QIE intervention), a progress was confirmed for this target group, underlined also by a stable
level of absences and limited drop out cases.
The percentage of schoolchildren at risk graduating at the end of the school year decreased from 73.6% in
the school year 2015-2016 (1467 children) to 63.8% in 2018-2019 (1043 children). The number and
percentages of grade repeating schoolchildren fluctuate to some degree in the 4 years, from 7.3% in the
first year, followed by 11.8% in the second year, 4.9% in the third year and 8,4% in 2018/2019). The
number of schoolchildren with uncompleted school record at the end of school year (because of schoolchild
left the city/commune) is roughly the same each year, i.e., 53 (2,7%) in 2014/15, 51 (3.8%) in 2016/17, 60
(3.8%) in 2017/18, but 0 in 2018/2019. The same indicator for schoolchildren in the city/commune, but
with uncompleted school record because of absences recorded is very different from year to year: i.e., 82
(4,1%) in 2014/15, 3 (0.2%) in 2016/17, 46 (2.9%) in 2017/18, but 0 in 2018/2019.
The number and percentage of vulnerable children with general grades higher than 8 (or very well)
decreased from 19.2 in 2014/2015 to 11.5% in 2018/9. In exchange the % of children with general grades
between 5 and 6 (sufficient) increased by 50% (from 20.7% in 2014/2015 to 30.7% in 2018/2019). In the
case study we identified an exceptional situation. According to the data from the Annual Internal Quality
Assessment Reports of Frumoasa School, a positive impact of the project at the level of vulnerable groups
only from the primary cycle was identified: in 2019 compared to 2014 the percentages were practically
reversed between the satisfactory level (approximately 60% of schoolchildren in 2014 – 15% in 2019) and
the very good level (approximately 15% of schoolchildren in 2014 – 60% in 2019) for Romanian language
and mathematics classes.
However, these changes may differ from school to school, depending on their particularities and wider local
context. For example, in Horgesti/Sohodor, where a majority of schoolchildren are vulnerable, while the
project could not have an impact in terms of school attendance and especially drop out, school result
(grades), reportedly, slightly improved (as in Frumoasa). In “Alexandru Safran”, support for the limited
number of vulnerable children identified was provided before QIE was initiated62, as ARACIP external
evaluation reports also confirm. In this case QIE brought added value in terms of openness towards
developing, internalising and transforming existing practices into systematic approaches. As a result of QIE,
vulnerable children receive particular attention in school, in closer partnership with their parents, progress
confirmed also by a stable level of absences and limited drop out cases. Similar results were registered also
in other schools where the number and status of vulnerable children is similar, i.e., Tg Ocna, Zemes, but
also in Colonesti (to a more limited extent), where the number of vulnerable children is higher63.
Florin D.– a case of school drop out
In the school year 2020-2021 Florin was supposed to be in the 8th grade. However, he stopped going to
school already in the previous year, thus while in 7th grade. Florin’s case combines several factors
62 However, the number of vulnerable children might be underreported in yearly school reports, as in these documents
around 30 schoolchildren with SEN are mentioned every year, while the mini-grant was set up for 150 vulnerable
schoolchildren.
63 In school year 2018/19, practically from 348 children enrolled 320 schoolchildren came from socio-economic
disadvantage communities, 180 schoolchildren had parents working abroad, 2 schoolchildren had SEN (already
enrolled), and 12 schoolchildren had disabilities.
92
generally contributing to drop-out, but some specific elements were also identified by this evaluation.
Firstly, Florin has a relatively minor physical disability (right lower leg). Despite this disability he is a
very good football player and actually this is his dream – to play football as a profession, career path for
which school does not have added value (in his view). He reportedly did not want to go to school
anymore because he was bullied and treated unfairly. As for the former, Florin is the only child with
disabilities (minor but visible) in the area and going to school in Zemes. And although it is not bullied
buy a majority of schoolchildren (or teachers), a couple of incidents were sufficient for Florin to make
his decision. A role in this regard was apparently played by some teachers in school. Both Florin and his
mother reported that a number of teachers blamed Florin for certain events (cheating at tests, breaking
windows); later on, it was proven that Florin was not the responsible schoolchild. The overall impression
is that F. has been labelled as “problematic” child, also because his older brother (who graduated
obligatory education, though) was a less “disciplined” schoolchild. While Florin is an active child, it is
possible that his parents haven’t set, in general, healthy boundaries to their offsprings (e.g., during
discussions the younger son was playing simultaneously with a phone and a tablet, and the TV was on –
the mother could not do anything because he would start screaming if any of the three devices was
turned off; she was, at the same time, amazed, of how many things he learns by playing with electronic
devices). The family has 4 children, 3 boys and a girl. The oldest son (who graduated 10 grades) is
currently around 18 years old and works with his father in constructions. The second child, a girl, is in
9th grade and intends to work in hospitality industry. Florin is followed by a younger brother,
approximately 4-5 years old. For many years Mr. D. was working outside the country to provide for his
family (that has a relatively decent living standards for a family in rural area with 4 children). During
those years the mother had difficulties in raising alone 4 children. Interaction with school was
challenging, particularly when problems emerged and she was called urgently by teachers/headmaster.
She has no private means of transport, mini-buses between Bolatau (a remote village in Zemes where
the family leaves) and school, located in the commune centre run only three times a day and she did not
have a place where she could leave the other children in order to go to school. The father returned home
when the mother could not manage the family alone, and children were calling him by his name as they
did not form an attachment to him as father. Both mother and father acknowledge that they could not
convince Florin to go to school (they tried also as a result of visits paid by the school manager and social
assistant), but they were also quite unhappy with events Florin went through in school, including with
a sports teacher who allegedly hurt Florin physically.
Level of importance given to education plays also a role in this context. Neither Florin’s mother, not his
father, have studied more than 10 years. The mother actually decided to marry Mr. Dulcescu in her 10th
grade, before graduating a vocational school. Asked about Florin’s prospects in life without an education,
she opinionated that “he will find something to do”. However, when asked about her own story, she did
admit that she regretted not having graduating and thus not being able to earn her own money, to be
more independent and be capable of contributing to the family’s expenses. The example set by the father
and older brother will be, most probably, followed by Florin, who will start working in construction field
eventually.
As mentioned above, remote location also contributes to school drop-out, i.e., the daughter studies in the
afternoon, in Lucacesti, a neighbourhood of Moinesti, a locality 10 km away, and during winter returning
home is simply dangerous. If she misses the mini-bus going to Bolotau, basically she can only come from
Zemes on foot, through an unpopulated area where wolves were signalled and a couple of violent
episodes took place (on girls).
All in all, disability, unfair treatment at school, single/less healthy parenting, poverty (to a certain
extent), remote location, models with a low level of education, all contributed to a rather unique
situation64. The mother did recall some courses she participated in, on parenting, but it is clear that they
were not sufficient to offset her existing beliefs and convictions. On the other side, gender differences
are to be seen in the family, where the boys are a bit more difficult to manage, while the girl is
hardworking and focused on school.
Impact on all children in early education
Evidence collected does not clearly indicate a higher enrolment in kindergarten as a result of the project (or
in general), however, kindergarten attractiveness increased. On one side, in certain communities, enrolment
64 Another case of school drop out was identified in Frumoasa, Balcani. Two brothers of Roma ethnicity dropped out of
school because the girl got pregnant and the boy started working in the household.
93
was already high (Tg. Ocna, Zemes, Frumoasa, but also Colonesti; in Horgesti reportedly only 60% of
children of age are enrolled in kindergarten). On the other side a certain decrease in enrolment and
continuous attendance is rather due to demographic trends or, respectively, to natural causes such as
diseases normal to occur at this age. As preschool education enrolment is not obligatory by law (with the
exception of last year), 100% participation is also not necessarily aimed and monitored, what actually
should happen considering the importance of early education for the child development process.
Other effects among this target groups were observed by parents and kindergarten teachers, i.e., increased
tolerance, (see also figure below), as well as increased kindergarten attractiveness due to new activities
carried out, based on new materials, in the classroom or in open air.
The survey among kindergarten teachers confirms the data collected through focus groups and interviews.
Further than increased tolerance, kids participate more intensively in activities organized, they skip classes
to a more limited extent as they like it more to come to kindergarten (see figure 27 below), and the
relationship with parents is improved (also due to parental education).

Impact on school management and school
Overall, positive changes at school management level have been identified as a result of school headmasters
and their teams’ participation in activities organised by QIE. Impacts validated by all stakeholders involved in
the evaluation refer mainly to school management being more involved and directly encouraging teamwork
and communication and among teachers, but also between teachers, children, parents and other school
specialists. Headmasters understand better their role and facilitate access to resources, including for
infrastructure works (for example in Horgesti), and, in this sense, they are more oriented towards
development and more focused on accessing available grants. As regional coordinators confirmed during
the focus-group, “QIE/UNICEF schools have no difficulties is writing project proposals, as they are at a
comparable level with high-schools frequently applying for grants”. In this context, headmasters are also
more focused on and better identify children in need of additional support.
As revealed by the case studies, QIE determined, indeed, a more focused orientation towards inclusive
education, law achievers, schoolchildren at risk, missing before QIE. ”The UNICEF project began when the
school really needed a change. The school has good results (schoolchildren with 10 at admission exams,
winning different competitions, etc.), but I discovered that there are many communities of children in risk
situations. […] ”We noticed that "inclusive education" is a concept that is not, in fact, understood by all
94
people”65. As other interviews pointed out, a key change triggered by QIE was the integration of the
“inclusive school” concept in the headmasters and all other stakeholders’ perspective, i.e., “a couple of years
ago nobody was talking about vulnerable children in school, and now “inclusive education” is better
established as a norm, mainly due to QIE”.
Survey results indicate, though, that concrete changes in terms of school management and drafting school
planning documents, although present, are not as strong as effects previously mentioned (see figure 29
below). On one side, school development plans are more based on needs and socio-cultural and economic
analyses66, formulate missions and vision based on identified needs and promote staff development and a
quality, inclusive education. However, at the same time, collecting evidence to support Plan’s development
and implementation, formulating realistic implementation plans including as related to for additional,
customised support for vulnerable groups are still to be further developed.

Source: survey among headmasters
Case studies reveal that changes induced by the model at school management level, while positive in many
schools, are stronger in schools already having an organization culture (e.g., Tg Ocna, Bacau/Safran, Zemes)
and/or a champion determined to develop the school (e.g., Horgesti). In such cases, QIE came to ”fine-tune”
already existing approaches and led to a ”change of vision”, in most of the schools visited, including in
schools where ARACIP external evaluation indicated deficiencies (e.g., Bacau/Safran). On the other side,
the evidence collected also indicated that QIE’s impact at management level may be very limited where
school headmasters are not interested and open to a new vision / modern approaches. The same is valid in
cases where headmasters are replaced and organisational culture may be weak from a strategic planning
perspective (e.g., Colonesti). Such cases strengthen the conclusion that stability at school level and continuous
support over a longer period of time, to both the principal and a small management team would facilitate
stronger, more sustainable results.
In the same vein, the case study also indicated that the extent to which school headmasters transfer new
knowledge and competences to teachers, and thus the school staff work as a team, contributes positively
to school’s performance in terms of building, managing and maintaining a constructive relationship with
the community and parents (e.g., Zemes and Bacau/Safran). In the latter case the management attitude in
this regard is decisive for the visibility of the school in the community and maintaining a competitive
position at municipality level, difficult for a school in the outskirts.

Changes at school level
In order to assess the extent to which schools became more child-friendly, we have used UNICEF’
framework for rights-based, child-friendly educational systems and schools (inserted in Annex 9).
Overall, positive effects on schools are visible in many cases. As one regional coordinator mentioned “at
this moment, at county level, there is a visible difference between <UNICEF schools> and <non-UNICEF
schools>, and UNICEF <mark> is visible at headmasters and teachers’ level”.
Most evidence indicates that QIE had an important positive effect in terms of improved relationship with the
community in general, including parents and local authorities. As regards the latter, cooperation was further
improved even in instances where schools have been traditionally supported by city-halls (e.g., in
Colonesti), through a strengthened cooperation with social assistants identifying and working with
vulnerable families. In other cases, cooperation was maintained despite local authorities’ delays in ensuring
the needed infrastructure and insufficiently conditioning social support to participation in education (in
Sohodor/Horgesti). In these cases, equipment bought through mini-grants have had an even greater added
value as in the case of other schools, with more access to resources.
Cooperation with all community stakeholders have been mentioned as the first and most important impact
element of the QIE package by the headmaster and teachers in Zemes. An important indicator of the
involvement of the local authorities in solving problems in school is the effort and energy spent for the
preparation and implementation of the project funded by the Regional Operational Programme for the
school infrastructure but also by investments made in Bolatau school (closed before the pandemic crisis)
to allow children to come to school in safe conditions.
Also, in Tg. Ocna, an improved capacity of working collaboratively, an intensified preoccupation to develop
solid partnerships with local community (target included in also in the strategic planning documents of
school) was found by this evaluation. ”In the first 4 years, the UNICEF project was central and the most
important (it addressed children from kindergarten to 8th grade). In addition to training for teachers, the
project made us work together, not only within the school, but also locally and regionally, through the
networks of schools that have been formed. We understood that we are part of a community and we found a
voice, so now the School Development Plan is focused more on the community. The fact that we collaborated
with the local administration, that we collaborated with the Social Service, that all the guides from UNICEF
and from the partners came with requests that had to be fulfilled by the mayor's office, all these improved
the cooperation at community level. […] The project brought us a very important partner that we relied on
and continue to rely on, namely the Social Service, which was one of the first partners in changing and
addressing inclusive education.”67
In Frumoasa, according to all those that have been interviewed, the project implemented by UNICEF
repaired the problems caused by the system of trainings for credits, more specifically it managed to
enhance team spirit and motivation for collaboration and learning. As one teacher has concluded "We have
a more colourful school, that's for sure!" referring to the diversity that is recognized in all its forms - people
and activities.” Also in this case, becoming closely familiar with the school generated a partnership with
parents and the community. The local authorities have supported the educational actions within the project
by providing transport services for the activities that have been carried out outside the locality (visits, trips
for schoolchildren, parents, teachers) and human resources for the successful conduct of counselling
activities (nurse, social worker, school mediator).
As summarised by one school manager, “Under QIE intervention, our school became a more welcoming
environment; modern methods, a more friendly looking learning space, non-formal activities made teachers,
schoolchildren and their parents more interested in building relevant learning experiences in their school.”
Headmasters consider that, to a large and very large extent, the schools become more child-friendly due to
their participation in QIE, with a positive impact on all aspects of this concept. However, QIE seems to have
had more impact from the perspective of promoting child participation in all aspects of school life,
understanding the importance of partnership with parents, and ensuring a healthy, hygienic, and safe learning
environment. Second in rank are aspects such as providing good quality teaching and learning processes
with individualized instruction appropriate to each child’s developmental level, using active, cooperative,
innovative and democratic learning methods and structured content and select good quality materials and
resources. Teachers’ perception on school friendliness is similar, with a focus on partnership with parents
67 Based on the interview with the school master.
96
and local authorities (which confirm findings at school level presented above), as well as on promoting
child participation in all aspects of school life, and ensuring a healthy, hygienic, and safe learning
environment. Teachers emphasize an improved capacity on their side, due to QIE, to identify and support
vulnerable pupils (positive effects of ISE monitoring tool, although mixed impressions from fieldwork).
Despite positive effects triggered by schools, there is room for improvement. Children involved in QIE
perceive their school to be moderately friendly (see figure 29 below). 64,81% of the children participating
in survey consider that school is enjoyable/friendly, however, as mentioned above, only 16,54% feel safer
when they study/ go to school compared to 2 years before68.

More than 70% of children participating in survey consider that their teachers encourage them to respect
each other and to learn, even if they make mistakes (78,67% - Q28). Many of them are also of the opinion
that teachers encourage them to work together (66,11%), to share their problems in order to find solutions
together (61,57) or to talk to their parents for the same purpose (50,68%). Only 34,64% of children say
that teachers encourage them to decorate the classroom, which might be an indication of the still
conservative approach to school appearance, despite de developments evident on the case studies, too.
However, the general perception of children over their school (how serious and useful is what you learn,
how are teachers, how are your colleagues, how do you feel at school, etc.) records a slight downward trend.
Compared to 5 years ago, 46% of children would give their school the grade 10 (compared to 49% 5 years
ago), 23% would grade their school with 9 (compared to 17% 5 years ago), and 14% would grade their
school with 8 (compared to 12% 5 years ago). The difference between the two moments in time is
actually determined by responses in urban areas, the grades given to school in rural areas being more
or less the same. Still, overall, approximately 80% of children consider that their school deserves one of
these three higher grades.
Impact on teachers
Overall, a series of impacts at teachers’ level are widely confirmed by all stakeholders consulted in the
framework of this evaluation. To a large extent, as a result of QIE, teachers collaborate more with
schoolchildren and parents, promote a healthy climate in school, and continue to use in class, although to
a more moderate extent, materials promoting diversity.
Teachers use improved teaching practices (i.e., innovative resources, new learning activities in new
learning contexts) but they consider that more should be done in this regard, for them to teach truly
68 Only 23% of children consider that the online school made them to a large and very large extent to enjoy less
attending classes and learning. Percentage is slightly less in urban areas (1% more).
97
innovative lessons. A rather limited number of teachers interviewed were of the opinion that the innovative
approaches learned in UNICEF’s trainings are not appropriate for certain subjects (e.g., Romanian
language) and for certain categories of schoolchildren (e.g., non-performing schoolchildren in rural area).
On the other side, although teachers confirmed in focus groups that trainings received under QIE were very
useful, they also could not name any new approaches learned with this occasion. Such evidence indicates
that changes identified do not manifest for all teachers who participated in training. Emulation is not the
rule, i.e., teachers learning new approaches from “QIE” teachers, but it is more present in schools with a
progressive organisational culture (for example in Frumoasa). Peer exchange and learning could improve
such results and should be enhanced and continued after project implementation. In the same vein, already
existing mechanism for peer exchange at school level (i.e., didactic/methodical club) could be improved
and used for sharing experiences gained by “QIE” teachers.
Good examples in this regard were identified in Zemes, where new learning activities in new learning
contexts have been implemented for history lessons, biology, physics and chemistry lessons. These lessons
are the combined result of activities targeting teachers and micro-grants that provided funding and the
specific context and incentives for teachers to look for innovative activities in their teaching approaches.
Also, in Frumoasa, where more than half of the teachers directly participated in the project, teachers have
immediately applied in classroom what they have learned during trainings and exchange visits, from group
learning methods, scientific experiments or dramatizations that they organised, prioritization of essential
aspects and adaptation of curriculum to the schoolchild’s needs.
Although progress is registered also in terms of non-acceptance of discriminatory behaviours and
understanding the concept of discrimination, there is good room for improvement in this regard. Some
teachers consider that diversity activities were not necessarily relevant as in the community there are no
minorities, which indicates a skewed view on the concepts of tolerance and non-discrimination. Teachers
progressed in terms of understanding and adapting to every child’s needs, however, there are strong
evidences from the field that capacity to work with children with SEN is low69. At the same time,
collaboration with other teachers and with school counsellor could be further improved and they could
carry out more extracurricular activities (strongly confirmed by survey among children, both in rural and
urban area – Q28).
As case studies revealed, teachers also became more aware of children’s needs outside the classroom,
particularly in the case of vulnerable children. Teachers not leaving in communities have a slight
disadvantage in this regard, as they are less familiar with the child outside classes and thus cannot quickly
identify risk situations.
Impact on early education teachers and kindergarten
Changes in case of early education teachers are similar with those of school teachers. At this level, the
difference was made, as in the case of schools, by the 360° approach taken (i.e., a combination of educational
resources/materials, training for all or a majority of teachers, exchanging experiences with other teachers
and activities focused on enhancing collaboration with parents, including parental education). With the
exception of Horgesti/Sohodor, kindergartens visited had adequate infrastructure due to local authorities’
involvement (although major investments may not have been carried out in the last 20 years or more), and,
in this context, activities undertaken by Step-by-Step, particularly the resources/materials added major
value as they covered the remaining needs.
Based on case studies conducted for this evaluation and survey results, positive effects are more visible in
rural areas, where needs were more acute, as parents are less involved and less resources are available to
support the kindergarten. Both training activities and particularly the materials provided by Step-by-Step
were seen as very valuable by kindergarten teachers.
The evaluation identified changes at kindergarten level from several perspectives. The new modalities to
organize integrated and interactive activities70 and use of new materials, as well as the improved relation
and collaboration with parents (and awareness on the importance of this collaboration) led to changes in
the overall climate and an improved focus on safety and emotional support, the key aims of early education.
As case studies reveal, improved cooperation with parents contributed to an exchange of ideas and

on case studies).
98
practices and to an “extension” of the safe and emotionally supportive environment from kindergartens to
homes. However, there is room for improvement as regards planning lessons more attractive to children.
The survey results confirm the key benefits of QIE at kindergarten level. A majority of teachers introduced
new teaching methods (76%) and, as a result, for 50% of them the lesson also did become more attractive.
Half of teachers participating in survey also indicate that they pay more attention to children that do not
seem to understand activities carried out or ideas discussed, but only for 30% it became clear how to plan
a lesson so that it is more attractive to children. In rural areas, more effects were obtained in terms of more
attractive lessons and the capacity to make a plan for a more interesting lesson (see figure 30 below).

Teachers also indicate that compared to 5 years ago, they have improved the most in the following areas:
paying attention to schoolchildren in line with their needs, using materials suitable for children’s different
needs, understand that each child is unique and in their collaboration with parents. More and continuous
efforts and resources (including mentoring/coaching) are needed for teachers to organise more
extracurricular activities as well as innovative lessons, and to improve their collaboration with the
counsellor but also their attitude towards discrimination. Limited paradigm shifts have been identified in
their concern about promoting inclusiveness in education71.
The case study shows that early education teachers need more visibility and attention/support, including
from the local community and authorities, e.g., during the current pandemic crises community nurses were
not available, and they needed to do check children themselves and make sure that they remain safe. There
is also a constant need for ideas for different activities with children at this age, new materials, while
resources remain scarce.
As in case of school teachers, evaluators observed that, as in the case of preschool teachers, changes were more
significant for those already interested in diversifying their activities and offering children different
perspectives and educational aids. Some of the interviewed kindergarten teachers could not describe
innovative approaches used in their activities with children, however, in other cases teachers learned how
to be inventive and to adapt to the situation (“If we do not have teaching materials, we organise observation
activities with children through which they learn to enjoy and observe the nature; we also collect various

99
objects and bring them into the classroom, and the children play with them (e.g. geometric figures can be
made from sticks)”72).
Impact on family/parents
The most frequent changes identified by the evaluation were an increased parents’ involvement and
connectedness with the school; an improved relationship parents have with their children as a result of
improved communication and quality time spent together; and an improved parental involvement in
strengthening child’s educational achievement, in academic support of the schoolchildren73. Parents –
children improved relations manifest in connection with school activities but also in other areas of the
family life in some cases. Parents have been happy to learn how to manage their personal, family and work
time.
A more positive attitude towards school and its activities has been identified by this evaluation in most other
schools visited. Based on evidenced collected through surveys, interviews and focus groups, parents’
involvement in “QIE schools” increased significantly in the last years74. For example, in Zemes, as a result
of QIE’s activities, parents became more interested and became better involved in school activities and
children education. Parents discus more with teachers about children's learning progress, have asked for
advice on education and have become more understanding and curious about their own children.
At the same time, parents’ positive perception on the importance of education also improved, as confirmed
by all surveys carried out and case studies. Illustrative in this regard are the results of the survey carried
out among children, i.e., close to 50% of them declare that the parents encourage them more to go to school
and explain them that school is the best solution for their future (as they understood this aspect
themselves).
Changes are two-geared for this target group, too, i.e., while already involved parents and parents of
schoolchildren performing well in school, as well as young parents embraced and benefited of activities such
as educational parenting, counselling and extracurricular activities, parents of vulnerable children were more
difficult to involve. This dynamic is similar in both rural and urban areas. A part of them were attracted,
after initial hesitations, by the activities undertaken, while another part dropped out of last sessions of
parental education and preserved their existing paradigm on child rearing and relationship with school.
Collaboration could not be established with extreme cases, i.e., families with alcohol problems. The vicious
cycle of “less interested parents, less performing and happy children” has been only partially broken.
More, continuous efforts are needed to generalise the positive effects obtained by QIE at the level of parents,
and this necessity is strongly supported by the fact that 82% of parents consulted in the framework of this
evaluation would recommend parental education to their peers. “What works” in this regard is the
snowball effect starting from parents that teachers trained as parental educators already new and had
gained their trust; as well as the support of the social worker. The letter confirms one more time the
importance of a close collaboration between school and city hall. At the same time, positive conditions are
already created for a continuation of parental education, as most parents interviewed or participating in
focus groups underline that participating in QIE activities, particularly in parental education classes,
strengthened relationships among themselves. Parental education classes felt like a support group (i.e.,
parents felt understood, realised that they are not the only ones confronted with certain problems) and
cooperation outside the group increased, in school or outside school-related activities.
Parents declared (survey among parents, Q19 and Q20), that the following helped them to have a better
relationship with their children and to support them with school (in this order): finding out that it is good
to go to school/kindergarten; spending more time with children and family; learning how to play and be
more friendly with the child/children (improvement also mentioned most often in all focus groups with
parents), learning how children think and need to be talked to. A relatively small percentage of parents,
under 20%, consider that talking to other parents and consulting a professional (i.e., parental educator)
was not necessarily helpful for them. 10% did not consider participation in school activities helpful at all,
72 Based on kindergarten teacher interview.
73 These main benefits are supported also by 80-85% of the school headmasters and teachers participating in surveys.
74 In 2015 25% were fully satisfied with their involvements, 20% would grade themselves with 9, 30% with 8 and 12%
with 7. In 2020 percentages are inversed, in the sense that 35% (10% more) of parents are fully satisfied with how
they cooperate with school, 32% (12% more) would grade themselves with 9. Consequently, only 21% and 5% of
parents consider themselves as having a 8- and 7-level involvement, respectively (Q24 – survey parents).
100
either. These group of parents may consider that they are self-sufficient or indicate gaps in activities
organised with parents and in their effectiveness, as mentioned above.
However, parents still need to work to understand that each child is unique and collaboration with other
children is important, despite improvements registered in this direction. Only between 60-65 % of parents
and teachers and 35% of children are of the opinion that parents understand the uniqueness of their
children and their particular needs, as they are unique.
At the same time, impact is partial at parents’ level also as regards understanding of the concept of
tolerance. While the activities undertaken in this area were relevant and had the immediate effects
expected as per sections above, the more limited impact can be explained by the insufficient intensity of
actions taken, compared to the “dimension of the problem”, i.e., a deeply rooted discriminatory mentality,
especially as regards Roma minority. Some improvements were registered in this regard, as indicated in
interviews and focus groups, but limited to children with disabilities or other vulnerabilities.
Impact on country public administration (CSI and CJRAE)
The County School Inspectorate (CSI) and County Centre for Resources and Educational Assistance
(CCRAS) did not constitute a direct target group of the project, oriented towards communities themselves.
While both of them were consulted and worked in partnership with UNICEF, as the case, only at a late stage
some dedicated activities (trainings) were designed and implemented for CSI (with a view to prepare QIE
scale-up).
Although the training was perceived as effective, to a limited extent CSI and CCRAS adopted approaches,
information or resources made available in the framework of QIE. Although familiar with QIE activities,
inspectors did not participate, e.g., in trainings, in order to absorb and transfer new practices to other
schools in the country, through their inspecting work. The QIE model is recognised as a good practice and
CSI took over some of its activities in other projects developed, but not all of these were implemented.
A key gain at county, institutional level is the fact that some of the QIE regional coordinators have been
CSI’s employees and continue to be active in this role, representing the project’s memory inside the
Inspectorate. Some interviews at community level also pointed out the QIE contributed to school’s capacity
to report on vulnerable children to the Inspectorate, which, overall, may have improved CSI’s capacity to
monitor them. All in all, including through QIE, a narrative focused on inclusive education consolidated at
CSI level, too.
It is worth highlighting that, during project implementation CSI created 29 positions of school mediator
and school counsellors, employed through CCRAS after UNICEF’s project finalised. Although this result is
at the crossroad between QIE and a second, complementary project implemented by UNICEF in the same
country (i.e., Delivery of a Minimum Package of Social Services at community level), it benefited both city-
halls and schools, and, in the end children in need of support to participate and / or stay in school. In this
context the evaluation finds that QIE produced more changes at CCRAS level, compared to CSI.
Not only CSI and CCRAS, but also the Teachers House (i.e., Casa Corpului Didactic) should have been
involved in the project from a sustainability perspective, i.e., trainings carried out under QIE to be taken up
and delivered to other schools or teachers/ repeated to the same teachers as needed, with the direct
support of the “QIE teachers” themselves.
The involvement of county-level institutions is much hindered by the frequent changes at decisional level
(i.e., during QIE implementation only, CSI changed 3 General Inspectors and CCRAS 2 Directors) but also
the relatively weak capacity of County Council (CC) to strategically plan in the education sector, particularly
as many decisions are taken at governmental level. On the other side, funds for actions CC (and local
authorities), may take in this area are, reportedly, insufficient.
Policy effects
Overall, UNICEF has been a long standing and reputed partner for the Ministry of Education (MoE) in
Romania. Support delivered by UNICEF in the form of technical assistance for drafting legislative acts,
methodologies, strategies and different studied to fundament policy alternatives has been in all case
perceived as highly relevant, of high quality and useful. The expertise UNICEF brings is much appreciated
both by MoE and other stakeholders in the area of education.
UNICEF supported MoE in several areas insufficiently addressed at policy level, despite their importance
in the education system in Romania. In this regard, under QIE UNICEF had an important contribution in the
area of early education, through advocacy actions and inputs for formulating strategic documents.
101
Although an early education strategy does not exist as a stand-alone document, UNICEF, together with
project partners, including Step-by-Step, contributed to the elaboration of a vision and of concrete
measures in this area. With UNICEF support the draft early-education strategy in Romania was evaluated
and recommendations were made for its improvement. The strategy will be finalised with UNICEF and
Step-by-Step support75. At the same time, national legislation was completed and methodology for
calculating standard financing costs for pre-schoolchildren was developed.
With UNICEF support a “Strategy for parental education” was also developed, much needed considering
also the findings and conclusions of this evaluation.
UNICEF contributed to the development of mechanism for preventing and evaluating school segregation
phenomenon (i.e., Framework-order no. 6.134/21.12.2016 forbidding school segregation in Pre-academic
Education and Annexes to Ministry Order 1540/ 2007 regarding school segregation of Roma children and
approving the methodology for preventing and elimination of school segregation of Roma children). Such
instruments are built on real-life experience gained during the development of projects UNICEF has
implemented in Romania (QIE and previous projects).
Acknowledging the importance of teachers for performance in education, UNICEF contributed to their
lifelong training by piloting, in the framework of QIE, of a certain approach largely taken up76 in “CRED”, a
major project implemented by MoE aiming to train 55.000 teachers in primary and secondary school.
Moreover, with UNICEF input, MoE adopted a revised methodology (2018 and 2019) for awarding a
supplementary, merit-based, degree for teachers achieving results with vulnerable children. UNICEF
advocacy efforts, although limited as regards an improved initial education for teachers77, have triggered
recent initiatives taken by MoE to professionalise the teaching career78. Moreover, based on experience in
QIE, ARACIP issued new evaluation standards for Pre-academic Education in 2020 (i.e., through
Government Decision 994/2020).
UNICEF also targeted schoolchildren in their advocacy and policy-related work. As such, it supported MoE
in improving the Framework Regulation for Organisation and Functioning of Units in Pre-academic
Education, as it developed and had approved though ministerial order the “Schoolchild Statute”. The
approval of this document creates the necessary preconditions for a better integration of children’s rights
in the educational system.
Unfortunately, high instability at political level hampered the adoption of some inputs provided by UNICEF
(i.e., on early education, parental education, the methodology for standard cost per pre-schoolchild). The
National Parenting Strategy was withdrawn during public consultations initiated by MoE, due to opposing
views expressed by conservative groups (e.g., Coalition for Family), religious cults, parents associations,
trade unions, but also the Romanian Academy. The critics did not raise concrete arguments against the
objectives or the utility of the activities proposed, but focused on the scientific sociological definition of
“family” introduced in the strategy, as well as on aspects allegedly contradicting the values of Romanians
and of the Romanian “traditional family”. As the Strategy was not adopted, the ample activities planned, i.e.,
parenting activities included in the norms of teachers, community medical assistants and mediators, and
regular parenting classes for all parents, could not be implemented. Although parenting education
continues through projects implemented by HOLTIS and other NGOs, with UNICEF support or under
different programmes, in the absence of a national strategy this policy instrument cannot be applied
country-wide; its positive effects manifests locally and their sustainability is under question. However,
the evaluation finds that at technical level UNICEF contributions have been constantly used at technical
level to fundament decisions and projects to be financed with EU funding or in partnership with other
international organisations such as the World Bank. However, MoE needs to significantly improve its
strategic planning, including monitoring and evaluation capacities, in order to be able to assess the extent
to which decisions legislated (e.g., the mechanisms for preventing and evaluating school segregation
phenomenon or the merit-based award to teachers achieving results with vulnerable children) real benefits

at school level. This evaluation hasn’t identified evidence through any of the data collection tool deployed
at country and local level, that this is the case.
9. Conclusions and recommendations
Based on findings presented above, the evaluation formulates the following conclusions and
recommendations.
Extended discussions were carried out with all the major partners on the evaluation report and its final
version, including conclusions and recommendations, was finalised based on comments and observations
transmitted to the evaluation team. UNICEF Romania is planning to organise a conference to further discuss
the findings and recommendations with a wider audience.
Relevance
Based on the evaluation findings formulated in the previous chapters, the evaluation concludes that the
Quality Inclusive Education package was highly relevant. The project addressed all children and adolescents,
including children in vulnerable categories, in both urban and rural areas, and this was the adequate
strategy to answer the problems identified and ensure project effectiveness (i.e., to tackle more than barrier
to participation to school but take a step forward and offer quality education). The key challenge at the core
of QIE interventions, i.e., school dropout and major absenteeism, remains, until the end of the project, a
relatively broad and complex phenomenon, especially in rural areas, but not only. The focus on both pre-
school and primary and secondary education is aligned to a preventive approach necessary in order to
tackle this challenge on long-term.
A strong feature of QIE from a relevance perspective (but also impact) is its “integrated” approach, i.e., QIE
created a broad context focused on learning interactions and collaboration between traditionally separate
groups - pupils, teachers, parents, institutions such as ARACIP - and it redefined the relationships among
these actors, particularly at local level, for the benefit of the child. The QIE strategy is based on an approach
focused on school and teacher, as key agents of change, and the design provides generally adequate
interventions for all planned objectives, especially at school and family levels.
The implemented activities have a high degree of relevance as they addressed directly causes of school
dropout such as family educational difficulties, limited interest in learning, limited involvement in
class/school, limited material base, limited communication between parents and school or insufficient help
from teachers, and their associated needs. All activities implemented under QIE were relevant in this
regard, i.e., extra-curricular activities carried out through microgrants, role models promoted, training of
teaching skills associated with child-centred and inclusive approaches, parental education and counselling.
However, the evaluation identified a number of additional activities that would have further enhanced the
relevance and effectiveness of the model and could be taken into consideration when QIE is scale-up (see
recommendation 1).
From the perspective of school needs, the most useful activities were microgrants, didactic training,
technical assistance for microgrants, training in parental counselling and parental education. At the local
community level, follow-up activities to parenting education sessions / workshops - in which groups of
pupils and parents carried out volunteer and charitable activities in the community were identified as being
the most relevant. Regarding the activities addressed to school management, the most relevant sub-
activities were the trainings carried out during the annual school visits and those developed during the
regional workshops.
Regarding the development of a favourable context for inclusion, headmasters and teachers offered the
strongest appreciation to measures related to process management and the development of the school
ethos and climate (e.g., redefining educational interventions as to reduce the risk of school dropout,
clarifying the situation of each pupil at risk, diversification of types of activities, teamwork) rather than to
those aimed at functional management.
On a further, positive, note, the evaluation has identified a degree of flexibility maintained throughout the
implementation process. In this vein, although not without challenges, activities were adjusted in order for
the project to adequately respond to further needs identified on the spot, such as expanding the number of
103
activities and resources to increase the number of training beneficiaries; clearly steering the training and
consulting sessions for the headmasters towards the objective of coordinating all project components at
school level; development of technical assistance activities for project development/fund raising; including
all children in activities implemented to create an enabling environment for non-discrimination and
extending the concepts of tolerance to all categories at risk.
The conceptualization of QIE package created favourable premises for an adequate response during
implementation of activities, as the theory of change proposed was developed on the basis of relevant statistics
and on previous experiences of UNICEF and partners. Adjusting the ToC during the intervention had the
advantage of adapting to different types of schools and communities, but it has made the monitoring
process for documenting the intervention more difficult. The primary qualitative and secondary data used
by this evaluation support the need to amplify the activities of monitoring the quality of interventions at
child level (see recommendation 2).
Based on evidence collected, QIE objectives, activities and results are highly relevant in relation to the
European and national strategic and legislative framework. Three elements specific to the context and
framework of this project contributed to the relevance of QIE: (i) the UNICEF’s vision and significant role;
(ii) the wide perspective and significant national and international experience of UNICEF’s partners in the
project and (iii) the traditional partnership of UNICEF with the Ministry of Education in developing and
implementing educational policies, as well as partnerships established before and under the project with
relevant institutions at national level and local.
Ensuring and providing access to quality and inclusive education starting with early education and
especially for Roma and children in rural areas has been a constant of the European Commission’s
Recommendations in the framework of the European Semester. According to UN Sustainable Development
Goals, the triggers of limited quality in education are lack of adequately trained teachers, poor conditions
of schools and equity issues related to opportunities provided to rural children.
QIE is fully aligned to all national strategies, as it proposed a model to implement existing legal provisions
as regards integrated interventions, and it is well anchored in the “National Strategy for the Reduction of
Early School Leaving”, both through the majority target groups – socially, economically, ethnically
disadvantaged people from rural areas, but also by carrying out activities targeting specifically early
education and promoting equal opportunities for all children.
In view of the above, we consider that the purpose of the QIE project, together with the values proposed
and the objectives assumed, are fully aligned with the European coordinates and respond to the challenges
and recommendations of the country. As follows79:
• The Qualitative Inclusive Education Package targets at the same time, the development of quality
education, and the school participation for all children, especially for those who are vulnerable.
Those interventions insist on preventing non-schooling, school absenteeism, dropout and early
school leaving, as well as on increasing learning outcomes and the competences acquired by the
children.
• The fundamental objective is that every child would be able to enrol in school -, to learn at their
maximal potential and be properly prepared to succeed in the labour market and to participate in
an active citizenship. A second objective is to accelerate the efforts to ensure the right to education
of all children, especially those vulnerable by improving the quality of teaching and school
administration, and to mobilise schools, families and communities to support the school
attendance and development of each child.
• QIE comprises child-centred interventions at the school, family and community levels, having
universal character, so that all children and schools can benefit from the interventions. It mainly
considers the equity, applying especially to the most under-privileged children and disadvantaged
school units.
• More specifically, QIE points the following aspects: improving the capacity of school management
and teachers to support each child according to their needs; improving teaching methods and
tools; creating partnerships with families and schoolchildren and developing parental skills;
mobilising communities in the sense of supporting education; improving non-cognitive skills and

the motivations of children; encouraging diversity among schoolchildren, regardless of gender,
ethnicity, religion, disability and socio-economic status.
The child rights approach was embedded already in the project ToC,80 as QIE addresses bottlenecks and
barriers in access to and retention in education for children and adolescents at risk, in order to ensure that
the right to education of every child is observed without discrimination. The solutions developed through
ToC address, at all levels of intervention (from system level to individual level), issues related to equity and
human / child rights associated with inclusive access to quality education. QIE also addressed, at least
indirectly, the right of children to be protected against all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or
abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation as well as their right of thought,
conscience and religion and to express views freely. Parental education also contributes to parents’
responsibilities and duties to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child,
appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the Convention
on the Rights of the Child.
A differentiated approach for girls and boys was applied only when deemed appropriate, otherwise equal
and non-discriminatory participation in all activities was ensured. The gender dimension was addressed
in training sessions, monitoring visits and exchanges of experience, however, activities addressing different
needs of boys and girls were not planned / developed (see recommendation 4).
Effectiveness and impact
In general, the evaluation found that QIE triggers changes in terms of increased participation but also
improved atmosphere, i.e., better communication and collaboration, in school. However, maintaining the
effects registered and, thus, continuing reform at school level, greatly depends on the intensity of the
intervention (e.g., if all or a majority of teachers are instructed), on its continuous implementation (as
opposed to an on-off, project-based activity) but also on external factors, particular to the educational
system in Romania and to the wider socio-economic context. Rural – urban dimension of school and path
dependency, i.e., an open mentality and management capacity already in place at school level, also influence
effects and impact obtained.
In the schools participating in the project QIE had an important contribution, in terms of redefining and
strengthening:
• the school-local authorities relationships (the local authorities better understood their role in
supporting the educational act by ensuring cooperation between school and the social
assistants/teams/policies but also to endow and renovate school buildings, in some cases);
• the teacher-parent relationship (parents understood that school can also have another approach
to schoolchildren’ problems, that it is oriented towards the support of schoolchildren, especially
those at risk);
• reseizing parents’ relationship with the school and teachers (e.g., parents understood that school
is not only resource consuming, but also a service provider and that their role is not only material,
but also emotional and supportive in the education process);
• redefining the concept of pupils at risk and transforming this category into a more visible one and,
moreover, transforming the children who were considered ‘predestined to a fate of non-fulfilment’
into pupils who can be supported by joint school-family efforts;
• the “inclusive school” concept in the perspective of school headmasters and of the other
stakeholders.
Counterfactual impact analyses highlight positive effects of QIE in terms of school participation, namely as
regards: “total number of schoolchildren enrolled”, “number of schoolchildren enrolled at the end of the
year”, “number of schoolchildren completing their graduation requirements by the end of the year” and
“schoolchildren repeating grades”. The latter decreased in QIE schools for both girls and boys, however, the
overall results are almost exclusively determined by positive changes in girls’ situation. These results call for
particular approaches to increase school attractiveness for boys, but also to improve school results for girls,
in line with the situation in the entire education system where girls obtain better school results (see
recommendation 3). Overall, due to increased attention paid to vulnerable children by the school
management and teachers, in closer partnership with parents, some results were confirmed for this target
group. In some cases, school results of vulnerable children slightly improved (i.e., Horgesti, Frumoasa) and
overall, more vulnerable children completed the school year with a completed school record, i.e., with
80 UNICEF, Quality Inclusive Education Model’s Theory of Change
105
necessary grades. Clear, differentiated impacts for vulnerable children could not be identified by this
evaluation, but qualitative evidence highlights a number of effects for this category such as:
• Increased motivation for learning and well-being at school;
• Better understanding of their own community and learning in the community, along with different
groups of people – their own parents, the elderly, poor families, children of other
ethnicity/confession – following activities in micro-grants;
• Understanding the concepts of tolerance and diversity, non-discrimination, following
transdisciplinary or counselling activities, e.g., on human rights or violence issues;
• Development of non-cognitive skills such as artistic, communication and teamwork, help,
entrepreneurship, self-knowledge and inter-knowledge – in the framework of extracurricular or
counselling activities in which topics related to risk behaviours for pre-teens (alcohol use,
smoking, inappropriate Internet use, etc.) were addressed.
• A better integration into the community and school as a result of their participation in
extracurricular activities organized through microgrants where they felt valued for their various
talents.
The evaluation observed that data on vulnerable pupils is collected, recorded and reported in multiple
manners (i.e., by city-hall social assistance services in line with national legal provisions or with the support
of Aurora81, by schools based on national procedures to report to County School Inspectorate and based on
a dedicated instrument developed under QIE – at least during project implementation; the tool hasn’t been
used after project closure). This might be a cause for insufficient quality of data on this category of pupils.
A harmonised data base at community level would significantly contribute to adequate needs assessments
that would underpin city-hall and school policies for vulnerable schoolchildren.
In the same vein, QIE’s impact in terms of absenteeism and drop out is rather indirect and restricted by several
external factors contributing in this regard. Family material and social circumstances (i.e., conflicts,
alcoholism, involvement of children in household chores etc.) remain the key reasons for absentees and
dropping out and this confirms the need for wider social and economic measures with effects locally as
well as closer collaboration and better social services at community level (see recommendation 4). School
drop-out is more widespread in the last years of lower secondary school, when children move towards high
school/vocational schools and among girls of Roma ethnicity (see recommendations 1, point i and 3).
Overall, positive changes at school management level have been identified as a result of school headmasters
and their teams’ participation in activities organised by QIE. School management is more involved and
directly encourages teamwork and communication among teachers, but also between teachers, children,
parents and other school specialists. Headmasters understand better their role and facilitate access to
resources, including for infrastructure works (for example in Horgesti), and, in this sense, they are more
oriented towards development and more focused on accessing available grants. On the other side, there is
room for improvement as regards school management and drafting school planning documents, for the
latter in terms of collecting evidence to support Plan’s development and implementation and formulating
realistic implementation plans including additional, customised support for vulnerable groups (see
recommendation 5).
Changes induced by the model at school management level, while positive in many schools, are stronger in
schools already having an open organization culture (e.g., Tg Ocna, Bacau/Safran, Zemes) and/or a champion
determined to develop the school (e.g., Horgesti). On the other side, the evidence collected also indicated that
QIE’s impact at management level may be very limited where school headmasters are not interested and
open to a new vision / modern approaches. The same is valid in cases where headmasters are replaced and
organisational culture may be weak from a strategic planning perspective (e.g., Colonesti) (see
recommendations 6 and 7).
QIE had an important positive effect in terms of improved relationship with the community in general,
including parents and local authorities. As regards the latter, cooperation was strengthened with social
assistants identifying and working with vulnerable families.
81 Developed by UNICEF in the framework of the complementary package implemented in Bacau, the Minimum Package
of Services (MPS).
106
QIE also made many participating schools more child-friendly, by offering a more welcoming environment
and a more friendly looking learning space decorated also during non-formal activities organised under
mini-grants.” However, significant room for improvement exists in this regard, if we take into account the
fact that less than 20% of children consulted in the framework of this evaluation declared that feel safer
when they study/ go to school compared to some years before, and this perception is only mildly influenced
by recent developments caused by COVID 19.
At the same time, although stakeholders consulted in the framework of the evaluation positively assessed
the training activities implemented, continuous intervention is needed for schools to reach expected
standards as regards providing good quality teaching and learning processes with individualized
instruction appropriate to each child’s developmental level; using active, cooperative, innovative and
democratic learning methods and structured content and select good quality materials and resources (see
recommendation 8). Still, the evaluation identified a series of impacts at teachers’ level i.e., teachers
collaborate more with schoolchildren and parents, promote a healthy climate in school, and continue to
use in class, although to a more moderate extent, materials promoting diversity.
Changes in case of early education teachers are similar as those available for school teachers. At this level,
the difference was made, as in the case of schools, by the 360° approach taken (i.e., a combination of
educational resources/materials, training for all or a majority of teachers, exchanging experiences with
other teachers and activities focused on enhancing collaboration with parents, including parental
education). Materials and equipment purchased for kindergartens and schools as well as extracurricular
activities (the latter two in the framework of the microgrants) had an important contribution to effects
identified by this evaluation (see recommendation 9). Developing a professional network of pre-school
teachers with certified skills and, overall, peer learning, was beneficial as it facilitated an easier
identification, development and implementation of strategies for the management of vulnerable children.
The evaluation identified, based on evidence collected, that participation in extracurricular activities
organized by QIE contributed to pupils’ development as they acquired socio-emotional and life skills (e.g.,
establishment of goals, team work, time management, prioritization, problem solving, analytical thinking,
leadership, public speaking and other). Extracurricular activities contributed to an improved perspective
of pupils on their school as well as to an increase in their self-esteem, and of their sense of belonging.
Through such activities, children discovered new interests and activities that could be transformed into
representative domains for their future. Expanding children’s horizon is a key benefit of the microgrants,
i.e., pupils were taken out of their community and exposed to more developed context, an experience
inspiring new interests and activities that could be transformed into future interest and career paths.
Another added value mentioned in several interviews and focus groups consists in the learning guides
developed based on school trips experiences (e.g., on healthy nutrition).
Ample parental education activities implemented under QIE as well as other activities involving parents
(i.e., parents counselling, extracurricular activities) had positive impacts in terms of parents’ involvement
and connectedness with the school; an improved relationship with children as a result of improved
communication and quality time spent together; and an improved parental involvement in strengthening
child’s educational achievements. However, while already involved parents and parents of schoolchildren
performing well in school, as well as young parents embraced and benefited of activities implemented, parents
of vulnerable children were more difficult to involve. The evaluation identified a number of cases when
parents participated only in the first sessions of parental education programme. Although most parents
participating in focus groups confirm that the courses made them spend more time with their children, play
with them, listening to them more, progress is slower for parents in vulnerable categories. Individualized
practices for this sub-target group would be beneficial being known that interaction and collaboration with
the families of pupils at risk must take place permanently (see recommendation 10).
At the same time, we can observe that in rural areas teachers consider that parental education is more
important given parents’ lack of involvement in the purpose of school, the lack of appreciation towards the
usefulness of education, the adverse social context, in most cases, due to the poor labour market
integration.
Therefore, in a context in which the school does not have a direct link to the labour market, the need of
parenting education regarding school participation is much more necessary. Furthermore, the existence of
successful role models for schoolchildren can motivate them in both urban and rural areas.
107
QIE also visibly contributed to an increased importance given to school, as success factor in life, both among
children and parents. However, children indicate that a better collaboration with parents and a closer
involvement with school on parents’ side is still to be achieved. This evidence indicates that activities
targeting parents (parental education and counselling, but also mini-grants for activities involving parents)
need to continue for the impact to reach all children and to significantly improve their non-cognitive skills
and levels of self-esteem (see recommendations 9 and 10).
Changes are more limited at CSI and CCRAS level, in terms of adopted approaches, information or resources
made available in the framework of QIE. However, QIE model is recognised at this level as a good practice
and CSI took over some of its activities in other projects developed, but not all of these were implemented
(see recommendation 8).
The evaluation confirms that teachers in rural areas are much more likely to lack the necessary
qualifications, particularly as the current school funding model and teachers’ merit allowances are not
sufficiently geared towards improving the outcomes of disadvantaged schools and schoolchildren.
Compared to urban areas, many rural schools (as many schools in marginalized urban environments) are
disadvantaged in terms of human resources, infrastructure, funding and accessibility. Improving transport
facilities for children and teenagers living in remote areas, sanitary and heating facilities, qualified teachers,
educational materials and modern equipment represent the necessary actions to be taken at the policy
level but mainly at the implementation level.
The evaluation observed that tolerant and non-discriminatory attitudes develop more gradually. From a
conceptual perspective, evidence collected reflect a good, broader understanding of the concepts of
inclusive education. School headmasters, teachers, and parents are significantly more aware of every
child’s uniqueness and particular needs, however, at a more subtle level, interviews and focus groups with
these stakeholders capture attitudes of segregation or denial of vulnerabilities in communities, especially
on ethnic or socio-economic criteria. Acceptance of children with disabilities seems to have increased
slightly more compared to other vulnerable categories. This dynamic indicates that a continuation at a
higher intensity (i.e., more activities) of long-term school practices is necessary for an adequate
internalisation and application of the non-discrimination concept in school (see recommendation 9).
Overall, UNICEF has been a long standing and reputed partner for the Ministry of Education (MoE) in
Romania. Support delivered by UNICEF in the form of technical assistance for drafting legislative acts,
methodologies, strategies and different studies to fundament policy alternatives has been in all case
perceived as highly relevant, of high quality and useful. UNICEF supported MoE in important areas
previously insufficiently addressed, i.e., early education, through advocacy actions, inputs in assessing
and formulating strategic documents and standard financing costs for pre-schoolchildren, and parental
education, by developing a dedicated strategy. UNICEF contributed to development of mechanism for
preventing and evaluation of school segregation phenomenon and to improvements in lifelong training
for teachers as QIE approach was largely taken up82 in “CRED”, a major project implemented by MoE aiming
to train 55.000 teachers in primary and secondary school. Other measures for a more equitable
remuneration of teachers and professionalisation of teaching career were taken with UNICEF support.
Unfortunately, instability at political level hampered the adoption of some inputs provided by UNICEF (i.e.,
related to early education, parental education, the methodology for standard cost per ante-pre-
schoolchild). In the absence of a National Parenting Strategy adopted by the government, this highly
relevant policy instrument cannot be applied country-wide and thus its positive effects, supported by
findings of this evaluation, manifest only where parental education is carried out trough singular projects.
However, the evaluation found that UNICEF contributions have been constantly used at technical level to
fundament decisions and projects to be financed with EU funding or in partnership with other international
organisations such as the World Bank. Limited evidence was also identified as regards the implementation
on the ground of some pieces of legislation adopted with UNICEF support such as the mechanism for
preventing and evaluating school segregation (see recommendation no. 15).
Further than effects registered in line with expectations reflected by QIE’s ToC, the evaluation identified a
number of additional, positive effects. No negative effects were identified by this evaluation. The key
unexpected effects refer to:
82 As confirmed by a majority of interviews carried out, including with teachers participating in CRED training sessions.
108
• Parents learned how to manage their personal, family and work time.
• Developing friendships between teachers as a result of the activities that they have attended
together (training courses and extracurricular activities or project management activities);
• Changes at a personal level for the involved teachers;
• Following the parental counselling component of the project, Frumoasa School could include in the
organization chart ½ the workload of educational counselling, which was covered by the teacher
who was initiated in this field through the trainings conducted during the implementation of the
project;
Efficiency
The average cost of QIE implementation is EUR 11,220/school/year and EUR 105/child or schoolchild for
the entire implementation period. The management costs of implementing partners are 15,64% of the total
overall budget. This proportion shows a very good distribution of costs, with the large majority of the
budget allocated to activities directly linked to the planned results, but with sufficient attention for
management and coordination to ensure quality and timely implementation of the activities. Based on this
average cost we can conclude QIE used its budget in an economical way, with smaller unit cost compared to
other intervention in the field of education and aiming at increasing access and participation to school as well
as developing teachers’ capacity to implement effective teaching and learning methods.
The County School Inspectorate Bacău and nine schools participating in QIE raised approximately RON
865,000 (EUR 158,800) from Erasmus+ and other European and national programme, therefore surpassing
the investment in technical assistance in the first year after QIE ended its implementation. In conclusion,
technical assistance for schools is a needed and worth investment, given that the investment in technical
assistance for schools has been recovered by schools that have been successful in fundraising activities (see
recommendation 12).
Scaling up the model (as it stands) at national level requires less than 2% of the budget of the Ministry of
Education in the first year of implementation and less than 1% every year afterwards according to the
costing model developed by UNICEF and unit costs for budgeting estimation at school and county levels are
available (see recommendation 13).
Sustainability
Evaluation found that stakeholders generally have an adequate understanding of the need to continue all
activities proposed by QIE. There is sufficient determination and experience to continue and improve
existing practices regarding (i) the diversification of the offer of school and extracurricular activities that
motivate and involve all schoolchildren, (ii) the use of teaching strategies adapted to the needs of
schoolchildren from vulnerable groups and (iii) in the area of strategic management, with an emphasis on
reducing dropout and increasing school participation.
However, the capacity of schools is insufficient for further development and facilitation of involvement of
parents/ community in school activities, parenting education and parenting counselling activities, counselling
and mediation support services for children from vulnerable groups, project writing activities / funding
applications. Further resources and interventions are needed for continuing the activities initiated by QIE,
for maintaining and further strengthening the results obtained and for achieving a long-term, solid impact
on schoolchildren.
According to the vast majority of opinions expressed, it is very unlikely that the comprehensive approach - on
all components of the QIE model - will be sustainable in schools, without additional allocation of human and
financial resources. According to the data provided by the case studies, susceptible to have low
sustainability are: parenting counselling activities (see recommendation 16) - due to the lack or
insufficiency of human resources in relation to the needs, extracurricular activities such as trips / visits
(which was considered one of the most relevant activities in pupils' perspective) - due to the insufficient
financial resources and trainings in the area of management skills or inclusion - due to low / lower quality
offers at DCH level and limited financial resources of teachers (see recommendation 13).
QIE can be rolled out and scaled up entirely or partially, starting with the most disadvantaged schools and
/ or counties. Initiatives including almost all QIE components show that replication is possible at local and
national level. Some QIE components (as separate initiatives) are already rolled out under the coordination
109
of the Ministry of Education, UNICEF, its implementing partners or other non-governmental organisations.
European, Norwegian and EEA funds, as well as limited national funds are available or will be available (in
the programming period 2021-2027 for EU funds) for this replication.
The integrated and holistic approach of QIE (targeting headmasters, teachers, parents, a large range of
activities with schoolchildren, including anti-discrimination and multicultural activities) is an important
strength of the model. However, replication of the entire QIE package (all components) for all schools in the
country, in the near future, might prove challenging, given the difficulties currently faced by schools and
the school system (see recommendation 15).
Factors influencing QIE’s success
QIE’s effectiveness, impact and sustainability is positively influenced if the following factors intervene:
• a large number/majority target group members are involved in project activities (for example, all
preschool teachers participated in the training);
• the existence of decision-making continuity at the local level (the school inspectorate should take
into account further implementation of campaigns, intervention packages, the continuity in
practice with the same management personnel, because, for example, even if headmasters have
gained confidence in managing children at risk by implementing the QIE intervention package,
their new approach was not maintained if they were changed from office);
• the extent to which headmasters and teachers are from the locality or proximity, have a long
experience in the school and do not intend to move to another school;
• the human resources who benefited from training activities remain in the school; the decisions on
teacher mobility are not under the responsibility of the school and the effects created by the
deficient regulations are felt especially by vulnerable schools - usually schools with a small number
of schoolchildren in rural areas;
• school counsellors and school mediators exist /are sufficient as number of staff (i.e., in some
schools none of the two positions existed) and are able to carry out their work, not hampered by
bureaucracy and unnecessarily complex rules;
• the existence of an active, open-minded school headmaster and a motivated work team. For this
result, the coaching or mentoring processes through which the management is accompanied on a
long-term basis to make the proposed changes are identified as essential;
• insufficiently developed norms, detailing the concrete implementation of legislation in place, for
regulating the standards, obligations and responsibilities for the implementation of inclusion in
schools;
• support from local authorities and their understanding of the role of education and of the school's
strategic priorities (support may be limited or may change following local elections);
• frequent policy changes, at local level (for the promotion and implementation of interventions)
and at national level (for programme, decision-making and legislative coherence), create obstacles
in extending the intervention;
• insufficient quality of initial education for teachers and their low remuneration level at entry level.
Based on the findings and conclusions above, the evaluation recommends the following83:

systems should be put in place, including indicators for
all levels of the intervention, clear baselines and targets
and data collection procedures.
Recommendation 3. Interventions in educational area, High Medium Ministry of
overall and in the framework of rolled-out QIE, should term Education
provide for actions aligned to different needs of boys and
girls. Such gender-customised actions should be
considered also for the activity of the school counsellor.
Recommendation 4: To ensure success in rolling out High Medium Ministry of
QIE, the role, responsibilities and interventions of local term Education,
authorities in the area of education should be clearly Local
detailed for each case (community), in line with the local Authorities
and country development strategies and legislation in involved

institutions (with the mayor's office) should be
developed and more applied cooperation with social
assistance services should be ensured, including as
regards a harmonised data base on vulnerable children
and pupils and adequate (case) management
mechanisms to ensure that children at risk receive all
necessary support.
Recommendation 5: The Ministry of Education should High Medium Ministry of
put in place adequate mechanisms for assessing term Education
regularly and ensuring the quality of the school
development plan and its implementation, i.e., three
times by plan period. These mechanisms may be
embedded/strengthened in existing monitoring, control
and evaluation systems, as undertaken by ARACIP and
County School Inspectorate.

teaching staff at entry level, in order to ensure stability
and quality of human resources at school level.
Recommendation 8. Independent of QIE rollout High Short term Ministry of
perspectives, interventions as implemented by QIE need Education,
to be continued in the participating schools, for reform Local authorities
at their level to be completed. In this regard the including County
evaluation recommends the development of a School
mechanism through which the County School Inspectorates
Inspectorates take up methods, materials, instruments
developed under QIE and integrate them in the existing
educational procedures and practices at SCI and school
level (e.g., in the activities of Teachers’ Houses and
Methodical Groups, whose capacity needs to be
strengthened).
Recommendation 9. In planning and performing QIE’s High Medium Ministry of
roll out, the integrated approach should be maintained, term Education,
as one of the key strong points of the project. However, UNICEF,
responsible actors need to include in any case, in the Local
customised packages delivered at school level, Authorities
comprehensive training for a majority of teachers in
school (differentiated by levels of seniority/experience)
as well as equipment and didactic materials, in
complementarity with recent measures taken to ensure
on-line schooling. In the same vein, activities targeting
non-discrimination and tolerance should be continued
and enhanced, for the aimed change to occur.
Recommendation 10. In planning and performing QIE’s High Medium Ministry of
roll out, the relevant actors need to take into term Education,
consideration that more extensive parental education is UNICEF and
needed, particularly for parents in vulnerable categories, relevant

Summative evaluation of the Quality Inclusive Education package of the “Social inclusion through the
provision of integrated social services at community level” modelling project in Romania, 2014-2019
Introduction
UNICEF is implementing in a large partnership with institutions and organizations at national, county and
community level a model of “Social inclusion through the provision of integrated social services at community
level”. The model is being implemented since November 2014 in 45 communities and in 51 schools85 from these
communities in Bacău county, in 34 rural and 11 urban communities.
The model consists of two components that aim to be complementary and inter-linked:
(1) the Minimum Package of Social Services (MPS) and
(2) the Quality Inclusive Education (QIE) package.
As part of the two initiatives the model also promotes communication for social change and gives attention to
issues and vulnerabilities related to adolescents. The main objective of the initiative is to promote social
inclusion and contribute to the reduction of multiple deprivations faced by children and their families in an
integrated manner.
The model is based on the hypothesis that by delivering a universal and integrated package of preventive social
services at community level (health, education, and child and social protection) to children and their families,
equity gaps and child deprivations are being reduced while at the same time lowering medium- and long-term
costs in social sectors.
In line with the planned duration of the different model components this document sets out the process to
evaluate the QIE component of the model (ending in June 2019).
1. Background and context of the evaluation
Situational overview
In the context of the EU 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as the new
framework of the EU structural funds for 2014-2020, the Government of Romania (GoR) embarked on a series
of reforms tackling poverty, social exclusion or early school leaving. National strategies on prevention of early
school leaving, social inclusion, protection and promotion of children’s rights have been developed and are
currently being implemented. Key principles and directions in these areas were set in accordance with
international standards and regulations, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child or the UN
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, already ratified by Romania.
Recent developments at EU level (e.g.: The Social Investment Package, EU Recommendation 2013/112/UE on
investing in children, Council Recommendation on promoting common values, inclusive education and the
European dimension of teaching) complement the picture, outlining the need for early intervention and a
preventive approach, to reduce the risk of poverty and social exclusion. EU Member states are encouraged to
ensure access to essential quality services for children. Moreover, specific targets have been set at national
level in the framework of the EU 2020 strategy, including reducing early school leaving to 11.3% and getting
580,000 people out of poverty.
As part of their successive partnerships agreements (2010-12, 2013-17), the Government of Romania and
UNICEF demonstrated commitment to review and adjust policies promoting children and their families’ well-
being, including through the priority objectives set in the 2014-2020 National Strategy for Protection and
Promotion of Children’s Rights86, Early School Leaving Prevention Strategy, Roma Inclusion Strategy. These
opportunities facilitated the alignment of the National Strategy with EC and UN Committee on the Rights of
the Child Recommendations, ensuring synergies and coherence between various national strategies and
between various levels of implementation as well. It also designs an appropriate balance between universal
85 The school unit is considered a juridical independent entity (the project was implemented in the first two school
years in 45 school units and starting with the third school year in 51 school units, having 6 new school units, in the
same 45 communities).
86 Approved through the Government Decision no. 113/2014. The National Strategy for the Promotion and Protection
of Children’s Rights 2014-2020 considers that early and preventive intervention allows reducing the risk of poverty
and social exclusion of children and as such, helps children achieve their full potential and fulfill their rights.

strategies of intervention, aimed at promoting the well-being of all children, and targeted approaches, aimed
at supporting the most disadvantaged, ensuring a focus on children who face an increased risk due to multiple
disadvantages such as Roma children, rural children, children with special education needs or disabilities,
children in alternative care and children living in low-income households.
The newly adopted UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018 – 2021 developed in line with the Sustainable Development
Goals adopted at UN level in 2015 is also providing key targets and indicators in ensuring quality and equitable
access to services for children of all age groups in a continuum of services from preconception period until 18
years.
Romania is currently the fastest growing economy in Europe with 7% growth (2017), yet growth in uneven,
doesn’t translate into progress for all parts of the country and society in an equal manner and the country
remains one of the poorest countries from EU. In fact, the number of children living at risk of poverty and social
exclusion is growing and stands at nearly 50% of all children. Nearly 29 per cent of Romanian children suffer
from severe material deprivation, which is significantly greater than in other European Union countries. In
2008–2016, the poverty rate for children was consistently 10 per cent higher than the overall average, and
the highest by far among all age groups.
Nearly 3.8 million children under age 18 (including 2 million adolescents) live in Romania, half of whom are
girls. According to the last population and households’ census (2011), three per cent of the population auto-
identified as Roma ethnic minority, although various estimates place this percentage much higher. Romania
faces multiple demographic challenges: its overall population is decreasing due to significant migration and
continued negative population growth and it is facing an accelerated ageing process. The proportion of people
living in rural areas is almost 50%. The gap in terms of access and quality of services between big urban areas
and small and medium urban areas and rural areas is significant and widening in recent past.
Education has seen improvements, but important disparities remain. At system level, there is a growing body
of evidence highlighting the vulnerabilities and the disparities of the Romanian education system affecting
especially the most vulnerable groups of children and adolescents. Among them, the access of Romanian
children to quality inclusive education remains one of its key challenges. The most recent study on out of school
children in Romania87 has revealed that 8.43% of young children (6-10 years old), 9.96% of children of lower
secondary education age (11-14) and 25% of children of upper secondary education age (15-18) were out of
school in the school year 2015-2016. Compared to previous years, we notice the increasing trend for the rate
of out of school children at all educational levels, with a total of 435,000 children and adolescents being out of
the education system from the preschool education cycle to upper secondary education cycle88. In fact, only
84% of the schoolchildren enrolled in 2004 have reached grade eight89. In 2018 just two thirds of the 8th grade
school cohort took the National Evaluation at the end of 8th grade and, out of those, 27 % did not pass the
exam. This shows that half of the children of this school cohort did not take or pass the exam. In the same time,
the rate of early school leaving (ESL) reached the value of 18.1% in 2017, still far from the national target of
11.3% set in the Europe 2020 Strategy90.
Disparities between the urban and rural areas start from birth (i.e., with the ante-preschool cycle starting at
birth according to the 2011 Law on Education and the Law on crèches) and become more predominant as
children advance through the system. The school cohort dropout analysis reflects some of the severe disparities
between the urban and rural areas in terms of participation to education: “in rural areas 1 in 4 children from
a school cohort is lost during the primary and lower secondary education, compared to 1 schoolchild in 10 in
the urban areas (23.1% in rural and 9.7% in urban)”91. School segregation also remains a key issue in
Romania: according to the European Commission, in 2015, more than 26% of Roma schoolchildren learned in
segregated classes92 (i.e., in classes with all or almost all schoolchildren being Roma). Moreover, according to

Sciences, 2017.

the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, only 38% of Roma children attend preschool education and 77% of young
Roma aged 18-24 are early school leavers.93
Even when children go to school, they still face significant challenges to acquire the skills and competencies
that are relevant for the 21st century. Almost 40% of 15-year-olds in Romania were assessed as functionally
illiterate and 24.3% were assessed as low achievers94, which is a rather shocking number for an EU member
state. The results of the international evaluations also reflect the persistence of enormous inequities: much of
this basic skills deficit is due to inequities in the education system. Youngsters from well-to-do backgrounds
vastly outperform those facing socioeconomic disadvantage. The difference in their math, reading, and science
competencies can be expressed in terms of the equivalent of years of schooling. Improving learning of children
from disadvantaged backgrounds is, therefore, a key driver of better performance overall. Further, PISA
singled out Romania when it comes to the motivation of schoolchildren: Romanian schoolchildren ranked
almost out of the chart and are the least motivated among the OECD participating schoolchildren. The quality
of education outcomes — measured in terms of basic skills — shows again significant differences between
rural and urban areas.
In terms of legal framework, the Education Law has been frequently changed and numerous amendments to
the Law have been adopted. OECD95 considers that “the repeated amendments also suggest that the Romanian
system of education was not ready, either philosophically or practically, to implement the measures set out in
the 2011 law”, while noting that “many fundamental parts of the Law are still in process of being implemented
or have been reversed by amendments”.
The existing disparities and vulnerabilities in education are generated by the chronic underfunding of
education, the design of the per capita funding formula which addresses insufficiently the equity aspects of
financing, the lack of evidence-based budgetary allocations among the cycles of education, limited capacity of
the system of education for strategic planning, the bottlenecks in reforming the initial and continuous training
of teachers, and social and cultural norms that are reproducing patterns of exclusion and discrimination.
As generally children face multiple sources of vulnerability, an integrated approach is key to ensuring
efficiency and effectiveness of the interventions. Still, evidence shows there is limited dialogue and cooperation
among sectors, making it difficult to maximize linkages and ensuring a consistent approach.
To propose evidence-based policy options, UNICEF and its partners are implementing a model “Social Inclusion
through Integrated Services”, based on the hypothesis that: delivery at national level of a universal package
of preventive social services (health, education, social protection) in an integrated/coordinated way to
children and their families will reduce equity gaps and deprivations children suffer while also reducing the
medium and long-term costs in the social sector and a comprehensive intervention focused on a quality and
inclusiveness of education will reduce early school leaving and enhance school participation.
The QIE model developed and implemented in 51 schools from 44 communities in the Bacau county aimed 1)
to test a comprehensive approach focused on the quality and inclusion of education, an approach that brings
together schools and families to prevent school absenteeism and school drop-out ; 2) to develop new
educational tools and practices that support the application of current provisions in education, with a focus
on an equity perspective 3) to develop new, innovative interventions addressing children’s non cognitive skills
and motivation for learning
2. Description of the object of the evaluation: QIE component of the “Social inclusion through
the provision of integrated social services at community level” modelling project
The object of this summative evaluation covers the Quality Inclusive Education component of the modelling
project “Social inclusion through the provision of integrated social services at community level” in
Romania implemented between October 2014 and December 2018. the Theory of Change (ToC) developed for
QIE Model relies on implementing the evidence-based solutions to the problems (bottlenecks and barriers in
school participation of various vulnerable groups of children to education: children from rural areas, Roma
children, children with disabilities, children from families affected by poverty, etc.) identified at each level:
system, community, family and school.

The model is implemented in 44 communities at the level of 37 urban and rural localities from Bacău county,
situated in the North-East of Romania. Communities are including 33 rural communities (one community =
one administrative territorial unit), as well as 11 urban communities (one community = defined as the
catchment area of a school). The selection of the 44 communities has been made based on an initial
assessment, applying a socio-development index. Following the identification of the urban and rural
communities, 51 schools have been selected from the respective communities. 45 Schools providing the longest
educational cycle (pre-school, primary, lower secondary, upper secondary) were selected from several school
units present in the 45 communities. In the school year 2017-2018 6 new school units from the same
communities were added.
The budget allocated for this modelling project is approximately USD9 million (for the period 2014-2018) and
the donors are: Norway Grants, French National Committee for UNICEF, Botnar Foundation and other UNICEF
resources. The budget allocated for Quality Inclusive Education package is approximately US 3 million (for the
period 2014-2018).
Brief history of the model
Taking into account the socio-economic context and situation of children and their families, especially of the
most vulnerable ones, including Roma, the modelling project was designed to ensure access to integrated
community-based services (health, education and social/child protection) and quality inclusive education in
one of the poorest counties, Bacău, in 38 localities (out of 93), both in urban and rural areas. The model was
designed based on recent literature, consultations with relevant stakeholders, as well as two previous
modelling experiences tested by UNICEF in education (School Attendance Initiative) and child protection (First
Priority: No invisible children!).
The goal of the model is in line with UNICEF Country Programmes 2014-2017 and 2018-2022, respectively to
provide technical assistance to the Romanian Government in order to put children on the public agenda and
contribute to the development of public policies in health, education and child protection. The model seeks to
demonstrate that delivery at county level of a universal package of community-based services (health,
education, social protection) in an integrated/coordinated way to children and their families will reduce the
equity gaps and the deprivations children in the respective county face.
The model's aim and objectives are in line with the provisions of relevant national strategies, including
(approved in chronological order): National Strategy on the Protection and Promotion of Child Rights 2014-
2020, National Strategy on Reduction of Early School Leaving 2014-2020, National Health Strategy 2014-
2020, National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 and Government Strategy on
Acceleration of Public Administration Reform 2014-2020 and Government Programme 2016 - 2020.
The main objectives of the model include: 1) to test services that already exist in the law but are not properly
implemented and to expand their implementation at national level; 2) to develop new protocols, standards
etc. to improve the quality of these services (make them more inclusive, preventive and cross sectoral; 3) to
develop new, innovative services. While these services aim to be universal, they will focus on vulnerable families
and children, including (explicitly, but not exclusively) Roma.
There are several principles guiding the model’s approach: universality, equity, inclusion, quality,
innovation and prevention.
The model is based on an extensive public-private partnership in the design, as well as implementation of the
intervention’s strategy, gathering relevant stakeholders at national, county and local levels, as follows:
National level : public (Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Institute of Educational
Sciences, Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Pre-academic Education) and private institutions (HoltIs
Association, Center for Education and Professional Development Step by Step, Community Development
Agency “Impreuna”, Centre for Health Policies and Services) have been involved in the design of the model, as
well as in the implementation of several activities (capacity building, development of tools and guidelines,
monitoring);
County authorities (Prefecture, County Council, General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child
Protection- GDSAPC, Directorate for Public Health (DPH), County School Inspectorate (CSI), County Centres
for Resources and Educational Assistance (CJRAE) are providing technical and methodological guidance to
118
local professionals, while ensuring complementarity of the model with institutional priorities and Bacău
County Strategy for Social Inclusion 2014-2020;
38 Mayoralties from Bacău county were responsible for: selection and recruitment of social workers and
community nurses, activation of community consultative structures (CCS), delivery of the MPS, drafting and
implementing a project proposal responding to community needs through a micro grant provided through the
MPS;
51 Schools from Bacău county were responsible for: creating school teams for the implementation of the
QIE components at preschool, primary and lower secondary level, devising an early warning system for the
identification of children at risk of drop out and absenteeism, improving the teaching skills of teachers,
promoting quality and inclusiveness of education, drafting and implementing a project proposal responding
to children’s needs through a micro grant provided through QIE, provision of parenting education and
promotion of role models.
The model’s implementation strategy is focused on two pillars:
Minimum package of services (MPS): an umbrella concept for the provision of integrated services in health,
education and social/child protection at community level; the package is organized around a set of seven
services (identification; information; counselling; support; referral; monitoring; evaluation) provided in an
integrated manner by a local team composed of a social worker, a community nurse and a school counsellor.
In vulnerable communities, the team can be extended, in order to include also a school mediator and/or a
Roma health mediator. In parallel with horizontal cooperation, vertical collaboration is also enhanced, with
county institutions providing technical and methodological guidance to their local counterparts.
Quality inclusive education (QIE): a package of interventions targeting the quality and inclusiveness of
education, so that all children complete compulsory education and are equipped with basic academic, social
and life skills. The multiple interventions organized within this package aim at several outcomes: a. promote
a child-centred teaching approach, so that schools are welcoming and inclusive for all children and their
parents; b. strengthen school management to generate a quality, inclusive and equitable educational
environment for all boys and girls and to better identify and address especially the most vulnerable
schoolchildren; c. enhance school-family collaboration; d. support parenting education, so that children live in
a protective and nurturing environment; e. support the development of non-cognitive skills (e.g. role models).
The two pillars are also complemented by a communication for development component including three main
campaigns targeting social norms raising the awareness for:
a. Local communication and behaviour change campaign targeting public service providers from
administration, health, education and social sector for reducing stigma and discrimination against
Roma;
b. Local communication and education campaign to provide education and behaviour motivation to
vulnerable adolescents, including Roma, to adopt healthy lifestyle and avoid alcohol consumption.
The strategy includes a communication plan to make sure that the model’s activities and results are
disseminated to a wide audience through various channels (national and local media, on line channels,
promotional materials, etc.). Advocacy efforts contribute to the overall goal of the model, so that thorough
documentation and evaluation of results, lessons learned and best practices influence public policies (national
strategies, programmes and projects) in health, education and child protection.
The following interventions were developed during the period October 2014-June 2019:
c) Initial assessment: a selection of 45 urban and rural communities covering 6 development clusters
and ensuring representatively at county level was made by a team of independent researchers (status:
done; deliverable: 45 communities selected). Once this selection was done one school from each
community was included in the project in the first phase and in 2016 in some communities the second
school existing there was included bringing the total number of schools involved at 51
d) Partnerships: partnership agreements with national, county and local institutions developed
(status: done; results: partnerships signed with: 4 public and private institutions at national level, 7
institutions at county level, 38 mayoralties and 51 schools)
e) In-depth assessment: collection of baseline by independent research against which the progress of
the model will be assessed (status: done; deliverable: 1 research report, with baseline collected from
45 communities from Bacău county, as well as 6 control communities from Galati county); At the
school level the assessment included the identification of different categories of vulnerable children
in terms of absenteeism, performance and inclusiveness.
119
f) Delivery of the QIE Model. The Quality Inclusive Education Model consists of six key components
(and for each component, activities are implemented at several levels: system level, community level,
school level and family & schoolchild level). The package of interventions of QIE Model is designed as
a universal package to be implemented at school level, at county level or at national level. However,
its modular and flexible structure makes it versatile and customizable so that when applied at the
level of a county or at the level of a school, this package is customized and applied according to the
specific needs of the county or of the schools involved (based on the situation analysis conducted at
the relevant level).
7) School Management Component
The School Management Component tackles a number of key management problems at school level such as
the lack of school efforts to prevent school dropout, the inability of early identification of the risks of school
dropout, the absence of risk-management in the School Development Plan, the weak capacity to identify and
attract additional resources needed by the school to promote better school results, etc Through the School
Management Component, implemented in partnership with the Institute of Educational Sciences, there are
delivered training programmes for school management teams and innovative tools and instruments are
provided to school headmasters for setting up an early risk detection system and management procedures for
the management of the risks of school dropout. School management teams are also coached in project
proposal writing, fundraising and project management through the implementation of the micro-grant sub-
component. School headmasters and their deputies are directly targeted in QIE Model and school management
capacity building is key due to their strategic importance for both school participation and quality and
inclusiveness of the education delivered in their school. Within the School Management Component there is a
sub-component on parents’ mobilisation. A number of capacity building activities are carried out in
partnership with the school management and teachers for mobilising and involving the parents into the school
life and in supporting the education of their children. Parents’ involvement in the school life is a key preventive
measure in combating school dropout and absenteeism.
8) Teaching and Learning Methods Component
This component consists of two sub-components: the didactics component and the `Joy to Learn` Contest. Both
sub-components are implemented in partnership with the Institute of Educational Sciences.
a) The Didactics Component (teaching and learning methods) tackles a number of key issues persisting in the
education system in Romania: insufficient initial teachers’ training, initial teacher training inadequate for the
social and cultural diversity of school population, usually the applied curriculum in many schools is not really
linked with the requirements or recommendations of the national curriculum framework documents, weak
customization of the teaching-learning methods to the needs of the schoolchildren with disadvantaged
backgrounds. Additional to these challenges, QIE factors in another recent challenge: the change of the
national curriculum and the transition from the traditional cognitive acquisition-based curriculum towards
a competency-based curriculum. Through the Didactics Component there are delivered face-to-face and on-
line training programmes for teachers on 7 curricular areas and 4 cross-curricular areas, training
programmes on inclusive education, placing a special emphasis on the pedagogical customization to fit the
school population social and cultural diversity. Additionally, teacher training programmes include the new
curriculum and the changes it brings in terms of pedagogical approaches. Training programmes have been
designed and delivered, as well, to school mediators and school counsellors School mediators and school
counsellors are trained and promoted in selected communities. They play a very important role, as a link
among families, school and the community. Their role is mainly to monitor children of school age who are at
risk of dropout and to support families getting them back to school.
b) The `Joy to Learn` Contest is an innovative approach to enhance schoolchildren’ motivation for learning and
stimulate creativity and uses innovative schoolchild-led pedagogical approaches aiming to enhance the
enjoyment of learning. The contest, open for all schoolchildren, is divided into 5 categories: written text,
photography, drawing, models and `anything else`. Within this sub-component, teachers are supported by the
IES to develop their skills in mobilising and guiding the schoolchildren develop their creativity and their voice
about learning. This is also a useful and meaningful model for the national programme of the Ministry of
National Education `The Different Week` in education.
9) Role Models (non-cognitive skills) Component
The Role Models Component addresses a number of challenges both at an individual (schoolchild) level, family
level and community level. In order to enhance the inclusiveness and equity of education, to prevent and
combat discrimination on several grounds (ethnic, socio-economic status, gender, area of residence) and to
promote a broad intercultural dialogue, the Role Models Component has been devised as part of the QIE Model.
120
Discrimination from adults and peers in educational settings is associated with increased negative perceptions
of one’s (ethnic) group, lower non-cognitive skills and lower levels of self-esteem. Through this component,
implemented in partnership with Community Development Agency “Impreuna”, children and schoolchildren
and their parents are involved in a non-cognitive skills development context via an innovative and attractive
strategy: by showcasing selected success stories from adults belonging to various disadvantaged backgrounds
(Roma, disability, poverty affected or from rural) that made it through education. The Role Models
Component’s strategy is to provide children/schoolchildren with credible, successful models, so that they
nurture higher aspirations in education, develop skills (e.g. resilience, motivation, self-esteem) and continue
their education path. The educational activities with the models (visits in schools) are accompanied by a series
of educational resources for the schools (a documentary movie about the professional success of the role
models that succeeded to become “somebody” using the educational path, publications for children or
adolescents and youth comprising the life stories of the role models and a pedagogical toolkit for school
teachers on how to use in various educational activities the resources developed and to foster inclusion and
valorisation of diversity).
10) Parenting Support Component
Through the Parenting Education Component there are tackled a number of key aspects related to child rights
and school participation and progress and is critical for the prevention of school dropout and absenteeism
(particularly for the families with disadvantaged backgrounds): weak parenting skills and parents’ education
and training level insufficient to support the school efforts of their children. This component consists of two
sub-components:
a) The parenting education sub-component, implemented in partnership with HoltIS Foundation, provides
parents with parenting education sessions for improving parenting skills, enhanced parent – child
communication and parents’ know-how to promote their child’s best interests. Parenting education curricula
has been developed to cover all cycles of child life, training of trainers’ curricula for education. professionals
(teachers, school headmasters and school counsellors) have also been developed and delivered to all schools
involved in the QIE Model. Moreover, at national level, through the Parenting Education Component there has
been developed a draft National Strategy for Parenting Education that is now under consideration within the
Ministry of National Education prior to be submitted to the Romanian Government for its adoption.
b) The parental counselling and mobilization sub-component, implemented in partnership with the Institute
of Educational Sciences, provides parents with counselling and awareness raising services for an improved
school-parents relationship and mobilization and involvement of parents in supporting their children’s
educational efforts and paths.
11) Early Education Component
While the participation to preschool education has increased constantly in the last decade, the participation
to ante-preschool education is severely hindered by the availability of the ante-preschool education services
(currently there are approximately 350 crèches at national level where less than 20,000 children are enrolled).
The Early Education Component tackles a number of key aspects for the quality and inclusiveness of early
education - ante-preschool (0-3) and preschool (3-6) education – such as the insufficient initial training of
preschool teachers and preschool staff which is neither adequate and does not always address specific issues
kindergarten staff face on a daily basis. Additionally, there are ongoing efforts to revise the ECEC curriculum
and to align it to the latest ECEC research and practices, while the teaching practices are still tributary to the
traditional teaching practices and methods. The Early Education Component, implemented in partnership
with Step-by-Step Centre for Education and Professional Development, supports the efforts for modelling ECEC
in Bacau County through capacity building (staff training, ToT and exchange of good practices) of staff in
ante-preschool and preschool education, the advancement of ECEC in Romania through inputs for the revision
of ECEC national strategy and development of an Action Plan. This component also aims to consolidate a
network of Resource Centres and trainers at national level able to implement and disseminate innovative
teaching and learning strategies in early education, demonstrate high quality ECEC services and help replicate
the model developed in Bacau at national level.
12) Micro-grant Component
The micro-grant component aimed to allow each school involved in the QIE Model to put in practice the
different school improvements and to exercise a leading role in such improvements. The micro-grant
component includes a needs analysis at school and community level, designing and implementing a strategic
plan to address these needs and promote a quality inclusive education approach. Based on a predetermined
methodological framework, the schools have the freedom to establish the priority interventions capable of
reducing school dropout & absenteeism and early school leaving and improve the quality and inclusiveness of
121
education. This component is implemented with the support of all implementing partners, under the
coordination of the Institute of Educational Sciences.
g) Local communication and behaviour change campaign targeting public service providers from
administration, health, education and social sector for reducing stigma and discrimination against
Roma: capacity building of local professionals was enhanced in order to recognize and fight
discrimination related to the access of public services
h) Communication: activity done on a permanent basis
i) Monitoring: activity done on a permanent basis
j) Advocacy: activity done on a permanent basis, including high level visits, high level events,
Theory of change
The Theory of Change (ToC) for the model was developed in September 2014 in a format which provides a
clear picture on how results would be achieved in the modelling project. It focuses on the expected impact on
equity gaps and deprivation of children and their families provided that a universal package of community-
based services (health, education, social/child protection) and a quality inclusive education package will be
provided in an integrated/coordinated way. The ToC includes activities, outputs and outcomes to be achieved
especially in the social/child protection, health and education areas, considering mainly the services developed
at community level with special focus on prevention.
To this end, in 2015, in consultation with various stakeholders at national and local levels, the ToC was further
developed and expanded including the necessary details for effective implementation of the model at county
and community levels. In this context, the expanded ToC includes refined objectives and logical
framework/sequence for activities required for the provision of the universal package of the community-based
services (health, education, social protection) and quality inclusive education package in an
integrated/coordinated way. These include therefore additional milestones linked to: 1) test the delivery of a
MPS96 to increase the social inclusion of vulnerable families with children, including Roma; 2) develop and
implement an integrated approach at school level to increase participation, reduce absenteeism, prevent early
school leaving and improve quality and 3) integrate the MPS with the school intervention in all the 45
communities.
Quality Inclusive Education (QIE) is a comprehensive integrated model consisting of a multitude of
interventions, tackling various problems and causes of absenteeism and dropout, with a clear focus on
enhancing the quality and inclusiveness of education. QIE includes several interventions and targets multiple
groups of key right holders (children, with a focus on children at risk, parents, preschool and school personnel)
and duty bearers (national, district and local authorities and professionals from various fields that could
support children’s retention and participation to school). In this respect, a specific Theory of Change has been
developed for QIE package (ToC in annex 1).
96 Within the context of advancing child-sensitive social protection and adequately investing in child wellbeing, UNICEF
advocates for a MPS as a universal mandatory social service package delivered through outreach field work by public
local authorities at community level to fulfil every child’s right to development, to combat poverty, to prevent the risk
of social exclusion and to support vulnerable families with children.
122
3. Evaluation purpose
The evaluation will serve to assess if the underlying assumptions and objectives formulated in the Theory of
Change for QIE were validated and achieved as well as to ascertain whether QIE contributes to promoting the
child rights to quality inclusive education.
The final evaluation of QIE is a key element in the process of promoting the scale-up of the QIE at national
level. The evidence generated by the interventions at school level and the lessons learned will be used for
advocacy and policy advice with authorities and stakeholders at local, county and national levels to ensure
that legislation and policies incorporate an adequate focus on the quality and inclusiveness of education.
UNICEF will use the evidence to advocate for and provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Education in
developing and amending educational policies related to prevention of dropout, absenteeism and early school
leaving (e.g. using a unitary definition of dropout; introducing specific action plans related to prevention of
absenteeism, dropout and early school leaving in the Institutional Development Plan of each school) and input
the national efforts for reaching the targets set for Romania by the EU 2020 Strategy. The evidence generated
will also be used to mobilize resources from the national and local budgets, as well as for leveraging funds
from the new EU Structural Funds 2014-2020 to ensure the sustainability at local and county level and
replicability of the model developed at national level.
In line with the UNICEF global evaluation policy the envisaged summative independent evaluation will be
conducted towards the end of the implementation period as intended in the initial project documents. It comes
as part of the agreed UNICEF Country Programme 2018-2022 Costed Evaluation Plan and it is the first
evaluation per se of this modelling intervention.
The previous major milestones in the evaluation plan were the in-depth assessment and ARACIP evaluation
that established in 2014 the baselines for the situation before the intervention and the independent mid-term
assessment that was conducted in 2016. This final evaluation is conducted in two stages, being one per each
major component of the modelling project. The present terms of reference describe the approach for the
second stage of the evaluation that focuses on the QIE and the possible effect that other interventions have
had over the beneficiaries of the QIE. At an earlier stage, the evaluation of MPS has been conducted and should
inform and enrich the one on QIE.
Apart from providing insights for the various national and local authorities, the evaluation will equally be
widely shared with partners from parliament and civil society that were involved during the implementation
and that can learn about the benefits of QIE and promote it through their respective channels. Further, the
evaluation will be shared with the donors that supported the project, institutional and private, to document
123
what was the effect of investing in the UNICEF modelling project. Finally, the evaluation will be used as key
input for the process of documenting the development of the QIE package in Romania as an instrumental
ingredient for national and regional horizontal exchange and possible replication.
UNICEF Romania working closely with UNICEF Europe and Central Asia Regional Office and Government of
Romania (GoR) are expected to use the evaluation as a knowledge management tool, as well as a priority topic
of interest within future horizontal cooperation initiatives in our region and beyond.
4. Evaluation objectives
The exercise will independently:
• Evaluate relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact of the QIE component;
• Identify and document the key elements that contributed to the QIE success and replicability, as well
as main bottlenecks and barriers in implementation;
• Document key lessons learned in relation to the QIE implementation and propose recommendations
for improvement;
• Make recommendations for further actions related to sustainability, scalability of the QIE as a
whole or components of QIE throughout the country.
• Identify the way in which the QIE component is relevant and produced results in addressing issues
related to gender equality, equity and overall advancement of child rights
5. Evaluation scope and focus
The overall scope of the evaluation is to assess how the QIE component of the modelling project “Social
inclusion through the provision of integrated community services at community level” is addressing the
challenges faced by the children and families from 45 urban and rural communities in Bacău county in
accessing a quality and inclusive education and to assess how this can be translated in plans for national scale-
up to cover all the children and families in Romania. Elements related to gender, equity and child rights are to
be considered throughout the evaluation process and in the evaluation report.
The evaluation will cover the period October 2014 – June 2019, based on the Theory of Change. The focus will
be on the 51 schools chosen from the 45 urban and rural communities in Bacău county, in 38 municipalities
that were included in the project and in the comparator group in Galati.
This evaluation will consider the changes and results of implementing QIE in relation with children and their
families, local stakeholders – schools from 38 urban and rural localities from Bacău county, local public
authorities; county stakeholders – local coordinators (education) and other professionals from CSI, County
Centres for Resources and Educational Assistance, County Council; and as well national stakeholders –MoNE
and other considered relevant Other stakeholders should be involved as well, such as: Ministry of Regional
Development, Public Administration and European Funds, Public Finance, relevant NGOs, academia, mass
media, donors, etc. The evaluation will also investigate the progress made through the project interventions
towards influencing the policies and legislation at national level for ensuring the access of all children to
quality inclusive education.
The evaluation should:
• Assess the QIE development, dynamics and results since its inception up until the end of the
implementation of the project in June 2019 (i.e. years 2015-2019);
• Look at the different components implemented within QIE in the period September 2015 – June 2019
from a results-based management approach;
• Identify programme implementation main achievements, in relation to the QIE goals, opportunities
and constraints encountered in implementation, lessons learned from implementing partners’
evaluations;
• Underline the most efficient elements that could be the core of future scaled-up interventions;
• Single out the successful elements that should be integrated in relevant public policies;
• Identify complementarity with other initiatives and sustainability opportunities under the current
national framework in education and in line with European guidelines;
• Evaluate QIE's results also from a gender and ethnical perspective, asses if the Intervention has
provided improvements. The evaluation should assess if QIE is addressing effectively and efficiently gender
and ethnic disparities related to the school dropout, absenteeism and participation phenomena;
124
• Analyse if ethical aspects were overall considered and promoted by QIE.
Potential limitations and risks
The evaluators will have to factor in several potential limitations and risks that may be encountered when
conducting the current summative evaluation:
• There is limited detailed official data on Roma children’s participation in education. However, within
QIE schools the data-bases compiled by the QIE implementation partners can balance the lack of
detailed official data at national or sub-national levels.
• There is fragmented or incoherent official data on children with disabilities and/ or special
educational needs (some official data include only the children having a disability certificate, other
data include as well other children with school orientation certificate without a disability certificate).
• It is possible that in certain schools some of the teachers or even headmasters who have been trained
in various training programmes no longer work in the same schools due to a high turnover of
teachers or headmasters.
• Attention should be paid to the complexity of the interventions implemented complementarily by QIE
implementing partners, as well as against QIE overall targets at various administrative levels.
• Migration (of both schoolchildren, their parents and teachers)
6. Evaluation questions
Considering OECD-DAC criteria97, the evaluation will specifically address the following categories of questions
which are expected to provide accurate insights related to the objective of the evaluation, scope and focus. The
questions below should be complemented by specific ones taking into account specific threats, obstacles and
bottlenecks deemed of strategic importance regarding the objectives of the summative evaluation. Also, the
questions should aim to identify and describe the lessons learned during implementation from the perspective
of having the intervention scaled up and to identify the elements that were relevant from the perspective of
gender equality, equity and child rights perspective.
Questions related to relevance:
• Are the activities and outputs of the modelling project consistent with the overall goal and its
objectives?
• To what extent has the modelling project been developed and implemented in line with the key
criteria for model projects (annex 6)
• To what extent is the modelling project relevant to national policies and programmes and cross-
sectoral strategies98?
• Are all processes based on a child/human rights approach? Are any age and gender issues considered
in providing the services?
Questions related to effectiveness:
• Did the interventions of the modelling project address the needs identified at the level of the most
vulnerable children? Are any age and gender issues considered?
• Does the model contribute to the capacity development of the schools?
• Which parts of the modelling project are most and least effective? What factors explain success?
• Are there any unplanned outcomes worth considering for filling in capacity gaps and/or addressing
remaining bottlenecks?
Questions related to efficiency:
• Does the modelling project use resources in the most economical/efficient manner to achieve
expected results?
• What is the value added (in terms of financial value) of the modelling project?
• Are the cost implications for scaling up considered?
Questions related to sustainability:
• Are the interventions modelled likely to continue when external support is withdrawn?
• Is the modelling project replicable? Are any adjustments of the model needed for replication?

98 National Strategies on Early school leaving, on the Protection and Promotion of Child Rights, on Social Inclusion and
Poverty Reduction, etc.
125
• What are the lessons learned at each level of intervention that should be considered for
implementation and further replication of the modelling project?
• What recommendations could be made to UNICEF and to the GoR to replicate and scale up such a
model?
Questions related to impact:
• What change did the modelling project determine or influence at the level of beneficiaries (children
and their families), professionals, communities, public administration – at local, county and/or
national level?
7. Evaluation methodology
The approach of the evaluation will be as participatory as possible. Stakeholders at all levels, including
children and their families, will be offered an opportunity to participate in the evaluation through discussions,
consultations, provision of comments on draft deliverables. In gathering data and views from stakeholders,
the evaluation team will ensure that it considers a cross-section of stakeholders with potentially diverse views
to ensure the evaluation findings are as impartial and as representative as possible.
The evaluation will apply the UNEG norms and standards99, and the UNEG ethical guidelines100, including
UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, and Data Collection and Analysis (effective
as of 1st April 2015), to ensure the quality of the evaluation process. Moreover, the evaluation should
mainstream gender and human rights considerations throughout. Aspects related to violence against children
and/or women will also be acknowledged. The report should use gender-sensitive, child-sensitive and human
rights-based language throughout, and whenever possible, disaggregation of data by gender, age, ethnicity,
area of residence, ability and income, should be made.
The evaluation team will propose the methodology design which should demonstrate impartiality and lack of
bias by relying on a cross-section of information sources (e.g. stakeholder groups, including beneficiaries, etc.)
and using a mixed methodological approach (e.g. quantitative, qualitative, participatory) to ensure
triangulation of information through a variety of means.
As concerns evaluability, the theory of change and data available allow for the assessment of the progress
achieved and the review of the modelling project results. In this context, the evaluation will consider the
existing baselines and will also use relevant available data collected within the modelling project, such as:
school reports, QIE monitoring platform, reports from county coordinators; monitoring reports, including
UNICEF monitoring field trips and experience exchanges. All these data sources are assessed as highly reliable,
since control mechanisms have been in place at all data collection levels (school, county, and at model level).
Data are disaggregated on age, gender and area of residence.
The evaluation will use mixed methods and could integrate:
– Primary quantitative data, collected through survey among school directors, teachers, parents, school
counsellor, school mediators. The evaluation will seek to collect disaggregated data based on the
following criteria: geographical – county and community levels; gender – boys/girls; ethnicity; age
groups, ability. If possible, other criteria will be considered, such as: grade for children in school, family
educational stock (mother/ father), etc. Nevertheless, when considering the survey for users of services,
the evaluation team will have to consider the quantitative survey conducted (in-depth assessment) to
generate relevant data about the beneficiaries of services (treatment group) and a control group (the
same as in the initial in-depth assessment).
– Secondary data analysis of: i) trends referring to education available through existing administrative
data; ii) existing reports on costs and financing of services from both UNICEF and other sources; iii)
longitudinal data from school-based reporting.
– Qualitative data, obtained through interviews and focus groups with key informants in the government,
public authorities at county and local levels, partner organizations (civil society and intergovernmental
organizations), parents, children, school staff and with different stakeholders in the evaluation.
The key sources of information are:
99 UNEG Norms and Standards for Evaluation, (2016), http://www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/1914
100 UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation. 2008, http://www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/102
126
– Rapid assessment of the social, health and education status of children and adolescents and their families
in one county (Initial Assessment) to inform modelling in “Social inclusion through the provision of
integrated social services at community level”
– In-depth assessment of the social, health and education status of children and adolescents and their
families in one county to inform modelling in “Social inclusion through the provision of integrated social
services at community level”
– Independent mid-term review of the whole modelling project
– UNICEF programme materials, such as country programme documents, strategies, project proposals and
reports to the donors
– Modelling project documents such as monthly and annual reports of schools and county coordinators,
micro-grants that are currently implemented by school
– Evaluations of the model project School Attendance Initiative
– Costing of QIE
Additionally, together with the data sources, a contact list of all relevant stakeholders, project implementing
partners and consultants will be made available to the evaluation team once a contractual agreement has
been made.
Potential limitations and risks related to the evaluation process may be linked to the staff fluctuation
within the involved institutions during the implementation of the model. It is possible that staff initially part
of the modelling is no longer working for the partner of the modelling. Other risks might be related to the
mobility of the families and children subject to intervention. Other risks may refer to the changes in the
Government or local authorities that may have occurred during implementation.
The quality assurance process will consist of the following steps: review of the inception report, including
methodology and data collection instruments both by UNICEF Country Office in Romania and the external
quality assurance facility for evaluations holding a LTA with the UNICEF Eastern Europe and Central Asia
Regional Office, review of all deliverables (the evaluation report will also be submitted for review to the
external quality assurance facility) and corrective actions recommended. On behalf of the UNICEF CO in
Romania, all the tools and deliverables will be reviewed by the Programme Specialist for Partnerships and
Horizontal Cooperation and the Education Specialist as well as the Research and Evaluation Committee, which
includes the UNICEF Country Office Management.
8. Evaluation workplan and deliverables
The evaluation process will include an inception phase during which a detailed evaluation framework and an
inception report will be prepared. The evaluation framework will build on the Theory of Change. It will provide
details on how to respond to the evaluation questions, which indicators to use, sources of verification.
This phase may include and/or be developed in parallel with the comprehensive analysis of available
information – desk review: including national laws, policies, action plans etc., county and local strategies,
reporting materials from schools and coordinators; monitoring reports, including UNICEF monitoring field
trips and experience exchanges. This phase may also include initial interviews with key stakeholders at
national level (i.e. MoNE, ISE, ARACIP) and possibly at county level (coordinators and directors from CSI,
CJRAE).
It is expected that data collection will start after submission and approval of inception report, including
proposed methodology and instruments, but npt earlier than the end of the school year 2018 -2019.
By end of data analysis, a draft evaluation report is to be submitted according to UNICEF-Adapted UNEG
Evaluation Reports Standards (the structure of the final evaluation report is available at:

ANNEX 3. Results of counterfactual analysis
To analyze the differences between the 51 schools in Bacau that were included in the project, and the 6
schools in Galati that were not included in the project, we carried out the following steps:
I. Divide the total database in two databases comprising only the number of boys and the
number of girls respectively for all indicators and school years;
II. Calculation of the averages for all indicators from the database, for each year of study, for
the 51 schools in Bacau and the 6 schools in Galati;
III. Calculation of the differences between the averages of indicators for schools in Bacau
and Galati for all indicators during the 5 years of school.
IV. Calculation of the difference between Bacau and Galati on all indicators in the first and
last school year (DID indicator).
Also, in order to have a much better picture of these differences, we decided to adopt a second scenario, in
which we eliminated schools with a number of pupils above the margin of +/- 10% compared to the number
of schoolchildren enrolled in Galati schools. The same steps mentioned above were performed in this
scenario. The objective of this scenario is to increase the similarity between the two groups (treated and
untreated) by selecting a sample from the treated group (the most appropriate sample, according to the
chosen criteria).
Scenario 1
Total database
In the case of the analysis of the DID indicator (difference in difference), a varied evolution of the analysed
indicators can be observed.
Positive differences are recorded for the following 4 variables: total number of schoolchildren enrolled,
number of schoolchildren enrolled at the end of the year, number of schoolchildren promoted and number
of schoolchildren with unfinished situation. Thus, the first 3 indicators indicate a more favourable
development of the treated group, while the last shows an unfavorable evolution of the treated group, along
the period of time that was analysed.

Negative differences were recorded for the following indicators: schoolchildren who are repeating the
class, schoolchildren with SEN, Roma schoolchildren, 8th grade graduates, schoolchildren with grades >5 at
the National Evaluation. All indicators show a less favourable development in the treated group than in the
control group, with the exception of the indicator for the schoolchildren who repeat the class. Thus, the
effects of treatment in the hoped direction are observed in the first four indicators.
„Boys” Database
149
In the case of the analysis of the boys' group, there are a few (and not very favourable) changes: first of all,
we can see the existence of a rather large difference in the number of schoolchildren enrolled (in
2018/2019 there was a decrease in the number of schoolchildren enrolled, schoolchildren registered at
the end of the year, the number of schoolchildren promoted, the number of Roma schoolchildren enrolled,
and a decrease in the number of pupils with grades higher than 5 in the National Evaluation). On the other
hand, there may also be a positive change in the decrease of number of schoolchildren who are repeating
the class, which is the only favourable development recorded in the treatment group.
In the case of this subgroup of treated units, a net impact of the treatment is observed only in the case of
the indicator referring to number of schoolchildren who are repeating the class.

„Girls” Database
In the case of the sample of girls, we can see the positive evolution of the number of girls enrolled, the
number of schoolchildren registered at the end of the year and the number of schoolchildren promoted. On
the other hand, there are also some negative developments of these indicators, such as: the low number of
8th grade graduates and Roma graduates, as well as the low number of pupils who scored more than grade
5 on the National Evaluation.
Compared to the boys' database, it is possible to see a significant change in the number of girls enrolled and
registered at the beginning of the year, with a considerable improvement for girls.

Scenario 2
Under this scenario the analysis was carried out on a sample of 24 schools in a margin of +/- 10% number
of schoolchildren enrolled compared to schools in Galati. Thus, it is obvious that this new sample selected
from the schools in Bacau represents a reality much closer to the counterfactual reality of the lack of
treatment, revealed by the sample of schools in Galati.
Total database
Within the total database, some improvements can be observed in the number of schoolchildren enrolled,
the number of schoolchildren registered and the number of schoolchildren promoted. There can also be a
positive development in the number of schoolchildren who are repeating the class that has decreased in
schools in the treated sample in Bacau. Compared to Scenario 1, it can be observed that in this case there
was a slight decrease in the difference in favour of schools in Bacau for the number of schoolchildren who
are repeating the class. Also, in this scenario, the magnitude of the favourable effects is greater.

„Boys” Database
In contrast to Scenario 1, this database shows how there is a significant improvement for the schools in the
Bacau sample in terms of the number of pupils enrolled, and the number of schoolchildren registered at
the end of the year. There is also an improvement in the case of a decrease in the difference for the number
of schoolchildren who are repeating the class, as well as a slight increase in the number of graduating
eighth-graders. And in the case of schoolchildren with SEN, the evolution, although minor, is a positive one.

„Girls” Database
In the case of the girls' sample, there is a considerable improvement in the number of pupils enrolled, the
number of pupils registered at the end of the year, and the number of pupils promoted. There is also a
negative development in terms of the number of schoolchildren with an unfinished situation (which
increased in 2018/2019), and the number of graduating eighth- graders (which decreased in the period
2018/2019), the number of Roma pupils (which also decreased), and the lower number of pupils who took
more than 5 in the national assessment.
In the case of the other indicators, no radical differences from scenario 1 can be noted. All these favorable
difference (effects of treatment) indicate net effects of treatment with a greater magnitude.

Case study 1
School, town/city
Introduction
General data about the commune/community/town/city the school is located in
Colonești is located in the eastern extremity of Bacău County, on the border with Vaslui County, located at
45 km from Bacău Municipality. It is crossed by the county road DJ241. It is composed of the following
villages: Zapodia, Coloneşti, Calini, Spria, Satu-Nou, Valea Mare.
Colonești does not have natural resources, raw materials or any special materials outside the forest fund.
The main economic profile of the commune is agriculture, with agricultural land accounting for 70% of the
total area. Also, the rearing of animals and birds shall be carried out in an individual household system.
There are 4 schools in Colonești: Școala Gimnazială „Smaranda Apostoleanu” (also known as Colonești
School, with 151 schoolchildren), Școala Primară Satu Nou (with 35 schoolchildren), Școala Gimnazială Spria
(with 87 schoolchildren), and Școala cu clasele I-VIII Sat Călini (with 45 schoolchildren), the last 3 schools
being, in fact, substructures of the first and main school. Also, there are 3 kindergardens: Colonești (2 groups
with 40 preschoolchildren), Călini (1 group with 16 preschoolchildren), and Satu Nou (1 group with 20
preschoolchildren).
According to the 2011 census, the population of Colonești amounts 2.106 inhabitants, down from the
previous census in 2002, when 2.176 inhabitants were registered. According to the official website of
Colonești, the population of the commune has 2.189 inhabitants of which 1.055 men and 1.134 women.
The majority of the inhabitants are Romanians ethnics (96,3%). For 3,56% of the population, ethnicity is
unknown. From a confessional point of view, the majority of the inhabitants are Orthodox (94,35%), with a
minority of Baptists (1,47%). For 3,56% of the population, the confessional affiliation is not known
(population census, 2011).
Around 40% of the population in the commune are vulnerable, socially assisted and without a job jobless
(this percentage has not changed in the last 5 years). The 60% of the non-socially assisted population is
consisted of elderly people, people who working abroad, and really few people who have local shops (about
10% of the population). Some farmers have accessed European funds, but this is not a common think to do
in Colonesti. There are very few farmers accessing national grants or European funds through zootechnical
projects, and those who apply have to write and manage projects, so the people in the commune are not open
to these procedures. The level of education is 8 classes, and most schoolchildren are not attending higher
education due to the 40km distance to Bacau.
General administrative data about the school
Colonești school Școala Gimnazială „Smaranda Apostoleanu” is an educational institution with legal
personality (SIRUES code 344951) which coordonates all the other schools and kindergardens.
According to data in SIIR, the number of schoolchildren enrolled in Colonești school increased with 173 from
the lowest number of 211 in 2014-2015 to 384 in 2018-2019 (although the highest number of schoolchildren
enrolled was of 423 in 2015-2016, decreasing every year since then). The graduation rate stays constant at
92%-93% since 2015-2016, with a higher rate – of 99.05% - in 2014-2015. The rate of passing the National
Evaluation has been constant after 2015-2016, decreasing from the previous year.

In 2015-2016, there were 4 children with special educational needs (SEN) enrolled, out of 423
schoolchildren, therefore under 1%. Since then, the number of children with SEN decreased (2 in 2016-2017,
1 in 2017-2018). In 2018-2019, there were no children with SEN enrolled in school.

According to the Annual internal quality assessment report from 2018 and regarding the families
background and parents level of instruction, the following information can be mentioned:
- 101.32% - at least 1 parent graduated lower education
- 3.95% - at least 1 parent graduated high school
- 1.32%- at least 1 parent graduated higher education
In 2018-2019, there were 250 schoolchildren who commute daily (no child travels to school more than 30
minutes), 320 schoolchildren from socio-economic disadvantage communities, 180 schoolchildren whose
parents are working abroad, 2 schoolchildren with SEN (already enrolled), and 12 schoolchildren with
disabilities.
Instruments used for the case study
The present study case is an exploratory approach, aiming to capture in depth the change mechanisms
specific to QIE project implementation at institutional level, to describe their relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency, their impact and the prospects for sustainable further developments. It is based on collection of
data from Școala Gimnazială „Smaranda Apostoleanu” Colonești, gathered using a mix of research methods,
in line with the denominators inserted in the evaluation matrix (interviews with principal, teachers, school
counsellor, parental educator, focus groups with schoolchildren, parents, teachers). Relevant information
from annual school assessment report and strategic school development plan were added, in order to
contextualize the study case. For more details, see Annex 2.
Relevance
EQ 1. Are the activities and outputs of the modelling project consistent with the overall goal and its
objectives?
223
• Extent to which activities planned are relevant and sufficient for the objectives set
• Extent to which outputs produced are relevant and sufficient for the objectives set
• Additional activities/outputs needed
• The extent to which consulted stakeholders agree that activities and outputs were of the necessary
quality to ensure achievement of objective
The interviewed representatives of the learning community from Colonești School (principal, teachers,
parents, and counsellor) pointed out that activities have been implemented for each of the envisaged
objectives of QIE package. Additionally, they identified and described different development needs they had,
underling that these necessities received a proper support from UNICEF intervention they were involved in.
Thus, teachers mentioned that they can bring in classes new and modern teaching methods, as well as new
child-oriented activities which really have a serious impact on children’s well-being. All educators from
Colonesti participated in training activities organised by Step-by-step and also in peer learning activities
carried out face to face or online. Representative of the local authorities stated that both teachers and the
Colonești School’s principal are now able to identify early problems at school level and can address them
accordingly, including through the involvement of the local authorities in cases that requires special
attention from the Social Services.
Teachers benefited from teaching materials that were very useful. Teachers mentioned that there are many
children who come from disadvantaged families and for them, as was mentioned in the interviews, being
able to learn and interact with other kids represent a big thing for them (“If we give them a calm and soothing
environment in which they can forget about their daily problems and if they come to school with love, I
consider it a win.” – teacher interview). Schoolchildren have participated fondly in all activities, which
developed the children's ability to work as a team and to interact, as well as built self-confidence. Also, as it
was stated by many teachers, children are taken out of the family environment and, at least for a few hours,
they are able to forget about the daily worries they should, in fact, not face at this young age (children are
forced to do agricultural work or various household chores).
Also, school supplies were necessary especially in kindergartens, where teachers actually bought school
materials from their own money before UNICEF intervened (“All activities attract children to school, but
teaching materials/school supplies are the most important for them.” – teacher interview). Teachers
affirmed that many children fail to purchase supplies and about 3/4 of the children are from vulnerable
areas, especially in Călini and Spria. Also, there are not many children with financial possibilities at the
Colonești School either (about 10-12 children can actually afford to buy school supplies).
Interestingly enough, one of the teachers stated that the trainings did not necessarily come first and there
were problems with the school's funds and the material/financial possibilities available to the teachers. It
has been said that the trainings courses actually show examples and behavioural patterns of children from
an entirely different educational and social environment than Colonești, so the theory does not match the
practise, and modern methods cannot always be applied in rural areas. Also, it has been stated that “children
are responding better to traditional methods” (teacher interview).
Regarding the parents, a mother stated that she attended parenting courses when she was pregnant with
her first child, so, naturally, she had a lot of questions, and the courses actually helped her to prepare and
better understand her role as a future mother. Also, parenting courses proved to be really useful and there
was an improvement in both the relationship between parents and the relationship between parents and
the school (“Some parents have been especially reluctant at first because of their level of education, but have
great confidence in UNICEF and in UNICEF's projects. Now, parents have a higher confidence in the school
and the community (however, parents don't necessarily trust the local administration).” – teacher
interview). Parents who have been socially assisted do not encourage their children to overcome their
condition, so they take over the model of their parents (family income comes from subsistence farming or
working here and there).
Children come to school driven by UNICEF projects and by the activities conducted with European funding.
By 8th grade, all children attend school (100% enrolment rate), but the trend is to drop out of school after
completing the 8th class, due to the distance to the high schools in Bacau. Also, surveys showed that some
224
schoolchildren have a low frequency participation at courses due to their financial situation, familial
problems and lack of support from the other children.
Overall, QIE’s proposed and implemented activities, as well as the outputs produced, were considered
relevant for addressing such identified needs. All respondents articulated such clear connections between
activities offered by QIE and the school’s goals or needs. Although teachers affirmed that there is a significant
progress regarding the interaction between schoolchildren and school, actually none of the schoolchildren
who participated in focus group believe they can discuss any issues with the counsellor, school psychologist
or teachers, but almost all schoolchildren said they could talk openly with their parents.
Additional activities needed, as identified by the school community members and local authorities
representative consulted are:
- Parental education courses are still needed, because despite the fact that the courses have been
completed and some parents have been involved in the last 3 years, “many young parents do not
take care of their children”, as a teacher told us. Thus, the main problem is considered to be the
attitude of the parents. The representative of the local authorities stated that “parents no longer
respond to parental education programmes, so certain constraints would be needed, such as the
denial of social benefits” (local authority representative). To help children, activities with parents
should be continued, because schoolchildren spend only a few hours at school and the rest of the
time is spent in the family environment.
- Psychological counselling courses would be needed, because there are many children in
kindergarten who should be diagnosed with SEN, but parents do not want to start the necessary
procedures. The only counsellor has to deal with a lot of children and the time is very short. Also,
since the pandemic started, there is no nurse to consult the children and the educators also do that.
- Non-discrimination and inclusion activities should be continued, as there are still problems in the
family environment, and children have a very rigid and closed attitude towards teachers (and other
children too).
- Teachers have mentioned that the space available for classes is enough to ensure that the courses
are conducted in good conditions, but the need for teaching materials still persists and it would be
useful for schoolchildren to benefit from a hot meal (as it happened during the project implemented
by the Red Cross).
- It would also be useful for Step by Step to get involved in school too, including secondary classes,
not only in kindergartens.
- An extended study programme would be useful, so children could do their homework, eat, learn,
and do various activities, such as music, painting, etc. Many children have a rigid attitude towards
teachers, an attitude that comes from the familial environment; interviews showed that if in
previous years there were such problems in the 8th grade, now these attitudes are present including
at the 5th grade level, because the involvement of parents in the children's lives is virtually absent.
- It was stated that a solution for encouraging schoolchildren’ enrolment in high school would be to
provide transportation to the high schools in Bacau (approx. 40 km); this is an initiative for which
the local authorities do not have the necessary financial resources.
In addition, there were other interventions needed mentioned in the focus group with the teachers:
- A special scholarship for underprivileged children is needed in order for them to go to high school.
- Many children go to high schools, get scholarships, but fail to cope. These children come from
families with little or no education, so they are not guided and “abandon the fight to the slightest
obstacle” – teacher statement.
- There should be continuity, a link between schools and high schools, in order to exist a smooth
transition for children.
- Parental involvement in children's lives is very important, so more action should be taken in this
direction.
EQ 3. To what extent is the modelling project relevant to national policies and programmes and cross-
sectoral strategies?
225
• Complementarity with other projects/interventions and challenges raised by legislation
QIE activities were considered compatible to any type of intervention aiming to promote inclusive and high
qualitative practices within schools. The project that came up the most was the one implemented by the Red
Cross with activities conducted twice a week; a significant part of this project that was very appreciated by
teachers was the meal that children received during these activities. Also, there is a new project implemented
with collaboration of the Red Cross through which tablets with educational applications were purchased for
schoolchildren so that online activities could be organized.
Some teachers have participated to courses organised by CRED, which focus on the new curriculum, while
others stated they will participate in future sessions. Also, teachers stated that they would have felt the need
for a CRED course to take place before the new curriculum came into effect. Teachers made a clear distinction
between the CRED and the UNICEF projects: UNICEF emphasizes attracting children to school by organizing
activities, so schoolchildren came more fondly to school and started working together: also, UNICEF focuses
on personal development and improving human relationships, while CRED offers a more didactic
perspective.
The Colonești School has been renovated and new schools have been built by accessing European funds and
NPRD funds. Also, there are programmes through UNICEF and OPHC which are offering educational
vouchers to primary/secondary and kindergarten schoolchildren, provided that schoolchildren attend
courses (the school drop-out rate was 0% in the last 2 years).
In collaboration with Terre des Hommes, a synthetic sports field with nocturnal light was built. There is also
a classroom that has been equipped and converted into a gym (at the moment, it has become a classroom
again due to the need to use the space for conducting courses under conditions of physical distance between
schoolchildren).
Transport to school is provided by the local authorities for children; also, during the pandemic, one mask
per day is provided for each child until 30 October and local authorities have been invested in thermo-
scanners. Colonesti manages to collaborate with many associations and organizations because, as stated by
the local authorities representative, they “need help and have the opportunity to ask”. The local authorities
are trying to find funding for various problems present at the community level (the SERA Foundation,
together with the community involvement, helped operate a 6-month-old child for cataracts and they built
houses for families without financial possibilities, but they failed to overcome their condition – alcoholism
and domestic abuses).
The local authorities, through access to micro-grants, managed to organise activities to combat bullying and
discrimination. Also, local authorities support victims of domestic violence to seek and obtain protection
orders, which has reduced the rate of aggression (“Aggression is no longer perceived as trivial, so people are
more open to reach to the authorities. As a result, women in the commune have become more independent.”
– local representative interview).
Some of the respondents considered QIE project consistent enough to be applied in any other educational
settings, similar to their school. More, than that, favourable opinions were express for supporting project
dissemination and its country wide implementation (“Every county should have access to this project,
because it is a very good experience and offers some possibilities that only access to resources can provide.”
– teacher interview).
EQ 4. Are all processes based on a child/human rights approach? Are any age and gender issues
considered in providing the services?
• Existence and level of availability of adapted activities for boys and girls / childer of different ages / if
a special attention to gender was needed and for children of different ages, with different
backgrounds and from vulnerable groups, especially Roma
In regard with the possible adaptation of QIE intervention to the needs of children with different ethnic and
cultural backgrounds, all respondents said that ”there is no differentiation between children, all are treated
226
the same, there was no discrimination between children” (teacher interview). The interviews showed that
not discrimination based on ethnicity is present in Colonești, but mostly discrimination based on financial
opportunities: some schoolchildren have financial possibilities and can purchase textbooks and school
supplies, and others did not have this possibility. However, teachers stated that schoolchildren also
discriminate against intellectual capacity, which behaviour is sanctioned and forbidden. Teachers are trying
to teach their schoolchildren that all of them are equal, regardless their financial opportunities and
intellectual capacities (although the number of schoolchildren with SEN is officially zero, there are still
schoolchildren who are not yet diagnosed, nor registered as such). Also, special attention was paid to
children with SEN (officially or unofficially registered as such), and the project was inclusive (at least at a
kindergarten level).
Effectiveness
EQ 5. Did the interventions of the modelling project/QIE address the needs identified at the level of the
most vulnerable children and families? Are any age and gender issues considered in providing the
services?
1. Effects at the level of children
o No of new/different extracurricular activities to which schoolchildren participated
o Pupils in participating schools understand concepts such as diversity, tolerance,
discrimination
Teachers, parents and school principal described several visible effects recent years of schooling and QIE
interventions had on children:
- developing common activities with educators and children from different cities, for instance,
activities were carried out with educators from Alba Iulia regarding the Italian teaching models, in
which children were free to make their mark on these activities;
- school drop-out rate has been zero in the last 2 years, but the situation is uncertain in the event of
the conclusion of funding programmes.
- children learned to be more tolerant and to accept other children who have problems or special
needs. There are, however, parents who do not teach their children these aspects, so their children
are reluctant to these notions.
- participating in different creative classes, like, for instance, between tradition and modernity, in
which children learned different type of dances, both modern and traditional.
- trips to Brasov and Bacau were organized so the children to have the possibility to discover other
traditions, to go to the theatre, etc. (“these activities led to the rapprochement between
schoolchildren, but also between schoolchildren and teachers, with a focus on the human side.” –
teacher interview).
- schoolchildren’ participation increased since the project started, but, overall, the impact on children
is barely visible.
2. Effects at the level of vulnerable children (schoolchildren at high risk of drop out)
o Vulnerable children involved in extracurricular activities
o Vulnerable children with improved self-esteem
227
Most of QIE activities took into account the needs of vulnerable children, but they didn’t focus especially on
the most vulnerable children (in part because most of the children are from poor and dysfunctional families).
However, teachers got a better understanding of their schoolchildren with special educational needs (SEN)
– although most of them are not registered as such – and learned to integrate them in activities in school and
outside the school.
Teachers brought toys and schools supplies from home or bought them from their own money because most
of the children do not have the financial means to do that, but there is still a need of didactic materials (there
are families that don't even have electricity and, last year, for 8th graders, teachers paid for internet
subscriptions for children with precarious material situations in order for them to be able to prepare for the
National Evaluation exam). Also, it was stated that there are many children who suffered during the
pandemic, because they did not have the means to attend online courses.
Many schoolchildren who have a difficult financial situation and they see education as their only chance to
leave Colonesti and to be independent, but there are also schoolchildren have the idea that, regardless of
their involvement, they can stay at home and work in Colonesti. Interviews showed that the abandon rate of
studies after the 8th grade is very high, despite the fact that in focus group almost all children wanted to
attend high school courses or some kind of vocational training. There are also schoolchildren who attend
university studies, each generation having 3-4 schoolchildren who are continuing their academic studies
(many parents also discourage children's academic course).
Other less positive findings are that:
- Collected data didn’t show an effort to identify other needs and vulnerabilities of the children or the
roots of the social exclusion some of them are facing;
- Activities have not been designed taking into account the needs of children with special educational
needs (SEN), mainly because parents refuse to officially take the necessary procedural steps in order
to do so;
- Many parents consider that their children are school’s responsibility and refuse to be involved in
any activities with their children;
- There were also children who were withdrawn from school by their parents, despite their potential.
Improved self-esteem among children has not been monitored by teachers. Teachers suppose the
extracurricular and non-formal activities helped children express better their ideas and contributed to self-
confidence and self-esteem. However, there are no data supporting this hypothesis and the focus group with
children showed exactly the contrary (“In the 8th grade, there are schoolchildren from vulnerable areas who
find it difficult to think that they can overcome their condition” – teacher interview).
3. Effects at the level of parents
o Parents involved in school activities (as effect of parenting class and parents’ counselling)
o Number of parents participating in activities promoting diversity, tolerance, non-
discrimination
o Number of parents understanding concepts such as diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination
o Number of parents cooperating more with teachers (asking more frequently the teacher on
the child situation at school).
Some of the parents that participated in focus group stated that they have learned how to care for and listen
to their children so that now there is a friendly relationship between parents and children. This statement is
confirmed by the children’s focus group in which almost all of them stated that they could talk openly with
their parents, but not with the counsellor, school psychologist or teachers.
There is no parental educator among teachers in 5th to 8th grades, so the parents of these schoolchildren
were not given the opportunity to attend these courses. Although, it was stated that these parenting courses
have had a positive impact on the relationship between parents and children, and parents have started to
advocate so that children can get to school (minibus and free transport to school for schoolchildren living in
remote villages). Mothers are also encouraged to denounce abuses and domestic violence, so they are asking
228
for orders of protection from the local authorities. Thus, the parents gained more self-confidence.
Parents affirmed that they have learned to appreciate their children more, to show them that they are loved.
They were also able to teach their children how to play and interact with other children/people. This may
be the case for a small number of parents who actually participated to parenting courses, but these effects
did not extend at the community level (“the outdated mentality of the parents is a difficulty in the way of the
children’s' academic course”, “there are many children taken into foster care or dealing with abuse and
domestic violence from their parents”).
All things considered, there is an evolution of the relationship between parents and school, which is much
better than 5 years ago (“The family environment is still the biggest problem. There is, however, a positive
development, in the sense that children and parents have felt the closeness and openness of teachers and, in
many cases, at least one of the two parents has become closer to the school.” - teacher interview). However,
this relation could be improved, and also the collaboration between school and the local authorities could
be improved, especially regarding the management of cases of children with a precarious material situation
and who are victims of domestic violence.
The parents who participated in focus group were the same parents who were actively involved in activities
and in parenting courses; they stated that they are aware that access to education creates opportunities for
children. In their point of view, children would have no reason not to come to school, because projects and
investments in the area have created the necessary conditions for schoolchildren to be able to learn in a
suitable environment.
Also, they stated that there were parents who were reluctant to sending their children to school, but they
have changed their mind (as a result of the intervention of teachers), so the children have become more open
to the parents and the parents have started to get along much better with their children. As mentioned
before, this is not a generalised effect at the community level.
Truth be told, most parents are not really interested in providing for their children or in their children’s
future due to their lack of education. Those who do not go to work abroad choose to stay in the commune
for convenience, especially since the social assistance for a family with 3 children exceeds the minimum wage
and the beneficiaries are also medically insured. This is the reason why such a big part of the population of
Colonești is comfortably living from social assistance.
Activities with parents, especially parental education, helped parents to be more aware of concepts
such as diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination. However, no other progress related to non-
discrimination has been reported and no special activities, with this objective, involved parents.
EQ 6. Does the model contribute to the capacity development of the schools?
1. Effects at the level of school management
o Improved institutional development plans
o Headmasters participating to training (management and diversity)
o The level of training quality
o The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
o Number of schools applying for and implementing mini-grants
o Number of schools applying for and implementing other educational projects
o Number of school mediators and counsellors / participating to training
The Colonesti School has a new director who was not involved in any QIE interventions. Although, the
previous director took part in the trainings, he never implemented or vaguely implemented what he learned
in the process of school management.
Despite this, all schools in Colonesti look much better, and the lobby at Spria School is full of pictures from
activities carried out within the UNICEF project and other projects. It is also very important to involve the
school manager in carrying out activities and in the smooth running of things; through various partnerships
and sponsorships, the change of schools is significant.
229
2. Effects at the level of school teachers
o Teachers participating fully/ partially, certified/per subject out of total number of teachers
in schools
o The level of training quality
o The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
o Number of teachers participating in extra-curricular activities
o Number of teachers understanding concepts such as diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination
The majority of respondents identified clear and visible effects on teachers’ didactic behavior, after
involvement in QIE project. Additionally, teachers themselves described – during interviews and focus group
- the benefits they had, as a consequence of their involvement in different types of activities as:
- Trainings for teachers and parental educators; there were mentioned trainings like Friendly school,
peer learning, non-discrimination training courses at Piatra Neamț (organized by Agenția de
dezvoltare și comunicare „Împreună”);
- Extracurricular activities and competitions –the competition “The Joy of learning” (“Bucuria de a
învăța”), trips to Bacău and Brașov, a culture and folklore camp at Valea Budului for both children
and their parents, activities and workshops for both children and their parents (quiling, origammi,
etc.).
Trainings for teachers and activities funded by micro-grants have been complementary, generating both
classroom and extracurricular activities using new teaching methods. All teachers stated that many
schoolchildren work in the household, and school is a way for them to relax. Teachers said it was very
important for these children to be able to get to school, and the educational performance comes after that
(although the enrolment rate is 100%, these children need to be drawn to school, and there are cases where
parents refuse to let their children to study, and these cases require the assistance of the Social Services).
3. Effects at the level of kindergarten teachers
3.1. Kindergarten teachers participating fully/ partially, certified/per subject out of total number of
kindergarten teachers
3.2. The level of training quality
3.3. The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
3.4. Kindergarten teachers participating in Peer Learning Activities PLA) out of total number of
kindergarten teachers
3.5. Extent to which training received covered new areas
3.6. Extent to which materials received covered new subjects/had new approaches
3.7. The extent to which materials were used in classrooms/were useful (no of classrooms with new
teaching materials)
3.8. Number of kindergartens teachers participating in extra-curricular activities
3.9. Number of activities carried out together with parents
There are only 4 kindergarten teachers in all 3 kindergartens. The interviews showed that these
kindergartens are understaffed, with teachers taking care of the cleaning and, much recently, consulting the
children in the absence of a specialised nurse. All 4 educators from Colonesti participated in training
activities organised by Step-by-step and participated in peer learning activities. Also, they benefited from
teaching materials that were very useful.
Teachers who were involved and came up with project ideas benefited from micro-grants (the local
authorities accessed a micro-grant on MPS). There were 3 micro-grants accessed by the educators (there
were activities against violence, dance, teaching materials and technical equipment were purchased) – “Hats,
T-shirts, socks and dance costumes were also acquired, and the school became friendlier and the children
were happy to come to school (children also received food and sweets)” (teacher interview). Not all
educators benefited from these micro-grants because they did not want to get involved.
230
The courses for kindergartens teachers were very useful and showed a different perspective on classroom
teaching (interdisciplinary approach) and “there were trainers from the Ministry with whom we shared
ideas and experiences and from whom we had a lot to learn, especially since I was in my first year as a
teacher” (teacher interview). The same teacher stated that learning is not just about teaching the subjects in
the curriculum, but it is very important “to look at and treat the child as a whole, to have an integrated
approach; children must learn to think for themselves, be people in the truest sense of the word and then to
accumulate knowledge”. As the teachers herself put it, this vision was entirely influenced by the QIE
intervention. Also, as a result of the project, the teaching activities of educators have changed towards
learning through play, activities and interactive lessons, so the children are encouraged to have the freedom
to cultivate their imagination.
The parents stated that the attitude of teachers has changed a lot towards the help of children, motivating
children to learn much more. Children go to school with more pleasure, and they are learning through play.
EQ 7. Which parts of the modelling project/QIE component are most and least effective? What factors
explain the success?
1.1. which components were highly effective and durable, which not.
1.2. WHY? (Number of factors affecting the effectiveness of different components).
Based on the answers provided by the consulted stakeholders in Colonesti (in interviews and focus-groups),
the most effective activities are:
- Trainings for teachers: in every interview it was stated that trainings represent an important and
decisive part of the QIE intervention, having in the centre activities and new methods of teaching
designed to be child-oriented. Also, these courses were both theory-based and had an important
part of practical examples and activities. Teachers learned to have a more inclusive perspective and
to improvise and to know how to make their courses both interesting and exciting for their
schoolchildren (“In my view, training activities have been extremely beneficial, because this has also
improved collaboration between teachers.” – teacher interview).
- Parental education, that generated a sustainable dialogue between parents (the few ones that
actually participated) and school for the benefit of the children, and made all stakeholders
interviewed for the case study to identify the improved and strengthened relationship with the
school with parents as the second most important result of QIE package in Colonesti. Also, this is the
aspect that needs further improvement and that could really make a difference in dysfunctional
families, if all the parents would be interested in being a part of the project and, toa greater extend,
of their children’s lives.
- School supplies were the most appreciated and needed in Colonesti because teachers used to buy
toys and didactic materials from their own money. There is still a dire need of supplies, but the
situation improved during the QIE intervention.
- The contest "Joy of learning" was considered interesting, and teachers participated and won prizes.
- The microgrant activities, that allowed extra-curricular activities and non-formal approaches to
curricular activities and opened the dialogue between the school and the local community: parents,
authorities, younger and older children. The microgrant planned activities evolved from their initial
focus on getting school/teaching material and equipment for the school (in the first year) – laptop,
printer, etc. – to activities aiming to improving relationships within the school and the community
(teachers-schoolchildren-parents) and offering non-formal and in-formal learning opportunities for
the school schoolchildren – trips to Bacau and Brasov, a folkloric camp at Valea Budului, etc.
QIE intervention could not be oriented on non-discrimination and tolerance, in part because there are many
children who are of a different ethnicity, but they are not registered as such. The same case happened in
regarding the children with SEN, they are not officially registered, so it makes it very difficult for teachers to
have an inclusive approach regarding these kids, since they do not receive the support and attention they
would need.
231
EQ8. Are there any unplanned outcomes worth considering for filling in capacity gaps and/or
addressing remaining bottlenecks?
Some teachers observed some unplanned outcomes - “I developed my ability to speak in public and managed
to overcome my emotion and to discover myself.” (teacher interview). Also, mothers were encouraged to
denounce abuses and domestic violence, so they are asking for orders of protection from the local authorities
(an increased self-confidence due to parenting courses and discussions with other parents, teachers and
local representatives).
No other unplanned outcomes were mentioned in interviews or focus groups.
Efficiency
EQ 9. Does the modelling project use resources in the most economical/efficient manner to achieve
expected results?
• Only if evidences were collected related to activities/approaches which could have been done
simpler/faster.
No consistent and informative answers could be recorded regarding the efficiency of resources utilization,
especially in relation with the balance between costs and activities implementation and possible achieved
results. There have not been identified high efficiency solutions, nor suggestions ensuring a greater
efficiency with a lower input.
Most of the respondents were not able to respond to this question, but it was stated that the UNICEF funding
has been well spent. Although, more could be done with additional funding, because there are still many
necessities to be meet. Teachers stated that the funds were welcome and sufficient at the time.
The interviews showed that there were, however, certain occasions (such as expensive hotel
accommodation in training courses) when the money could have been spent on more people attending
classes or helping children. Also, every teacher knows what he needs, so it would have been much better
(and efficient) if teachers would have been asked at the start of the project what needs they have, because
these needs differ by group and by each school (in some kindergarten there was a dire need of toys, but in
others more school supplies would be needed).
EQ 10. What is the value added (in terms of financial value) of the modelling project? –
• Have QIE generated more projects and/or fund raised in the schools?
Colonesti benefits from many external interventions, such as those of the Red Cross to help children in
disadvantaged areas (clothes, warm meals, tablets, etc.), the intervention of Terre des Hommes for the
development of the synthetic sports field, POCU interventions regarding the qualification of people, but these
can not necessarily be considered effect of QIE intervention.
Sustainability
EQ 12 Are the interventions modelled likely to continue when external support is withdrawn?
• Continuity of employment of trained teachers and managers
• Extent to which funds are secured for the continuation of activities
• Extent to which relevant stakeholders intend to continue the intervention in a certain timeframe
• Commitment of QIE stakeholders to continue using the knowledge, approach and tools acquired
under QIE beyond the lifetime of the project
• Why not? Risks to sustainability
QIE interventions in Colonești were very useful, but are less likely to be sustainable in the school. Of course,
the knowledge acquired by teachers in these activities will continue to be used in the class (“These activities
have opened up new horizons for teachers and educators.” – teacher interview). The same could be said
about the school aesthetics, but this a very limited impact. Just a small group of parents participated in
232
parenting courses and became closer to their children and the school, but the majority of parents are still in
the same spot as they were before the beginning of the intervention (“Activities were started but not
completed; parenting courses were successful with some parents, but this initiative was abandoned halfway
through, and neither UNICEF nor Holtis involved anymore.” – teacher interview).
In every interview it was said that there are still many necessities at both the school and community level,
so the project should continue in order to bring more funding in the school. But, without UNICEF’s funding
and without the help of Red Cross and other institutions involved, the sustainability of the results is unlikely.
For example, when the micro-grants funding was over, no more activities could be organised due to lack of
funds at the school and community level (as it was stated, the budget of the city is scarce, since almost half
the population is socially assisted).
EQ 14. What are the lessons learned at each level of intervention that should be considered for
implementation and further replication of the modelling project?
• The focus here is the replication of the project (not the continuation) – what needs to be done in other
for the same project to be implemented in other localities/counties? Other measures/modification of
the project as it is right now.
As a teacher stated, it would have been much better if teachers would have been asked at the start of the
project what needs they have, because these needs differ by group and by each school. The interviews
showed that these interventions were highly appreciated and should be continued in Colonesti, as well as
implemented as it is in other regions.
Impact
EQ 16. What change did the modelling project determine or influence at the level of beneficiaries
(children and their families), communities, professionals, public administration – at local, county
and/or national level?
1. Impact on all schoolchildren in schools
1.1. Perception on formally recording absences
1.2. Perception of children on school attractiveness
Under QIE intervention, school became a more welcoming environment; modern methods, a more friendly
looking learning space, non-formal activities made teachers, schoolchildren and their parents more
interested in building relevant learning experiences in their school. Unfortunately, the impact on the
schoolchildren from 5th to 8th grade is barely visible, the most results being achieved in kindergartens.
Although children became more active in class and participated in most formal and non-formal activities,
without the continuation of the project, these effects will not last.
Regarding the perception of formally recording absences, all the respondents declared that the absences are
registered in school documents. Also, it was stated that the rate of drop outs was zero in the last 2 years (in
focus group, schoolchildren stated that they do not know any children who abandoned the school). Since
most of the children are at risk, there is no monitoring system implemented in this regard in school.
2. Impact on schoolchildren at high risk of drop out
2.1. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project with improved school
attendance
2.2 Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who abandoned school
2.3. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who repeated the school year
2.4. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who have better school
results
Locally, the problem of school drop-out and absenteeism has been solved at the moment, but the situation
is uncertain in the event of the conclusion of funding programmes.
233
3. Impact on all children in early education
3.1. % of pre-schoolchildren with improved kindergarten attendance (by age groups)
QIE interventions had a high impact at a kindergarten level, mainly because they provided school supplies,
toys and teachers implemented many new activities. Before the project, teachers needed to buy toys and
supplies from their own money. These interventions had the most impact at a kindergarten level.
Unfortunately, there are no financial means at the community level to ensure these supplies (due to the high
rate of unemployment), so the situation is uncertain.
4. Impact on school management and school
4.1. Schools participating in the programme are more child-friendly (dimensions developed in survey)
4.2. Number of cases in which local authorities become involved in solving problems encountered by schools
4.3. The extent to which knowledge gained during training was shared with other teachers.
4.4. The number cases in which the school director assisted teachers in class.
The impact on school management is virtually null, mainly because there is a new principal who did not
benefited from any courses. Despite this, the schools in Colonesti are more friendly, and were recently
renovated through European and national funding. The local authorities ensure free transportations to
school and they intervene in special cases to ensure the participation in school of all children. The relations
between school and the local authorities increased in the last years, so there is a more coherent and
integrated intervention at the community level.
5. Impact on teachers
5.1. Number of teachers using diversity materials in classroom
5.2. Number of teachers using/extent to which teachers use adapted curriculum to various needs of children
at risk
5.3. Number of teachers using/extent to which teachers use new learning activities and new learning
contexts.
5.3. Turnover of teachers
As mentioned before, the impact on some teachers is high, and they are implementing new activities and
they are using new teaching methods learned in trainings (affirmation confirmed by the survey). Teachers
were able to access micro-grants in order to buy laptops, printers and other didactic materials. Although,
there are not enough books for all children, so they either have to share them (1 book at 4-5 children) or the
teachers need to print materials for every child (this has been particularly difficult due to the pandemic,
having in mind that there are many households without electricity).
6. Impact on early education teachers
6.1 % of early education teachers who diversified the activities undertaken with the children
6.2. % of early education teachers who introduced innovative approaches in their activities with children
There are only 4 teachers in Colonesti, but all of them participated in trainings and developed new skills. It
was stated that QIE interventions have the most impact at the kindergarten level. Teachers diversified the
activities undertaken with the children. There is still a dire need os school supplies in kindergarten, but
teachers learned how to be inventive and to adapt to the situation (“If we do not have teaching materials,
we organise observation activities with children through which they learn to enjoy and observe the nature;
234
we also collect various objects and bring them into the classroom, and the children play with them (e.g.
geometric figures can be made from sticks)” – teacher interview).
7. Impact on family/parents
7.1. Number of parents with improved attitude as regards the benefits of education.
7.2. Number of parents with improved attitude as regards the benefits of parental education.
7.3. Number of parents with improved relationship with their children
The most frequent effects mentioned in this respect were the following:
- increased parents’ involvement and a better relationship with the school;
- an improved relationship between parents and their children;
- parental involvement in strengthening child’s educational achievement, in academic support of the
schoolchildren (parents support and encourage their children to choose their own path in life and
do not impose a particular academic path on them).
Although, these impacts are present on a small group of parents, because most of them did not participated
in activities and parenting courses (also, only mothers were involved in these activities). In every interview
was stated that parents’ mentality and lack of education are the biggest problems in Colonesti (“Parental and
child counselling should be emphasized in order to improve communication between parents and children.”
– parents focus group).
Conclusions
Overall, QIE initiative has been effective in stimulating improvement in Colonesti School community, in
setting the scene for facilitating provision of effective education for all children, in partnership with local
community. Although, the intervention has little impact at parents’ level, due to their reluctance and
apparent lack of interest in these types of activities. QIE interventions at 5th to 8th grade is virtually null due
to the fact that there are no parental educators to organise parenting courses with this children’s parents.
The most significant problem remains the attitude of the parents, attitude that is transmitted to the children
(reluctance, indifference, lack of self-confidence, no clear vision about the future).
Despite de fact that every teacher stated that QIE interventions had a major impact on a community level,
the evidences show otherwise: there is, in fact, a significant improvement of teachers’ teaching methods, of
schools’ aesthetics, but the interventions did not have the desired impact on parents and, at a larger scale,
on the community. It is true that the level of cooperation between school, local authorities and a relatively
small number of parents increased in the last years, but considering all the projects and financing that
Colonesti is benefiting from, the outcome is, in fact, very limited.
All respondents stated that the sustainability of QIE interventions are questionable and they cannot afford
to continue organising formal and non-formal activities due to the lack of funding. Also, all respondents
stated that UNICEF should be more involved in Colonesti in order to assure further funding for these
activities.
Case study 2
School, town/city
Introduction
General data about the commune/community/town/city the school is located in
Horgești is a commune in Bacău County. It is composed of eight villages: Bazga, Galeri, Horgești, Mărăscu,
Răcătău-Răzeși, Răcătău de Jos, Recea and Sohodor. The commune is located in the central-eastern area of
the county, south of the municipality of Bacău (30 km away), on the left bank of the Siret and near the Dacian
fortress Tamasidava. The territory of the commune is crossed from north to south by the Răcătău stream.
235
According to the 2011 census, the population of Horgești commune amounts to 4,583 inhabitants,
decreasing compared to the previous census in 2002, when 4,691 inhabitants were registered. The
commune is ethnically homogeneous, without significant minorities. According to the census, over 94,02%
of the population is made up of Romanian ethnics, while for over 5,83% of the inhabitants of the commune
the ethnicity is unknown. From a confessional point of view, most of the inhabitants are Orthodox (55.92%),
but there are also minorities of Roman Catholics (20.58%), Pentecostals (15.16%) and Baptists (2.27%). For
5.8% of the population, the confessional affiliation is not known. The main activity of the community is
agriculture.
In commune are four school structures: Horgești Secondary School, Sohodor school structure of Horgesti
Secondary School, Răcătău School with grades I-VIII, Recea School with grades I-VIII. The commune is
present online with website and there are three important turistic objectives: The wooden church dedicated
to "Saint Nicholas", dating from before 1809 in the village of Sohodor, The wooden church dedicated to the
"Holy Dukes" (1885), The wooden church from 1875 from Bazga village.
General administrative data about the school from SIIR and Internal evaluation reports sent to
RAQPE
Horgești School is not the only school from the commune, there are other 2 schools, Recea and Răcătău.
Horgești School manages two structures: one in Horgești and one in Sohodor (Sohodor school structure of
Horgesti Gymnasium School).
According to data in SIIR, the number of schoolchildren enrolled in Horgești School decreased with 63 from
526 in 2014-2015 to 463 in 2018-2019. The graduation rate do not stay constat, the highest rate of
graduation was 93% in 2014-2015 and the lowest rate was 66% in 2017 – 2018. A detailed situation is

Relevance
EQ 1. Are the activities and outputs of the modelling project consistent with the overall goal and its
objectives?
• Extent to which activities planned are relevant and sufficient for the objectives set
• Extent to which outputs produced are relevant and sufficient for the objectives set
• Additional activities/outputs needed
• The extent to which consulted stakeholders agree that activities and outputs were of the necessary
quality to ensure achievement of objective
Taking into account the objectives of QIE package, planned and implemented activities and outputs
generated have been sufficient in order to allow the objectives to be met. However the interviews show that
is need additional activities to improve the educational act and communication with children in order to
achieve the objective of QIE package.
Data collected (interviews and focus groups) show activities have been implemented for each of the
envisaged objectives of QIE package. The following table is summarising the most relevant activities and
outputs, as perceived by the school community members (the management, teachers, parents and children)
consulted for the case study.
Objective of QIE package Relevant activity according to Relevant outputs according to
the school community the school comunity members

related to interactions in teams,
with children and parents.)

QIE’s theory of change, but it has
been reported by the school

Creating partnerships with Parental education (7 parental Parents participating in parental
schoolchild families and educators) education sessions/workshops
developing parenting skills Activities promoting interaction (166 sessions and 220 parents
between parent and child involved)
Mobilizing communities to No such activities were -
support education organized
Additional activities needed, as identified by the school community members consulted are:
• Creating an online platform through which educators can see the activities of other educators -
improving peer learning
• Activities to present demonstration lessons (especially at the preschool level)
• Additional trainings for teachers on schoolchild communication, the most useful activities are those
related to communication with schoolchildren
238
• Additional cooperation mechanisms with local institutions (with city hall), though the cooperation
with local institution was increased withing the Minimum package of services, in present is necessary
more cooperation with social assistance services
• Actions to reward the schoolchildren' involvement in the educational act, like a „day centre”
(Example: In early education, participation in kindergarten was improved by the 50 Ron ticket -
national project). One important think mentioned by the school manager was these material
benefits need to be offered by school (UNICEF support), no by the town hall.
One additional output needed, identified by the microgrant coordinator, has been the credits/certification
of the teachers’ trainings, in this way teachers can be more interesting in trainings. Another output needed
is more materials for lessons, after the discussion with teachers it was found that in Horgești is a problem
related to textbooks, in this case a series of support materials for the classes can be beneficial.
Consulted stakeholders agree that activities and outputs were of the necessary quality to ensure
achievement of objective, according to the director, dropout rate have decreased slightly in the last years.
All activities and outputs were necessary because in Horgesti, as teachers identified, Roma ethnicity is a
problem. Roma families influence their children to give up to school considering not important the
educational act, moreover a lot of schoolchild prefer to work or go abroad and they lose school years.
Another factor which influence the education is religion, many families are Pentecostal and with church help
families have gone abroad and theirs children have given up to school.
EQ 3. To what extent is the modelling project relevant to national policies and programmes and cross-
sectoral strategies?
• Complementarity with other projects/interventions and challenges raised by legislation
The objectives of the QIE Package are also found in other projects and interventions that were carried out in
Horgești School, both at primary and secondary level. However, it was found that the school did not benefit
from other major complementary interventions, nor did it manage to obtain funding for Erasmus projects.
[n general, the respondents identified partnerships through which the needs of the schoolchildren in the
school were ensured, one of them was the partnership with the Ovidiu Association which offered a mini
library to the primary school schoolchildren. Another collaboration was with the association “ALL GROW
Romania”, where within the project “CHANGE ARCHITECTS”, the schoolchildren won a trip to Rome, but due
to the lack of material possibilities they could not go. Other partnerships were with the NGO Romania Youth
Democracy and Tamasidava. No other projects were carried out at school level, as mentioned above,
although two funding applications were submitted for Erasmus projects, by it was lost.
According to the director, during the implementation of QIE the collaboration with city hall was very low, it
was impossible to carried out a partnership between these two institutions. The school mediator's meetings
with the social worker were not productive, although permanent collaboration with social assistance
services is necessary for the management of vulnerable schoolchildren.
Regarding the replicability of the project at national level, respondents set out a number of issues that should
be taken into account. UNICEF should choose the people to work with and the role of the school need to be
increased in managing the various financial resources.
EQ 4. Are all processes based on a child/human rights approach? Are any age and gender issues
considered in providing the services?
• Existence and level of availability of adapted activities for boys and girls / childer of different ages / if
a special attention to gender was needed and for children of different ages, with different
backgrounds and from vulnerable groups, especially Roma
Most respondents considered that the QIE Package promoted children's rights, so that age, gender and
ethnicity issues were taken into account. In terms of gender, a slightly different approach was identified at
239
the preschool level, where play activities took into account the gender of schoolchildren (according to an
early education teacher - "There is equality for everyone, but some play activities are different").
In terms of non-discrimination and tolerance, several respondents appreciated the need for the course on
non-discrimination hold by „Agenția Împreună”. The importance of this course can be given the ethnic
specificity of the community, where is a large Roma community. The case study shows through the course
the degree of tolerance has been increased vertically, teacher - schoolchild. At the horizontal level, there is a
high degree of assimilation of the Roma community, which has reduced discrimination. Despite of high
degree of assimilation, respondents noted that the tolerance has been increased among schoolchildren,
because the teachers used a different class approach learned during the trainings.
The school counsellor mentioned the vulnerable position of the girls, who are culturally influenced and
choose to leave school early (one of the teachers said that "Boys can be kept longer in school"). In the case
of this type of situation, the project did not offer a possible solution, but the teachers think it is possible to
find the solutions („I think that solutions could be found to keep the girls at school - teacher interview”)
Effectiveness
EQ 5. Did the interventions of the modelling project/QIE address the needs identified at the level of the
most vulnerable children and families? Are any age and gender issues considered in providing the
services?
1. Effects at the level of children
1.2. No of new/different extracurricular activities to which schoolchildren participated
1.3. Pupils in participating schools understand concepts such as diversity, tolerance, discrimination
QIE address the needs identified at the level of the most vulnerable children and families, in this way teachers
have used the information from „Impreună Agency” course, regarding non-discrimination. As we mentioned
above in Horgesti is a majority of Roma in which can exists a lots of tolerance problems, but this issue is not
very serios because there is a high degree of assimilation. However, the big effect at the level of children have
been tolerance increased, as identified the respondents.
Beyond this, teachers appreciated that the effects on children were varied. Although most believe that
schoolchildren have become more tolerant, some believe that the effects have been minimal because it is
very difficult to help children who are strongly influenced by the family. Data collection showed that
participants believe that schoolchildren are disinterested in the educational act, as long as the family has the
same attitude. Some of them noticed the existence of a wall in collaboration with the schoolchild and many
of them are disorganized and do not want to collaborate.
The case study shows not many extracurricular activities were performed, most of the microgrants being
intended purchase of materials. From this point of view, one of the main needs identified at school level was
covered, the shortage of teaching materials. According to the respondents, different extracurricular activities
were carried out at the level of each class or in Săptămâna Altfel. (example: activities related to minorities
and non-discrimination, visiting high schools in Bacău). Regarding the activities carried out by UNICEF, the
Joy of Learning contest was an interesting one, because children performed in new activities and they were
attracted to.
2. Effects at the level of vulnerable children (schoolchildren at high risk of drop out)
2.2. Vulnerable children involved in extracurricular activities
2.3. Vulnerable children with improved self-esteem
Most of QIE activities took into account the needs of vulnerable children, but most of them didn’t focus
especially on the most vulnerable children. The training courses have helped teachers to define their
approach in dealing with different groups of vulnerable schoolchildren. Although the community has
240
homogenized over time, the two main causes of schoolchildren' vulnerability remain: the culture (Roma
ethnicity) and the financial situation, the second one determines the phenomenon of migration.
From the perspective of culture, the respondents mentioned about the early leaving of school by girls who
choose to start their own families and thus give up the educational act. Starting with the sixth grade,
schoolchildren leave school and begin to earn their own money, this phenomenon is based on family
influence. The financial situation is the second main cause of school dropout by children in Horgești. In order
to improve their material conditions, many families take their children abroad and they lose school years,
often the children are not even enrolled in school, because if they enroll and do not go, they lose social
assistance.
Another category of vulnerable schoolchildren are schoolchildren with SEN, in Horgeti school in the period
2014-2019, the number of these schoolchildren ranged from 3 to 6. Respondents did not mention much
about this category, but in an interview was reported about a particular situation in which a schoolchild with
SEN, although well integrated, he dropped out of school because of lack of his parents support.
As mentioned, the activities carried out were not exclusively dedicated to vulnerable schoolchildren. One of
the respondents mentioned that when exclusive activities took place for vulnerable schoolchildren, who
were rewarded in a sports activity, the other schoolchildren felt discriminated. Case study shows that the
main effect on vulnerable children was self-acceptance, both on their own and in interaction with others, the
stereotypes were almost eliminated. This effect is convergent with the expected outcome at the project level
- increasing diversity and increasing the motivation of the schoolchild, especially the vulnerable schoolchild.
3. Effects at the level of parents
• 3.2. Parents involved in school activities (as effect of parenting class and parents’ counselling)
• 3.3. Number of parents participating in activities promoting diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination
• 3.4. Number of parents understanding concepts such as diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination
• 3.5. Number of parents cooperating more with teachers (asking more frequently the teacher on the
child situation at school).
The QIE Package have intervened at the level of parents through parental education and organized activities
with parents and their children (especially at preschool level). Moreover, visits were made to vulnerable
families, and during parenting sessions were carried out practical actions in order to make the parents be
interested. (watching videos). HOLTIS evidences also confirms that the trainings took place, involving 7
parental educators, 23 groups of parents, 166 meetings between parental educators and parents, 220
parents involved, 27 support meetings and 37 teachers.
The consulted stakeholders identified that in Horgești is a need for parental education, given the fact that
the educational act is not a priority for the community in Horgești. Most respondents considered that parents
were not interested in education and this attitude also influenced their children. Parents were the least
component involved in the intervention, and the migration phenomenon have led to the cancellation of
several parental education sessions.
Although the interest of parents was low, the teachers consider that the intervention produced a small
change in the relationship between parent and child. The school manager stated that parents understand
the importance of the educational act, but not the benefits of education. Also, in some cases, teachers noticed
that their parents changed their attitude towards school.
Therefore, in the case of the Horgești School, the outcomes at the level of the parents were partially fulfilled.
Thus, the outcomes in the ToC regarding the parent component - parental skills and increasing the interaction
between families and schools - were achieved to a small extent.
Like the effects produced on the child and in the case of the parents, they are influenced by the ethnic nature.
According to the director, parents have a wrong perception of education, and this perception is specific to
Roma parents.
241
EQ 6. Does the model contribute to the capacity development of the schools?
1. Effects at the level of school management
• 1.1. Improved institutional development plans
• 1.2. Headmasters participating to training (management and diversity)
• 1.3. The level of training quality
• 1.4. The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
• 1.5. Number of schools applying for and implementing mini-grants
• 1.6. Number of schools applying for and implementing other educational projects
• 1.7. Number of school mediators and counsellors / participating to training
The school manager interviewed appreciated the training helped him to improve his administrative capacity
and changed his approach to discuss with other teachers. On the other hand, the teachers mentioned that
the principal was very implicated and the school's management had been improved.
From an administrative perspective, the school manager appreciated that the trainings helped him in
elaborating the institutional development plans. The first institutional development plan of school was made
during the QIE package and several teachers participated in its realization. However, the technical support
component was less useful because no real support was provided. At the school level, two projects were
drafted, but the school did not obtain the financial support although the indications from the Technical
Assistance trainings were used.
From the perspective of improving the approach of vulnerable schoolchildren, the principal appreciated the
utility and quality of training, he has succeed in communication to other teachers about the importance of
supporting this category of schoolchildren. (The math teacher, who did not attend trainings, was persuaded
by the principal to be more rational with the schoolchildren).
2. Effects at the level of school teachers
• 2.1. Teachers participating fully/ partially, certified/per subject out of total number of teachers in
schools
• 2.2. The level of training quality
• 2.3. The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
• 2.4. Number of teachers participating in extra-curricular activities
• 2.5. Number of teachers understanding concepts such as diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination
The majority of respondents identified clear and visible effects on teachers’ didactic behaviour, after
involvement in QIE project. Participants said that through the courses their confidence increased and the
skills in the class have been improved. It was found that teachers participated in both teaching modules (by
disciplines) and transdisciplinary training (for example - training on non-discrimination).
From the perspective of transdisciplinary training, the most appreciated the training organized by the
„Agenția de Dezvoltare Comunitară Împreună” on the topic of non-discrimination. Regarding the training by
disciplines, the teachers had divided opinions, some considered that the learned methods were not useful in
class (different methods which were used by Romanian teacher). On the other hand, in the case of subjects
such as geography, the new methods stimulated schoolchildren to learn (lessons taken outside, in nature).
The teachers appreciated that through the courses they interacted with other teachers, which stimulated the
peer learning.
However, several teachers considered that the success of the intervention depends on the effects produced
on each component. Participants argued that the effect on parents and schoolchildren is the first to occur,
because education comes to grind and cannot compensate a poor environment.
242
3. Effects at the level of kindergarten teachers
• 3.1. Kindergarten teachers participating fully/ partially, certified/per subject out of total number of
kindergarten teachers
• 3.2. The level of training quality
• 3.3. The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
• 3.4. Kindergarten teachers participating in Peer Learning Activities PLA) out of total number of
kindergarten teachers
• 3.5. Extent to which training received covered new areas
• 3.6. Extent to which materials received covered new subjects/had new approaches
• 3.7. The extent to which materials were used in classrooms/were useful (no of classrooms with new
teaching materials)
• 3.8. Number of kindergartens teachers participating in extra-curricular activities
• 3.9. Number of activities carried out together with parents
Data collected for the case study did not show a significant difference between the effects at the level of
teachers and kindergarten teachers. At the level of kindergarten teachers, the main effects identified were:
• Increasing classroom skills
• Increasing self-confidence
Also, in the case of educators, the course on non-discrimination and the Joy of Learning contest were
appreciated, because of the new activities were carried out. The educators used the methods learned in class
and thus determined a degree raised of tolerance among the children (a schoolchild with autism was
integrated more easily after the children were told a story on this topic). Regarding the collaboration with
the parents, at the preschool level they were more involved and activities were carried out together with the
schoolchildren and the parents. On the other hand, in 9 years 5 educators were changed and the main cause
was the fact that the parents were not cooperative in some cases.
Moreover, it was found that there is a need for more intense participation in peer learning actions, the
educators suggested that it is important to implement an online platform (posting activities at kindergarten
level) and exchange experiences. As the consultation stakeholders shows the kindergarten from Horgești,
Sohodor, no infrastructure investments were made, so the need for space remains a problem. As the
interviewees identified, although the locality is 30 km from the city (which is not so far from the city), in the
rural area, („Many educators chose to leave because of the working conditions. "). From this perspective, the
effects on educators are reduced.
EQ 7. Which parts of the modelling project/QIE component are most and least effective? What factors
explain the success?
• 1.1. which components were highly effective and durable, which not.
• 1.2. WHY? (Number of factors affecting the effectiveness of different components).
Based on the answers provided consulted stakeholders in Horgești (in interviews and focus-groups), the
most effective activities are:
• Teacher trainings session - Transdisciplinary trainings were appreciated by all teachers, for
example trainings on Intercultural Education, Friendly School, Prevention and Combating Violence.
Also, the participants considered useful the courses on communication with schoolchildren
organized by the Institute of Educational Sciences.
• Extracurricular Activities - the most beneficial were the visits of the schoolchildren from Horgești
School to the school structure from Sohodor. Other extracurricular activities were carried out in
class and in the „Săptămâna Altfel” and as the teachers mentioned, the schoolchildren were
delighted to participate in them.
• Microgrants - There were 3 microgrants in the school, and the resources were mostly used to
purchase materials. With the help of materials purchased through microgrants, the quality of the
courses has been improved.
243
• Some of the training on improving school management - Usefulness in drafting institutional
development plans
About less effective activities:
Other effective activities were to improve school management, less the Technical Assistance component.
According to the director, the technical assistance trainings did not provide real support in drafting project
funding applications.
Moreover, as most of the participants mentioned, the parental education component was less effective, the
main cause being the lack of interest of the parents.
EQ8. Are there any unplanned outcomes worth considering for filling in capacity gaps and/or
addressing remaining bottlenecks?
There are no important unplanned outcomes. The only unplanned effect identified was an increase in
teacher confidence. Also, another effect that teachers would have wanted, although at the project level this
would have been an unexpected effect (as it is not part of the outcome category) was the strengthening of
the partnership with the local community. (City hall).
Efficiency
EQ 9. Does the modelling project use resources in the most economical/efficient manner to achieve
expected results?
• Only if evidences were collected related to activities/approaches which could have been done
simpler/faster.
No data was available on the efficiency of QIE implementation in Horgești. However, from the perspective of
efficiency in the interviews, it was mentioned that most of the financial resources were used for the purchase
of materials. These are expensive and with fewer resources the same results could not be achieved.
In the same time, some of respondents mentioned some aspects regarding some shortcomings they
encounter, not also in term of monetary, but also in term of time and materials:
• Lack of space in Sohodor kindergarten (small classrooms and the toilets problem in the school
yard)
• Lack of textbooks for some disciplines as English and Geography
• The curriculum has still issues flexibility
EQ 10. What is the value added (in terms of financial value) of the modelling project? –
• Have QIE generated more projects and/or fund raised in the schools?
Even the school manager shows commitment to search additional financial aid and adequate fundraising for
supporting different initiatives, he have not succeed in until now (The school lost two Erasmus projects). But
in term of founds and sustainability, the town hall finances schoolchild visits between schools (Horgești -
Sohodor), which have been funded within micro-grants.
Sustainability
EQ 12 Are the interventions modelled likely to continue when external support is withdrawn?
• Continuity of employment of trained teachers and managers
• Extent to which funds are secured for the continuation of activities
• Extent to which relevant stakeholders intend to continue the intervention in a certain timeframe
• Commitment of QIE stakeholders to continue using the knowledge, approach and tools acquired
under QIE beyond the lifetime of the project
• Why not? Risks to sustainability
244
A part of the activities are likely to be sustainable in Horgești school. Through the components on which
it intervenes, the QIE Package promotes inclusive education. Regarding the Horgești school, sustainability
can be seen in terms of outcomes and continued activities.
First, regarding the effects (outcomes) of the project, the teachers mentioned that they will continue to use
the knowledge gained in the courses, as well as the materials obtained through the QIE package. Secondly,
from the perspective of continuing the activities, the teachers mentioned that they will continue the visits of
the schoolchildren between schools, with the financial support of the city hall.
Participants did not deepen the topic on the sustainability of the project, however it was found that
sustainability depends on the partnership with the local community. The town hall is one of the main
institutions that can finance the activities at the school level, at present there is no good collaboration
between the school and the city hall.
EQ 14. What are the lessons learned at each level of intervention that should be considered for
implementation and further replication of the modelling project?
• The focus here is the replication of the project (not the continuation) – what needs to be done in
orther for the same project to be implemented in other localities/counties? Other
measures/modification of the project as it is right now.
The case study shows that replication in other areas would be beneficial for an inclusive education, given the
holistic approach of the intervention. Moreover, teachers appreciated that the teaching style could be
standardized at the level of several schools and the stereotypes related to rural education would be
eliminated.
Participants suggested some aspects that could be taken into account in the context of which the project
would be replicated:
• Initiation of an online platform for preschoolchildren
• Increased emphasis on training aimed at communicating with the schoolchild
• Improving the technical assistance component
• Incentives for good schoolchildren (not just vulnerable ones)
Impact
EQ 16. What change did the modelling project determine or influence at the level of beneficiaries
(children and their families), communities, professionals, public administration – at local, county
and/or national level?
1. Impact on all schoolchildren in schools
1.4. Perception on formally recording absences
1.5. Perception of children on school attractiveness
QIE generated overall a better learning environment in Horgești school and therefore increased school
attractiveness trough the new activities (new teach approach used by teachers or extraccuricular activities).
Participants in the focus group and interviews mentioned that the schoolchildren were very pleased with
the activities they participated in, and the relationship between teacher and schoolchild have been improved.
Schoolchildren have become more receptive than before.
In the data collection process, several structural elements were identified that affect the impact on
schoolchildren. First of all, the dropout rate at school level depends very much on the phenomenon of
migration. The director mentioned that there were also periods when the dropout rate decreased, but
migration destabilized the balance. Second, the support received from the church, many families are
Pentecostal, and the practice of helping each other makes schoolchildren no longer understand the benefits
of school.
245
Another factor that influences the impact on schoolchildren is the influence from the family. The project
intervened through parental education at the family level, but this component did not have the desired
outcome.
2. Impact on schoolchildren at high risk of drop out
2.1. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project with improved school
attendance
2.2 Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who abandoned school
2.3. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who repeated the school year
2.4. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who have better school
results
According to the data collected schoolchildren at high risk of drop out are from Roma community. There is
no visible impact on school attendance or drop out, but according to any teacher school result (grades) have
been slightly improved. Case study didn’t show a focus or monitoring system implemented in the school to
track the situation of children at risk. However the principal mentioned that the school have a list with
vulnerable children through AURORA platform (the platform is managed by the social services at the city
hall level), but the interviewees did not identify its utility.
3. Impact on all children in early education
3.1. % of pre-schoolchildren with improved kindergarten attendance (by age groups)
The case study shows that at the preschool level the dropout rate is insignificant, with about 60% of children
enrolled in kindergarten. This may be due to the higher degree of parental involvement, compared to the
involvement of parents at the gymnasium level. As the educators appreciated, the tolerance of the children
increased, and they were delighted with the new activities carried out in the classroom. Moreover, the
kindergarten has become a friendlier place.
4. Impact on school management and school
4.1. Schools participating in the programme are more child-friendly (dimensions developed in survey)
4.2. Number of cases in which local authorities become involved in solving problemes encountered by schools
4.3. The extent to which knowledge gained during training was shared with other teachers.
4.4. The number cases in which the school director assisted teachers in class.
The QIE Package has had a major impact on school management. From this perspective, the principal
appreciated that through the courses he has improved his administrative capacity and has learned how to
manage the difficult situations that may arise at school level. It was also found that there was a transfer of
knowledge from the director to the other teachers, and the cooperation process was accentuated.
Focus group participants appreciated the director has continued be involved in school activities. The
principal's initiative to attract forms of funding for the school was also appreciated. On the other hand, the
interviewees said that the improvements at school level are visible, currently there are several endowments
made with the help of micro-grants. However, the Sohodor structure still faces infrastructure problems.
From the perspective of the partnership, there is no good communication with the city hall or social services,
there were activities for schoolchildren, organized separately from the school. However, teachers believe
that closer collaboration with the community is needed to promote the educational act. The town hall
manages the social aids and from this perspective it can also influence the educational act.
246
5. Impact on teachers
5.1. Number of teachers using diversity materials in classroom
5.2. Number of teachers using/extent to which teachers use adapted curriculum to various needs of children
at risk
5.3. Number of teachers using/extent to which teachers use new learning activities and new learning
contexts.
5.3. Turnover of teachers
Through the QIE Package, teachers have improved their classroom skills and mode of communication with
schoolchildren. They changed their approach to the classroom and used the materials obtained through the
QIE package. The teachers carried out various activities in the classroom through which they managed to get
closer to the schoolchildren.
Opinions on the methods of approaching some lessons were divided, some teachers considered that the
methods were useful, others not. (The Romanian teacher considered that learning the Romanian language
by using different practical methods did not have a beneficial effect). Case study shows that the biggest
impact on teachers was increasing the tolerance among teachers and influence schoolchildren to have the
same attitude.
6. Impact on early education teachers
6.1 % of early education teachers who diversified the activities undertaken with the children
6.2. % of early education teachers who introduced innovative approaches in their activities with children
The impact in the case of early teachers education was not very different from the impact on the other
teachers. Thus, educators felt that they have improved their classroom approach and gained more
confidence. Various activities with children were also carried out and materials obtained through UNICEF
were used.
The case study shows that early education teachers need more visibility and attention, both at the central
level of the school and from the local community. There is also a constant need for ideas for different
activities with children.
7. Impact on family/parents
7.1. Number of parents with improved attitude as regards the benefits of education.
7.2. Number of parents with improved attitude as regards the benefits of parental education.
7.3. Number of parents with improved relationship with their children
According to focus groups and interviews, the intervention component on parents had a partial impact. Only
in some cases, after the parental education sessions, some parents improved their relationship with the
child.
The case study shows that at the preschool level the degree of parental involvement is higher than in the
middle school level, where only certain parents are more involved, as mentioned by a teacher – „The parents
of good schoolchildren are also involved”.
247
Conclusions
Overall, QIE package has been relevant and effective in Horgești. First of all, in the community from Horgești
there are a series of needs to which the project responded:
• The need to integrate vulnerable children (especially Roma)
• Basic material need
• The need to stimulate parental interest
Although the project had a holistic approach, there were several factors that influenced the results, these are
culture, migration and continuous lack of interest of parents.
In general, the success of the package consisted of:
• Strengthen the school's management capacity
• New approaches and teaching methods
• Improve teachers' skills
• Motivate schoolchildren and improving skills – (just in some cases)
• Encourage diversity among schoolchildren
Parental education was less effective, parents were not interested, participation in parental education
sessions decreased from one session to another. The case study showed that at the preschool level both
parents and children are much more involved than at the gymnasium level, so interest decreases with age.
In conclusion, ensuring the sustainability of the project is very important for maintaining the results. It was
found that schoolchildren in Horgești can be influenced by many factors and can leave school early, so to
continue the activities at the schoolchild level becomes a necessity.
Case study 3
School, town/city
Introduction
General data about the town the school is located in
Târgu Ocna (“salt town”) is a town located in the southwest of in Bacău Country, on the bank of Trotuș river.
It is crossed by the national road DN12A, which connects Onești with Miercurea-Ciuc.
According to the 2011 census, the population of Târgu Ocna amounts to 11.300 inhabitants, down from the
previous census in 2002, when 13.576 inhabitants were registered. The majority of the inhabitants are
Romanians ethnics (90.99%), with a minority of Roma ethnic population (1.47%). For 7.18% of the
population, ethnicity is unknown. From a confessional point of view, the majority of the inhabitants are
Orthodox (82.72%), with a minority of Roman Catholics (8.29%). For 7.26% of the population, the
confessional affiliation is not known (population census, 2011).
Public school number 2, Târgu Ocna, Bacău county (Școala Gimnazială nr.2 Târgu Ocna) is situated on
number 3, Oituz street, in the central area of the locality. The center of the town where school is located
represents an urban environment, which enjoys an advantage over the other town’s neighborhoods because
of its patrimonial attractions, administrative and services, polarizing capacity and complete urban utilities
(Bănică, 2010, page 342). This particular area of Târgu Ocna city is predominantly residential (over 80% of
the buildings are designed for habitation). In the same time, it is the area of maximum functional diversity,
where over 50% from the total number of employees work (idem).
Despite facing diverse administrative and structural dysfunctionalities (unreliable utilities, intense traffic,
insufficient green areas), the central area of Târgu Ocna registers a higher score at community sustainable
urban development indicators (as those identified by Niţulescu, 2000), comparative with other places
nearby, like Oneşti or Moineşti.
248
General administrative data about the school
School number 2 Târgu Ocna is an educational institution with legal personality (SIRIUS cod 343115);
starting with 2010-2011 school year, it coordinates the following satellites units:
- School number 2, Târgu Ocna,
- Kindergarten number 4, Târgu Ocna,
- “Floare de colţ” Kindergarten, Târgu Ocna,
- Kindergarten number 3, Târgu Ocna,
- Kindergarten number 3 bis, Târgu Ocna.
As a consequence, the school currently administrates 8 buildings (own building and those belonging to
satellite structures).
Accordingly to data in SIIR, 92 kindergarten children Number of schoolchildren with SEN
and 493 school schoolchildren attend the school and
its structures (377 in coordinating unit, school Level Number
number 2, in 2015/2016 school year).

- 8% - at least 1 parent graduated lower education
- 45.55% - at least 1 parent graduated high school
- 45.72 - at least 1 parent graduated higher education
No child travels to school more than 1 hour to school.
Instruments used for the case study
The present study case is an exploratory approach, aiming to capture in depth the change mechanisms
specific to QIE project implementation at institutional level, to describe their relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency, their impact and the prospects for sustainable further developments. It is based on collection of
data from School number 2, Târgu Ocna, gathered using a mix of research methods, in line with the
denominators inserted in the evaluation matrix (interviews with principal, teachers, school counselor,
parental educator, focus groups with schoolchildren, parents, teachers). Relevant information from annual
school assessment report and strategic school development plan were added, in order to contextualize the
study case. For more details, see Annex 4.
249
Relevance
EQ 1. Are the activities and outputs of the modelling project consistent with the overall goal and its
objectives?
The interviewed representatives of the learning community from Târgu Ocna number 2 School (principal,
teachers, parents, and counselor) pointed out that activities have been implemented for each of the
envisaged objectives of QIE package. Additionally, they identified and described different development
needs they had, underling that these necessities received a proper support from UNICEF intervention they
were involved in.
The principal described two main directions of institutional development that school needed support in:
- increasing collaboration with different stakeholders
- being more focused on promoting inclusive educational approaches (”We thought about what the team
can do for all the schoolchildren, because each child had his own problems. We realized that we lack the
school culture oriented towards this approach”, principal declaration).
Teachers were talking mainly about their willingness of improving their abilities, their desire of learning
new approaches, more creatives ones, which can keep schoolchildren engaged; in addition to their need of
adding a modern touch to their didactic approach, teachers wanted to be more skillful in properly manage
the diversity of learners, to address their specificity and propose personalized leaning paths for all the
schoolchildren. They clearly expressed such self-perceived development needs during the interviews and
focus group discussions: ”I need to be able to implement new things in the classroom, to support children
through more relaxing, more attractive, more diverse and better thought out activities”. ”I wanted to improve
the way we work in class and to make children more interested in the educational act”, ”I need to know how
to design individualized learning activities” (teachers declarations).
Their schoolchildren talked as well about a desired creative learning environment, about the necessity to
have more extracurricular activities (cooking, sewing), about summers schools and the need to participate
in volunteering initiatives. They explained properly different concepts specific to inclusive education, but
they did not expressed a specific need to approach more consistently one or another aspect or to interact
more with a higher degree of diversity of peers.
Overall, QIE’s proposed and implemented activities, as well as the outputs produced, were considered
relevant for addressing such identified needs. All respondents articulated such clear connections between
activities offered by QIE and the school’s goals or needs. This was a commonly reported declaration,
expressed in different registers: "The project responded to the needs of the school; we really needed that
our community became closer to the school, that parents to be more open; we needed to have an improved
relationship between school and family…” (teacher interview).
Additional activities needed, as identified by the school community members consulted are:
- Trainings for teachers for becoming digital savvy in order to efficiently develop remote education
programs;
- Additional support for teachers dealing both with low achiever and high performance
schoolchildren.
In the same time, principal underlined the need for a more tailor made approach from QIE intervention. As
different institutions have different challenges to overcome, the principal pointed out that QIE provided a
uniform offer, no matter the specificity of the school. ”The offer was the same for all schools. For our school,
emotional/psychological support would have been needed, especially for the schoolchildren participating in
school academic competitions (”olimpiade”) and for the teachers who support them for achieving the
performance. We have tried to reduce the discrepancies between schoolchildren with high performance and
those with poorer performance and it would be useful to have a course to help teachers manage these
challenges” (Principal).
250
EQ 3. To what extent is the modelling project relevant to national policies and programmes and cross-
sectoral strategies?
QIE activities were considered compatible to any type of intervention aiming to promote inclusive and high
qualitative practices within schools. The issue was mainly highlighted in school principal and teachers’
opinions, where they underlined the specificity of the activities planned and carried out within the
framework of project, their relevance to the proposed targets. Other respondents did not clearly approached
this issue, being not able position themselves in relation with the concordance between intervention
objectives and activities.
In the same time, some of the respondents considered QIE project consistent enough to be applied in any
other educational settings, similar to their school. More, than that, favorable opinions were express for
supporting project dissemination and its country wide implementation (”These politics as those
implemented in our school, should be transferred in the national policy” - school principal’ declaration).
No significant examples were described, identifying projects complementary to QIE interventions,
previously developed by school team. More than that, several confusions were made between different
initiatives, mainly between those initiated by UNICEF (QIE and Minimal Services Package). Some
respondents were not able to discriminate between actions proposed within QIE and other projects, putting
the interviewer in the position to describe briefly the specific actions which were supposed to be discussed
(for example, the trainings developed by Step by Step Centre in kindergartens in another project of the
organization – Romania grows along with you – were mistakenly considered part of QIE intervention).
EQ 4. Are all processes based on a child/human rights approach? Are any age and gender issues
considered in providing the services?
The majority of the respondents considered that QIE activities can support the development of inclusive and
qualitative learning environment due to their potential of promoting child/human rights within the school.
Interviewed teachers and parents declare that the initiative respects schoolchildren’ diversity; however,
they were not able to identify concrete examples of adaptation of the approach to particular needs of
different groups addressed. No specific personalized intervention was identified in relation to gender or age
specific.
In regard with the possible adaptation of QIE intervention to the needs of children with different ethnic and
cultural backgrounds, respondents offered mixed perceptions. A great number of the teachers underlined
their openness and willingness to respect cultural diversity; they frequently pointed out their beliefs about
necessity of building an inclusive school, as being their educational goal. Although, when asked for concrete
details, two respondents declared: ”we do not make differences between children”,” we treat all the same”
(teacher declarations), describing approaches favorable to equal treatments of children but not sufficient
personalized for building equitable ones, focused on different educational treatments.
Effectiveness
EQ 5. Did the interventions of the modelling project/QIE address the needs identified at the level of the
most vulnerable children and families? Are any age and gender issues considered in providing the
services?
1. Effects at the level of children
251
Teachers, parents and school principal described several visible effects recent years of schooling had on
children. Schoolchildren themselves declared that they participated in different activities under QIE
umbrella, considered beneficial for their development:
- developing common projects with other institutions, for instance, special school from Pașcani (they got
new friends there, communicate, did projects together);
- visiting other institutions, like a School of Căiuți, Bacău county, like the private school from Cluj County
(Transilvania College); during such activities, they were able to compare the educational offer received
by different schoolchildren, to catch ideas for organizing their learning environment more creatively.
Some of the schoolchildren did benefit personally from the exchange, as they received a scholarship for
attending the above mentioned private high school for the next coming years;
- participating in different creative classes, like, for instance, Romanian language one, when they
improved their public speaking abilities.
2. Effects at the level of vulnerable children (schoolchildren at high risk of drop out)
Regarding the effects QIE’s capacity of addressing the needs identified at the level of the most vulnerable
children and families, a significant comment has to be stated. Unlike other schools from Bacău county, school
number 2 Târgu Ocna is situated in an economically depressed area, but it is not one of the neediest
institutions, with a significant number of at risk schoolchildren (”No schoolchild in my class abandoned
school, I have not a single drop out case” – teacher declaration). And, significant enough, it is not part of the
cohort of the persistently lowest-achieving schools. Accordingly to School Development Plan, taking as a
criteria the admission mark of schoolchildren when graduation 8th class, school was, in 2014, the 14th
institution out of 164 schools from Bacău county. Therefore, the initiatives proposed by QIE are not really
reaching neediest schoolchildren in the community (whom are mainly enrolled in satellite school number
3).
As different respondents pointed, comparative to school number 2 Târgu Ocna, the neighboring institution,
School number 3 is considered to have more schoolchildren with a higher probability of failing academically
or dropping out of school. ”There are about 200 schoolchildren at risk in our cluster: about 50 schoolchildren
in the central school and the rest of them learning in satellite unit, school number 3” (School counsellor
declaration).
One respondent pointed clear that an infusion of resources in the neighbouring low-performing school
number 3 could have been more beneficial. ”There is a structure of School No.2 (School No.3), where there
are many children with problems […]; there are about 100 children with problems, and some of them have
been integrated into the collective” (teacher declaration). ”In School No. 2 there are not many cases of school
dropout or absenteeism. School No. 3 needs new furniture for children, blackboards, video projectors”
(interview, teacher).
However, even it is not facing the same challenges as the satellite unit, school number 2 has several
schoolchildren coming from a low economic background families. Their situation was described by the
school counsellor, who used a set of questionnaires addressed to parents regarding their financial stability
level: ”We learned a lot about the situation of children from vulnerable families from these forms. We also
talked to parents who were open about their financial situation and the issues they face”. Following the
identification phase, the intervention included personalized plans or addressing vulnerable children needs.
” We carry out activities aimed at developing self-confidence and support for overcome poverty issues; first
these children participated in individual counselling sessions, then in group counselling with other
colleagues who face the same difficulties” (school counsellor).
3. Effects at the level of parents
A high contribution to parents achievements within QIE seem to be the cumulative effect of parenting
training (as those organized, for instance, at Vatra Dornei) and parents’ counselling activities.
252
The interviews and focus groups conducted illustrated that several training sessions with parents have taken
place; Holtis evidences also confirms that the trainings took place, involving 11 parental educators, 44
groups of parents, 324 meetings between parental educators and parents, 475 parents involved, 63 support
meetings and 86 teachers.
They were considered highly efficient, helping parents to connect, know each other; they also got ideas how
to be more encouraging of his/her education, gaining significant knowledge and skills to interact with their
children and the confidence and empathy to use these skills effectively. Discussions about concepts such as
diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination were initiated during parental education sessions as well. Some of
these trainings were attended also by Roma parents from schoolchildren enrolled in school number 3.
As a consequence, parents come more frequently to school and get more involved in academic aspects of
their children activities, as they and their children reported. Very frequent descriptions were referring to
the improved way of organizing periodical meetings with parents (ședințele cu părinții), enjoyed equally by
teachers and parents.
EQ 6. Does the model contribute to the capacity development of the schools?
As declared by the principal, participating in QIE project determined changes in school development plan
and influenced the decision making process. Additionally, school manager interviewed highly appreciated
the training quality and utility; a more confident approach of school managing process was reported, as a
consequence of the staff development programme attended.
Learning environment and visual culture of school changed after involvement in Friendly school trainings;
as a consequence, schoolchildren created posters and other objects from recyclable materials to decorate
classrooms.
2. Effects at the level of school and kindergarten teachers
The majority of respondents identified clear and visible effects on teachers’ didactic behavior, after
involvement in QIE project. Additionally, teachers themselves described – during interviews and focus group
- the benefits they had, as a consequence of their involvement in different types of activities as:
- Trainings for school teachers; there were mentioned trainings like Friendly school, Sinaia, 2018-2019
(together with the trainers, teachers build toys and musical instruments for their activities), health
education, peer learning, discrimination (organized by Agenția de dezvoltare și comunicare „Împreună”)
- Trainings for kindergarten teachers, organized in Iași or Piatra Neamț (by Step by Step Centre)
- Extracurricular activities and competitions – activity on ”What do you want to be when you grow up?
(Ce vrei să te faci când vei fi mare?), the competition ”The Joy of learning” (”Bucuria de a învăța”), study
visits in other schools, trips.
The participants were generally satisfied with the trainings that they received (especially the practical
activities) and gained benefits from their active attendance.
EQ 7. Which parts of the modelling project/QIE component are most and least effective? What factors
explain the success?
Gathering these effects in a comprehensive overview, it is clear that different components of QIE
intervention were assessed differently by the respondents; among them, exchanges/study visits, trainings
(for parents and teachers) and microgrants seem to be highly appreciated, mostly known and considered
beneficial to the community of school number 2, Târgu Ocna. Below, there are some opinions of the
respondents regarding the effectiveness of different QIE components:
- Micro-grants: very useful for supporting different activities (e.g. peer learning support) and
consolidating school infrastructure;
253
- Exchanges and field visits: they were carried out for only 2 years, but, as principal declared, ”it was one
of the best initiatives with the role of showing schoolchildren that they live in a community, helping to
create a school culture”. The activity was continued outside the project, so that every year about 3 other
schools are visited. Schoolchildren participated in classes and interacted with other schoolchildren,
performing various activities, and teachers interacted with other teachers (collaborative activities, such
as joint math competitions);
- Project technical assistance: useful for supporting different projects applications
- The contest "Joy of learning" was considered interesting, many teachers participated and won prizes;
- Teacher training sessions: they were beneficial because the teachers were taken out of school and
challenged to get out of their comfort zone; trainings focused on non-formal education activities were
considered to have a significant impact; training for pre-school teachers were considered useful as well;
- Parental education (generating a better parent-child relationship, visible in school): 200 parents have
participated since the project started. The great dissatisfaction expressed by the parental educator was
”that we failed to bring many parents from the vulnerable area, but many parents who were interested
in parenting participated”.
EQ8. Are there any unplanned outcomes worth considering for filling in capacity gaps and/or
addressing remaining bottlenecks?
No significant unplanned outcomes were mentioned as solutions for filling in capacity gaps and/or
addressing remaining bottlenecks.
One frustration was expressed by two of the interview teachers, regarding the fact that they did not received
any documents to certify their involvement in different activities (”I participated to the ”The Joy of learning”
competition, but I did not get any record”, ”I attended friendly school training, I finalized the course, I had
some difficulties to upload the homework on the platform, due to its malfunction. I did not receive a
certificate and was not able to get the associated credits for this activity”).
Efficiency
EQ 9. Does the modelling project use resources in the most economical/efficient manner to achieve
expected results?
No consistent and informative answers could be recorded regarding the efficiency of resources utilization,
especially in relation with the balance between costs and activities implementation and possible achieved
results. There have not been identified high efficiency solutions, nor suggestions ensuring a greater
efficiency with a lower input.
The majority of respondents claim that the necessary resources were mainly available, adequate to support
their short term goals. As an example, it was presented the trip organized in Brasov (where children visit the
oldest Romanian school and the zoo), which was a proof of efficient utilization of resources for the profit of
schoolchildren.
Other resources provided were considered useful: books for teachers and schoolchildren (the story booklets
designed by Agentia Împreună, guidelines for kindergarten team - Repere fundamentale în dezvoltarea
copiilor de la naștere până la 7 ani – a tablet for the school counsellor, useful for working with schoolchildren.
Micro-grants were useful for funding school journal, purchasing books for the Reading Club, financing the
development of infrastructure (internet access).
In the same time, some of respondents reiterated some aspects regarding some shortcomings they
encounter, not only regarding to monetary value but also in terms of time and personnel. Thus, they are
talking about:
- an overburdening curriculum and insufficient time for dealing with all the children in the classroom and
for customization to specific learning needs;
254
- lack of space in school number 2 (that is why a reorganizing of space is planned for the near future,
taking into account the learning facilities of school number 3, which is not so overcrowded as the central
institution);
- lack of modular furniture for facilitating interactions and cooperative learning activites;
- an overworked school counselor, serving two schools, number 2 and 1 (1 counselor for 1000
schoolchildren);
- lack of the school mediator: the most underlined vulnerability identified relates to the school mediator
(who is not part of their team anymore).
EQ 10. What is the value added (in terms of financial value) of the modelling project?
Even the school manager shows commitment to search additional financial aid and adequate fundraising
for supporting different initiatives, not many of them proved to be successful. As head master declared,
school team initiated some applications for funds, but ”not too many”.
Sustainability (approx 1 page)
EQ 12 Are the interventions modelled likely to continue when external support is withdrawn?
School number 2 Târgu Ocna seems to have a consistent level of organizational capacity, which appears to
show strong prospects for sustainability of QIE interventions. Most of the teachers, as well the school
manager, are local, dedicated to the institutional proposed targets. Equally important, school team is
confident that local support and partnership are functional and that will be continued in the near future as
well.
Also, the activities developed under QIE umbrella managed to create an environment that is welcoming to
promote inclusive qualitative approaches in education, therefore, most of the activities related to consolidate
learning culture and environment are likely to be sustainable. A large number of teachers and parents
interviewed expressed confidence that their school has the will to sustain and build upon their
improvements.
However, mixed prospects for sustainability can be predicated in relation to the attention given to the low
achievers and to schoolchildren coming from economically challenged communities; their educational needs
are expressed in a more subtle and discrete manner, the number of these schoolchildren is smaller
comparative with their academic-oriented peers, and, therefore, they can be overlooked by teachers focused
more on performance and competitions.
School manager is also confident that the school is on a path of improvement that will continue beyond the
course of the temporary infusion of UNICEF funds; principal admits that a lot of support came from micro-
grants, but she is confident that additional solutions can be found for continuing the activity. ”We will be able
to finance the projects even after their funding will be limited: the school journal will be accessible online,
the visit of other schools will be supported by parents and community. From the school's point of view,
accessing micro-grants is a future goal”.
As a clear official statement on the intention of continuing the project beyond UNICEF financing and technical
support, an example from the school development plan can be added. As declared by the principal,
participating in QIE project determined changes in institutional development plan. Thus, the second
strategic target from the plan is focused on ”assuring the equal access to education and promoting quality
through teacher trainings and involvement in different further projects”. One strategical option derived from
this target is expressed as following: ”to involve the school in projects that have as purpose the added value
of training of teachers (continuation of BaCuLit project, opening of JOBS and UNICEF projects)”.
EQ 14. What are the lessons learned at each level of intervention that should be considered for
implementation and further replication of the modelling project?
255
During the interviews and focus groups, the respondents claimed their readiness to continue using the
knowledge, approach and tools acquired under QIE beyond the lifetime of the project. So, it is feasible that
QIE components can be replicated following the initial design and structure provided by UNICEF and
partners. Therefore, a school with a similar profile and degree of institutional maturity can replicate the
intervention in a different environment, using lessons learnt from Târgu Ocna school:
- For promoting equal chances for all the children, a robust partnership can be developed with local
community. Schoolchild vulnerabilities are to be addressed also through the educational potential of
community, as children’ education requires more than school’ improvement (as an individual
institution); it is necessary to involve the community as a whole and to stimulate initiatives and active
participation of all community members,
- A comprehensive/integrative model of intervention has to replicated, as different component are
interrelated and influence each other potential of success,
- A special focus has to be placed on parents’ involvement as that any strategy of promoting quality
inclusive education should be participative and widely supported by parents.
Impact
EQ 16. What change did the modelling project determine or influence at the level of beneficiaries
(children and their families), communities, professionals, public administration – at local, county
and/or national level?
1. Impact on all schoolchildren in schools
Under QIE intervention, school became a more welcoming environment; modern methods, a more friendly
looking learning space, non-formal activities made teachers, schoolchildren and their parents more
interested in building relevant learning experiences in their school.
Schoolchildren perceive the school as being more attractive, as there are more extracurricular activities and
more creativity. Additionally, during focus group, schoolchildren talked about their improved ability to
communicate, socialize and connect (they described an increased number of the connections schoolchildren
had with the school and the surrounding community). The improved self-esteem of schoolchildren was also
pointed out. Beside this intensified engagement process, some academic achievements were described as
being visible effects on schoolchildren’ performance: in their teachers view, schoolchildren seem to be ”more
focused in school, have a higher level of self-regulated learning” (teachers focus group).
Regarding the perception of formally recording absences, all the respondents declared that the absences are
registered in school documents. As the principal declared (confirmed by school records), the number of
absences of schoolchildren was not very high even before the implementation of QIE (average of 6 absences
/ child in a year).
2. Impact on schoolchildren at high risk of drop out
As it was mention previously, Târgu Ocna school was not facing important risks related to the education of
children with vulnerabilities; the dropout rate was not highly alarming even before the implementation of
QIE. As one of the teachers states, there were not many schoolchildren with this problem (drop out school)
in school, but the impact of the project is clear and visible in other aspects: collaboration between
schoolchildren, the perception of lessons as more attractive, a greater degree of creativity changed
schoolchildren' attitudes towards school (teacher focus group).
School dropouts had a rate of 0.2% before the project, it increased to 2% shortly after that, because several
schoolchildren who did not previously attended school regularly decided to get enrolled (26 children were
brought to school, 2 of them already have finished high school and 12 children are still in primary school).
After this raise, the dropout rate is now at 0.8% (principal declaration).
256
3. Impact on all children in early education
There is no perceived impact on kindergarten attendance in Târgu Ocna. The kindergarten had a certain
level of attractiveness even before QIE intervention and the attendance is significant high.
4. Impact on school management and school
As the school principal stated clearly, the model contributed to the capacity development of the schools. The
institution organizational capacity, its ability to ”fine tune” its interventions were – accordingly to
management perspective – clearly stimulated by the participation in QIE project. It was a ”change of vision”,
as school principal declared.
The main contributions of participating in QIE intervention were identified as being the following:
- A more focused orientation towards inclusive education, low achievers, schoolchildren in risk situations,
focus which was missing previous QIE. ”The UNICEF project began when the school really needed a
change, during the 175th anniversary of the school's founding. The school has performances
(schoolchildren with 10 at admission exams, wining different competitions, etc.), but I discovered that
there are many communities of children in risk situations”. ”We noticed that "inclusive education" is a
concept that is not, in fact, understood by all people” (principal interview).
- An improved capacity of working collaboratively, an intensified preoccupation to develop solid
partnerships with local community (target included in also in the strategic planning documents of
school)
”In the first 4 years, the UNICEF project was central and the most important (it addressed children from
kindergarten to 8th grade). In addition to training for teachers, the project made us work together, not
only within the school, but also locally and regionally, through the networks of schools that have been
formed. We understood that we are part of a community and we found a voice, so now the School
Development Plan is focused more on the community. The fact that we collaborated with the local
administration, that we collaborated with the Social Service, that all the guides from UNICEF and from
the partners came with requests that had to be fulfilled by the mayor's office, all these improved the
cooperation at community level.” ”The project brought us a very important partner that we relied on
and continue to rely on, namely the Social Service, which was one of the first partners in changing and
addressing inclusive education. (School principal).”
5. Impact on teachers
After being involved in QIE initiatives, teachers felt more confident to implement changes in their
school/classroom, to introduce more practical activities (”use more frequent the microscope”, as one teacher
declared), to design their own materials. Teachers became more focused on schoolchildren needs, they also
learned to listen to schoolchildren, to ”let them ask why” (teacher interview). They also appreciated the
materials they received (for example the story books from Agenția Împreună, used in role-playing games
and different activities) (interview preschool teacher).
Overall, teachers reported a consistent self-perceived improvement of educational practices over the life of
the project. They still need more support on dealing with schoolchildren with special needs and a more
developed awareness on engagement and retention for at-risk schoolchildren.
6. Impact on early education teachers
As in case of school teachers, QIE brought improvements in kindergarten teachers approaches, mostly
regarding their preoccupation of designing educational aids and including different materials – toys, stories
257
- in their everyday routine. No significant paradigm shifts have been identified in their concern about
promoting inclusiveness in education.
The preschool education teacher interviewed also reported that her colleagues used the materials received
for preparing the exams they faced in their career (examenul de gradul II).
7. Impact on family/parents
The most frequent effects mentioned in this respect were the following:
- increased parents’ involvement and connectedness with the school;
- an improved relationship parents have with their children;
- parental involvement in in strengthening child’s educational achievement, in academic support of
the schoolchildren (”I ask my child about her grades often”, parent declaration).
Such effects were summarized by the parental educator interviewed as following: ”There was an
improvement in the relationship between parents and their children: parents changed their attitude towards
children, realized that they should be involved in family life and affairs, parents no longer imposed excessive
interdictions and began to communicate more with children, so that schoolchildren became more open to
their parents and came to school with more love and more openness. The child immediately feels the changes
in the relationship with the parents and the atmosphere of calm that the parents must transmit to the
children matters a lot” (parental educator).
One aspect to be underlined regarding parental education sessions and counseling, it was the fact that they
were attended mainly by parents of children who were not facing significant disadvantages and were not at
risk schoolchildren. Few parents of high-absence schoolchildren, few Roma parents were involved, mainly
from school number 3. In their care, clear improvements have been noticed, from more intense
preoccupation about academic life of their children, to overcoming their shyness in approaching delicate
educational issues.
Conclusions
258
Overall, QIE initiative has been effective in stimulating improvement in school number 2 Târgu Ocna
community, in setting the scene for facilitating provision of effective education for all children, in partnership
with local community. Some additional conclusions can be added to this overview statement:
- Since Târgu Ocna School is not an institution with a significant number of at risk schoolchildren, some
of the QIE activities targeting directly the disadvantaged or low achievement environments appeared
to be unrelated to the school’s performance goals, improvement plans, or needs. In this regard, QIE was
not a tailor made approach, responding to the particular needs of one school or another. However, the
Targu Ocna school team approached QIE input with a maturity of one stable organization, who
participated in all activities and picked up the inputs which were fitting their interests (as those
supporting collaboration inside and outside institution, or innovative teaching methodologies etc). In
other words, it was not QIE intervention adapting to institutional needs; school itself integrated the
external support in their internal development program, due to a higher level of organizational
capacity;
- QIE process of implementation in Târgu Ocna School was beneficial for all the children, not only for low
attaining, disengaged ones or those coming from economically challenged families. When QIE reached
some staff or parents from neighboring school number 3, and included them in the activities, more at
risk schoolchildren were, indirectly targeted. In this respect, a more inclusive approach with other
units from the cluster coordinated by school number 3 can be recommended;
- Due to QIE intervention, an improved flexibility and responsiveness to individual needs of all
schoolchildren was declared, including those with vulnerabilities of different ethnic background. In
fact, the openness for inclusivity and respect for diversity was a significant progress reported.
However, a superficial understanding of the concept of equity was noticed in several declarations, some
educators considering that equal and similar treatment of schoolchildren is a reasonable enough
approach for managing their diversity, ignoring the necessity of providing them with personalized
tools they specifically need to thrive and achieve their full potential;
- QIE generated a more cohesive community, an increased preoccupation for educational improvement,
a better relationship of teachers, schoolchildren, parents. However, some activities were attended by
the usually interested beneficiaries, not by the ones who are frequently reluctant to get involved; for
instance, in parental trainings the majority of the participants were the mothers (and even in the focus
group with parents, the discussion included only female respondents);
- School teams believes that they were able to lay a foundation for improvement that can be sustained
well beyond the course of the external initiated intervention. The arguments for predicting sustainable
further developments are multiple: a strong managerial competence, a strategic planning that includes
inclusiveness and qualitative approaches in education, high number of qualified and skillful teachers, a
supporting community, a good collaboration with local authorities and services;
- Some of the participants in discussion from interviews and focus groups mixed inputs from different
projects, confusing one intervention with another, others did now know anything about some
components of QIE package. But, even their level of knowledge about QIE was different, as well as their
involvement, the respondents from Târgu Ocna school proved that different interventions proposed by
QIE was adapted to school specific and integrated naturally in the learning culture of the institution.
Thus, QIE became a part not only of the school development plan, but also of every day learning
environment.

Case study 4
School, town/city
Introduction
General data about the commune/community/town/city the school is located in.
Zemeș is a commune in Bacău County. It is composed of two villages, Bolătău and Zemeș. The commune is
located north of the municipality of Moinești, with which it borders. Based, in the past, on petrol industry,
the community has been affected by the decline of the industrial activity, increasing poverty rate and
emigration raised in this context, as underlined by the local public authorities interviewed.
According to the 2011 census, the population of Zemeș commune amounts to 4,368 inhabitants, down from
the previous census in 2002, when 5,248 inhabitants were registered. The declining school population also
indicates a possible general demographic decline.
The commune is ethnically homogeneous, without significant minorities. According to the census, over 95%
of the population is made up of Romanian ethnics, while for over 4% of the inhabitants of the commune the
ethnicity is unknown.
The commune is present online with website and Facebook page and the commune administration is guided
by a local development strategy, developed in 2014, for a period of 7 years: 2014-2020 (the strategy was
developed within the "Assistance in developing local development strategies for five Petrom communities").
Since November 2019, the Zemes School benefits of European funding (ROP) for rehabilitation. All these
elements indicate interest from the local public administration for the community development and the
school.
General administrative data about the school from SIIR and Internal evaluation reports sent to RAQPE.
Zemeș school „Ștefan cel Mare” is the only school in Zemeș, managing two structures: one in Zemeș and one
in Bolătău. The school has a kindergarden and organises classes up to the 8th grade.
According to data in SIIR, the number of schoolchildren enrolled in Zemeș school decreased with 100 from
571 in 2014-2015 to 472 in 2018-2019. The graduation rate stays constant at 94%-95% since 2015-2016,
with a higher rate – of 97.7% - in 2014-2015. The rate of passing the National Evaluation has been constant
after 2015-2016, decreasing from the previous year.

EQ 1. Are the activities and outputs of the modelling project consistent with the overall goal and its
objectives?
• Extent to which activities planned are relevant and sufficient for the objectives set
• Extent to which outputs produced are relevant and sufficient for the objectives set
• Additional activities/outputs needed
• The extent to which consulted stakeholders agree that activities and outputs were of the necessary
quality to ensure achievement of objective
Taking into account the objectives of QIE package, planned and implemented activities and outputs
generated have been sufficient in order to allow the objectives to be met. Data collected (interviews
and focus groups) show activities have been implemented for each of the envisaged objectives of QIE
package. The following table is summarising the most relevant activities and outputs, as perceived by the
school community members (the management, teachers, parents and children) consulted for the case study.

Additional activities needed, as identified by the school community members consulted are:
- Additional trainings for teachers, because the provided trainings didn’t cover all school subjects
- Additional trainings for teachers on schoolchildren counselling, as there is an important need for
children to be supported and guided when choosing and preparing for the high school
- Additional preparation for parental educators to identify the needs of the parents and, in some
cases, additional support for parental educators during activities, when dealing with difficult cases
(families with intersectional needs)
- Activities to develop teachers’ competences to use technology when teaching both in class and
online (a need identified during the COVID-19 crisis)
The main additional outputs needed, as identified by the school manager and teachers, have been the
credits/certification of the teachers’ trainings. At the beginning, trainings not providing the ‘usual’ external
motivation (related to the ‘professional folder’, credits and certificates) had not been attractive for teachers.
Consulted stakeholders agree that activities and outputs were of the necessary quality to ensure
achievement of objective. UNICEF and partners have been praised by teachers and the school manager and
they felt both theoretical input, practical support and microgrants have been very useful and contributed
together, due to their quality, to the effectiveness presented below.
EQ 3. To what extent is the modelling project relevant to national policies and programmes and cross-
sectoral strategies?
• Complementarity with other projects/interventions and challenges raised by legislation
QIE activities have been relevant for Zemeș School in the context of other interventions and relevant
for the national policies and particular initiatives implemented in the same school. On the other
hand, one of the most important characteristics making QIE particularly relevant is the ‘holistic
approach’ taking into consideration the needs of all relevant participants to education. This also favours
complementarity and synergies with other interventions.
QIE activities are in complementary with activities implemented by Terre des Hommes. According to the
school manager, competences developed due to QIE activities (especially, but not only the technical
262
assistance) allowed her to access additional funds from Terre des Hommes for school infrastructure.
Additionally, since November 2019, the Zemeș School benefits from European funding (ROP) for
rehabilitation, the need for infrastructure development being in complementary with the needs covered by
QIE for quality and inclusive education, improved competences and abilities of teachers and the school
manager, education and mobilising the parents and the community, developing new skills and the
motivation of children.
Moreover, activities in kindergarten are in complementary with activities organised by OvidiuRo in the same
institution, contributing together to the development of the institution (endowment and competences of
teachers)
Several of the consulted parties identified the holistic approach promoted by UNICEF, providing activities
and generating outputs for all members of the school community (schoolchildren/children, teachers, the
school management, parents) as an important added value of QIE, mentioning complementarity and
synergies created between activities (e.g.: the development of the manager competences is supporting
activities within the microgrants projects – with children – and activities organised with parents. The latter
two activities are supporting each other etc.). The consulted stakeholders recommended a similar holistic
approach for the national policy.
EQ 4. Are all processes based on a child/human rights approach? Are any age and gender issues
considered in providing the services?
• Existence and level of availability of adapted activities for boys and girls / childer of different ages / if
a special attention to gender was needed and for children of different ages, with different backgrounds
and from vulnerable groups, especially Roma
Age issues have been considered. Activities in microgrants and beyond have been adapted to children age
and older children had the opportunity to self-organise activities.
Zemeș is a ethnically homogeneous community and discrimination is considered a problem by none of the
consulted stakeholders. Activities promoting the diversity helped participants, including the school
manager, teachers, parents and children to be more aware of their own biases. Social exclusion (mainly due
to poverty, in Zemeș) have been considered in activities organised within microgrants and in activities
organised by children and parents in the Holtis Club.
Effectiveness (approx 4 pages)
EQ 5. Did the interventions of the modelling project/QIE address the needs identified at the level of the
most vulnerable children and families? Are any age and gender issues considered in providing the
services?
1. Effects at the level of children
• 1.2. No of new/different extracurricular activities to which schoolchildren participated
• 1.3. Pupils in participating schools understand concepts such as diversity, tolerance, discrimination
In Zemeș school, QIE supported and inspired a large number of extracurricular activities, as well as
activities using nonformal methods and games to teach the classical school subject.
The most appreciated activities are:
a) The community festival (serbare câmpenească) organised by the school. The festival allowed
children to have the initiative for several activities and has been very important in building a strong
relationship between the school and the community, actively involving children;
b) Activities of historical re-enactment linked to children history lessons
c) Outdoors lessons and experiments during biology, chemistry or physics lessons
d) The Holtis Club, an informal organisation of children and parents, organising volunteering and
charity activities (a donations campaign for Christmas, a costume ball in February, a campaign
263
promoting a healthy lifestyle in school, targeting the other schoolchildren).
As mentioned, children participated in activities organised by Agenția Împreună, and have been guided in
their activities by teachers that have been participated to activities on diversity, tolerance, discrimination.
However, all consulted stakeholders agreed that the issues are new for the children. According to the school
manager and the teachers, the lack of a „different” group in the school and the apparent homogeneity of the
community affected the perceived relevance of the issues related to diversity and discrimination in the
organised activities. Therefore, the consulted stakeholders agree there is an important progress that
children are now more aware of their own biases (learn from and perpetuated by the community and media).
2. Effects at the level of vulnerable children (schoolchildren at high risk of drop out)
• 2.2. Vulnerable children involved in extracurricular activities
• 2.3. Vulnerable children with improved self-esteem
Most of QIE activities took into account the needs of vulnerable children, but most of them didn’t
focus especially on the most vulnerable children. However, teachers and typical children got a better
understanding of their colleagues with special educational needs – SEN and learned to integrate them
in their activities in school and outside the school. Schoolchildren, parents and teachers participated
in school activities with charitable purpose, meant to support children affected by poverty. However,
these have been rather social than educational activities.
The consulted stakeholders identified poverty and dysfunctional families as the main vulnerabilities of
children in Zemeș school. According to the interviews and focus groups, a special attention has been payed,
especially by the school manager, to allow these vulnerable children to participate in activities. UNICEF
support though microgrants has been appreciated because it allowed the school to by materials for the
activities and to provide them to children. The custom of asking parents to buy, send or bring materials to
school have not been used/perpetuated. As a result, children affected by poverty didn’t faced barriers for
their participation to activities.
On the other hand, the school manager and teachers estimate this approach allowed them to earn the trust
of parents affected by poverty and to develop a better relationship with them.
On the other hand, and less positive findings are that:
- Collected data didn’t show an effort to identify other needs and vulnerabilities of the children or the
roots of the social exclusion some of them are facing;
- Activities have not been designed taking into account the needs of children with special educational
needs - SEN (the number of children with SEN in Zemeș schoo is small– from 5 to 7 in in 2014-2019).
Improved self-esteem among children has not been monitored by teachers. Teachers suppose the
extracurricular and non-formal activities helped children express better their ideas and contributed to self-
confidence and self-esteem. However, there are no data supporting this hypothesis. The focus group with
children shows they still need activities supporting their self-confidence and self-esteem.
3. Effects at the level of parents
• 3.2. Parents involved in school activities (as effect of parenting class and parents’ counselling)
• 3.3. Number of parents participating in activities promoting diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination
• 3.4. Number of parents understanding concepts such as diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination
• 3.5. Number of parents cooperating more with teachers (asking more frequently the teacher on the
child situation at school).
The improved relationship between the school and the parents have been the result of most of the
activities, including parental education, but also all the extracurricular and non-formal activities (presented
above) organised, where parents have been invited to participate and in some of them they participated
actively (especially in the community festival and the Holtis Club).
264
Moreover, in parents’ counselling trainings (and from each other, after some of them participated in these
trainings) teachers learned to improve their relationship with children. However, this effect has not been
mentioned by all the interviewed teachers.
Activities with parents, especially parental education, helped parents to be more aware of concepts
such as diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination. However, no other progress related to non-
discrimination has been reported and no special activities, with this objective, involved parents.
EQ 6. Does the model contribute to the capacity development of the schools?
1. Effects at the level of school management
• 1.1. Improved institutional development plans
• 1.2. Headmasters participating to training (management and diversity)
• 1.3. The level of training quality
• 1.4. The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
• 1.5. Number of schools applying for and implementing mini-grants
• 1.6. Number of schools applying for and implementing other educational projects
• 1.7. Number of school mediators and counsellors / participating to training
The school manager interviewed appreciated the training quality and utility and stated that the
training for managers gave her confidence and changed her approach to organising meetings with
the teachers in school, the parents and stakeholders in the community.
Trainings and practice also helped the school manager to get better in developing project ideas for the micro-
grants. Over time the focus on accessing microgrants shifted from projects ensuring teaching materials
(endowment) to non-formal activities involving schoolchildren, teachers and, sometimes, parents as well.
The school is part the EduNetwork due to the competences on project development acquired through
technical assistance. The school also submitted application form Erasmus+ funding and although the funds
have not been secured from the first attempt, the school manager shows tenacity in improving the
application and getting the funds.
On the other hand, the school counsellor has not been stable and therefore the achievements of the project
on her activity could not be well evaluated in 2020.
2. Effects at the level of school teachers
• 2.1. Teachers participating fully/ partially, certified/per subject out of total number of teachers in
schools
• 2.2. The level of training quality
• 2.3. The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
• 2.4. Number of teachers participating in extra-curricular activities
• 2.5. Number of teachers understanding concepts such as diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination
Teachers interviewed appreciated training quality and utility and a large number of teachers in the school
participated in trainings. However, at least at the beginning of the project, teachers underlined the need for
training formal certification (credits for continuous professional training). Both teachers and the school
manager underlined that, at the beginning, trainings not providing the ‘usual’ external motivation (related
to the ‘professional folder’, credits and certificates) had not been attractive for teachers.
Interviews and the focus group with teachers show that trainings dedicated to teachers have been effective
on several levels:
- Communication with children in the classroom and organising lessons on a more participatory
manner
- Communication with parents
- Communication among colleagues
265
From the point of view of the first element, trainings for teachers and activities funded by micro-grants have
been complementary, generating both classroom and extracurricular activities using new teaching methods.
From the point of view of the latter element, the element of “team building” during the trainings, as well as
visits to other schools have been very well appreciated by teachers as added values of the project, allowing
them to seek further development and new methods to teach old subjects.
3. Effects at the level of kindergarten teachers
• 3.1. Kindergarten teachers participating fully/ partially, certified/per subject out of total number of
kindergarten teachers
• 3.2. The level of training quality
• 3.3. The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
• 3.4. Kindergarten teachers participating in Peer Learning Activities PLA) out of total number of
kindergarten teachers
• 3.5. Extent to which training received covered new areas
• 3.6. Extent to which materials received covered new subjects/had new approaches
• 3.7. The extent to which materials were used in classrooms/were useful (no of classrooms with new
teaching materials)
• 3.8. Number of kindergartens teachers participating in extra-curricular activities
• 3.9. Number of activities carried out together with parents
A large proportion of the kindergarten teachers in Zemeș participated to the dedicated activities.
The case study didn’t show a difference between the appreciation of the project’s activities by school
teachers and kindergarten teachers. Activities adapted to the needs of kindergarten teachers have been
equally well received and appreciated, including information on how to organise the space and existing
teaching materials to answer best the needs of children in kindergarten. Kindergarten teachers also
appreciated the Peer Learning Activities.
EQ 7. Which parts of the modelling project/QIE component are most and least effective? What factors
explain the success?
• 1.1. which components were highly effective and durable, which not.
• 1.2. WHY? (Number of factors affecting the effectiveness of different components).
Based on the answers provided consulted stakeholders in Zemeș (in interviews and focus-groups), the most
effective activities are:
- Activities dedicated to the school management that generated a change of management style and
contributed, according to all stakeholders to the change of the organizational culture. A more
formalistic organizational culture has been replaced by an environment of dialogue. The success of
the activities dedicated to the school management has an impact on the success of all the other
activities, but first and foremost on all the activities where teachers need to communicate beyond
their pedagogical subject and the classroom: e.g. on the relationship with parents (parental
education and counseling), the extra-curricular activities and the communication with their pears
(the Peer Learning Activities).
- Parental education, that generated a sustainable dialogue between parents and school for the
benefit of the children, and made all stakeholders interviewed for the case study to identify the
improved and strengthened relationship with the school with parents as the most important result
of QIE package in Zemeș. On the other hand, parental education generated, in the view of teachers,
results in a better relationship of the parents with the teachers and the school, and less in the
relationship of the parents with their children.
- The microgrant activities, that allowed extra-curricular activities and non-formal approaches to
curricular activities and opened the dialogue between the school and the local community: parents,
authorities, younger and older children. The microgrant planned activities evolved from their initial
266
focus on getting school/teaching material and equipment for the school (in the first year), to
activities aiming at improving relationships within the school and the community (teachers-
schoolchildren-parents) and offering non-formal and in-formal learning opportunities for the
school schoolchildren. This evolution shows the success of the microgrant activities in connection
with the activities dedicated to the school management, activities targeting parents and
activities targeting teachers.
- Peer Learning Activities and visits to other schools represented a source of inspiration for
activities in the school.
The holistic approach of QIE is one of the most important factors for the success, as activities
generated results using the outcomes of other activities: the microgrants activities benefited from
better management and their success contributed to the trust building of the school manager and
teachers to try and continue similar activities.
Less evidences are available in order to assess the success of training activities for school and
kindergarten teachers. The first problematic issue was related to credits and certificates for trainings, as
presented above. The second issue was that not all subject have been covered by trainings, although most of
the teachers have participated to trainings organised by the Institute for Educational Sciences. Third, the
training activities for teachers didn’t had the same novelty as the other activities in the QIE package.
Furthermore, the activities aiming at promoting diversity have been well received in Zemeș school, but most
of the teachers consider that these activities have small relevance and effectiveness in the Zemeș.
EQ8. Are there any unplanned outcomes worth considering for filling in capacity gaps and/or
addressing remaining bottlenecks?
There are no important unplanned outcomes. The positive outcomes related to the school culture has been
mentioned as an unplanned outcome by teachers and the school manager. Several of the interviewees (the
school manager and teachers) mentioned the school as a second family for the teachers. However, we
appreciate this is part of the expected outcomes of the activities for headmasters.
Efficiency
EQ 9. Does the modelling project use resources in the most economical/efficient manner to achieve
expected results?
• Only if evidences were collected related to activities/approaches which could have been done
simpler/faster.
No data was available on the efficiency of QIE implementation in Zemeș. All interviewed teachers and the
school manager consider QIE highly efficient, with needed activities organised in time, but without the
feeling of funds shortage that is too often the rule in the budgetary management of the school. Although all
teachers underlined the importance of knowledge, trainings, new teaching methods and opened channels
for communication with parents, they also stressed the importance of having enough teaching materials and
the necessary equipment to implement the new teaching methods learned in trainings.
EQ 10. What is the value added (in terms of financial value) of the modelling project? –
• Have QIE generated more projects and/or fund raised in the schools?
The school is part the EduNetwork due to the competences on project development acquired through
technical assistance. The school also sublimed application form Erasmus+ funding and although the funds
have not been secured from the first attempt, the school manager shows tenacity in improving the
application and getting the funds.
Moreover, the school manager considers that funds from Terre des Hommes, provided for school
infrastructure, have been supplemented due to the activities in the school and the ability of the school
267
community overall and of the school manager herself to convince the donor to invest more in the school in
Zemeș.
Sustainability
EQ 12 Are the interventions modelled likely to continue when external support is withdrawn?
• Continuity of employment of trained teachers and managers
• Extent to which funds are secured for the continuation of activities
• Extent to which relevant stakeholders intend to continue the intervention in a certain timeframe
• Commitment of QIE stakeholders to continue using the knowledge, approach and tools acquired under
QIE beyond the lifetime of the project
• Why not? Risks to sustainability
Most of the activities are likely to be sustainable in Zemeș school. Most of the teachers in the school
are local, have extensive seniority in the school and don’t plan to leave. The same can be said about
the school manager.
Funds to continue the school activity overall and teachers’ salaries are secured and since 2019 the
school is also the beneficiary of European funds for the infrastructure. Similar activities to the ones funded
by microgrants are planned and to a certain extent the school manager is confident that support (including
financial support for some activities) will be available from the local budget for activities in the school and
kindergarden. However, the school manager and teachers are not very optimistic that funds form the local
budget for non-formal activities will be as high and easily available as the micro-grants.
Local stakeholders show support for the activities implemented under QIE and for similar activities,
especially for the ones connecting the school and the community, like the community festival (serbare
câmpenească) and for visible non-formal activities, like the activities of historical re-enactment linked to
children history lessons.
The school manager shows commitment and determination to continue fundraising for the school and
non-formal activities as well as trainings for the teachers. Adapting teaching to online schooling during the
COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge. In this context fundraising activities are also focusing on the issue
of digitalisation.
There is less evidence that parental education will continue without further support and guidance
from Holtis, although it is one of the most effective and appreciated activities. The trained parents are a
consolidated group and continue to communicate (offline and online - they share a Facebook group) after
the programme ended. Moreover, parental educators appreciated the experience and they told the
evaluators that parental training activities have change their perspective on parenting and the teacher-
parent relation. However, parental training is a time consuming, complex and sometimes difficult activity,
and there is not enough motivation to continue the activity without support and guidance form Holtis.
EQ 14. What are the lessons learned at each level of intervention that should be considered for
implementation and further replication of the modelling project?
• The focus here is the replication of the project (not the continuation) – what needs to be done in order
for the same project to be implemented in other localities/counties? Other measures/modification of
the project as it is right now.
The case of Zemeș school shows that most of QIE components can be replicated as designed by
UNICEF and partners.
However, this case shows how much results at the level of each target group (children, teachers,
parents, the school manager) are supported by different activities under different components (e.g.:
teachers’ approach to school and their stability is connected to the activities targeting teachers, but also the
school manager; the improved relationship between the school and the community is due to activities
268
targeting the school manager, parental education and microgrants activities etc.). Therefore, one of the
lessons learned is the need to have complementary activities implemented in the future as well.
On the other hand, for replicability, the problems faced in QIE implementation in the first year need to be
overcome. Zemș experience shows that trainings for teachers and headmasters are better received by these
target groups if they are integrated with the lifelong training programme they are used to.
Impact
EQ 16. What change did the modelling project determine or influence at the level of beneficiaries
(children and their families), communities, professionals, public administration – at local, county
and/or national level?
1. Impact on all schoolchildren in schools
1.4. Perception on formally recording absences
1.5. Perception of children on school attractiveness
QIE generated overall a better learning environment in Zemeș school and therefore increased school
attractiveness form the point of view of children, teachers and the school manager. Non-formal activities
and the use of new teaching methods contributed to this result.
However, there is no perceived impact on recorded absences overall. One of the reasons for this lack of
impact is the fact that Zemeș school had a low number of recorded absences of schoolchildren even before
the implementation of QIE.
2. Impact on schoolchildren at high risk of drop out
2.1. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project with improved school
attendance
2.2 Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who abandoned school
2.3. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who repeated the school year
2.4. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who have better school results
According to data collected Zemeș school was not facing important risks related to the education of
children with vulnerabilities and the dropout rate was small before the implementation of QIE. There
is no visible impact of QIE on school attendance, drop out and school result (grades). Moreover, the case
study didn’t show a focus or monitoring system implemented in the school to track the situation of children
at risk.
3. Impact on all children in early education
3.1. % of pre-schoolchildren with improved kindergarten attendance (by age groups)
There is no perceived impact on kindergarten attendance in Zemeș. One of the reasons for this lack of
impact is the fact that kindergarten attendance was high in Zemeș even before the implementation of QIE.
4. Impact on school management and school
4.1. Schools participating in the programme are more child-friendly (dimensions developed in survey)
4.2. Number of cases in which local authorities become involved in solving problemes encountered by schools
4.3. The extent to which knowledge gained during training was shared with other teachers.
4.4. The number cases in which the school director assisted teachers in class.
269
QIE had a significant impact on the school management and the school overall. Children report a
school that is friendly and trustworthy teachers from the perspective of children.
As already mentioned, the school organised several activities having in mind children needs, but also their
preferences and non-formal educational activities (curricular and extra-curricular) have been appreciated,
contributing to a more child-friendly environment.
On the other hand, the most important impact that all interviewees underlined is the improved
relationship of the school with the community in general, including parents and the local authorities.
Cooperation with all community stakeholders have been prised by the school manager and it was the first
and most important impact element of the QIE package. Moreover, all interviewed teachers identified the
same result spontaneously as one of the most significant and they appreciated the school director’s merit in
building this positive relationship with the community.
Interviews also showed a transfer, from the school manager to the teachers, of knowledge and competences
to build, manage and maintain the relationship with the community and parents
An important indicator of the involvement of the local authorities in solving problems in school is the effort
and energy spent for the preparation and implementation of the project funded by the Regional Operational
Programme for the school infrastructure.
On the other hand, the participation of the representatives of the local authorities to the community festival
(serbare câmpenească) organised by the school in 2018 and 2019 represents, as well, an indicator of the
good relationship between the school and the community.
5. Impact on teachers
5.1. Number of teachers using diversity materials in classroom
5.2. Number of teachers using/extent to which teachers use adapted curriculum to various needs of children at
risk
5.3. Number of teachers using/extent to which teachers use new learning activities and new learning contexts.
5.3. Turnover of teachers
As mentioned, the turnover of teachers is low in Zemeș and the positive results of QIE at the level of
the school management is an important factor ensuring the stability of teachers. Moreover, as a
result of QIE activities new learning contexts have been created in the school and children have been
better integrated in the classroom, as teachers started implementing new teaching tools and
methods and also became more aware of children’s needs outside the classroom.
Activities targeting teachers have not been well received from the beginning, as already presented in this
case study. They gained the trust, motivation and engagement of teachers only from the second year of QIE
implementation. Moreover, although during the interviews and focus groups they stated their appreciation
for the training content and quality, they could not identify specific activities they changed in their
methodology as result of the trainings. They also appreciated diversity activities as having low relevance in
the context of Zemeș, where minority communities are not present (in high number).
Moreover, teachers asses children needs especially from a social point of view and they don’t see an
important need for the adaptation of curricula to various needs of children at risk. The number of children
with special educational needs is low in the school and the focus on these children is equally low, as resulting
from interviews and focus groups. Overall, from the perspective of teachers, QIE didn’t generated a visible
impact on the learning activities in the classroom. However, children report an very good relationship with
teachers, lessons that are interesting and teachers opened to learn children perspective, trusting their
judgement.
On the other hand, by generated an improved relationship of the school and teachers with parents, QIE had
an indirect effect to a better integration of children in the classroom environment, because teachers become
more aware of the family environment and needs of children related to their family needs.
270
As already mentioned, new learning activities in new learning contexts have been implemented for history
lessons, biology, physics and chemistry lessons. These lessons are the combined result of activities targeting
teachers and micro-grants that provided funding and the specific context and incentives for teachers to look
for innovative activities in their teaching approaches.
6. Impact on early education teachers
6.1 % of early education teachers who diversified the activities undertaken with the children
6.2. % of early education teachers who introduced innovative approaches in their activities with children
The impact of QIE over the kindergarten teachers is similar with the one on schoolteachers. Activities
have been diversified by all interviewed kindergarten teachers. However, none of the interviewed
kindergarten teachers could describe innovative approaches used in their activities with children.
On the other hand, as in the case of schoolteachers, QIE activities, together, helped kindergarten teachers to
build trust among and better relationship with parents and allowed these kindergarten teachers to
understand better children needs related to their family environment.
7. Impact on family/parents
7.1. Number of parents with improved attitude as regards the benefits of education.
7.2. Number of parents with improved attitude as regards the benefits of parental education.
7.3. Number of parents with improved relationship with their children
QIE effects at the level of the relationship between the school and the parents have been one of the
most important form the point of view of the consulted stakeholders. Parents became more
interested and have been better involved in school activities and children education. Moreover, after
parental education, parents reported an improvement in their relationship with their children, at
least concerning school activities.
Although some of the parental educator faced challenges in mobilising parents and convincing them to
participate to the parental education activities, they have been successful due to: (1) the snowball effect
starting from parents that teachers trained as parental educators already new and had gained their trust;
(2) the support of the social worker.
According to the interviews with the parental educators, the large majority of parents have been very happy
with the parental education sessions. They created a community and continued the communication among
themselves, showing the sustainable impact of their positive attitude regarding parental education.
The main result at the level of parents reported by parental educators, teachers and the school manager is
their attitude towards the school and an improved cooperation between the school and the parents in the
interest of children. Therefore, the case study finds an important impact of parental education and other
activities with parents concerning their attitude as regards the benefits of education.
Parents also reported an improvement in their relationship with their children, at least concerning school
activities. An improved parent-children relation has been noticed in other areas of the family life in some
cases. Moreover, parents have been happy to learn how to manage their personal, family and work time.
Conclusions
Overall, QIE package has been very relevant and effective in Zemeș. In a nutshell:
- Activities answered the needs of the school community overall and has been consistent: activities
generated expected outputs and outcomes
- QIE proves to be in complementarity with other interventions, including large investments in school
education
271
- QIE generated a friendly school, a better relationship of teachers and schoolchildren, teachers and
parents and parents and schoolchildren, as supported by all interviewed stakeholders
- The results (effectiveness and impact) on the school management are among the most important
and visible compared to other results. These results supported and accelerated all the other results
in the school.
Due to these elements, it is probably sustainable at local level with limited external intervention and
support. Considering sustainability:
- The turnover of teachers is limited and this is supported by the local context (many teachers are
residents in Zemeș), but also by the school manager ability to create a friendly working
environment;
- Funds to continue the school activity overall and teachers’ salaries are secured and local
stakeholders show support for the activities implemented under QIE and for similar activities
- The school manager shows commitment and determination to continue activities similar to QIE and
to continue fundrising efforts for these activities.
Parental education was very effective in improving parents relationship with their children and the school
and overall support of the community for education in general and the school’s activities in particular.
However, there is less evidence that parental education will continue without further support and
guidance from Holtis, due to their complexity.
On the other hand, there are limited results related to non-discrimination and the integration of vulnerable
children. These limits must be considered in the local context of Zemeș school, that has not faced important
problems related to discrimination, integration of children with vulnerabilities or otherwise different for the
typical children, drop out etc.
Case study 5
School, town/city
Introduction
General data about the commune/community/town/city the school is located in
The city of Bacău is the residence of Bacău County, from Moldova, Romania. It is located on the river Bistrița,
on which there are two hydroelectric power plants in the city that cover part of the local electricity
consumption. The surface of the municipality is 43 km² and the population is 144,307 inhabitants. According
to the National Commission for Strategy and Forecast, Bacău is the third largest city in Moldova and it on the
second place in terms of contribution to GDP within the North East Development Region (20%), after Iasi
(30%). Bacău has an international airport that offers regular flights to various national and European
destinations. In 2011, the airport registered a traffic of 318,000 passengers
(http://bacaulturistic.ro/destinatie/bacau/). According to the Bacău County School Inspectorate data for
2018-2019, Bacău County there are 535 educational units with legal personality and subordinates, 516
public and 19 private units. In the municipality of Bacău there are 70 public educational units, with legal
personality and subordinates, out of which 17 are gymnasium schools with legal personality.
Bacău has 11 districts, Dr. AL Secondary School. Şafran being located on Henri Coandă Street, Aviatori 1
district.
General administrative data about the school from SIIR and Internal/External evaluation reports sent to
ARACIP
272
Dr. AL. Șafran Gymnasium is a district school in Bacău, located in its peripheral area. It has no
subordinate schools and it includes the following education levels: preschool, primary education cycle,
gymnasium and, also, “Second Chance” type of programme. According to the external evaluation of ARACIP
from 2015, the evaluation of the education services quality shows that there are prerequisites for successful
implementationt of EIC intervention and that the organizational climate and school ethos can support the
development of the addressesed skills in a sustainable manner:
-teachers are involved in scientific activities or in proffessional development activities (in 2015, the
available data shows that 23.5% of teachers are involved - at local level, and 11.8% - at regional level);
-the results of scientific research (conducted locally, nationally or internationally) are used in the
activities addressed to pupils in order to improve school performance. Thus, according to the External
Evaluation Report (EER) published on ARACIP website (https://aracip.eu/cautare-scoli?search=safran), in
2015, the Romanian language teacher developed a new activity in class, which is called „Reading Diary”. It
includes reading sheets, collages, spellings, quotes, thoughts, emotions and feelings recorded by pupils for
each book read. The teacher also encouraged pupils from gymnasium to post materials made by them on a
website created within the Erasmus mobility project “Discover informal education to reduce early school
leaving”. As a result, the school was enrolled in the “Junior achievement” project;
- the school's vision is built around the slogan “Passion. Involvement. Perseverance";
- the openness to beneficiaries is achieved through data transparency and the organization of the
event "Open Day";
- the school program is organized in 2 shifts, and at the time of the ARACIP evaluation, one of the
kindergarten groups, due to lack of space, had afternoon classes.
- human resources are valuable, there are 4 trainers and a mentor
- the orientation towards schoolchildren is also supported through the care and support for pupils with
delays in cognitive development and for pupils with SEN ("a support program has planned improvement
classes for schoolchildren, depending on learning needs. Teachers teach additional clasess: for the National
Assessment Exam - mathematics, Romanian language and literature, physics, chemistry "," For the 12
registered pupils with SEN, the teachers developed adapted programs. There are 4 pupils with SEN in the
eighth grade. At the math class we attended, we found that the teacher worked differently and gave
additional support to these pupils. Pupils statements and their portfolios shows also that pupils with Sen are
treated accordingly to their needs”)
We will analyze the organizational context (presence of vulnerable groups, quality of human resources,
quality of education infrastructure, level of family education, level of absenteeism) in order to identify the
dimensions that needed to be addressed within the EIC package:
a) vulnerable groups
From the perspective of the factors that influence the learning outcomes, children from vulnerable
backgrounds (Roma schoolchildren, children with SEN, children in a situation of repeating the year or with
incomplete school situation) are prone to poorer results, absenteeism and dropout.

We can observe that vulnerable groups are small in size and, in general, the school results are good.
Thus, there is a need for targeted approach focused on pupils at risk.

We can also observe that parents level of education exceeds the level of compulsory education, which
creates the premise of a very good collaboration of the family with the school.
c) the quality of human resources
In terms of human resources, Dr. AL. Şafran Gymnasium has continuity at the management level, the
headmasters being in office from 2013-2014, which favors both the educational climate and the educational
culture and the development vision of the school.

Also, in terms of school infrastructure, according to the 2015 ARACIP evaluation, the school had an
insufficient material base. This situation has negatively influenced the learning results and has favored the
absenteeism and, thus, school dropout.
e) the level of absenteeism
The level of absenteeism can increase the risk of drop out, because it is known to be a preliminary stage
of this phenomenon. The causes of absenteeism are multiple. At the level of the Dr. AL. Saffron Gymnasium
we can observe an increased level of absences.

The QIE intervention package aimed to support the participation of all children in quality inclusive education
by decreasing the dropout rate, increasing inclusion, motivating pupils for learning and school participation
and by improving learning results. The QIE package was developed around the following objectives:
improving the capacity of school management and teachers to support each child, according to their needs;
improving teaching methods and tools; creating partnerships with schoolchildren' families and developing
parenting skills; mobilizing communities to support education; improving children's non-cognitive skills and
motivation; encouraging diversity among schoolchildren, regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, (dis)
ability and socio-economic status.

Relevance
EQ 1. Are the activities and outputs of the modelling project consistent with the overall goal and its
objectives?
• Extent to which activities planned are relevant and sufficient for the objectives set
• Extent to which outputs produced are relevant and sufficient for the objectives set
• Additional activities/outputs needed
• The extent to which consulted stakeholders agree that activities and outputs were of the necessary
quality to ensure achievement of objective
The interviewed teachers consider that the activities within QIE package were useful, due to their focus on
teachers training and development. However, teachers’ perspective towards pupils at risk has not changed
significantly. Teachers still do not identify them in class and do not adapt their teaching technics. Their
opinion is that the activities are useful for the other schoolchildren as well, and, mainly because “the school
promoted its image as a school with inclusive education”, not because they led to educational services more
sensitive to vulnerable pupils.
Moreover, the school counselor considered that the intervention had positive effects, especially, through the
microgrants, that contributed to "creating an environment favorable for the development of the connections
between schoolchildren, parents and teachers", without highlighting the importance of meeting vulnerable
pupils’ needs. But, compared to teachers’ perspective, the counselor acknowledges the existence of
vulnerable children at school level.
The parenting educator, who is focused the needs and education of parents, acknowledges the existence of
school dropout phenomenon and disorganized families. This context is also proven by the rate of
schoolchildren who complete high school and participate in the national assessment exam. The school
principal identifies the current needs in the area of designing teaching strategy, teaching methods,
developing pupils' non-cognitive skills and addressing vulnerable children and their families, who, through
QIE intervention, have acquired a better understanding of the importance of school and school collaboration.
Therefore, the interviewees did not identify children from vulnerable groups in a common note. This
situation raises serious risks regarding the sustainability of the activities developed within QIE package,
after the completion of the intervention.
The needs that have been addressed through microgrants had been identified whitin the school. The fact
that at the school level there are parenting educators specialized for each educational level is considered to
be a correct and very useful approach in relation with the identified needs. At the level of teachers
community, there have been identified the need to adapt the courses to the specificity of the discipline or
school cycle. Some activities conducted within classes are very general and they have to be customized
according to the study discipline and / or the educational level. From the perspective of teachers
participating in the training courses, the trainers had an appropriate attitude twoards them.
According to this case study analysis, the project needs a component addressed to beginners and a greater
adequacy / customization to the specific needs of each school in its inception phase. At the same time, it is
necessary to rethink and redesign the component regarding early education. Further, from the analysis of
277
the collected data, we observe that a technological component, which refers to the use of technology in
lessons, the use of digital platforms, should be included in the intervention package. From the perspective of
the parenting educator, the component addressed to parents would have been useful if it was organized with
smaller groups (maximum 10 participants). The difficulty of working with parents consists in their
availability to participate in sessions and the lack of school – family partnership culture. Parenting
counseling activity as well as the parenting component of the intervention have put more pressure on pupils
families in terms of availability and allocation of time resources.
The principal considers that the objectives have been achieved and the customizations of the of the
intervention to the specific needs of the school have been achieved through microgrants.
The biggest difficulty was to form the parents target group within the intervention and to manage it.
Nevertheless, the importance of exchanges of good practices between schools, as well as, the dissemination
of information within school meetings, was clearly highlighted.
The parent counseling course should have been more adapted to the particular needs of the school, given
that it addressed general well-known issues and did not offer new information to the participants. However,
the statute of the counselor within the school has been strengthened.
The first group of parenting education was formed with parents highly interested in this type of activity, in
order to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and information within the parents’ community and raise their
curiosity regarding this component of the intervention. Teachers have noticed that within parents’ group
there is a segregation on material/financial ground and they, usually, they are ashamed to speak about their
problems. This was the starting point in working with them.
However, the collected data show that parents got closer to the school and they became more open to this
type of activity. It was a challenge to work with parents, but also, in some cases, the reluctance of some
teachers became an impediment. They have been convinced to participate in parenting sessions by other
participants shared their experiences and, in this way, raised their curiosity regarding the content of the
course. Only the principal states that the objectives of the intervention package have remained a priority for
the school, and the sustainability of the intervention can be identified within the teaching methods applied
in the classroom.
The microgrants and their effects were highly appreciated by the interviewees, because they have facilitated
the establishment of a set of development guidelines, which constituted the bases of the later designed
institutional development plan.
EQ 3. To what extent is the modelling project relevant to national policies and programmes and
cross-sectoral strategies?
• Complementarity with other projects/interventions and challenges raised by legislation
Teachers do not identify the complementarity between the intervention package and other educational
policies at the school level, due two the following reasons: they do not know elements of the educational
policies and they identify the package only through certain components and overall perspective and
understanding of the intervention. All priorities are considered important, even if the interviewees do not
argument this perception on the bases of concrete examples. At the level of parenting education, no
connection with other policies has been identified, this type of activity taking place only within QIE
intervention. It was taken into account that parents need to know both girls 'and boys' specific problems.
The principal identifies the link between the intervention and the Erasmus + project on inclusion, carried
out during the 2016 campaign. moreover, at school level there were implemented other Erasmus +
projects on the mobility component (KA1). Also, at the national level, the principal considers that the
connection with the family is better substantiated if there is a generalization of parenting education within
the education system, even if there are no direct evidences that indicate this causal link within Dr. Al.
Saffron Gymnasium.
EQ 4. Are all processes based on a child/human rights approach? Are any age and gender issues
considered in providing the services?
• Existence and level of availability of adapted activities for boys and girls / childer of different ages
/ if a special attention to gender was needed and for children of different ages, with different
backgrounds and from vulnerable groups, especially Roma
278
Although they do not provide concrete examples, teachers consider that the school counselor was already
focused on non-discrimination in its practice, so that the mentioned goals (diversity, inclusion, adaptation-
flexibility of the intervention approach, exchange of good practices) only came to strengthen the existing
approach. At the school level, sexual education courses were also held, with the consent of the parents. The
parenting educator considers that there must be given priority to goals such as tolerance, promoting
diversity, inclusion, appreciative approach, accountability and respect and the exchange of good practices.
There was no gender differentiation within the conducted activities, although in some activities there were
particular situations related to gender issue, but not in the sense of favoring any category.
Effectiveness
EQ 5. Did the interventions of the modelling project/QIE address the needs identified at the level of
the most vulnerable children and families? Are any age and gender issues considered in providing
the services?
279
1. Effects at the level of children
• 1.2. No of new/different extracurricular activities to which schoolchildren participated
• 1.3. Pupils in participating schools understand concepts such as diversity, tolerance, discrimination
Among the most important effects registered by QIE, is the improvement of the activities conducted with
pupils, by applying techniques learned during trainings and utilization of the obtained educational materials.
Integrated activities with pupils have been rethought and the teaching approach has been changed in
accordance to them. Also, for the benefit of the pupils, teachers have been collaborating and sharing their
ideas and the materials used in the classroom have been adjusted.
The general opinion is that the parenting educator is a good example for the school environment due to his
attitude towards pupils and, moreover, the vision of the school and the interactions between teachers and
pupils have been improved. The desire to participate in educational projects and to develop projects for
children has increased, even if at school level the culture of project participation already existed.
At the same time, there are certain distortions of the project idea at the level of the participants. Some
consider that the project addresses certain needs identified at school level, but their benefits are more
obvious when it comes to adjacent effects. For example, the fact that that the participating pupils can
communicate and interact within pupils from other parts of the world was a highly appreciated positive
effect, even if it didn’t cover a preidentified need.
Another positive effect of the intervention identified at the level of pupils constitutes their changed attitudes
towards school as a result of the knowledge transfers from the trainings for teachers activity to the
classroom:
-teachers tried to address their study disciplines in a transdisciplinary manner (for example, in Romanian
language class, in the context of studying a fable, the topic of tolerance was addressed through a debate);
-the activities organized with children and the trainings have gained more authenticity, because there were
identified the need for interaction and team work (activities that increase the ability of pupils to act in
classroom as a social group);
-emphasizing the importance of learning, motivation for learning, reducing violent behaviours, improving
self-esteem, by focusing on each pupil’s role in class and by raising awareness regarding the importance of
these dimensions within the teaching process;
Increasing the capacity of teachers to collaborate facilitates also the development of this type of skills among
schoolchildren. At the same time, teachers' awareness regarding the characteristics or the key favoring
elements of inappropriate behaviors lead to timely action and / or to their prophylaxis, which at the level of
pupils is a positive effect, not only for those targeted by these actions, but also for the entire group.
Another essential element for learning process is pupils’ valorization in a realistic and objective manner, a
phenomenon that was emphasized by the interviewed teachers. Thus, teachers they become aware of the
activities that highlight the potential of each child, and in this way, they increase pupils’ desire to get involved
in class activities. A very important benefit for pupils, as a result of teacher trainings, is the importance that
is given to the elements that facilitate the learning process: identifying schoolchildren for whom the
material/financial situation can be be an obstacle, the importance of learning, the need to integrate returning
schoolchildren from abroad, their awareness on the need for education in ensuring integration on the labor
market, the need to valorize children through specially selected activities.
The school counselor considers that he has consolidated his statute in school as a counselor, because all
those involved have realized the importance of these activities. From the perspective of the parenting
educator, the improvement of the relationship with the parents also had an effect on the pupils’ level,
because they became much more understanding with the children.
The principal believes that violent behaviors among schoolchildren have been reduced, many changing their
perception on the role of the school in their lives, especially through the microgrants that have facilitated
the purchase and utilization of tablets. At the same time, from the interaction with them, he noticed that they
are more tolerant and that they accept different points of view more easily. The school became more friendly,
both by painting the walls and by participating in new types of activities.
Another effect of the package is that less vulnerable schoolchildren got closer to the school.
280
2. Effects at the level of vulnerable children (schoolchildren at high risk of drop out)
• 2.2. Vulnerable children involved in extracurricular activities
• 2.3. Vulnerable children with improved self-esteem
The effects at the level of vulnerable children are less delimited and described than those at the level of all
pupils, being observed only at the level of their integration in the school community and the increase of their
participation in school. At the same time, as a result of the intensified interactions between teachers and
parents of vulnerable pupils, the home environment has also changed (for example, as a result of
participating in parenting education courses, one child said that his mother changed her attitude at home
and that she speaks and listens to him more).
The parenting educator beliefs that educating parents helps directly the children, especially the vulnerable
ones. In the same line, he says that when parents are silent or insecure (those that are part of vulnerable
groups), their children are often shy.
The school counsellor considers that vulnerable children do not have to have different socio-emotional
attitudes and that they are often identified within school with the help of teachers who analyse the database
information about their families (economic level, level of education, etc.).
Thus, there a lack of systematization in defining the mechanisms that can ensure the identification of
vulnerable schoolchildren (a more empirical identification).
Indeed, at the school level there is a greater involvement of vulnerable children in extracurricular activities,
which in the opinion of the school counsellor has helped pupils at risk of dropping out of school, without
applying certain school-level measure in order to manage their situation.
The teachers rethought the coordination class, which gained significance in the school, because teachers
acknowledged their importance in the establishment of relationship with schoolchildren. Collaboration with
parents was another key element that contributed to the decrease of dropping out phenomenon, especially
among vulnerable schoolchildren. Basically, the perspective of the school towards these pupils have
changed. They are no longer invisible and teachers focus on activities that facilitate their integration, even if
not in the form of comprehensive, centralized programs at the school level.
3. Effects at the level of parents
• 3.2. Parents involved in school activities (as effect of parenting class and parents’ counselling)
• 3.3. Number of parents participating in activities promoting diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination
• 3.4. Number of parents understanding concepts such as diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination
• 3.5. Number of parents cooperating more with teachers (asking more frequently the teacher on the
child situation at school).
At the level of Bacau municipality, 45 parenting educators were trained in 8 schools, 130 groups of parents
were formed, 194 support meetings were held and 1595 parents were involved.
At the level of parents, there was an improvement in their relationship with the school, and as a consequence
they gave more support to the school. At the same time, they became more open with their own children. We
can consider that they went through a double transformation: in relation to the school and in relation to the
children, one deriving from the other. The receptivity to the implementation of projects in school has also
increased.
Unfortunately, not all parents who needed parenting education participated in these activities. In their case,
no skills transfer activities took place (learning how to behave with children).
However, the parenting educator considers that most of the parents collaborate more with the school, and
within the organized meetings in school the parenting process continues. The parents changed their vision
regarding the school also because they saw that the meetings in which they have participated are different
from those where money was requested or where all the negative aspects of their children’ behavior were
highlighted.
There have been organized informal meeting, sessions suggested by the trainer were carried out, but also
others types of meetings were conducted at the parents' request (where the focus was on learning through
games and openness). Within the activities addressed to parents, each parent told his problems, which
brought them closer together. Thus, the relationship between parents and the relationship between parents
281
and educators has improved, but also the relationship between parents and children. Teachers have noticed
that young parents are more open than older parents to this type on activities and interactions.
Parenting educators have worked with both categories of parents (with vulnerable children and without
vulnerable children), finding that those with vulnerable children are irascible, because they try to hide their
shortcomings, and they avoid exposing their problems.
However, the biggest gain of this intervention can be considered the increased trust that parents have in
teachers and vice versa. Also the role of school has been acknowledged due to the fact that parents realized
that educational process also addressed them. At the same time, parents realized that they could relate
differently to teachers.
After the implementation of QIE package, parents are much more open, they can identify and expose their
problems in front of the teachers, ask for help and they understand that they can get support, if needed.
However, not all parents of vulnerable children can establish a relationship with the school (e.g. alcoholic
parents).
Even skeptical parents were convinced of the usefulness of the parenting education training, being co-opted
to participate in the specific activities.
From this activity, the teachers understood that they have to communicate differently that before with
parents and to approach a supportive, pragmatic attitude, to interact directly and in a fair manner with them,
for the benefit of the child.
EQ 6. Does the model contribute to the capacity development of the schools?
1. Effects at the level of school management
• 1.1. Improved institutional development plans
• 1.2. Headmasters participating to training (management and diversity)
• 1.3. The level of training quality
• 1.4. The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
• 1.5. Number of schools applying for and implementing mini-grants
• 1.6. Number of schools applying for and implementing other educational projects
• 1.7. Number of school mediators and counsellors / participating to training
At the level of Dr. AL. Saffron Gymnasium, the activities of the project are continued. Exchanges of experience
activities conducted with headmasters, as well as, the consolidation of a team of teachers at school level are
benefits of QIE intervention, from the perspective of school management. Regarding to the physical
environment and the access to educational means, the existence of a smart board and tablets was facilitated
through the microgrants. The perspective regarding the actions through the needs of the school van be
addressed has changed, because now the school id more orientated towards developing projects and
applying for financing. Last but not least, the principle believes that the need to integrate vulnerable children
has been acknowledge by the teachers’ community.
At the same time, from a management perspective, the relationship with parents has been strengthened and
intensified, including in the design of the organizational development, which has been a benefit for the entire
school. The planning of activities and the design of the medium-term development strategy have been
improved and certain needs have been addressed through microgrants. From the perspective of the school
management, the practice of collaboration between teachers has increased, the teaching process and the
involvement of pupils in the educational act has been improved (but, there were given no further details or
arguments that can sustain this perception regarding the changes that have taken place).
However, we observe that there is no perception at the level of teachers regarding explicit improvements of
the manager's relationship with them. The effects perceived from the management level are not being
confirmed by the teachers. This situation can be explained by the fact that the management team was formed
previously to the implementation of the project and that certain practices and relationships already existed.
From a managerial perspective, the obtained results were predictable, the activities being beneficial.
Therefore, there were no unexpected results for the school / school management. However, the
representatives of the school considers that the results of the national assessment exam (that placed the
282
school it in the top 5 schools in Bacău) are a consequence to a certain extent to QIE intervention, manly due
to the change in the relationship with parents, the improvement of teaching process and the integration and
support of vulnerable children.
At the level of the educational climate and the ethos of the school, the principal, who was directly and actively
involved in the intervention package, did not signal major changes. The personnel of the school and
especially the management team have learnt that the needs of the school should be identified in a systematic
manner and that they can be addressed by developing projects and accessing financing. After the completion
of the intervention there is a greater openness and a proper involvement in projects development.
2. Effects at the level of school teachers
• 2.1. Teachers participating fully/ partially, certified/per subject out of total number of teachers in
schools
• 2.2. The level of training quality
• 2.3. The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
• 2.4. Number of teachers participating in extra-curricular activities
• 2.5. Number of teachers understanding concepts such as diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination
Teachers learned to manage vulnerable schoolchildren, participated in training (most, except 5 of them),
although some of them failed to complete the courses due to failure to complete the required homework.
At school level there is no system for monitoring the transfer of skills acquired within the training sessions.
At the same time, the increase of collaboration between teachers, as well as the change of vision on
vulnerable schoolchildren ("the change of mentality has determined the new approach on interaction with
pupils") and the relationship with parents are obvious effects of the intervention. Teachers place more
emphasis on tolerance and non-discrimination. There have been also observed the following effects:
increased effectiveness of teamwork, more focus on the idea of partnership, increased importance of school
in the community, increased parents’ confidence in their abilities as a result of teacher support and school
receptivity.
The training for teachers represented a refreshment of already known information. Nevertheless, they have
contributed to the understanding of the integrated education approach. Teachers understood that all these
priorities (promoting diversity, inclusion, adapting / conducting flexible teaching activities / learning
approaches, creating a positive / friendly climate in the classroom, exchanging good practices) should be
prioritized, in order to facilitate the involvement of pupils with poorer results.
At the same time, the relationship between teachers has been strengthened, the approach has been changed
through extracurricular activities, which had a major impact on cooperation process. Teachers have learned
to organize more realistic, pragmatic and supportive meetings / interactions with parents, and not just
highlight negative situations. We can consider that the leadership has been improved in relation to pupils
and parents, but also within the school. The training program was focused on practical activities and less on
theory, on learning "how to act and where to act".
Although there is no mechanism for monitoring the transfer of competences, the school management
focused on training, accessing Erasmus + grants for teacher training (KA1).

of kindergarten teachers
• 3.2. The level of training quality
• 3.3. The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
• 3.4. Kindergarten teachers participating in Peer Learning Activities PLA) out of total number of
kindergarten teachers
• 3.5. Extent to which training received covered new areas
• 3.6. Extent to which materials received covered new subjects/had new approaches
• 3.7. The extent to which materials were used in classrooms/were useful (no of classrooms with

• 3.9. Number of activities carried out together with parents
All educators participated in the courses organized by Step by Step. The educators from the preschool level
have understood the importance of creating a pleasant, secure and affectionate climate because it leads to
the improvement of the educational act. They participated in two exchanges of good practices, which was
very beneficial. Hence, we consider that the component of early education should be much more visible and
the courses should be continued, as they have added "bricks" in the foundation of the profession of educator.
The collaboration with Step by Step was very good. Unfortunately, there is a lack of support in the provision
of infrastructure (furniture) at the pre-school level, which led to the proposal to carry out awareness-raising
campaigns for the authorities regarding need of the early education system. At this level, the approach
towards vulnerable children and the promotion of inclusive education have changed. At the same time, the
implementation of other Erasmus + projects contributes to the connection of teachers with the idea of a
teacher-oriented approach.
Although initially it was more difficult to form the target group of parents (for parenting activities in
kindergarten), later things worked well. Organizational or situation management problems were overcome,
training sessions were held with parents, and the results were very good. There were constant
disseminations and exchanges of good practices between teachers at preschool level.
increased visibility of the kindergarten being obvious. At the process level, the integrated activities were
rethought with the support of Step by Step and teaching/educational materials were provided. These
elements on which the QIE packed is focused (understanding concepts such as diversity, tolerance,
discrimination, vulnerable pupils, the importance of learning, motivation to learn, reducing violent behavior,
improving self-esteem) existed before the implementation of the intervention, but QIE the educators became
more aware of their importance in the education act and are much more careful in identifying and correcting
inappropriate behaviors among children.
Through micro grants, toys and materials were purchased. But, still, the institution needs other
infrastructure elements. Although the kindergarten looks good, there is always room for more. Working in
mixed teams (teachers from rural and urban areas) was clearly in the benefit of the educators. The
kindergarten still has a system for sharing information and experiences.
Even though the absenteeism has been reduced at the school level, within the preschool level there has not
been observe any change. This situation may be caused by the fact that the participation of children in
preschool cycle is not mandatory. The professionalization of teachers was an objective of the intervention
and it has been reached for 80% of the educators. At the preschool level, 60% of educators have changed
their approach.
EQ 7. Which parts of the modelling project/QIE component are most and least effective? What
factors explain the success?
• 1.1. which components were highly effective and durable, which not.
• 1.2. WHY? (Number of factors affecting the effectiveness of different components).
The most effective components perceived by the teachers from the Dr. AL. Saffron Gymnasium are:
• Trainings for teachers
• Parental counseling
• Microgrants
• Parenting education
• Exchanges of experience
• "Joy to learn" competition
• Visits of IES experts
To these components, we can add the management component, which was appreciated by the school
principal, especially for the practice of organizational development design. At the same time, the
284
intervention of the partner Agency Together in which the school was underrepresented because it did not
have Roma schoolchildren is not mentioned in any interview. However, only one teacher from the school
participated in one activity conducted by this partner.
Therefore, the successful components are those with greater representation at the school level. The
microgrant remains among the most appreciated components of the package, because it has a strong
dimension of changing the physical environment through the endowments provided, which makes the
teachers immediately perceive the change.
EQ8. Are there any unplanned outcomes worth considering for filling in capacity gaps and/or
addressing remaining bottlenecks?
Following the implementation of the QIE package, the educational culture and the inclusive education
climate were strengthened.
The interviewed teachers state that there have been changes in mentality regarding the approach to
interactions with pupils, without emphasizing the focus on vulnerable pupils.
The school had experience in working with children with SEN and children with cognitive delays, but as a
result of the implementation of the interventions, the approach was strengthened and gained meaning in the
case of children at risk. At the same time, due to the openness of teachers to the principle of non-
discrimination, this approach has been strengthened. This confirms the theory of organizational change that
emphasizes the importance of support structural factors.
In Dr. Al. Saffron Gymnasium, even before the implementation of this package of interventions, there were
conducted initiatives that addressing the needs of vulnerable, with SEN or with development delays children,
even if they were decentralized at school level and only in order to obtain better results in the national
evaluation exam (in the external evaluation report, the ARACIP it states that the school organizes additional
classes for children with development deficiencies).
While these results can be understood as expected effects, an unexpected result mentioned by teachers,
headmasters and school counselors is the increased teacher cooperation in both the endogenous and
exogenous environments of the school. In this sense, there have been observed the dissemination of
activities with schoolchildren at risk, including in pedagogical meetings.
Another unexpected result is the rethinking of the partnership with parents and the increase of visibility
both in the educational community and in the local one. The principal is very satisfied with the fact that the
attractiveness of the school has increased, this fact being sustained by the reduction of the number of
transferred / non-promoted schoolchildren:

Differences between those enrolled at the beginning and the end of the school year may be caused by the
transfer of schoolchildren. In a school with 800-900 pupils, the differences of up to 50-60 children are not
significant.
Efficiency
EQ 9. Does the modelling project use resources in the most economical/efficient manner to achieve
expected results?
• Only if evidences were collected related to activities/approaches which could have been done
simpler/faster.
According to the data collected, teachers and the principal believe that more financial resources are always
needed. Giving money through a project is a good approach. Microgrants were perceived as more
appropriate, especially because they are a result of teamwork and include all levels of education attended
by the beneficiary. Based on the microgrant, the school has been equipped with smart whiteboards and
tablets, which has facilitated a more enjoyable learning process for schoolchildren (e.g. by using KAHOOT,
which is a type of applications that aims to energize the classroom).
In relation to the effects and impact on the school, the results of the intervention are obvious from the
perception of teachers, schoolchildren, parents and the principal. There is no data on how these resources
are used.
EQ 10. What is the value added (in terms of financial value) of the modelling project? –
• Have QIE generated more projects and/or fund raised in the schools?
The model of the intervention package was inspiring, on one hand, due to the multitude of factors taken into
account when addressing the risk of dropping out, and on the other hand, based on the school's willingness
to act in order to decrease the magnitude of the phenomenon. Therefore, the school has accessed Erasmus +
programs, to support schoolchildren in the learning process, but also to keep alive the need for continuous
development of teachers. Acknowledging the benefit of identifying needs and accessing financing in order to
meet those needs was a result of the microgrant component of QIE. Dr. Al. Saffron Gymnasium continues this
approach by developing and accessing Erasmus + projects.
Sustainability
EQ 12 Are the interventions modelled likely to continue when external support is withdrawn?
• Continuity of employment of trained teachers and managers
• Extent to which funds are secured for the continuation of activities
• Extent to which relevant stakeholders intend to continue the intervention in a certain timeframe
• Commitment of QIE stakeholders to continue using the knowledge, approach and tools acquired
under QIE beyond the lifetime of the project
• Why not? Risks to sustainability
As confirmed by the interviews and focus groups, everything learned in the training courses was applied.
The social worker did not get very involved, he came to school several times, but the activities organized by
him needed the support of teachers.
Counseling sessions with parents are continued, microgrants are missing, but otherwise everything that has
been learned is used. The perspective of continuation also exists from other projects that address similar
themes (teacher training, non-discrimination, etc.).
Teachers feel that they have learned a lot at a personal level, including for their statute of parents. What they
have learned from the other parents, the experiences shared in parenting education helped them.
286
Professionally, they consider that they had enriched their method of communication and understood the
importance of listening. There is a need to train social workers collaborate with the parenting educators.
Teachers will continue to cooperate, because they have a different vision on the management of
schoolchildren and parents. Some educators have become a resource for other educators in the county,
sharing materials and ways of working and managing preschoolchildren and parents. At the same time, other
teachers disseminate elements from the trainings that they have attended within the pedagogical meeting.
The risks regarding the sustainability of the intervention are maintained because there is still an unclear
perspective on vulnerable pupils and also because of the lack of skills trainings and the lack of access to new
projects.
EQ 14. What are the lessons learned at each level of intervention that should be considered for
implementation and further replication of the modelling project?
• The focus here is the replication of the project (not the continuation) – what needs to be done in
orther for the same project to be implemented in other localities/counties? Other
measures/modification of the project as it is right now.
We need more social workers to work with the parenting educators. The planning of activities must take
into account the "school life", because teachers were initially overwhelmed by training sessions.
Nevertheless, afterwards, by making UNICEF more flexible and prioritizing activities, teachers were able to
train according to their needs. The component of parenting education and parental counseling must be
replicated. The vision of the principle is very important for the success of a project. There is a need for a
greater individualization of the school's needs in the implementation of a project, as such, the solution of
microgrants is very good in establishing directions.
The theoretical courses should be conducted for each educational level. Even if it is a program addressed
exclusively to schools, it should also involve the local community. At the same time, the selection criteria for
obtaining microgrants should be more flexible, encourage creativity eliminating strict requirements. From
the teachers’ perspective, within the training sessions, more applications based on case studies would
constitute elements of added value for this component.
Impact
EQ 16. What change did the modelling project determine or influence at the level of beneficiaries
(children and their families), communities, professionals, public administration – at local, county
and/or national level?
1. Impact on all schoolchildren in schools
1.4. Perception on formally recording absences
1.5. Perception of children on school attractiveness
The changes observed at the level of pupils are influenced by several factors as: the perception of the
activities within the intervention package, the change of teachers’ approach towards classes, the change of
the parents' relationship with the school and their perception about school, education, and their own
children.
According to the data collected through interviews, parents and schoolchildren say that these changes took
place because they perceived the activities within QIE package as being interesting and useful and, especially,
the parents understood the role of the school in their children’ lives.
At the same time, the increase of participation in extracurricular activities of pupils and parents created a
positive impact on the relationship with the school, leaving aside the initial defensive position, which was
cultivated by previous perceptions. At the same time, the parents' interactions within common and
constructive activities led to useful interactions for the children.
287
The facilities and activities within microgrants facilitated the improvement of the learning activity, also with
a positive effect on the schoolchildren' perception towards the school.
In the Dr. Al. Saffron Gymnasium, the activities were not exclusively addressed to vulnerable schoolchildren
(as increase integration and inclusion). Therefore, the impact can be judged by the evolution of the learning
results of pupils and by the results of the national assessment.
We only present the results for the secondary level of education, because at other levels the existing data
show a more qualitative approach that has a strong descriptive character. At the same time, we excluded the
2016-2017 school year from the analysis because the data were not updated for that school year, being a
reporting error within RAEI database.

From the above table we can observe, in the case of the school year 2018 – 2019 an increase in the frequency
of the average between 9-10, which confirms the positive effects on schoolchildren who benefited from
intervention and further, from the changes in the educational process. At the same time, starting with the
2014-2015 school year, we can observe that the data trends show an increase of the number of
schoolchildren with grades above 5.
2. Impact on schoolchildren at high risk of drop out
2.1. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project with improved school
attendance
2.2 Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who abandoned school
2.3. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who repeated the school
year
2.4. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who have better school
results
No vulnerable children were identified at school level (see Fig.1). The external evaluation report made by
ARACIP in November 2015, shows that the support for this category existed within the school before the QIE
intervention. Therefore, there was an availability and an openness towards this type of activities that could
facilitated their further development and internalization as to be transformed into current practices.
In this regard, the main benefit of the implementation of QIE package is the conscious management of the
vulnerable pupils and the improved relationship with parents as a result of the subcomponent of parenting
counseling and the parenting component in particular.
288
The teachers and the school principal state that they have a unitary approach regarding the schoolchildren,
not making differences and wanting to send clear messages in this case to the schoolchildren in order to
avoid labeling.
However, at the level of the microgrant we can find a reference to the 150 vulnerable children existing in the
school, without verifiable data from other sources (for example, RAEI). The average absences per pupil
remains relatively in the same range. Thus, we can observe a difference of approximately 1.5 percent
between the average per pupil from school year 2014 – 2015 and school year 2018 – 2019 (see Fig. 5).
Because of the fact that the existing data refers to all schoolchildren and do not identify a group of vulnerable
pupils, there are difficulties in identifying the impact generated by the intervention. Judging by the exit data,
we identify a 0 rate of school dropout, which indicates that vulnerable schoolchildren are properly managed
on all dimensions that may affect them (parents, motivation, etc.). At the same time, the level of parents’
education (see Fig. 2), as well as the continuity of the teachers' position (see Fig. 3) are factors that influence
the results of the schoolchildren, especially those at risk.
3. Impact on all children in early education
3.1. % of pre-schoolchildren with improved kindergarten attendance (by age groups)
The attendance of children enrolled in kindergarten has not been improved, as the pre-school level of
education is not mandatory and also because of the fact that the pre-school period overlaps the period in
which children develop their immunity, which leads to frequent illnesses.
However, from the data reported by the school for the RAEI database, we observe a slight decrease of the
attendance of pre-scholars for 2018-2019 school year (see Fig. 5). But the perception of teachers does not
confirm that this situation can be determined by any component of the intervention package.
However, we can observe an improvement in the relationship with parents, due to the change of vision in
terms of interaction and support, but also of the education act, due to the changing ways of approaching
integrated activities, the new materials used, the changing of the climate of kindergarten and its focus on the
two key dimensions of the early educational system: the safe environment and the emotional support.
4. Impact on school management and school
4.1. Schools participating in the programme are more child-friendly (dimensions developed in survey)
4.2. Number of cases in which local authorities become involved in solving problemes encountered by
schools
4.3. The extent to which knowledge gained during training was shared with other teachers (in school).
4.4. The number cases in which the school director assisted teachers in class.
The school management was prone to improvement and transformation, these characteristics being
supported by the continuity of management since the school year 2013-2014. Also, the package of
interventions on the management component produced transformations at school level in the strategic
design of institutional development, which was identified as a weakness of the school within the external
evaluation made by ARACIP in 2015.
The leadership of the deputy principal and the vision regarding the organizational development of the
principal are mainly oriented towards human resources and animated by the struggle for survival in the
local context. The gymnasium is a district school that can survive through the quality of services offered in
the social context of declining school population.
The principal is also a parenting educator. He participated in the training component, coordinated the
implementation of the microgrant and he contributes to maintaining the school development by accessing
Erasmus + projects. He aims to develop an educational climate focused on the need for professional
improvement and development, for the benefit of pupils. This fact is confirmed at the community level by
the fact that the school became much more visible after the completion of the intervention and, despite the
conditions, it ranks in the top 5 schools in terms according to the results obtained by pupils at the national
assessment exam.
289
Improving the relationship with parents, changing the vision towards vulnerable children and offering them
more support within school have contributed to the organizational ethos, which is marked by self-confidence
and the validation of the efforts made by the beneficiaries.
From an endogenous perspective, parents and the community consider that Dr. Al. Saffron Gymnasium is
much friendlier, more open to development and more appreciated for extracurricular activities and projects
in which it participates. This fact is confirmed by the bigger number of enrolled pupils in secondary level
compared to the primary level, although, in the situation of a segregated system in terms of school quality
(good schools / bad schools), there is a tendency to migrate to central schools. Since the phenomenon has
not been observed in this case, it turns out that parents find enough arguments to keep their children close
to school, being convinced that within this school they have access to a quality education.
Also, as a component of the organizational culture, the principle encourages the transfer of skills or
knowledge acquired within training sessions, which leads to the desire of participating in similar
experiences or increase cooperation between teachers. This effect brings a plus in the transformation and
development of the human resources, in this case of the teaching staff.
Being a municipal school, the interviews showed a low level of support from the local community. At the
same time, the school principal represents a role model of collaboration, being perceived as such even
when he attends the classes of other teachers. Also, within the school the new teachers are mentored by
those with didactic experience and recognized by their professional authority.

5.3. Turnover of teachers
The number of teachers at primary and secondary level who completed the training courses within the
teaching component accredited by the Ministry of Education was only 4 out of 169 (from all 51 schools
participating in the intervention). However, on different components, the participation registered in the
IES documents is presented below:

Figure8. The participation at tranings for teachers within Dr. AL. Şaffran Gymnasium (Data source: IES)
The didactic component which was coordinated the IES partner had the following participation from the
Dr. AL. Saffron Gymnasium:
• In 2018-2019 there were 169 graduates, 4 from Dr. Al. Safran Gymnasium (Bucur Liliana,
Vrînceanu Irina Carmen, Duduman Ioana, Deaconu Elisabeta).
290
• In 2017-2018, 3 teachers participated, of which only 2 finished the courses (Anda Adriana-
rejected, Creţu Larisa-admitted, Tabarcea Gabriela-admitted)
• In 2016-2017, 13 teachers participated (Tunaru Cătălin, Toderaşc Ingrid Elena, Movilă Irina,
Mavrichi Carmen, Manea Alexandru, Gartu Mihaela, Ioniţă Magdalena, Lazăr Veronica, Abageru
Elena, Bucur Liliana, Butnaru Nuţa, Pătraşcu Diac Flaviana).
• In 2015-2016 there are 9 participants, among which 8 teachers (Bărbuţ Oana Andreea, Bucur
Liliana, Dragomirescu Ana, Feneru Mara, Ioniţă Magdalena, Lazăr Veronica, Prisăcaru Marilena,
Tunaru Cătălin) and the principal.
As a result of the participating in training courses, teachers consider that they have changed their teaching
activities, due to fact that they have applied the acquired knowledge and used the received materials.
Teachers say that training for teachers component was very important for improving their activity.
Schoolchildren confirm that the lessons are more attractive in most situations.
Therefore, as a result of the components that targeted teachers, they improved their approach to the
teaching process, the relationship with parents and the management of vulnerable children. The ARACIP
Evaluation Report of 2015 mentions that even before the intervention there was an availability and
support for schoolchildren, the package of interventions completing this availability. At the same time, the
QIE package came to maintain and develop new behaviors, attitudes in different contexts, to enrich
knowledge, which led to the consolidation of teachers' skills by practicing them in new contexts.
Even if the perception of educators is that the level of change in teachers is below 80% and that there are
teachers who say that only 30% of activities are changed, the improvement of the processes can occur as a
chain reaction, through contamination, supported by pupils and parents feedback. Also, exchanges of
experience can be a factor generating change, because, in this way, teachers internalize much better the
change that occurs. To maintain the impact, teachers need to validate their work and receive feedback from
beneficiaries. At the same time, the schoolchildren 'results could be an indirect confirmation of the
teachers' involvement in attractive lessons.
6. Impact on early education teachers
6.1 % of early education teachers who diversified the activities undertaken with the children
6.2. % of early education teachers who introduced innovative approaches in their activities with children
All the educators participated in the training courses. According to the interviews, the professionalization
of educators has been achieved to a 80% extent, and 60% of the educators changed their approach.
An identified strength was the interaction between teachers from urban and rural areas. In this regard, it is
considered that it will be very useful to include more kindergartens in the intervention.
Educators have become more receptive to identifying and correcting inappropriate behaviors among
children, because they can lead to the formation of attitudes that would not respect the principles of non-
discrimination and tolerance. However, school participation is not considered to be significantly improved
due to that pre-school attendance is not compulsory.
Another gain of the educators was the relationship with the parents which improved because they
understood better how to approach them, listening to their problems and understanding their perspective.
The material packages that were provided contributed to the change in the teaching process. Within the
kindergarten physiotherapy sessions were needed and, therefore, there have been organized such sessions
with specialized physiotherapists.
Through trainings, educators have received guidance from Step by Step partner on how to organize their
activities, how to approach activities with preschoolchildren in order to activate children and facilitate the
learning process. At the same time, the educators learned how to ensure a safe and emotional climate in
kindergarten, because these elements are the main pillars on which preschool activities must be based. The
educators also benefited from the exchanges of good practices. There were organized two such activities
for the kindergarten from Dr. Al. Safran Gymnasium.
291
The parenting sessions were a challenge, as parents were reluctant at the beginning of the project. Good
communication with them led to the success of the process.
The care for vulnerable children, the differentiated approach and the vision on integration have created at
the preschool level the premises of inclusive education, of a friendly and open school to all children.
It is considered by the educators that the courses on early education should be continued.
7. Impact on family/parents
7.1. Number of parents with improved attitude as regards the benefits of education.
7.2. Number of parents with improved attitude as regards the benefits of parental education.
7.3. Number of parents with improved relationship with their children
Parenting educators have helped change parents' attitudes toward school. They mentioned that the
teachers worked more easily with the parents who had attended these courses.
As a strategic vision, in this school there are parenting educators for each level of education, which
constitutes a strength of the system because parents have already acquired skills and knowledge when
their children move from an educational level to another. The school principal is a parenting educator,
which can give him a clear and comprehensive perspective of the role and benefits of the parenting
training for the school and especially for the children.
Parenting education and parenting activities have changed parents’ perception on school and on the role of
education for their children. The initial skepticism regarding their involvement in the project was
transformed into enthusiasm and cooperation. At the same time, teachers, parents and children positively
appreciate the school’s involvement in different projects and further, they understanding the benefits of
this participation.
However, the interviewed teachers and principal know that they have not been able to co-opt all parents in
parenting activities. But now, after the implementation of QIE package, they know how to relate differently
with them, to show openness and a pragmatic and supportive attitude. At the same time, there were
identified cases where the communication with parents was impossible, due to their (e.g. alcohol
addiction).
All the activities carried out had another important effect (besides the change registered in attitude of
teachers towards the educational process, towards their role in the child's education or towards the child),
namely the strengthened their relations between them, facilitating empathic interactions, which led to
support even between parents.
Conclusions
In regard within QIE package objectives (planned objectives: creating partnerships with schoolchildren'
families and developing parenting skills), the Gymnasium has achieved the following rezults:
• improving the capacity of school management and teachers to support each child, according to
their needs;
• improving teaching methods and tools;
• encouraging diversity among schoolchildren, regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, (disability)
and socio-economic status
• improving children's non-cognitive skills and motivation
• creating partnerships with schoolchildren' families and developing parenting skills
• mobilizing communities to support education.
In regard with the objectives of the QIE intervention package, Dr. AL. Saffron fulfilled meet, to differnt
extents, each planned objective. Thus, the principal was very involved in the activities of the intervention
package, not only on the management component, but also on the didactic and parental education
component.
292
The intervention has contributed to the empowerment of teachers and have facilitated the development of
a strategy more focused on children with cognitive delays or with SEN, on children at risk, who are
considered vulnerable. According the teachers, however, there is a hesitation in identifying vulnerable
children by referring to the risk factors stated by the OECD. A clear definition and identification of the
categories of vulnerable pupils does not exist within the school, except the referral to the learning outcomes.
However, in the organizational culture, as well as in the climate and ethos of the school, there was the
availability of teachers to additionally support children with mental delays, as evidenced by the 2015
external evaluation conducted by ARACIP. The phenomenon was insular and, therefore, it was not
generalized at the school level. Through the package of interventions, within this component, perceptions
and mentalities at the level of teachers has been improved, as well as the cooperation between them.
The improvement of teaching methods was mainly supported by the didactic component. Dr. Al. Safron
Gymnasium had a good participation every year in the case of training of teachers, on different modules, but
the completion of the accredited course was done only by 4 teachers, one being the deputy principal.
According to the interviews, participants did not pass the course because did not do the specific assignments,
which questions the level understanding towards the concepts learned within the course. Another reason,
as stated by the teachers, was the lack of correlation of this activity to the educational calendar of teachers.
But, there is still a need to identify the real causes, as well as the ability of teachers to transfer to the level of
daily teaching practices what they have learned in trainings.
According to the interviews conducted with teachers, there was a need for a further adaptation of the
contents of the training to each discipline. Only at the preschool level, educators noticed the novelties and
applied to the class the specific techniques and approaches Step by step. The fact that the contents were
focus on the specificity of their activity facilitated the application and the transfer in the current practice of
the learned elements and this led to the improvement of the activity with the children. According to the
discussions with schoolchildren, they identified as most interesting and most beneficial extracurricular
rather than classroom activities. Regarding the classroom activities, pupils appreciated the utilization of
smart whiteboards and tablets, as well as the training on the utilization of KAHOOT (a type of application
which is designed as to mediated the interaction between teacher and pupils and provide immediate
feedback).
Encouraging diversity among schoolchildren, regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, (dis) ability and socio-
economic status was achieved throughout the implementation of the intervention package, including within
microgrants. Also, according to teachers, parents and the school principal, the improvement of non-cognitive
skills and children's motivation were achieved by opening towards them and improving the teacher-
schoolchild relationship. The interviewed teachers stated that the school has strengthened its image as an
inclusive school in the community and it has become friendlier with children. Even if, there are no evidences
in this regard, these effects of the intervention can be related to the learning outcomes materialized in the
grades and in the averages obtained at the national assessment exam. At the same time, the school principal
and the teachers confirm that there has been no school dropout in recent years. They were not mentioned if
there were situations of pupils being at risk of dropping out, but returning to school. Schoolchildren also
improved their noncognitive skills through the extracurricular activities in which they have participated.
These types of activities were organized also after the completion of QIE package, through other projects
implemented in the school.
Creating partnerships with schoolchildren' families and developing parenting skills was supported by the
parenting education component. Dr. AL Safron Gymnasium has strategically chosen to have a parenting
educator for each level of education. The co-optation of the parents difficult. From the data analysis, we can
observe that the average of study years in the case of parents is 12, which means that most parents have
finished high school, exceeding the level of compulsory education. This has been a benefit for the parenting
education component, the receptivity of parents towards the learning process was higher. The interactions,
the training for parents, as well as, their counseling led to a correct relationship between them and the
school. In fact, according to the perceptions of the principal and teachers, the mentality of parents and
teachers regarding collaboration has changed. Parents are more open to project activities, asking for school
support and vice versa, collaborating with each other. Teachers mention that not all parents who needed
training participated. Also, the communication with parents with addictions has been very difficult (e.g.
alcohol addiction).
293
The mobilization of communities in the sense of supporting education was difficult at the beginning of the
project. The teachers involved said that there was the need for a more adequate participation and
implication of the social worker, because he had to be supported by teachers when conducted the activities
that were under his responsibility, as mentioned in the interview teachers.
The QIE intervention package have been implemented within Dr. Al. Şafran Gymnasium starting from some
favorable premises for their development and outcomes, namely the openness and desire to change and
solve certain needs identified as representing vulnerabilities at the school level. Moreover, the competencies
formed through the intervention package are supported by other complementary projects that ensure and
maintain organizational development. At the same time, the principal's vision and personal example of
involvement led to a favorable dynamic and real changes in the school.
Case study 6
School, town/city
Introduction
General data about the commune/community/town/city the school is located in.
Frumoasa village is part of Balcani Commune (together with Balcani, Ludești and Schitu Frumoasa localities),
located in the north of Bacău county, on the border with Neamț county. According to the 2011 census105, the
population of Balcans is of 7,173 inhabitants, being in a decline compared with the previous census from 2002
(when 8,051 inhabitants were registered). The majority of the inhabitants are Romanian (93.77%). The main
minorities are Roma (2.09%) and Csangos (1.41%). From a confessional point of view, the majority of the
inhabitants are Orthodox (70.95%), with a minority of Roman Catholics (26.84%). For about 2% of the
population, ethnicity and confessional affiliation are not known.
According to the aforementioned census, in 2011, Frumoasa village had 3339 inhabitants it is the locality with
the largest population in the commune (at least double compared to other villages). Unlike the general structure
of the population in the commune, Frumoasa village has a heterogeneous, distinct ethnic structure (which is, in
fact, not unique in Bacău County). According to the documents106, the village was formed of Transylvanian
emigrants in the second half of the 18th century, most of whom were Hungarian speakers who mingled with the
Romanian population in Moldova. Most of the villagers are Csangos, of Roman Catholic denomination. The Roma
community is the largest in the commune and lives on the outskirts of the village in an area that residents call
"the neighborhood" (according to interviews with parents).
The nearest town where schoolchildren from Frumoasa village can study after gymnasium is Moinești (about
25 km away) and the distance to the school’s administrative center (County School Inspectorate) is about 50
km. Due to the geographical location of the village, the access to resources is not easy and the economic and
cultural dynamics are reduced. The vast majority of families in Frumoasa have members who work abroad. Most
cultural and social events (for example volunteering for vulnerable people) in the village are traditionally
organized with the support of the Parish of the Roman Catholic Church in the locality.
General administrative data about the school from SIIR and Internal evaluation reports sent to RAQPE
Frumoasa village Gymnasium School, Balcani commune, is the only educational unit in the locality and
it includes also the Frumoasa Kindergarten with normal schedule. In 2003 the unit was transformed
into the School of Arts and Crafts (which included the 9th and 10th grades) and had been functioning
under this name until 2010, when the school became a gymnasium again.
According to SIIR data for the period 2014-2019 (the project implementation period), the school's
schoolchild population (primary and secondary education cycles) has been steadily declining (from

200 schoolchildren enrolled in 2014 to 182 schoolchildren in 2018), with an average of 18 8th grade
graduates annually and a high school admission rate of approximately 45%. The 2017-2018 school
year was the year with the highest success rate in the capacity examination (10 out of 17
schoolchildren, approximately 59%). In 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 the number of schoolchildren
repeating the year increased from 2 to 5 schoolchildren, and in 2019 there were 2 cases of
schoolchildren with unfinished school situation (dropout). According to the same data (SIIR), in the
period 2014-2019 no Roma pupils were registered or declared (by family self-identification) in
Frumoasa village.
In addition to this information, according to the Annual Internal Quality Assessment Reports, in the
period 2014-2019 there has been a change in trends regarding the transition from one cycle of studies
to another, namely the decrease in the number of middle school schoolchildren going to high school
and also the increase of those who opt for vocational schools (about half of the schoolchildren),
possibly due to the difficult situation on the labor market in the area.
We point out here that there have been occasionally identified significant differences between the
records from SIIR and the statistics at school level. According to school records, between 2014 and
2019 the number of pupils enrolled in the school in Frumoasa village decreased at a higher rate
compared to that found in SIIR (from 293 to 235 and the number of preschoolchildren from 74 to 55).
In 2018-2019 school year, Frumoasa School had a staff of 28 teachers (of which 26 qualified) and 301
pupils and preschoolchildren. 97% schoolchildren and 80% teachers were living in the locality. Only
one schoolchild with special educational needs (SEN) was registered in the school, in primary
education cycle. Regarding the ethnic structure for the period we are referring to, school statistics
show that the entire school population in Frumoasa did not declare itself to be of any ethnicity other
than Romanian and the 2014-2015 school year was the last year in which Hungarian was taught as a
native language in Frumoasa School.
In Balcani Commune two schools benefited from the QIE package implemented by UNICEF in the period
2014-2019 – Balcans Gymnasium School no. 1 and Frumoasa Gymnasium School.

Frumoasa Gymnasium School has been later included in the UNICEF intervention, at the school’s principal
request and, according to those interviewed when conducting this case study (the school principal, teachers,
295
parents and pupils), as structured according to the objectives of the QIE package, the project fully met the needs
of the school community in Frumoasa.
The school Internal Quality Assessment Report from school year 2014-2015 stipulates that the school had a
total of 367 pupils and preschoolchildren, of which 34 in single-parent families, 20 children in foster care, 54
children in the care of grandparents or other relatives and 31 children from very poor families. According to the
estimation of the school’s principal, at least one-third of the school's pupils have one or both parents working
abroad. Also, despite the fact that they did not self-identify as such, in each group of schoolchildren there are at
least 3 Roma schoolchildren (according to the statements of a school teacher), some of them with a very low
standard of living. Also, according to the internal and external assessment reports (ARACIP), at that time,
Frumoasa Gymnasium School was deficient in terms of human resources (insufficient employees and
qualifications, high fluctuation of personnel and so on) and material resources (school spaces considered
satisfactory, especially insufficiently equipped with modern technology and teaching resources). Before
entering this project, some of the pupils from Frumoasa school have been already involved in QIE activities at
the school from the neighboring town, Balcans, where there were no Roma schoolchildren.
"We wanted to benefit from UNICEF's intervention because we needed it. First of all, the schoolchildren of the school
are Roma, Csangos, it is a complex community in which children need integration, acceptance ... some
schoolchildren are in the care of grandparents or other people. Starting from these phenomena, I have realized
that the school must go beyond education, because each of these children has a story that I did not know, and they
must look at the school with confidence and come to school with pleasure, and it is necessary for these children to
be supported. (...) In this context, we asked the mayor to invite us to a meeting in which we could express our desire
to implement the project in our school. " (interview with the school principal)
The school from Frumoasa requested to entry into the project later, through the local administration, which
created a slightly atypical beginning and also favorable premises for the intervention: “we really enjoyed this
project because we had support and everything went well!” (teacher).
According to the interviewees, the planned activities have met the identifyed needs of the school community in
Frumoasa:
- At the level of school and teacher management there is an awareness regarding the complex needs of each
schoolchild which generates challenges in terms of approach strategies - from their correct identification
to the development of school and teaching management strategies. Activities such as technical assistance
on request, for example for the elaboration of the Institutional Development Plan, experience exchange
between schools and the involvement of management staff and teaching staff in different components of
the project are mentioned as responding to these needs.
- Improving teaching strategies (teaching methods and tools) both in the area of each discipline and
transdisciplinary, but also regarding the communication skills of teachers is an objective highly appreciated
by teachers and pupils. This objective has been achieved through training activities that in many aspects
have been a unique and valuable experience for all teachers involved: organizing residential trainings
(several days in different localities), experiential teaching, the character of the used methods, visits to other
schools.
- Creating a partnership with schoolchildren' families and developing parenting skills, by developing the
parenting educator skills of teachers and organizing parenting sessions, met one of the main strategic
orientations of the school - that of involving the family in children's education and ensuring coherence of
educational interventions between these two environments - school and family.
- Creating a partnership with the community, mobilizing it in support of education not only from a material
perspective, but also from a value/attitudinal and behavioral point of view, has been also a identified as a
school need in terms of effective outward communication. This visibility has been especially achieved
through micro-grant activities and sessions with parents.
- Improving non-cognitive skills and increasing the motivation to learn, especially for pupils from vulnerable
groups, has been an objective to be achieved through the activities carried out in micro-grants but also
indirectly, through teaching innovations generated by teacher trainings.
- In a heterogeneous community like the one in Frumoasa village, the importance of promoting diversity and
tolerance of gender, ethnicity and denomination is well known and, furthermore, this objective represented
a direction of action for the activities carried out in the project. The group of interviewed pupils especially
296
identifies as an impactful activity the meeting with people from Roma community with success stories. This
activity have had effects, as identified by those interviewed, mainly in teaching practices, interactions
between schoolchildren in the classroom and in extracurricular activities.
Despite the novelty of the experiences that they have participated to (e.g. for parents in parenting sessions, for
teachers as parenting educators or in writing and implementing micro-grants), parents and teachers talk about
overcoming initial fears as soon as they had their first direct experiences in the group and about the spreading
of the state of trust within the community. The community of Frumoasa, which was used to interact in other
ways and environments, needed a context in which to become aware of its educational role and to become a
closer partner of the school in a less formal way: "There is a need to communicate with parents, to exchange
experience, to be visible in the community" (the principal of the school).
The activities in the QIE package are considered to be consistent with a series of voluntary actions carried out
in the Frumoasa community for people from vulnerable groups. The school principal also mentioned that the
participation in an ERASMUS mobility project in the field of school education (in which 8 school teachers have
participated in specialized and transversal skills development sessions) was a propagated effect of QIE package,
due to the improved of technical skills for projects.
Adapting the activities to the age of the children / pupils is considered natural: “in kindergarten, the children
being small, we had to involve the parents in the activities every time and this was a double gain” (educator);
"Especially in the first grades of primary cycle, children make negative remarks about their colleagues, especially
the Roma pupils, they bring them from home ..., now is the best time to correct them" (teacher).
Regarding the differentiations of the activities by gender, the school principal mentioned that the parenting
education groups have been organized separately for women and men (mothers, respectively fathers), and that
there have been observed differences in the propagation of the effects of these meetings. The groups of pupils
were not usually differentiated, with the exception of the cases when the topic was focused on the physical
transformations of girls at puberty and elements of sex education were discussed due to early marriage
practices in the Roma community.
Effectiveness
EQ 5. Did the interventions of the modelling project/QIE address the needs identified at the level of the
most vulnerable children and families? Are any age and gender issues considered in providing the
services?
297
1. Effects at the level of children
• 1.2. No of new/different extracurricular activities to which schoolchildren participated
• 1.3. Pupils in participating schools understand concepts such as diversity, tolerance, discrimination
2. Effects at the level of vulnerable children (schoolchildren at high risk of drop out)
• 2.2. Vulnerable children involved in extracurricular activities
• 2.3. Vulnerable children with improved self-esteem
Most interviewed adults - teachers and parents - mentioned that their schoolchildren / children have never
been happier to participate in school activities than during the period when the QIE package has been
implemented in the school from Frumoasa village. Although the children were accustomed to volunteer or
artistic activities, usually organized by the parish of the local Roman Catholic church, in this case, the activities
have been extended, they were more frequent, different than the previous ones and they were constant in school
life and in the community for a while. According to the school principal, the activities involved without exception
all pupils and preschoolchildren of the school, adapting them to age levels and focusing on specific target groups.
According to a mother, "this time" resources have been allocated in a nondiscriminatory manner, "not only for
those that the city hall says they are in need (those who receive social aid). They were given also for the children
that don't come from the poorest families, because mine also need them, we don't have jobs either and my husband
has to work elsewhere (abroad)” (N. mother, 4 children, pupils in Frumoasa school).
According to another mother, as a result of the project, the children communicate more openly with their
parents: “everything has changed for both parents and children: for example, my little girl told me that she has a
boyfriend in the 8th grade, even if I don’t agree with this, and she told me that her teacher told her to tell me this”.
The interviewed pupils (4 pupils in the 7th grade) confirm the aforementioned perspective of adults and
emphasize the effects of the QIE intervention in several sectors, as follows:
- Increasing motivation for learning and well-being in school: "teachers taught us how to behave with each other,
and when we come to school we feel good with each other", "we worked a lot in teams when we went to school, that
now we can do it online”, “I like to learn much more when I am in a group”, “some teachers explain us more on our
understanding”.
- Parents are more supportive in terms of school and extracurricular activities and more open on intimate topics
with them: "they encourage me more with school", "they left me on the trip", "my mother is more open with me",
"my parents didn't want to attend those parent meetings, but I would have liked them to go (smiles)”.
- Better understanding of one's own community and learning in the community, along with different groups of
people – their parents, elderly people, poor families, children of another ethnicity / denomination – as a result
of the activities conducted within the micro-grants: “I liked the most the activity in which a young Roma man
spoke about the time when he was discriminated as a child and how he felt… and what helped him ”,“ I have made
March trinkets and with the money obtained by selling them I helped those in need ”,“ We sold the icons painted by
us and that's how the children who couldn't afford came on the trip ”.
- Understand the concepts of tolerance and diversity, non-discrimination, as a result of the transdisciplinary or
counseling activities, for example those focused on issues related to human rights and violence.
- Development of non-cognitive skills, such as artistic skills, communication and teamwork, mutual support,
entrepreneurship, self-knowledge and mutual knowledge – within the extracurricular or counseling activities
that addressed topics related to risk behavioral for preadolescents (alcohol consumption, smoking,
inappropriate use of the internet and other)
Regarding children from vulnerable groups (those with a precarious financial situation in their families, those
with parents working abroad, those raised by relatives or those in foster care, those from the Roma ethnic
group), the interviewed teachers mentioned better integration in the community and in school as a result of
participating especially in extracurricular activities organized through micro-grants. Within these activities the
pupils felt valued for their different talents: “usually these children were not very good at school and did not
socialize with colleagues, and after these activities schoolchildren got closer and the vulnerable children had more
courage in the classroom”(teacher). According to the statements of all interviewed teachers, there have been
noticed an improvement in the school results of vulnerable schoolchildren and a more positive attitude towards
learning. This information has been also confirmed by the statement of a schoolchild (8th grade): “we noticed
298
that from our classroom (8th grade) most pupils want to go to college and even from the whole school the majority
now wants to finish at least the high school”.
Among the extracurricular activities with the greatest impact in terms of novelty, complexity and results, the
most frequently mentioned were:
- volunteering activities and visits to the homes of vulnerable children on religious holidays (Good’s little
volunteers)
- collecting and providing aid for pupils with special needs from another school, located in a nearby locality
- organizing a trip using the money obtained from the sale of glass icons painted by pupils from the school
- making March trinkets and selling them at the village Sunday fair in order to raise funds for those in need
- meetings with people from the Roma community who shared their experiences of discrimination
- organizing an artistic event in which schoolchildren' talents were valued and school musical instruments
were used
- different ways of organizing events on national holidays, for example using dramatized stories
For children in the care of someone other than their parents, the voluntary participation of their guardians or
relatives in parenting education sessions and parents extracurricular activities is a type of involvement that it
is expected to have positive effects on the wellbeing and education of the children.
3. Effects at the level of parents
• 3.2. Parents involved in school activities (as effect of parenting class and parents’ counselling)
• 3.3. Number of parents participating in activities promoting diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination
• 3.4. Number of parents understanding concepts such as diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination
• 3.5. Number of parents cooperating more with teachers (asking more frequently the teacher on the
child situation at school).
According to Holtis statistics, a total of 258 parents were involved in parenting and counseling sessions for the
two schools in the Balcani commune that were included in the project (the Balcani school and Frumoasa school),
which confirms the estimate of the Frumoasa school management that about half of the parents or guardians of
the school's pupils have participated in the project activities.
From the perspective of the school/parenting counselor, the organization of counseling sessions for parents,
although it was initially difficult, it became a success due to their continuous participation: “we were flexible and
we managed to cover all the modules with as many parents as possible. Parents like to be listened to and parenting
activities with parents are still being organized”.
The parenting educator that have been interviewed also confirmed that after the first group session the
reluctance of parents/guardians in the community to participate in parenting sessions has been overcome.
According to him or her, the lack of knowledge and material resources makes most of them initially feel
incompetent and not get involved in the education of their children: “parents saw that they had nothing to fear,
that we talked relaxed over coffee as from parent to parent and for the second group more came, we had to sort
them (by vulnerable group) (...) The accommodation is necessary, then the collaboration begins”.
All the interviewees, from the school manager to the pupils, noticed changes in the cases of most parents that
have participated in the parenting sessions and/or in the parenting counseling sessions:
- Increased willingness to participate in parenting and counseling sessions, building a parenting practice,
even if parents are not yet accustomed to sharing role-playing experiences outside of school: “one is to
participate and the other to hear (...), I can't tell other parents about how good it is to talk to someone who
knows (parenting educator) and what we do at meetings” (mother).
- Better understanding of the concepts of tolerance and non-discrimination as a result of participating in
extracurricular activities that aimed to raise mutual aid funds, together with schoolchildren and school.
- Raise awareness regarding the importance of education and parents or guardians role in child’s education:
“a relative who cared for a schoolchild of the school confessed that if she did not participate in our activity
(organized through a micro-grant) she wouldn’t have known how important she is in the child's life” (teacher);
"My children have also noticed that I have changed, that I’m more patient and they talk more with me"
299
(mother); "There were also meetings with fathers, and they got involved, they found better ways to approach
the child's education, and mothers set out to meet outside the school" (school principal).
- Increased willingness to collaborate with the school: "they have received attention and interest even in them
as people, they were amazed by these activities (at parenting sessions) and I have noticed that we feel closer
even at regular meetings with parents" (teacher)
Regarding the parenting sessions, an interviewed mother has concluded: “...it was beautiful, I also received new
materials - notebooks ..., the lady, not only what she said, but how she said it, it went straight to my heart. I proposed
to see each other at my place when it ends (the project), I'm making a large coffee pot ... it will take a while."
EQ 6. Does the model contribute to the capacity development of the schools?
1. Effects at the level of school management
• 1.1. Improved institutional development plans
• 1.2. Headmasters participating to training (management and diversity)
• 1.3. The level of training quality
• 1.4. The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
• 1.5. Number of schools applying for and implementing mini-grants
• 1.6. Number of schools applying for and implementing other educational projects
• 1.7. Number of school mediators and counsellors / participating to training
The fact that the principal took steps forward in order to include the school in the project already demonstrates
the determination in initiating the process of change in the school. According to her statement, "I knew what my
needs were and what the directions of action were, but I didn't know how," and the QIE intervention met these
needs. The technical assistance received on request for the elaboration of the institutional development plan
and for projects contributed, on one hand, to the development of technical management skills and, on the other
hand, generated energy and confidence to change the managerial behavior. All interviewed teachers said that
the school’s principal is the key to the success of a large-scale intervention and appreciated that the principal of
their school participated in all actions of the project (and as a parenting educator led the most challenging group
of parents - that of the fathers) and that she often uses teamwork. Further, as a result of the actions conducted
within the project, the lack of specialized staff has been compensated (the school does not have a school
mediator and until the project it did not have a school counselor either). Following the QIE intervention, the
school from Frumoasa initiated the collaboration with the mediator from the Balcani School, requested the
supplementation of places for the training of parenting educators (from 4 to 6) and the school counselor, entry
level in the profession, benefited from professionalization.
The interviews captured the changes generated by the project at the management level: the development of the
capacity to structure an operational development plan; experience in writing projects has generated confidence
and competence in writing new projects, thus the school has won an Erasmus mobility project during QIE
project; building work teams for various actions and school documents development; increasing the capacity to
mobilize the community and the authorities in support of the school's actions; the purchase through micro-
grants of technical equipment (14 tablets) and musical instruments that contributed to the improvement of the
school's material resources; encouraging teachers to participate in team training in order to further support
teamwork in school; requesting (additional) training for parenting educators and school counselors as a result
of understanding the complexity of interventions in the case of vulnerable schoolchildren: "The school's
perspective on vulnerable children has changed, because we have become more aware than ever that we must be
close to this category of children emotionally, socially, trying to find solutions to the problems they face ... When I
didn't do so many activities, I didn't know the story behind the child (…) ”(school principal).
2. Effects at the level of school teachers
• 2.1. Teachers participating fully/ partially, certified/per subject out of total number of teachers in
schools
• 2.2. The level of training quality
• 2.3. The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
• 2.4. Number of teachers participating in extra-curricular activities
300
• 2.5. Number of teachers understanding concepts such as diversity, tolerance, non-discrimination
3. Effects at the level of kindergarten teachers
• 3.1. Kindergarten teachers participating fully/ partially, certified/per subject out of total number of
kindergarten teachers
• 3.2. The level of training quality
• 3.3. The extent to which the training was effective (knowledge gained was applied)
• 3.4. Kindergarten teachers participating in Peer Learning Activities PLA) out of total number of
kindergarten teachers
• 3.5. Extent to which training received covered new areas
• 3.6. Extent to which materials received covered new subjects/had new approaches
• 3.7. The extent to which materials were used in classrooms/were useful (no of classrooms with new
teaching materials)
• 3.8. Number of kindergartens teachers participating in extra-curricular activities
• 3.9. Number of activities carried out together with parents
According to the school’s principal, more than half of the teachers have participated directly in trainings
conducted under QIE intervention and all the teachers in the school supported the activities that have been
carried out. All teachers participating in the interviews have attended vocational training courses and most
developed complementary skills as a parenting educator and/or project writing and implementation skills
(micro-grants).
Regarding the training of specialized professional skills/teaching skills, it "exceeded expectations" (teacher)
through the organization of sessions and the training methods that have been used. According to the school
principal, the teachers, because of the "chase for credits" that are easier to obtain in order to ensure their job
continuity, did not know what to choose, lost their motivation and become very individualistic. The teachers
mention that the residential organization of training allowed them to get to know each other better outside of
school, to get closer and to work in teams.
On the other hand, due to the applicative nature of the training, from the practical reading of the reference
documents (curriculum) to the teaching methods that they have learned in an experientially manner, the project
has been considered by teachers a unique training experience: “I liked so much experiment that we have done,
that I turned to my sister abroad to get me the package of substances ... and the children were happy” (chemistry
teacher); "I have understood the differences between the old and the new curriculum, how to make the transition
from primary to secondary education .... I have implemented what I have learned in these courses and it had a
positive impact both in the classroom and seen in children's results” (mathematics teacher); "I have learned to
work with the method of dramatization and since then I’m applying it continuously because it produces learning
naturally" (teacher, primary education).
The benefits in terms of both didactic area and non-formal communication with schoolchildren and parents
have been mentioned by all interviewees. The schoolchildren have noticed that teachers “explain more”, “do
extracurricular activities”, “make us work in a team”, “some are friendlier” and especially have appreciated the
artistic activities organized by the drawing and music teacher.
The relaxed, sometimes playful character of the trainings, and at the same time very structured, with effects
both in terms of professionalization and personal life, are aspects mentioned by the participants in the training
courses for parenting educators: “I am a timid person, but through the courses I managed to cope with such
activities, I went out of my comfort zone” (teacher, primary education).
Regarding the training activities addressed to teachers working with preschoolchildren, the interviewees
mention benefits related to learning to collaborate with each other and with primary school colleagues and with
parents, purchasing teaching materials for each group and successfully organizing activities through micro-
grants: "we can't do extracurricular activities with the children from kindergarten without involving their parents,
so I have learned how to really collaborate with them and all the parents participated” (teacher, primary
education).
301
EQ 7. Which parts of the modelling project/QIE component are most and least effective? What factors
explain the success?
The interviewees have considered that the effects produced by each of the components of the intervention could
not have been generated and maintained if they did not support each other in a holistic approach towards an
inclusive education. Starting from what they have learnt experientially or what had the strongest impact,
schoolchildren have mentioned the activities in micro-grants (extracurricular) and parenting education
sessions, parents have mentioned parenting sessions and parenting counseling sessions, teachers have pointed
out teaching skills training sessions, parenting education sessions and micro-grants and the manager has
mentioned, as a priority, the technical assistance in the project, also the micro-grants and the complex and
complementary trainings of the teachers.
According to the teachers, the application in the classroom of the skills acquired during trainings would not
have been enough if there was not a whole emulation for openness and collaboration at the level of the school
community and beyond. And the initiation of parents 'participation in extracurricular activities, in parenting
education and counseling sessions, the involvement of the local administration (e.g. for financial support of
schoolchildren' travel to activities outside the locality, or collaboration with the school mediator), carrying out
actions through micro-grants, teamwork of teachers and other would not have been possible without the
support activities for the school management that provided structure and trust.
The school principal considers that the teachers have benefited from professionalization in a coherent and
authentic way, both due to the quality of the trainings and to the fact that they participated voluntarily in large
numbers and the effects spread also to the group / team of teachers functioning in the benefit of the
schoolchildren.
Regarding the structural factors of the project, that have generated positive effects, we emphasize the following:
the holistic approach of the intervention, the emphasis on changing the approach regarding the vulnerable child,
structuring the intervention in predefined steps for new skills and generating professional skills in a group
context, involving all stakeholders in supporting the intervention.
Among the contextual factors that can explain the success of QIE intervention in initiating change at Frumoasa
School, we believe that it is important to emphasize the spirit of initiative, mutual aid practices (volunteering)
and transgenerational resilience specific to the vast majority of the community; the personal example of
initiative, the determination and enthusiasm of school’s principal; the valorization within the community and
school of artistic activities, especially the music related ones, which created the context of Roma community
valorization (community of musicians/fiddlers); the emotional attachment of most of the teachers to the school
and the competitive (performance) spirit of most of the teachers.
EQ8. Are there any unplanned outcomes worth considering for filling in capacity gaps and/or
addressing remaining bottlenecks?
Among the unexpected effects, the interviewees have mentioned:
- Increasing parents' self-confidence and expectations regarding their involvement in the educational
process (mothers expressed the expectation that fathers would attend more parenting and counseling
sessions)
- Friendship, closeness between teachers after attending together training courses and extracurricular or
project management activities
- Changes on a personal level for teachers
- Due to parenting counseling component of the project, Frumoasa School has been able to include in the
organizational chart a part-time job for educational counselor and it has been covered by the teacher who
was initiated in this field during the project trainings.
- As a result of the improvement of technical skills for developing projects, the participation in a mobility
project in the field of school education (ERASMUS) in which 8 school teachers have attended sessions for
the development of specialized and transversal skills
- The impossibility to solve two cases of school dropout (a girl and a boy from the same Roma family), despite
frequent intervention and communication with the family. The family has several children in school, but in
the case of the two older ones the family made a decision that was not totally under their control (the
302
daughter became pregnant, got married and went to another locality and the boy had to work to supplement
the family income)
- The long-term value of the acquired skills and their value in learning situations (online) that could not be
anticipated (due to the current context of the COVID pandemic): development of decentralized education
scenarios at school level, complex organization of activities, writing projects for funds / health materials ,
teamwork of teachers, their ability to use technology and set priorities in teaching and learning for
vulnerable schoolchildren, good relationships between schoolchildren to support distance collaboration,
partnership with families in learning, the ability to manage with the help of the local community difficult
situations.
Efficiency
EQ 9. Does the modelling project use resources in the most economical/efficient manner to achieve
expected results?
• Only if evidences were collected related to activities/approaches which could have been done
simpler/faster.
EQ 10. What is the value added (in terms of financial value) of the modelling project? –
• Have QIE generated more projects and/or fund raised in the schools?
According to the school manager, the efficiency with which the actions in the project were carried out is fully
demonstrated by the produced effects. On one hand, the allocation of resources was flexible - for example, the
addition of 50% places for parenting educators was accepted, the organization of sessions with parents was
adapted to their program, and so on, local authorities supported actions with resources when necessary and on
the other hand, there was no compromise on objectives, timetable and quality standards (all modules were held
in parental counseling, micro-grant activities were successfully completed). According to all those involved,
including parents and schoolchildren, the allocation of resources has been sufficient and necessary, as these
actions could not initially be carried out more simply or with fewer resources.
The QIE intervention, through the technical assistance provided for identifying targets, directions of action,
resources, generated additional resources for the school, respectively 18,600 Euro through an Erasmus mobility
project in the field of school education in which 8 teachers of the school have attended, abroad, sessions for the
development of specialized and transversal competencies.
Also, according to the school principal and interviewed teachers, in the context of the pandemic that affected
the traditional teaching process in 2020, the development of the school strategy for intervention and the
required resources, based on projects developed by the team of teachers, could not have been optimal.
Sustainability
EQ 12 Are the interventions modelled likely to continue when external support is withdrawn?
• Continuity of employment of trained teachers and managers
• Extent to which funds are secured for the continuation of activities
• Extent to which relevant stakeholders intend to continue the intervention in a certain timeframe
• Commitment of QIE stakeholders to continue using the knowledge, approach and tools acquired
under QIE beyond the lifetime of the project
• Why not? Risks to sustainability
According to the school management, the continuity of the intervention is maintained, as the school principal
together with the management team continues to develop action strategies for the school and write projects for
the necessary resources (health or digital) in the new context of distance learning. Also, during the interview,
the school management has expressed its concern that the actions of the school and local authorities have
become less complementary due to the change of priorities that took place at the city hall (as a consequence of
the recent local elections).
Also, despite the fact that most teachers are from the locality and are emotionally attached to the school, the
school principal mentions the risk that the mobility of human resources cannot be stopped, one of the causes
303
being the existing regulations, implemented by ISJ Bacău, that do not take into account local and individual
needs (e.g. taking into account the distance / commute costs).
The interviewed teachers have stated that they have increased and improved their repertoire of teaching
methods and that they continue to use them in class. They also have mentioned that the skills of adapting the
curriculum to the cases of vulnerable schoolchildren and digital skills are very useful in the context of distance
teaching-learning-assessment. The risk that they have identified in terms of sustainability is the loss of energy
to develop the activities in a different manner and the context of group emulation (which is already happening
due to isolation for pandemic control).
According to the school counselor, the support activities addressing parents continue in the Frumoasa school
and, even if they are more difficult to organize at a distance, the parenting educators have been using and
transferring elements of parenting education during the meetings with parents. The risk identified by the school
principal is that the relationship with the parents may become formal again after such a long pause of face-to-
face interaction in school (in the context of the pandemic). In this regard, he proposed to the school board that
parents take the initiative of organizing parenting groups.
According to all the teachers that have been interviewed, the more diverse and new extracurricular activities
are the least susceptible to continuity, in the absence of resources.
EQ 14. What are the lessons learned at each level of intervention that should be considered for
implementation and further replication of the modelling project?
• The focus here is the replication of the project (not the continuation) – what needs to be done in
orther for the same project to be implemented in other localities/counties? Other
measures/modification of the project as it is right now.
According to the interviewees, the package does not require modifications for replication and it is considered
that its value is reached precisely due to this structure. In terms of content, teachers have mentioned the need
for new topics in the training package for teachers (e.g. subjects in the arts curriculum) or for educational
counselors (e.g. management addressed to pupils returning to Romania after the experience of migration).
The main lessons learned at school level (management and teachers) are the following: the story of each
schoolchild must be known by the school and the intervention must address all cognitive, emotional, social
aspects; parents and the community only support the school if they know it from the inside and less formally;
local authorities must be informed on aspects related to the quality of education, not only on those related to
funds; learning, including trainings, and collaboration are more effective if done in a friendly climate;
extracurricular activities are essential for creating connections between schoolchildren, teachers, parents;
vulnerable schoolchildren gain more confidence in school if they have the opportunity to participate in activities
in which they are valued and receive responsibilities.
Impact
EQ 16. What change did the modelling project determine or influence at the level of beneficiaries
(children and their families), communities, professionals, public administration – at local, county
and/or national level?
1. Impact on all schoolchildren in schools
1.4. Perception on formally recording absences
1.5. Perception of children on school attractiveness
According to the interviewed schoolchildren, teachers in their class constantly record the absences and
motivate them with documents, according to the regulations. Between 2014 and 2019, according to the Internal
Quality Assessment Reports, there has been observed a decrease in absences per schoolchild from 7.4 to 5.2
(total of motivated and unmotivated absences). The positive evolution of the process of participation in school
activities is obvious: while the number of motivated absences have remained constant, the number of
unmotivated absences have decreased by half.
304
This process is associated, in the perception of all interviewees, especially with the attractiveness and broad
participation of schoolchildren in extracurricular activities organized through the micro-grants within the
project. These activities have created a favorable and a friendlier relational and learning context in the school.
This effect is also present at the level of compulsory activities. Further, the more relaxed didactic approach with
novelty elements, in which schoolchildren work in teams and offer each other mutual support, gave confidence
and support especially to those from vulnerable groups. In terms of family participation, the involvement of
parents with more responsibility in education has given coherence to this process.
2. Impact on schoolchildren at high risk of drop out
2.1. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project with improved school
attendance
2.2 Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who abandoned school
2.3. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who repeated the school year
2.4. Number of schoolchildren at risk monitored in the framework of the project who have better school
results
A comparative analysis of learning results for the school years 2014-2015 and 2018-2019 (beginning and end
of QIE package implementation), according to the data from the Annual Internal Quality Assessment Reports of
Frumoasa School, shows a positive impact of the project at the level of vulnerable groups only from the primary
cycle as follows: in 2019 the percentages of 2014 were practically reversed between the satisfactory level
(approximately 60% of schoolchildren in 2014) and the very good level (approximately 15% of schoolchildren
in 2014) for Romanian language and mathematics classes.
During the implementation of the project there were no cases of school dropout, and later, in the school year
2019-2020, the interview with the school principal and also the SIIR statistics mention 2 dropout cases - sister
and brother from the same family belonging to the Roma community. The school principal mentions this
situation as unexpected, as she monitored the cases closely and the pupils evolution seemed to be positive.
3. Impact on all children in early education
3.1. % of pre-schoolchildren with improved kindergarten attendance (by age groups)
According to the Internal Quality Assessment Reports, the situation of inclusion and participation in early
childhood education is not a problem in the community of Frumoasa village. The decrease in the number of
preschoolchildren, from 74 in 2014 to 55 in 2018-2019 can be associated with the process of demographic and
birth rate decline.
4. Impact on school management and school
4.1. Schools participating in the programme are more child-friendly (dimensions developed in survey)
4.2. Number of cases in which local authorities become involved in solving problemes encountered by schools
4.3. The extent to which knowledge gained during training was shared with other teachers.
4.4. The number cases in which the school director assisted teachers in class.
According to all those that have been interviewed, the school in Frumoasa is now friendlier due to the emulation
created by the project activities. Schoolchildren, teachers and parents know each other better, they got closer
and they work better in teams. As mentioned earlier, the project implemented by UNICEF managed to fix the
problems that have been caused by the system of trainings for credits, more specifically it managed to enhance
team spirit and motivation for collaboration and learning. As one teacher have concluded "We have a more
colorful school, that's for sure!" referring to the diversity that is recognized in all its forms - people and activities.
According to the school principal, knowing the school from the inside has generated the real partnership with
parents and the community. The local authorities have supported the educational actions within the project by
providing transport services for the activities that have been carried out outside the locality (visits, trips for
schoolchildren, parents, teachers) and human resources for the successful conduct of counseling activities
(nurse, social worker, school mediator). The development of teachers' skills and the experiencing of learning
305
and teamwork are maintained. The cases of schoolchildren from vulnerable categories are managed by the
educational counselor with the help of other teachers. However, the principal says that the most important
activity for her is to keep in touch with schoolchildren and parents, in school and beyond, until the change in
practices becomes more profound.
5. Impact on teachers
5.1. Number of teachers using diversity materials in classroom
5.2. Number of teachers using/extent to which teachers use adapted curriculum to various needs of children
at risk
5.3. Number of teachers using/extent to which teachers use new learning activities and new learning
contexts.
5.3. Turnover of teachers
According to the school principal, more than half of the teachers directly participated in the project and most of
them supported the activities and their colleagues (25 out of 26). All the teachers interviewed stated that they
have immediately applied in classroom what they have learned during trainings and experience exchange visits,
from group learning methods, scientific experiments or dramatizations that they have experienced to the
prioritization of what is essential and further adapt the curriculum to the schoolchild’s needs. Also, even though
the discipline taught by the arts teacher from the Frumoasa School was not included in the training package, the
teacher benefited from the learning experience within the team he coordinated for micro-grants.
During the interviews, all teachers have spoken about the unique and positive experiences that impacted them
personally and professionally, due to their participation in the project activities. They have mentioned that their
desire for improvement and career growth has enhanced.
6. Impact on early education teachers
6.1 % of early education teachers who diversified the activities undertaken with the children
6.2. % of early education teachers who introduced innovative approaches in their activities with children
According to the Internal Quality Assessment Reports, during the implementation period of UNICEF project, the
material resources of the kindergarten were improved through technical means (they were missing) and
teaching resources that allowed the educators to diversify the activities addressed to children. Further,
according to the statements of an educator, the organization of extracurricular activities through micro-grants
have involved for the first time all parents. Many of the methods learned in trainings and during the experience
exchanges visits were new and are perceived as didactic innovations.
7. Impact on family/parents
7.1. Number of parents with improved attitude as regards the benefits of education.
7.2. Number of parents with improved attitude as regards the benefits of parental education.
7.3. Number of parents with improved relathiship with their children
According to all parents and pupils that have been interviewed, the attitude and behavior of parents have
changed as a result of the project activities, especially due to their participating in parenting education sessions
or counseling activities. These activities have been a pleasant surprise for parents (“I didn't think I would like it”,
“I didn't think I could change”), children (“my daughter kept asking me what we were talking about that the
sessions take so long”), as well as for the parenting educators and the educational counselor (“and they were
delighted but also us, for the fact that it works”). According to the estimates of the school manager and parenting
educators, about half of the pupils' families have participated in parenting education or parenting counseling
sessions and about 90% of them have made positive changes regarding the support they offer their children in
the learning process. Moreover, parents have discussed more with teachers about children's learning progress,
have asked for advice on education and have become more understanding and curious about their own children.
Conclusions
306
All participants in the interviews conducted for the case study Frumoasa school consider that the project
implemented by UNICEF is relevant, useful and has brought significant benefits to its direct beneficiaries -
schoolchildren and parents, especially those from vulnerable groups. Briefly, the conclusions of the study are:
- School management and teachers requested later the entry into the project, considering that the project
objectives meet the needs of the local and school community, which is a large and heterogeneous
community (Csangos, Romanians and Roma) where over a third of school pupils were considered
vulnerable (working parents abroad, Roma, children in foster care, schoolchildren with SEN, schoolchildren
from poor families). This generated a strong motivation to participate and develop activities in order to
obtain the estimated results (In the project activities have participated more than half of the school
teachers, about half of the parents / guardians of the schoolchildren, all the schoolchildren of the school).
- The wide participation of schoolchildren in activities organized through micro-grants became the context
in which the school was able to activate in the non-formal area of learning and become a more relaxed
environment, more practical and attractive for children. The effects of QIE intervention for pupils were:
increasing motivation for learning and well-being at school; parents become more supportive of school and
extracurricular activities; better understanding of the community and learning within the community,
together with different groups of people - parents, the elderly, poor families, children of another ethnicity
/ denomination; understanding the concepts of tolerance and diversity, non-discrimination; developing
non-cognitive skills, such as artistic skills, communication and teamwork, mutual support,
entrepreneurship, self-knowledge and mutual knowledge; a better integration in the community and in
school of the Roma schoolchildren as a result of the participation especially in the extracurricular activities
in which they felt valued for their different talents.
- All interviewees, from the school manager to the schoolchildren, have noticed changes in most parents that
have attended parenting sessions and / or parenting counseling sessions, as follows: increasing the
willingness to participate in parenting education and counseling sessions, building a parenting learning
practice, enhanced awareness of the importance of education and their role in children's education,
increasing willingness to collaborate with the school.
- At the level of management and human resources development (manager, teachers, school counselor,
parenting educator) the intervention aimed mainly at changing the perspective towards the schoolchild;
developing the capacity of structuring a functional, operational development plan; increase the experience
in writing projects; building work teams; increasing the visibility of the school and the capacity to mobilize
the community and the authorities in support of the school's actions.
- According to the interviewees, the package does not require changes for replication and it is considered
that its value is achieved precisely because of this structure: holistic approach to intervention, emphasis on
changing the perspective regarding vulnerable child, adequate and flexible allocation of resources,
structuring the intervention in predefined steps when generating new skills and professional skills in a
group context, the involvement of all stakeholders in supporting the intervention.
- The main lessons learned at the school level are the following: the story of each schoolchild must be known
by the school and the intervention must address all cognitive, emotional, social aspects; parents and the
community only support the school if they know it from the inside and less formally; local authorities must
be informed on aspects regarding the quality of the educational process, not only those related to funds;
learning, including trainings, and collaboration are more effective if done in a friendly climate;
extracurricular activities are essential for creating connections between schoolchildren, teachers and
parents; vulnerable schoolchildren gain more confidence in school if they have the opportunity to
participate in activities in which they are valued and receive responsibilities.
- Among the contextual factors that explain the success of the QIE intervention at Frumoasa School, we
emphasize the following ones: the spirit of initiative, the practices of mutual support (volunteering) and the
transgenerational resilience specific to the community in its great majority; the personal example of
initiative, determination and enthusiasm of the school principal; the valorization within the community and
school of the artistic activities, especially the musical ones, which created the context of Roma community
valorization within the locality (community of musicians / fiddlers); the emotionally attachment of most of
the teachers to the school and their competitive (performance) spirit.

Annex 9. Concept of child-friendly school used
A rights-based, child-friendly school has two basic characteristics:
1. It is a child-seeking school — actively identifying excluded children to get them enrolled in school
and included in learning, treating children as subjects with rights and State as duty-bearers with
obligations to fulfill these rights, and demonstrating, promoting, and helping to monitor the rights
and well-being of all children in the community.
2. It is a child-centred school — acting in the best interests of the child, leading to the realisation of
the childés full potential, and concerned both about the "whole" child (including her health,
nutritional status, and well-being) and about what happens to children — in their families and
communities - before they enter school and after they leave it.
3. Above all, a rights-based, child-friendly school must reflect an environment of good quality
characterized by several essential aspects:
It is inclusive of children — it:
4. Does not exclude, discriminate, or stereotype on the basis of difference.
5. Provides education that is free and compulsory, affordable and accessible, especially to families
and children at risk.
6. Respects diversity and ensures equality of learning for all children (e.g., girls, working children,
children of ethnic minorities and affected by HIV/AIDS, children with disabilities, victims of
exploitation and violence).
7. Responds to diversity by meeting the differing circumstances and needs of children (e.g., based on
gender, social class, ethnicity, and ability level).
It is effective for learning — it:
8. Promotes good quality teaching and learning processes with individualizd instruction appropriate
to each child's developmental level, abilities, and learning style and with active, cooperative, and
democratic learning methods.
9. Provides structured content and good quality materials and resources.
10. Enhances teacher capacity, morale, commitment, status, and income — and their own recognition
of child rights.
11. Promotes quality learning outcomes by defining and helping children learn what they need to learn
and teaching them how to learn.
It is healthy and protective of children — it:
12. Ensures a healthy, hygienic, and safe learning environment, with adequate water and sanitation
facilities and healthy classrooms, healthy policies and practices (e.g., a school free of drugs,
corporal punishment, and harassment), and the provision of health services such as nutritional
supplementation and counseling.
13. Provides life skills-based health education.
14. Promotes both the physical and the psycho-socio-emotional health of teachers and learners.
15. Helps to defend and protect all children from abuse and harm.
16. Provides positive experiences for children.
It is gender-sensitive — it:
17. Promotes gender equality in enrolment and achievement.
312
18. Eliminates gender stereotypes.
19. Guarantees girl-friendly facilities, curricula, textbooks, and teaching-learning processes.
20. Socializes girls and boys in a non-violent environment.
21. Encourages respect for each others' rights, dignity, and equality.
It is involved with children, families, and communities — it is:
22. Child-centred - promoting child participation in all aspects of school life.
23. Family-focused — working to strengthen families as the child's primary caregivers and educators
and helping children, parents, and teachers establish harmonious relationships.
24. Community-based - encouraging local partnership in education, acting in the community for the
sake of children, and working with other actors to ensure the fulfillment of childrens' rights.

Annex 11. Ethical review certificate

Annex 12. Ethical considerations
Along the data collection, analysis and reporting, in order to ensure the integrity of evaluation, special attention
was paid by evaluators towards respecting the ethical standards of UNICEF, as presented in the “Procedure on
Ethical Standards in Data Collection, Evaluation and Research “(April 2015), particularly as concerns: the
320
harms and benefits, informed consent, privacy and confidentiality, payment and compensation, conflict of
interests.
The evaluators acted with integrity and honesty in their relationships with all stakeholders and respected the
ethical principles of the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Code of Conduct for Evaluation in the UN
System:
(1) Intentionality of the evaluation (Utility and necessity)
The rationale for conducting this evaluation has been clarified at the outset. The evaluators are fully aware that
this summative evaluation is conducted with the clear intention to use its results in informing decisions and
actions and with the purpose to make relevant and timely contribution to the development of legal and
institutional framework in the field of education in Romania.
(2) Obligations of evaluators
• Independence of judgement - the evaluation findings and recommendations are independently
presented
• Impartiality - the evaluators operated in an impartial and unbiased manner at all stages of the
evaluation. They collected diverse perspectives on the subject under evaluation and present impartial
and unbiased opinions on the modelling project strengths and weaknesses. The conclusions and
recommendations of the evaluation were discussed within the evaluation team ensuring that the
individual opinions of the evaluators are balanced and the result of the evolution is not affected by
personal bias.
• Credibility - all experts part of the team are highly qualified professionals, able to carry out the
assigned tasks within the timeframe set up while maintaining a qualitative standard for deliverables.
• Conflict of interest is avoided so that the credibility of the evaluation process is not undermined. None
of the proposed evaluators are in conflict of interest as they were not involved in the implementation,
design or previous evaluation of the modelling project. A Declaration for avoiding the conflict of
interest was filled in and signed by all evaluators at the beginning of the evaluation process.
(3) Honesty, integrity and accountability
• Honesty and Integrity – all evaluators are professionals and showed honesty and integrity in their
behaviour. They accurately presented the data collected and findings as well as the limitations and
uncertainties in data interpretation; no risk of bias arose during evaluation;
• Competence – all experts part of the team are highly qualified professionals able to carry out the
assigned tasks;
• Accountability – The evaluators are aware that they are accountable for the completion of the agreed
evaluation deliverables within the timeframe and budget agreed, while operating in a cost-effective
manner;
• Obligation to participants – The evaluators respected and protected the rights and welfare of human
subjects and communities, in accordance with the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other
human rights conventions. Evaluators respected differences in culture, local customs, religious beliefs
and practices, personal interaction, gender roles, disability, age and ethnicity, while using evaluation
instruments appropriate to the cultural setting. Evaluators ensured that all participants were treated
as autonomous agents, free to choose whether to participate in the evaluation, and ensured that the
relatively powerless are represented. Participation of children in the project activities aiming at data
collection were based on prior consent of parents. The information on project objective was presented
by using an easy understandable language (as more than one third of parents directly consulted proved
321
to have a low level of education). Evaluators were aware of and complied with legal codes (whether
international or national) governing the interviews with children.
The recruitment of stakeholders from the relevant institutions was made following their informed
consent to participate in the evaluation exercise. Participation in the evaluation was voluntary and no
reference was made on the names of respondents.
• Confidentiality - Evaluators respected people’s right to provide information in confidence and make
participants to interviews, focus-groups and surveys aware of the scope and limits of confidentiality,
while ensuring that sensitive information cannot be traced to its source.
• Avoidance of harm - Evaluators minimise any risks and harms to, and burdens on, the participants in
the evaluation, without compromising the integrity of the evaluation findings.
• Evaluation process transparency – The evaluators clearly communicated to stakeholders the
purpose of the evaluation, the criteria applied and the intended use of findings. Also, the evaluators
ensured that all stakeholders had a clear understanding of the questions addressed and any other
documents they are coming in contact with. The evaluation report was written in such a way to make
the link between evidence, findings, conclusions and recommendations transparent, persuasive and
proportionate to the body of evidence collected.
• Accessibility to those affected by evaluation – The evaluators provided information regarding the
evaluation process in accord to the contractual provisions agreed with UNICEF. The evaluation report
will be made public by UNICEF after the finalization of the evaluation process.
• Omissions and wrongdoing – N/A Evaluators did not find evidence of wrong-doing or unethical
conduct, thus there was no need to inform UNICEF and have it reported to the proper oversight
authority.
(4) Evaluation product
• Accuracy, completeness and reliability of report - Evaluators ensure that the evaluation report and
any other presentations are accurate, complete and reliable. Evaluators explicitly justified judgements,
findings and conclusions and showed their underlying rationale, so that stakeholders are in a position
to assess them.
• The evaluation was carried out with a human rights approach and observed the provisions of the
respective international regulations, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
of Discrimination Against Women and UNIDO’s Policy on Gender Equality and the
Empowerment of Women. In engaging children in the evaluation, the UN Convention on the Rights
of the Child and the UNICEF guidelines for participation of children was observed.
• Elements related to gender, equity and child rights were considered to the extent possible throughout
the evaluation process and in the evaluation report – including as a dedicated section where the
answer to EQ 4 is elaborated.
• The evaluated model is the intervention of a rights-based organization, therefore the evaluation
mainstreamed gender and human rights considerations throughout. The evaluation observed the
UNICEF’s guidelines on “Ethical Research involving Children” (2013). Disaggregation of data by
age and ethnicity was made whenever possible creating a basis to analyse not only human rights and
gender, but also equity issues. The methodological design of this evaluation was drafted based on a
mix of quantitative and qualitative approaches, both capturing gender differences and empowering
informants (especially the final beneficiaries). This was ensured by using participatory tools such as
focus group workshops and opened/semi-structured interviews. The evaluation team members were
322
guided to make use of their fieldwork skills addressing the enhancement of informants’ participation
in the process of data collection and to avoid traditional directive type of interaction.
• An Informed Consent Form was used to ensure the adults agreement for data collection among
children.
• In order to ensure representation of different groups in evaluation, the selection of the informants took
into account to the greatest extent possible the gender balance. Ethnic representation could not be
covered as, by Romanian law, belonging to an ethnical/racial group, can be based on only on the very
declaration of the respondent.
In order to carry out the evaluation in full accordance with the UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation
(including UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation and Data Collection and Analysis),
QURES organised, as required by the ToR, a basic ethics training of the enumerators and researchers, prior to
data collection launch.
