EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1. Evaluation purpose and scope
In January 2020 UNICEF Ghana engaged Coram International to conduct a Formative and Summative Evaluation of
its Child Protection Programme, covering programming from January 2012 to December 2019, across two
programme cycles (2012 – 2017 and 2018 – 2022). The purpose of the evaluation is to support learning and decision-
making to improve child protection outcomes for girls and boys in Ghana: to hold UNICEF accountable for its
contributions to child protection outcomes; to clarify the changes in child protection in Ghana that have been
brought about by UNICEF’s programme; and to determine whether the current programme has the right strategic
focus to contribute to strengthening the child protection system moving forward. The UNICEF Ghana Country Office
is the primary intended user of the evaluation. Other users include the UNICEF Regional Office for West and Central
Africa, the Government of Ghana, other UN agencies and NGOs, and development partners.
The evaluation's geographical scope is expansive, covering programming across Ghana at both national and sub-
national (regional, metropolitan and district) levels. It generates evidence in relation to 4 of the 6 evaluation criteria
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/Development Assistance Committee
(OECD/DAC), namely: relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability.1 In addition to these criteria, the
evaluation methodology incorporates UNICEF’s guiding principles of gender, human rights and equity.
1.2. Methodology
The evaluation employed a mixed methodology, drawing on the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative data,
whilst increasing opportunities for triangulation. In addition to drawing on existing evidence, the evaluation
involved the collection of a significant body of primary data. Data collection methods included:
- A standardised survey with social welfare officers and community development officers at district level
(n=120) to gather evidence on their child protection response work. Professionals were surveyed across 30
districts that received interventions from UNICEF and 30 ‘comparison’ districts;
- A KAP survey of both children and adults (n=1022), designed to investigate changes in the knowledge,
attitudes and practices (KAP) of communities targeted by UNICEF’s social and behaviour change
interventions. The survey was designed to identify changes in KAP which had occurred since a 2013
baseline. It was administered in areas where UNICEF has conducted community engagement work, as well
as in selected ‘comparison’ districts which had not received interventions;
- Key informant interviews (n= 159) with stakeholders at national, regional and district level;
- In-depth life history interviews (n = 87) with children and their caregivers whose cases had been subject
to a child protection intervention;
- Reviews of case files (n=80) maintained by district social welfare officers;
- Focus group discussions (n=242) with community members to gather qualitative evidence on attitudes
and norms around child protection issues.
Strict ethical guidelines were followed at all stages of the data collection and analysis.
1.3. Findings and Preliminary Conclusions
Relevance of UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme
Evaluation findings demonstrate a strong alignment between UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme’s design and
approaches and the Government of Ghana’s priorities in relation to violence against children, evidenced by an
analysis of GoG policies and plans, as well as interviews with Government representatives. UNICEF’s contributions
to strengthening the legal and policy framework for child protection and building the capacity of service providers
to implement that framework were found to be particularly relevant to national priorities. UNICEF’s commitment
was demonstrated by its willingness to divert from past approaches where these were not well aligned with needs
in Ghana.

The Child Protection Programme was also found to be relevant and responsive to the needs of children in Ghana.
Across research sites, respondents consistently described that UNICEF has taken a consultative approach to
programming; seeking out beneficiaries’ views and making relevant adjustments to meet their needs better.
However, evaluation findings suggest that in practice certain groups of children have been more difficult to reach
than others. In particular, findings suggest that street children require additional support and may have been
neglected by services delivered through the national child protection system.
Outcomes and Effectiveness of the Child Protection Programme2
Effectiveness of National Child Protection System Strengthening
UNICEF’s child protection programming was found to have made significant contributions to strengthening the
national child protection system in Ghana. When UNICEF’s 2012 programme cycle began, Ghana lacked an
institutional framework for the delivery of child protection response services. Recognising this gap, UNICEF worked
effectively with the Government of Ghana to develop a more strategic vision for child protection work. Significant
achievements include improvements to the legal and policy framework for children protection, particularly the
development of the Child and Family Welfare Policy and the Justice for Children Policy, as well as the establishment
of a comprehensive child protection response service delivered through district administrations as part of a broader
child protection system. These changes were recognised and valued by respondents, who emphasised the
importance of building an institutional framework for child protection work.
Evaluation findings also demonstrate that UNICEF made important contributions to strengthening the capacity of
social welfare authorities to deliver child protection services. In particular, UNICEF has succeeded in building the
capacity of district level social welfare staff to deliver child protection response services in line with the
Government’s case management SOPs. Whilst findings indicate that the application of case management
procedures is imperfect, a considerable proportion of service providers do report to be following the SOPs when
responding to CP cases, a significant change from past practice. Furthermore, findings demonstrate the
effectiveness of UNICEF’s interventions: the implementation of case management procedures was found to be
consistently stronger in districts that received UNICEF support compared to those that did not.
The degree to which this improved capacity has translated into outcomes for children exposed to violence or other
forms of child protection risk is less clear, particularly given that these cases were rarely found to be reaching the
child protection system. Findings revealed that the vast majority of child protection cases to which district level
social welfare authorities respond are child maintenance cases, followed by custody cases, and, to a less extent,
cases of parental neglect and abandonment. These findings are problematic, suggesting that the child protection
system is not yet fulfilling its core function of identifying and responding to cases where children are exposed to
violence or at risk of harm.
The evaluation identified a number of explanations for this trend. VAC cases continue to be handled by the Police
Service’s Domestic Violence Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU), and in some localities coordination between DOVVSU
and district social welfare authorities was found to be weak. Meanwhile, effective and reliable referral channels
between frontline professionals and district level social welfare authorities are lacking in many districts,
undermining identification of cases where children are at-risk3. Finally, findings point to a number of reporting
barriers, including stigma around child abuse and attitudes which are accepting of domestic violence, lack of
awareness of reporting channels and practical barriers, which make accessing services challenging or costly.
Effectiveness of community mobilisation and behaviour change
UNICEF’s child protection programme has included a number of behaviour change campaigns and community
mobilisation efforts, designed to transform attitudes and practices in relation to child protection. At the national
level this has involved the use of mass and social media to raise awareness, whilst at the local level, interventions
involved collaboration with local government to deliver a Social and Behaviour Change Communication toolkit.
UNICEF supported campaigns were found to have achieved an impressive reach: findings from the KAP survey
indicate that the national ‘Ghanaians Against Child Abuse’ campaign has had widespread coverage in communities
across Ghana, and 70 per cent of respondents in intervention communities said that they had participated in
awareness-raising activities. The participatory methodology applied in the application of the toolkit was found to
2 This evaluation covers UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme across all of its many components, however the executive summary presents
findings on the effectiveness of two main areas of programming: strengthening the national child protection system and community mobilisation
and behaviour change.
3 There is some evidence that districts that have received UNICEF interventions, particularly those that were part of the ‘policy to practice
initiative’, are more likely to receive referrals from the police, community members and DOVVSU.

be particularly effective in promoting community engagement, and 99.2 per cent of participants said that they
would recommend activities to a friend.
As well as achieving widespread reach and endorsement, analysis of the data from the KAP surveys provides
evidence that UNICEF’s campaign and mobilisation efforts may be having a significant impact in contributing to
transforming community norms and behaviours related to child protection. Respondents in the KAP surveys were
asked a range of questions about their attitudes and practices in relation to a variety of relevant topics, and changes
in results from baseline (2013) to endline (2020) were compared in both UNICEF intervention4 and non-intervention
communities. Overall, the findings indicate a significant improvement over time in attitudes and practices across a
range of issues, including: family separation, violence against children, child marriage, child justice and help seeking
behaviour. Yet despite the changes which occurred, there were no significant differences in rates of change in
UNICEF intervention sites compared to comparison sites, making it hard to determine whether changes can be
directly attributed to UNICEF’s campaign and mobilisation efforts.
Evidence from the KAP survey suggests that behaviours related to violence against children may be particularly
‘sticky’, or difficult to shift. Analysis of the data demonstrates a small but significant reduction in rates of violence
against children from baseline to endline.5 However, there were no significant improvements in rates of violence
in UNICEF intervention compared to control sites, and rates of change in intervention sites concerning attitudes
towards corporal punishment and children’s experiences of domestic and emotional violence were found to be
particularly slow. Whilst social norms endorsing violence against children are widespread and entrenched, drivers
of violence against children include structural factors such as poverty, low levels of education, lack of opportunity,
gender inequalities and children’s position of dependency in families and communities. These are complex factors
that may not be effectively addressed by sensitisation messaging alone.
Efficiency of UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme
UNICEF’s Child Protection programme was successful in mobilising significant financial resources to support its
system strengthening approach over both the 2012 – 2017 and 2018 – 2022 programme cycles. This is a notable
achievement given that UNICEF Country Offices have often struggled to obtain funding for CPSS work, as ‘issue
based’ programming tends to be more popular amongst donors6. The Child Protection Section was innovative in
recognising that funding for an ‘issue’ can be incorporated into a system strengthening approach and utilising issue-
based funding to promote their broader systems strengthening objectives.
A lack of sufficient resources continues to hinder child protection outcomes in Ghana, however. Evaluation findings
demonstrate that district-level child protection services remain underfunded, resulting in significant disruptions to
their effective delivery. Adequate funding for local child protection response services is critical to ensuring that
resources are used efficiently within the child protection system. Without this component of the child protection
system in place, the efficiency of other investments made by UNICEF, the GoG and other partners, are likely to be
undermined, as cases are missed and duplication and fragmentation are more likely to occur. UNICEF has
acknowledged the lack of sufficient resources for frontline social workers, and the Child Protection Programme has
undertaken initiatives aimed at advocating for budget commitments from Government at central, regional and
MMDA levels, but significant work remains to be done.
Sustainability of UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme
Evaluation findings suggest that many programme outcomes have been institutionalised, enshrined in law, policy
or practice, and are therefore likely to continue even after programming ends or changes its focus. Evidence also
demonstrates that the GoG is increasingly taking ownership of programme activities. The next step in promoting
sustainable child protection outcomes is to ensure that policy level achievements translate into effective child
protection prevention and response services on the ground. This will require the GoG to commit sufficient funds to
service delivery and highlights the need for UNICEF to continue to prioritise achieving budget commitments from
the government.
UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has made considerable contributions to building the capacity of Ghanaian
government counterparts at national and sub-national levels, and this support was found to have resulted in
genuine improvements in the abilities and practices of beneficiaries. UNICEF’s programme design has been

conducive to sustaining capacities in the longer term. UNICEF developed materials, manuals and tools, which can
continue to be used by relevant agencies going forward, and, wherever possible, supported the integration of
training materials into national curricula to ensure their continued use. Whilst is too early to comment definitively
on the sustainability of capacities generated through the Programme, findings clearly indicate that they have the
potential to continue after the Programme’s conclusion.
Gender equality7
Efforts have been made to mainstream gender in the child protection programme by recruiting a dedicated gender
specialist and developing a Child Protection Programme Gender Strategy for the 2018-22 programme.8 While child
protection responses are evenly split by gender, the low number of child abuse cases overall suggests that a
significant proportion of cases involving violence, neglect and abuse are not receiving an appropriate response, a
phenomenon likely to affect girls more seriously than boys given their higher vulnerability. Whilst social and
behaviour change programming has raised awareness of gender equality and shifted some norms, particularly those
related to women’s economic empowerment and child marriage, much work remains to be done to address
entrenched norms and to reduce the high levels of violence reported by girls in Ghana.
1.4. Lessons learned
A number of ‘lessons learned’ emerged from the evaluation, which can be used to inform future programming:
1. Legal reform is more likely to be successful when it is evidence based, drawing on analysis of existing laws, solid
empirical evidence on the issues at stake and consultation and engagement with stakeholders.
2. Building a fully functioning child protection system requires sufficient resourcing, a continuum of services,
monitoring and oversight and community engagement in addition to a legislative and institutional framework; it
requires a long-term commitment to realise.
3. The identification and referral of suspected child abuse cases is an essential step in child protection system
building and requires both effective referral processes and widespread training and awareness-raising.
4. Strengthening prevention and early intervention can promote an effective, efficient and sustainable child
protection system. Acting early when risk is first identified can prevent cases from reaching crisis point.
5. Coordination amongst different bodies with child protection duties and roles is key to ensuring effective
implementation of the child protection system and delivering outcomes for children.
6. In contexts where particular forms of violence are normalised, shifting attitudes and practices requires that
sensitisation messaging be integrated with other programming approaches (social welfare, livelihoods, etc).
7. Building an effective foster care service requires appropriate funding for foster families and sufficient support
from a social service workforce.
8. Gender empowerment programming may produce unintended consequences and must be done sensitively in
order to avoid reinforcing stigma or discrimination.
1.5. Final Conclusions
The findings of this evaluation demonstrate that UNICEF Ghana’s Child Protection Programme has made significant
contributions to strengthening the national child protection system in Ghana. In addition to being well aligned with
UNICEF’s global strategies, the programme’s system strengthening approach was found to be highly relevant in the
Ghanaian context. UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has made significant contributions to addressing gaps in
Ghana’s child protection system. A number of important outcomes of this work include: institutionalising a social
welfare workforce at the district level and building the capacity of that workforce to deliver child protection
response services; establishing frameworks for alternative care and justice reform and models for service delivery,
and building duty bearer’s capacity to implement those frameworks and models, and supporting the delivery of
community mobilisation and awareness campaigns which achieved remarkable coverage and high levels of public
approval; amongst many others. The Child Protection Programme employed an efficient design and was effective
in mobilising resources across diverse partners and stakeholders. Many of its achievements are likely to remain after
programming has ended or changed focus, and the programme’s capacity building work has generated capacities

which are likely to be sustained. Yet, the evaluation also identified a number of barriers that have limited the degree
to which this work has translated into outcomes for children and will potentially undermine the efficiency and
sustainability of the child protection system going forward. Addressing these should be the focus of upcoming
programme cycles.
1.6. Recommendations
A number of recommendations emerged from the evaluation. These were validated, discussed and developed
during a participatory workshop held with key stakeholders in Accra on 24 March 2021 to ensure that they are
actionable and appropriate to the Ghanaian context. The main recommendations include:
1. Capacity building and training: UNICEF should continue to support efforts to develop the capacity of child
protection and justice professionals, building on the work that has been done, and continue to support the
institutionalisation of pre-service and in-service training. Training on child protection for health care professionals
should be prioritised.
2. Referrals: It is recommended that UNICEF advocate with the Ministries of Health and Education to ensure that
health clinics, hospitals, pre-schools and schools nominate at least one child protection focal point or ‘champion’,
who should receive training and be responsible both for raising awareness of child protection amongst children and
staff and for making case referrals to the Department of Social Welfare and Community Development.
3. Case management: UNICEF should provide technical assistance to the Department of Social Welfare and the
Ministry of Justice to support the establishment of alternative mechanisms for addressing maintenance cases, such
as a Child Maintenance Service attached to the Family tribunal.
4. Community based services (fostering): UNICEF should continue to advocate with the Ministry of Gender and the
Ministry of Finance to provide further resources to the Foster Care Fund and, in particular, to cover the expenses of
a foster child. UNICEF should also continue to advocate to DSW at different levels to provide social work support to
foster families.
5. Coordination between social welfare and the police: It is recommended that UNICEF support the development
of a joint working protocol specifically between the DoVVSU and the Department of Social Welfare and Community
Development. This should be done as a priority and should accompany the roll-out of the Inter-Sectoral Standard
Operating Procedures.
6. Information management systems: UNICEF should work closely with the MoGCSP, the MoLGRD decentralised
Departments of Social Welfare and Community Development, and other relevant stakeholders to support the roll-
out of the Social Welfare Information Management System in all districts through the provision of coaching, training
and (where necessary) information technology.
7. Children’s services plans: UNICEF should support MMDAs to develop a bi or tri-annual children’s plan, which
would enable them to provide more effective and efficient child protection services. In preparing the plan, reference
should be made to the Social Services Directory which covered available services in 260 district areas. Case
management data and records should also be reviewed to help assess the likely demand for services within each
district. This information would assist the district in prioritising services and budgeting accordingly.
8. Social norms and behaviour change: UNICEF should review its communication programmes in light of the findings
on knowledge, attitudes and practices, and accompany sensitisation interventions with programming to address
structural drivers of entrenched norms.

INTRODUCTION
In January 2020, UNICEF Ghana engaged Coram International to conduct a Formative and Summative
Evaluation of its Child Protection Programme.9
UNICEF has been present and working in Ghana since 1982 and has achieved important results in child
protection. Challenges still remain in the high tolerance for violence against children, inconsistent
application of child protection laws and policies, and capacity gaps in the child protection system. Since
2012, a system-strengthening approach has been adopted, moving away from the previous focus on
issue-based programming.
This evaluation covers UNICEF Ghana’s child protection work from January 2012 to December 2019,
which occurred under two different country programme cycles (2012 to 2017 and 2018 to 2022). Its
primary purpose is to support learning and decision-making to improve child protection outcomes for
girls and boys in Ghana. The evaluation will also hold UNICEF accountable for its contributions to child
protection outcomes. By examining, collecting and analysing evidence, the evaluation will help to clarify
the changes in child protection in Ghana that have been brought about by UNICEF’s child protection
programmes, and whether the current programme has the right strategic focus to contribute to the
development and strengthening of the child protection system moving forward.
The evaluation draws on a variety of evidence sources to answer evaluation questions pertaining to the
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of UNICEF’s child protection work, as well as to
cross-cutting questions of gender, equity and human rights. Evidence gathered includes extensive
qualitative and quantitative data collection in all 16 of Ghana’s regions and representing a wide variety
of beneficiaries and stakeholders, from government partners and donors to district social workers and
children who have experienced different aspects of the child protection programme.

CONTEXT OF THE EVALUATION
3.1. Child protection context
There is a high prevalence of violence against children in Ghana and dominant social norms permit the
use of physical punishment both at home and in schools. According to figures from the Domestic Violence
Victim Support Unit, in 2015 there were 14,810 cases of violence against children reported, with the most
common offences being assault (5,361 cases) and non-maintenance (4,685 cases).10 The issue of child
maintenance can be considered a form of neglect or parental irresponsibility and is thus a child protection
issue. In 2016, there were 2,261 complaints about child rights abuses made to the Commission on Human
Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ), with child maintenance being the most commonly reported.11
Survey data suggests that the actual prevalence of violence against children is much higher than formal
reports might suggest. In a 2013 baseline report, 44 per cent of adults said that they physically punish
their children, and 24 per cent said that a child in their household had been beaten by an adult at home
in the past month. 14.5 per cent of children aged 14 to 17 said they had been beaten at home in the past
month, and 58 per cent said that they were beaten regularly by an adult at home between the ages of 2
and 14. When asked how their teacher disciplines them, by far the most common response was ‘hitting
or physically hurting’.12 Data from 2011 and 2017 indicates that there has been little change in prevalence
in the intervening years, with 94 per cent of children aged 2 to 14 experiencing physical punishment or
psychological aggression from their caregivers during the previous month.13
Only a small number of children enter the formal care system, with the majority of such children placed
in residential care despite ongoing efforts to deinstitutionalise children.14 ‘Formal care’ is defined as “All
care provided in a family environment which has been ordered by a competent administrative body or
judicial authority, and all care provided in a residential environment, including in private facilities,
whether or not as a result of administrative or judicial measures”. ‘Residential care’ is defined as “care
provided in any non-family-based group setting, such as places of safety for emergency care, transit
centres in emergency situations, and all other short- and long-term residential care facilities, including
group homes”.15 A mapping exercise undertaken in October 2016 identified 115 residential homes,
providing care for 3,586 children. Just over half of these homes (53 per cent) were located in three
regions: Greater Accra (21 per cent); Ashanti (18 per cent) and Volta (14 per cent), and two-thirds of all
children living in residential homes were in three Regions: Greater Accra (30 per cent), Ashanti (22 per
cent) and Central (12 per cent).16
Gender-based violence is also widespread, with almost a third of women (32.4 per cent) aged 15 to 49
agreeing that a husband can be justified in beating his wife.17 Among women aged 20 to 24, one in five
were married before age 18 and the highest levels of early marriage are seen among those who reside in

rural areas, live in poor households and have little or no education.18 Forms of violence intersect, with
young women who were married before the age of 18 being more likely than their never-married peers
to say that wife-beating is justified.19 There has been progress in some areas, however, with the
prevalence of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) among women aged 15 to 49 declining from 3.8
per cent in 2011 to 2.4 per cent in 2017/18 and from 1.5 per cent to 0.6 per cent among those aged 15
to 19.20 Ghana has made relatively good progress in reducing early marriage, with a 2 per cent annual
rate of reduction on average (ranking 7th out of 24 countries in West and Central Africa). Most regions
have seen considerable reductions in child marriage over the past 35 years, though progress has been
slower in the Northern and Eastern regions.21
Other harmful traditional practices are also seen in Ghana, such as widow inheritance, harmful mourning
rituals, and witchcraft accusations. According to an anti-witchcraft accusation coalition, there are six
‘witch camps’ in Ghana with between 1,000 and 1,200 children resident.22 There are also reports that
children as young as 7 are sent to ‘prayer camps’ for those with disabilities, where there are reports that
they are forcibly restrained and deprived of food.23
Court data from 2011 to 2013 showed a relatively low number of children being formally processed
through the justice system, with 120 juvenile cases in 2011, 151 in 2012, and 173 in 2013. Theft was the
most common offence (51 per cent), followed by assault / causing harm (18 per cent) and sexual
offences24 (12 per cent). Boys were much more likely than girls to be in conflict with the law, representing
87 per cent of offenders.25 In 2016 DSW recorded that the probation services managed 974 juveniles, and
28 were on remand.26 There are few statistics on children in detention but there are some reports that
juveniles are being detained in adult prisons.27
Birth registration has increased in recent years but substantial variation by wealth and rurality remains,
with just 55 per cent of children in the poorest households registered compared to 86 per cent of those
in the richest, and 64 per cent of rural children registered compared to 80 per cent of urban children.28
Ghana is judged to have made a moderate advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labour,
though many children, particularly in rural areas, are still working. Nearly a quarter (24.7 per cent) of
children aged 5 to 14 are working, with the main sector being agriculture (including fishing). Child labour
in the cocoa sector is a particular concern. It is estimated that 770,000 children were engaged in child
labour in cocoa production in 2018/19, including approximately 710,000 who were exposed to at least
one component of hazardous child labour. In cocoa-growing areas, 51 per cent of children in agricultural
households were engaged in hazardous work in cocoa production.29 A quarter (25.3 per cent) of children
aged 7 to 14 combine work and school.30 Analysis of data from the Ghana Living Standards Surveys in

2005 and 2012 demonstrates an increase in children’s employment from 13 per cent to 29 per cent. This
increase is driven primarily by an increase in the proportion of children combining work and school (from
7 per cent to 25 per cent), while the proportion of children solely in employment (i.e. not also attending
school) decreased.31

3.2. Legal and policy framework for child protection
Ghana’s recognition of universal children’s rights through the ratification of the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) has introduced new social norms and political obligations.
In order to meet the obligations of Article 19 and 20 of the UNCRC, Ghana is required to provide State
child protection services where a child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm due to abuse,
neglect or exploitation as a result of the care (or lack thereof) that is being offered by their caregiver.46
Ghana was the first country to ratify the UNCRC on 29 June 1990. Since that date it has ratified many but
not all of the major international instruments related to child protection.47 Ghana has also ratified the

African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (2005). The 1992 Constitution requires the State
to be guided by these international instruments and mandates Parliament to enact laws to ensure
children’s rights, including the right to measures of special care and assistance, and to protect children
from exposure to physical and moral hazards, from engaging in work that constitutes a threat to health,
education or development, and from torture or other cruel, inhumane, or degrading punishment.48
While important progress had been made in child protection in Ghana, up until 2012 the framework for
responding to and preventing child abuse was not sufficiently coherent. Only small numbers of children
were reached, and there was a lack of efficiency throughout the system. 49 In 2012, UNICEF and the
Government of Ghana committed to a system’s strengthening approach and developed a more strategic
vision for child protection in Ghana.50 This included a goal of a comprehensive legal framework for child
protection that fully reflected and incorporated international standards and norms, while also
considering the local context. Under this approach, three key policies were developed, providing the
framework for the child protection system-strengthening agenda: the Child and Family Welfare Policy,
adopted in February 2015, the Justice for Children Policy, adopted in November 2015 and the Ghana
National Medium-Term Development Policy Framework 2018-2021. The policies have three main
purposes: To strengthen and enforce the legal environment, to improve services and to address
behaviour that is inimical to children’s best interests. In addition, the Children’s (Amendment) Act 2016
(Act 937) was passed, which amended the Children’s Act of 1998 (Act 560) and adopted the Hague
Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, as well
as introducing provisions on the management of domestic and intercountry adoption and foster care.
The following sections outline the legal framework for various aspects of child protection in Ghana in
more detail.
Child welfare
The Children’s Act, 1998 provides for the rights of the child, including health, education, name and
nationality, and social activity. It covers issues of parental duties and responsibilities, adoption and
fosterage, and protects children from discrimination, exploitative labour, forced betrothal or marriage,
and torture and degrading treatment. Contravention of any of these provisions is an offence and is liable
to a fine of up to 5 million GHC, or to one year in prison, or both.51
The Children’s Act also outlines the legislative process for responding to children in need of care and
protection, including the duty of the District Assembly to protect the welfare and promote the rights of
children, and the duty of the Department of Social Welfare and Community Development of a District
Assembly to investigate any contravention of children’s rights. The Act provides for the removal of a child
to a place of safety if a child is deemed in need of immediate care and protection, and for parental rights
to be transferred to the Department if in the child’s best interests.52 However, the Act does not include
an explicit preference for interventions that promote family preservation or reintegration, and there is
no clear statement of the principle of institutionalisation as a last resort.53

The Children’s (Amendment) Act 2016 (ACT 937) introduced amendments to the Children’s Act 1998 (ACT
560) to include an expanded definition of children in need of care and protection, the introduction of
guiding principles regarding the best interests of the child, and a requirement for mandatory background
checks for those who work with children.54
Other laws with relevance to child welfare include the Domestic Violence Act, 2007 (ACT 732), which
provides criminal and civil remedies, including compensation, for victims of psychological, sexual,
economic, and emotional, verbal or psychological violence. The Act provides for the removal of the victim
to a place of safety and the issuing of a protection order.55
The Ghana Education Service has banned the use of corporal punishment in schools and published
guidelines for the use of positive discipline, but the practice of corporal punishment still continues in the
home.56 The Children’s Act 1998 prohibits any form of correction that is “unreasonable in kind or in
degree according to the age, physical and mental condition of the child”, thus implicitly allowing the use
of correction deemed “reasonable”. Furthermore, Article 41 of the Criminal Code 1960 states that a “blow
or other force may be justified for the purpose of correction” by a parent, guardian, schoolmaster or
other person authorised to inflict correction on a child under 16 years of age.
Ghana expressed its commitment to prohibiting all corporal punishment of children, including in the
home, by clearly accepting the recommendations made as part of the Universal Periodic Review of Ghana
in 2017.57 This was followed up by the MoGCSP in July 2018 in a position paper on corporal punishment,
which recommended that there should be an amendment of the Criminal Code and the Children’s Act to
prohibit corporal punishment in all forms and settings.58
Although the Children’s Act, together with other Laws mentioned above, the Juvenile Justice Law and the
Human Trafficking Act, can be considered as a step towards ensuring a comprehensive legal framework
for child protection, the level of implementation of the different laws has been variable and incomplete,
reducing their effectiveness.
Alternative care
The Children’s Act, 1998, provides for the establishment of residential homes for children by either the
Government or a NGO, subject to the Minister’s approval. The Act also outlines the procedure for
admission of a child to the home and grants the Department of Social Welfare and Community
Development of the MMDAs the right to monitor and inspect residential homes.59
Under the 2012 – 2017 and the 2018 – 2022 Child Protection Programmes, further work has been
undertaken to protect children in alternative care with the support and technical assistance of UNICEF.
Revised National Standards for Residential Homes for Children in Ghana were developed in 2018,
together with Standard Operating Procedures for Inspection, Licensing, and Monitoring Residential
Homes for Children in Ghana.60 Foster Care Regulations were also passed in 201861 and following this, a

Foster Care Operational Manual was published to provide guidance to Department of Social Welfare
officers and Foster Care Agencies on the delivery of foster care services.62
The Cabinet approved Ghana’s accession to the Hague Convention on inter-country adoption in 2016. In
line with acceding to the Hague Convention, the Children’s Act was amended the same year to establish
a Central Authority for adoption.63 Domestic adoption has also been the subject of new regulations,
which Parliament approved in 2018.64
In addition to the many sets of Regulations, the Government produced a manual for routine monitoring
of the alternative care system in 2018, which provides guidance on how to collect and report data on
children in formal alternative care, including residential homes, foster care, adoption, and those who
have been reunified or reintegrated into family-based care.65
Birth registration
The Children’s Act also lists birth registration as part of parental duties and responsibilities.66 It is also
compulsory under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, to register births within twenty-one days of
the date of birth. A fee must be paid to register births outside of this period.67 The Births and Deaths
Registry, under the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, is responsible for directing,
coordinating and monitoring the birth registration process throughout Ghana. It establishes local
registration offices, provides registration materials and supervises the work of the local offices.68 The
Standard Operating Procedures for Civil Registration and Vital Statistics System of Ghana set out the
standardised approach to and guidelines for the registration of births to ensure a uniform registration
process across the country.69
The enactment of the Decentralisation Act, 2016 (ACT 936) has resulted in the decentralisation of births
and deaths registration, with the Births and Death Registry now a department of the district assemblies.
A Registration of Births and Death Bill 2016 was drafted by MoLGRD, with support from UNICEF, and
finally became law in November 2020 (the Registration of Births and Deaths Act 2020 (ACT 1027)). The
intention is that the Births and Deaths Registry will have a digital interface with other systems, such as
the Ghana Health Service and the Ghana Statistical Service and provide for the generation of Community
Population Registers. These measures should improve knowledge about local populations and enable far
more effective development planning. The new Births and Deaths Registration Act also provides for the
registration of surrogate babies and introduces the concept of notification of births and identifies primary
notifiers, including persons in charge of health facilities and traditional birth attendants who must provide
information to the authorities.70
Child labour and child trafficking
Ghana has ratified a number of the key international conventions concerning child labour, but has yet to

Convention on Domestic Work (Convention 189)72 and the Protocol to the Forced Labour Convention
(Convention 29).73
Forced labour is prohibited under the Constitution, the Labour Act,74 the Human Trafficking Act,75 and the
Human Trafficking Prohibition Legislative Instrument. In addition, the Children’s Act prohibits
exploitative child labour and sets the minimum age of employment at 15 years, or 13 years for light work
deemed unlikely to be harmful to a child or to affect the child’s attendance at school, in line with the
UNCRC. The Act prohibits night work and certain types of hazardous labour for those under 18. It also
sets out the responsibility of employers, including those of apprentices, to provide a healthy and safe
working environment and provides for fines and imprisonment for employers who violate the law.
Inspection and enforcement of the law is the responsibility of district labour officers.76
Other relevant laws include the Constitution, Labour Regulations Legislative Instrument, and the Labour
Act which identify hazardous occupations or activities that are prohibited for children.77 These do not
include working underwater, despite many children working in the fishing sector.78
Commercial sexual exploitation of children is prohibited under the Criminal Offences Act and the Labour
Regulations Legislative Instrument,79 though these provisions are not in line with international standards,
and there is currently no legislation against the use of children in pornographic performances.80
The minimum age for voluntary military recruitment is 18, and there is no compulsory military
recruitment (conscription). However, there is no legislation against military recruitment by non-state
armed groups.81
Human trafficking is taken seriously in Ghana. The Human Trafficking Act was passed in 2005, which
provides for the prevention, reduction and punishment of human trafficking, and for the rehabilitation
and reintegration of trafficked persons.82 Subsequent to the passing of the Act, a Human Trafficking
Secretariat was established, as well as an Anti-Human Trafficking Unit in the Ghana Police Service and the
Anti-Human Smuggling and Trafficking in Persons Unit in the Ghana Immigration Service, an operational
unit set up to arrest human trafficking and smuggling offenders. Child trafficking was specifically
addressed by the GOG and the Government of the USA as a result of a Child Protection Compact (CPC)
Partnership in 2015; a four-year joint initiative aimed at addressing child trafficking in Ghana by
strengthening the government’s capacity to identify child trafficking cases, care for and reintegrate
victims, investigate effectively and prosecute traffickers, and prevent trafficking from occurring. 83
Despite these efforts, trafficking continues and to counter the challenges, a National Plan of Action for
the Elimination of Human Trafficking in Ghana 2017 – 2021 was drafted with support from UNICEF and
the Government of Canada, focusing on women and children. The National Plan of Action contains a
range of activities aimed at prevention and protection of victims and potential victims of trafficking,

- 2021) sets out a number of interventions to reinforce public awareness, improve capacity, collaboration
and coordination, promote community empowerment, and provide social services and economic
empowerment programmes. One of the expected outcomes is that laws relating to child labour will be
better enforced, and content gaps in the legal framework addressed.86 The Ministry of Fishing and
Aquaculture Development additionally published a Strategy on Anti-Child Labour and Trafficking in
Fisheries in October 2018 which aims to significantly reduce child labour and trafficking in the fisheries
sector through effective protection of children and prosecution of offences. The Strategy aims to promote
speedy and effective prosecution through strengthening institutions involved in the enforcement and
prosecution of child labour and child trafficking violations.87
The legal review process identified a number of legal changes to be made with relation to child labour
and child trafficking. Amendments proposed to the Children’s Act include an expansion of provisions on
child labour and an indication of the State’s commitment to protecting children from armed conflict and
illegal mining (engaging children in illicit activities is not currently an offence), and provisions on child
sexual abuse and child pornography. In the Criminal Code, amendments are required to add specific
provisions on child pornography, child sex tourism, child prostitution, and the use of children in the
production, sale and trafficking of drugs. The Human Trafficking Act also requires amendment to protect
the victims of trafficking from prosecution for violations of immigration laws or any other illegal activity
as a direct result of their being trafficked.88 These amendments are yet to be passed by Parliament.
Child marriage and other gender issues
Under the Children’s Act, the minimum age for marriage is 18 years and forcing a child to be betrothed
or married is punishable by a fine or a year’s imprisonment.89 Despite this provision, the percentage of
girls between 20 -24 who were married or in a union before the age of 18 was estimated at 21 per cent
nationally, with girls from rural areas twice more likely to be married while children than in urban areas.90
The National Gender Policy, approved in 2015, also makes it clear that marriage under the age of 18 is
prohibited, a stance supported by the National Strategic Framework on Ending Child Marriage in Ghana
(2017-2026), which aims to ensure that laws, policy frameworks and mechanisms related to ending child
marriage are in place and effectively enforced and implemented.91
The age of marriage is set at 18, but the age of sexual consent in Ghana is set at 16.92 The MoGCSP has
published a position paper on harmonising the age of marriage and the age of sexual consent in Ghana.93

While the consensus appears to be to maintain the age of sexual consent at 16, a proposal has been made
to amend the law to legalise sexual relations among children below the age of sexual consent, provided
the age gap is less than 2 to 3 years. Additional amendments include revising the definition of defilement,
which only applies to girls, making it a first-degree felony, and to make compulsion of marriage a more
serious offence. At present it is only a misdemeanour under the Act94 but would become a second-degree
felony under the amendment.
Section 69A of the Criminal Code was inserted in 1994 and a further amendment was made in 2007 to
address the practice of female circumcision. It sets out a clear definition of female genital mutilation /
cutting (FGM/C) and makes it a second degree felony to carry out FGM/C.
Child online safety
As in every country, online safety has recently become a child protection issue and one which Ghana has
yet to address effectively. Ghana has not ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights
of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography (2000) or acceded to the
Convention on Cybercrime (2001), the Council of Europe’s Convention on the Protection of Children
against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (2007), or the African Union Convention on Cyber Security
and Personal Data Protection (2014) (though this was signed in 2017).95
Following a series of consultations, a multi-sectoral National Child Online Protection Steering Committee
was set up in 2016, and was tasked with drafting a Child Online Protection Framework for Ghana.96
MoGCSP released a position paper on the legislation and policy gaps relating to children’s online safety
in 2018, which was followed by a review of the Electronic Transaction Act 2008 (Act 772). During the
review process, to which UNICEF contributed, the Ministry of Communications decided to consolidate all
the proposed amendments into a separate Cybersecurity Bill 2019, which was passed by Parliament in
November 2020. The Cybersecurity Act 2020 (ACT 1038) sets up a Cybersecurity Authority that replaces
the national cybersecurity centre at the Ministry of Communications. This Authority will have its
dedicated budget from the consolidated fund and will be responsible for implementing the Act 2020. The
Act covers a wide range of offences including but not limited to the grooming of children online, the
showing of indecent images and photographs of a child, cyberstalking, sexual extortion, ‘revenge porn’
and blocking, filtering and the taking down of illegal content, with the protection of children listed as one
of the grounds for triggering the action.
Discrimination
Article 17(2) of the Constitution of Ghana prohibits discrimination “on grounds of gender, race, colour,
ethnic origin, religion, creed or social or economic status.” Section 3 of the Children’s Act also prohibits
discrimination with more detail: “on the grounds of gender, race, age, religious, disability, health status,
custom, ethnic origin, rural or urban background, birth or other status, socio-economic status or because
the child is a refugee”. Despite this wide definition, the protection provided has proved to be inadequate
to protect certain vulnerable children. The USAID Human Rights Report 2019 notes that children with
disabilities are subject to abuse and intolerance. Children with mental disabilities, some as young as
seven, are recorded as being sent to spiritual healing centres, known as ‘prayer camps’ to ‘heal’ them.
Reports noted that some were deprived of their liberty, denied food and physically assaulted.97 The

Government does not monitor the camps despite the Mental Health Act, which prohibits involuntary and
forced treatment in non-accredited facilities.98 In December 2018 the Mental Health Authority issued
guidelines for traditional and faith-based healers to ensure that they respect the rights of children with
mental disabilities.
Those living with HIV/AIDS are also still stigmatised. The Ghana AIDS Commission Act criminalises
discrimination against a person infected with or affected by HIV or AIDS and provides for a fine of 1,200
to 6,000 GHC, imprisonment for 18 months to 3 years, or both. The Act further provides for the right to
health, education, insurance benefits, employment, privacy and confidentiality, nondisclosure of status
without consent, and right to hold public or political office for those with HIV/AIDS and those suspected
of having HIV/AIDS.99
Overview of the child protection system in Ghana
Traditionally, children in Ghana grew up in extended family groups, with child-rearing and socialisation
seen as the responsibility of the entire community. Informal foster arrangements played an important
role as a ‘safety net’ to protect children from the negative impacts of household poverty or orphanhood
and continue to be the main form of support for children in need of protection. Although extended family
networks and traditional foster arrangements remain important, particularly in rural areas, social change,
including rapid urbanisation and migration has eroded these networks and undermined the ability of
communities to care for and protect children.100 In some cases, informal fostering may be abusive or
exploitative, for example if a child is fostered to carry out domestic work or labour.101 There is, therefore,
a growing role for the State in monitoring and providing adequate protection and care to those children
who are in need.
Governance and responsibility for child protection services
Within the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection (MoGCSP), the Department of Children is
the leading coordinating body for child protection issues and leads on formulating child-related policies
and legislation, while the Department of Social Welfare is responsible for providing guidelines and
standards for child and family welfare services and for providing social welfare training, registration and
management of childcare institutions, the registration of CSOs/NGOs, the central adoption agency, and
the management of two probation units. The Department of Children leads the National Child Protection
Committee, with representatives from several government ministries, departments and agencies, UN
agencies, NGOs and other development partners.102
Within the MoGCSP, there is also the Domestic Violence Secretariat, which is responsible for the
coordination of national programmes related to domestic violence and ending child marriage and the
Anti-Human Trafficking Secretariat, which coordinates and monitors the implementation of the National
Plan of Action for the Elimination of Human Trafficking 2017-2021. Within the Department of Labour, the
Child Labour Unit coordinates the implementation of the National Plan of Action for the Elimination of
the Worst Forms of Child Labour 2017-2021; and within the Ministry of Communications, the Child Online
Protection Unit coordinates interventions related to online sexual exploitation and abuse. Within the
Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, the Department of Community Development
implements programmes focused on poverty reduction, livelihoods, and technical/vocational training,

including the Mass Education Social Drive, which promotes behavioural and social change in relation to
issues relevant to child protection.103
The Department of Children has offices in ten regions (as of 2020 there were no offices in the six new
regions created in 2018-19), managed directly by MoGCSP. In each of the sixteen regions, there is a
Department of Social Welfare and a Department of Community Development, both of which are managed
by the Office of the Head of Local Government Service (OHLGS). Regional Directors of all three
departments are non-voting members of the Regional Coordinating Councils (RCCs). 104
Following the Local Governance Act in 2016, the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of
Community Development were merged at district level into one department, which is responsible for the
actual provision of services related to child and family welfare and child protection and thus forms the
core of the social services workforce.105 The district-level departments are staffed by social welfare
officers (SWOs) and community development officers (CDOs), who have different roles and professional
backgrounds. While the Department reports jointly to the District Assembly, SWOs and CDOs maintain
separate reporting lines to their respective Departments at a regional level. A new role of social
development officer has been created, but has not yet been adopted in all districts.106 There is currently
a serious shortage of social services staff, with 2,460 staff working across these departments in 2020, less
than half of the minimum staffing norm of 5,790.107
The process of decentralisation has had a number of difficulties, including a lack of local administrative
capacity, delays in the transfer of funds and staff, and poor coordination between central and local
government officials. Community members are relatively unlikely to approach their District Assembly for
help with problems, and much more likely to rely on their Member of Parliament or chief, suggesting that
national and traditional institutions are still viewed as more competent or more reliable than local
ones.108 This has important implications for child protection, given the centrality of the District Assembly
and local institutions in providing child protection services.
Police
The Ministry of Interior oversees the Ghana Police Service and its specialised units and supervises remand
homes for young offenders. The Domestic Violence Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU) responds to cases of
domestic violence. DOVVSU has 112 offices across the country in all regional capitals and in many
districts, but only the office in Tamale has a specialised interview room for children. The Anti-Human
Trafficking Unit (AHTU) deals with cases of child trafficking and has ten regional offices besides its
headquarters in Accra.109 The police tend to deal with more serious child protection cases, for example,
involving criminal abuse or neglect. Historically, they have been inclined to focus more on investigating
the perpetrator than on supporting child victims.110
Since 2016 the Ghana Police Service has been integrating child-friendly policing into the police training
curriculum for both new recruits and police officers already in post. A mapping of the Ghana Police Service

conducted in 2016 found that there was a need to raise awareness of child-friendly policing and
legislation and policies relevant to children in contact with the law. Specialist officers at DOVVSU and
AHTU were found to have more awareness but lacked the tools and infrastructure to implement policies.
For example, there was a gap in the skills and resources required for crisis counselling and psychosocial
support. The report found that child victims and witnesses were offered very little protection, and that
there were no child-friendly spaces or financial support available.111 Obtaining medical reports and
providing shelter for child victims or witnesses remain a challenge for the police. Following the mapping,
standard operating procedures were developed to guide the handling of child cases. A Student’s Manual
was also developed to provide background information and lessons on child protection for police recruits
undertaking the child-friendly policing training course and in-service police officers in DOVVSU and
AHTU.112
Judicial system
The Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) is a quasi-judicial body which exists
to protect fundamental human rights and to ensure good governance for every person in Ghana.113 CHRAJ
was established under the Commission of Human Rights Act 1993, which sets out the composition of the
Commission, the functions of the Commission, and the establishment of regional and district branches.
Representatives of CHRAJ in the regional and district offices are responsible for receiving complaints from
the public and investigating any allegations of human rights abuses or corruption.114 CHRAJ has offices in
100 districts across all 16 regions and handles complaints involving children’s rights, including
maintenance, neglect, abuse, abandonment, child labour, paternity, forced marriage, custody etc.,
dealing with, on average, 3,500 complaints per year. Over 80 per cent of complaints relate to neglect,
custody of the child and improper care of the child in the context of custody, while 7 per cent related to
education and 1 per cent to child marriage.115
The Judicial Service oversees the administration of courts. There are 72 circuit courts, of which ten are
child-friendly gender-based violence courts, and 192 district courts, of which three are juvenile courts
and family tribunals. The juvenile courts and family tribunals handle cases involving juvenile offenders,
child neglect, maintenance and custody cases and sit as a panel. One of the panel members must be a
social welfare officer.116 However, magistrates or prosecutors working in Juvenile Courts or Family
Tribunals do not currently have to undergo formal training or qualifications, meaning that proceedings
are not always child friendly.117 All three juvenile courts are in Accra, with general district courts handling
juvenile cases in other regions. There are no social workers in criminal courts and no comprehensive
victim/witness support programmes, though some pre-trial preparation is provided to child
victims/witnesses by DOVVSU staff.118 The general practice is for children to testify in open court, though
judges are encouraged to hear sensitive cases in-camera.
Health sector
In 2018 a capacity assessment was conducted to ascertain the health sector’s response to child abuse
incidences and to identify gaps in capacity. The assessment found that many providers report knowledge
and skills in responding to cases involving child abuse, including in making referrals, documenting

findings, recommending follow-up treatment, and history-taking and examination. Most providers also
reported a sympathetic attitude towards victims of child abuse, attending to them in a positive and timely
manner. However, some gaps were identified around the provision of practical, social and psychological
support to child victims, and in the forensic management of child abuse cases, for example in the taking
of forensic samples to be used as evidence, accessing advocacy for abused children and reporting to the
appropriate authorities. There were also gaps in knowledge around HIV prophylaxis and sexually
transmitted infection (STI) treatment after sexual assault, and around the appropriate handling of
perpetrators. The report concluded that there was a need to strengthen inter-sectoral collaboration
between partners involved in child protection, including healthcare providers, police officers,
prosecutors, and social welfare services.119 Guidelines for health workers were published in 2018 to
support health workers in preventing and managing child abuse, including supporting child victims of
abuse and following the correct procedures for collecting and preserving evidence for potential use in
the legal system.120
Education sector
In July 2018, the Ghana Education Service published a Safe School Resource Pack, which includes a
training manual, a teachers’ handbook, a positive discipline toolkit, fact sheets, and peer-to-peer
materials. The resource pack defines the concept of a ‘safe school’ and gives information on the things
that make schools unsafe, including bullying, sexual harassment and corporal punishment.121 The
teachers’ handbook contains information on children’s rights, the negative effects of violence on children,
and the implementation of safe, positive discipline techniques in classrooms.122 The peer-to-peer
materials recognise the important role of child participation in making a school safe and contains
resources for children to learn about their rights and responsibilities, how to challenge bullying and sexual
harassment, and how to solve conflict without violence.123 The fact sheets contain information on
reporting school-based violence at various levels, from the child up to the headteacher, as well as School
Management Committees or Parent-Teacher Associations, local councils, police, social welfare officers,
medical centres, and courts of law.124
As well as these resources, the Ghana Education Service updated its Code of Conduct in April 2016 to
incorporate School-Related Gender-Based Violence. The Code of Conduct explicitly prohibits the use of
corporal punishment or other acts that inflict physical pain on a child, from using work as a form of
punishment, and from using any cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.125
Community and informal child protection institutions
At a local level, there are many informal service providers and structures that respond to child protection
concerns, including traditional leaders such as chiefs and Queen Mothers,126 faith-based organisations,
teachers, and assembly members. Often informal community structures emphasise compensation,
reconciliation, and restoring harmony in the family and community to prevent any recurrence of the
abuse. Providing support for the child and seeking their opinion or experience is often seen as less
important. Informal actors often prefer not to refer child protection cases into the formal system,

particularly for cases attracting stigma such as rape, defilement and incest.127 In the five case study
districts included in the evaluation of the Policy 2 Practice initiative, traditional authorities saw
themselves as responsible for organising community durbars on child protection issues, and as having a
role in addressing sexual related abuse such as incest, defilement and rape. Views on cooperation with
formal authorities differed between districts, with some recognising the importance of working with the
police in child protection cases, and others feeling that their traditional role had been undermined.
Traditional authorities were generally aware of the need to develop linkages between formal and
informal services, particularly around sexual assault cases.128
In 2010 Ghana introduced the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act to regulate the process of mediating
settlements in civil and minor criminal disputes and to recognise customary arbitration formally as a
means to resolve these matters. The Act could potentially be used to divert children charged with minor
crimes.129 During the workshops held as part of the Policy 2 Practice initiative, social workers recognised
the need for further collaboration and cooperation between formal and informal actors and the need to
engage with a broader range of informal actors. Participants agreed that there was a need to build the
capacity of informal actors in order to have a shared understanding of roles and responsibilities with
regards to the handling of criminal offences involving children, including when cases should be referred
into the formal system.130 Traditional authorities have been engaged in the development of the Child and
Family Welfare Policy, the Justice for Children Policy and the proposed amendments to the Children’s
Act, the Juvenile Act and other laws.

OBJECT OF THE EVALUATION
This evaluation covers UNICEF Ghana’s child protection work under two different country programme
cycles. The country programme 2012-2017 had six key components, namely health and nutrition; water,
sanitation and hygiene; education; child protection; advocacy, communication, monitoring and analysis
and cross-sectoral support. The child protection component had a budget of US$18.5 million.131 The 2018-
2022 country programme retains the same six components (with the substitution of ‘policy and evidence’
for ‘advocacy, communication, monitoring and analysis’) and has a budget of US$30 million for child
protection.132 Both programmes take a systems-strengthening approach with the aim of effecting legal
and regulatory change, reforming the child and family welfare and justice services to become more
effective and relevant in both preventing abuse and responding to harm, and supporting behaviour and
social change.133
Strengthening the child protection system in Ghana is an important and high-impact area for
intervention. The national Child Protection Social Drive has reached millions of people across Ghana with
messaging around child protection issues and has attracted influential supporters such as the Second
Lady of Ghana. The Government of Ghana’s child protection budget has grown from 44 million GHC in
2016 to 142 million GHC in 2020, with 0.26 per cent of the national budget allocated to child protection
services.134 Governmental budget allocation to child protection is similar to other West African countries
for which budgetary analysis is available, but falls far short of the ECOWAS benchmark which requires
that 3 per cent of the national budget be allocated to child protection.135

2012-2017 child protection programme and results framework
The 2012-2017 child protection programme was informed by the results of the Mapping and Analysis of
Ghana’s Child Protection Report, based on research undertaken in 2010. 136 The mapping report,
highlighted the importance of a systems-based, rather than issues-based approach, and enabled the
targeting of the programme towards areas with a high prevalence of child protection issues. Under the
2012-2017 Country Programme plan, the two main outcomes were ‘a functioning national child
protection system that will better protect children, especially orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs),
from violence, exploitation abuse and discrimination in the five most deprived regions and during
emergencies’ and the ‘capacity of the justice system strengthened to deliver justice services for children’.
Child protection programme interventions targeted five regions in Ghana, three located in the north of
the country (Northern, Upper East and Upper West regions), the Western region and the Greater Accra
region. The programme employed a mix of strategies to achieve results, including developing institutional
capacity for policy implementation, planning, monitoring and evaluation, addressing equity, particularly
in relation to gender, location and disadvantaged groups, strengthening public-private partnerships, and
strengthening community-based strategies.
The 2012-2017 programme had seven outputs, four under Outcome 1 and three under Outcome 2. The

2018-2022 child protection programme and results framework
The overall outcome for the 2018-2022 child protection programme is that ‘girls and boys in Ghana,
especially the most disadvantaged, increasingly benefit from an equitable and integrated child protection
system’. The Country Programme as a whole continues its focus on the five most deprived northern
regions (Northern, Savannah, North East, Upper East and Upper West, while also using district-level data
to target activities to areas with the highest need. The child protection programme builds on the system
strengthening approach commenced under the 2012-2017 programme, with child protection system
strengthening identified as a high-impact area for intervention. Capacity building of the social welfare
workforce continues in 20 selected districts while interventions concerning alternative care for children
in foster care, kinship care or adoption focus on districts with high numbers of children in residential care.
Development of guidelines and directives is carried out at a national level.
The 2018-2022 programme has five outputs under the main outcome as follows:
Overall outcome: Girls and boys in Ghana, especially the most disadvantaged, increasingly benefit from
an equitable and integrated child protection system
a. Proportion of children aged 2-14 years who experienced any physical punishment and/or
psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month decreases to 83% by 2022
b. Percentage of women aged 20-24 who were first married / in union before age 18 decreases to
18% nationally by 2022 (12% of women in urban areas, 16% of women in rural areas)
c. 85% of children aged 0-5 have their births registered with the civil authorities
Output 1: Child and family welfare, justice for children and birth registration-related laws and regulations

b. 95% of children aged 0-1 have their births registered with the civil authorities
Output 5: Women, girls, boys and men in selected areas have an increased understanding of violence and
harmful practices that affect children especially girls
a. 1,250 new communities engaged through child protection facilitation toolkit as part of the social
drive campaign by 2022 (2,050 communities in total)
b. 9% of the population aged 10-18 (810,000) and 12% of the adult population (1.2 million) reached
by UNICEF-supported programmes that target parents and primary caregivers to address child-
rearing to prevent and respond to violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect, and that aim at
increasing girls' and boys' capacity to identify, prevent and/or report more than one form of
violence
Programme beneficiaries
The primary beneficiaries of UNICEF’s 2012-2017 and 2018-2022 programmes are girls and boys in Ghana,
particularly those disadvantaged through disability, special needs, ethnicity, migration status or socio-
economic status, and those in need of care and protection. Parents, guardians, and caregivers should also
be regarded as beneficiaries, as should community members in areas targeted by social and behavioural
change campaigns.
Beneficiaries also include the main duty bearers and secondary duty bearers involved in the delivery of
child protection at national, regional and district levels. These include social service providers, police and
justice officials, teachers, healthcare professionals, members of Metropolitan, Municipal and District
Assemblies (MMDAs), and community and traditional leaders with responsibility for providing protection
to children.
Theory of Change
The 2018-2022 programme has a theory of change that is expressed both visually and in writing in the
programme strategy note.137 The overall change envisioned is that ‘fewer girls and boys experience
violence, abuse, exploitation, neglect and injustices, and more children are registered within one year of
birth and no later than their fifth birthday’. The programme outcome is that ‘by 2022, girls and boys in
Ghana, especially the most disadvantaged, increasingly benefit from an equitable and integrated child
protection system’. According to the theory of change, in order for this outcome to lead to the final vision,
several conditions must be met:
• Political prioritization of and commitment to child protected is reflected in laws, planning and
budgeting
• The momentum and support for Civil Registry and Vital Statistics reform continues
• Child and family welfare, justice, and birth registration systems provide accessible, quality
preventive and responsive services to children and families
• Families, young people, communities and traditional leaders embrace and lead change for child
protection, with a general increase in appreciation for women’s and girls’ empowerment and
equal opportunities for girls and boys
137 UNICEF Ghana, ‘Proposed country programme 2018-2022 Programme Strategy Note: Child Protection’, 15 September 2017.
33
• An overall internal and external supportive environment reinforces positive, transformative
change and increases stakeholder accountability
UNICEF’s inputs aim to support and strengthen three pillars of work in order to generate the five
programme outputs that will contribute to the overall outcome. Firstly, the enabling environment formed
by the legal and regulatory framework must be more conducive for child protection. Secondly, the supply
of effective and efficient child protection services, including specialised child protection case
management and birth registration services, must be better able to prevent and respond to child
protection concerns in a timely and appropriate way. Thirdly, the demand for child protection prevention
and response must be strengthened through social and behavioural change, particularly with regards to
gender-related norms and behaviours. Through these pillars of work, laws and regulations will be aligned
to national policies and international standards, access to child and family welfare services will be
improved, the justice system will be more child-friendly, the birth registration system will be more
efficient, and communities will have an increased understanding of violence and harmful practices.
The programme has several assumptions and risks. The theory of change assumes that programming is
mutually reinforcing across all three pillars; that the government will remain committed to child
protection system reforms and that Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection will remain
committed to championing and leading the change; that organisational change and decentralisation will
not adversely affect the programme; and that families, young people and communities are ready and
willing to change. The main risk is a reduced level of funding which would limit the ability to continue
programming in all three ‘pillars’. Another key challenge identified is that of monitoring and gauging the
impact of programme interventions due to the sensitivity of issues and the difficulties inherent in
measuring an ‘absence of incidents’ – the outcome that effective prevention work aims to achieve.
Climate change and emergencies are also recognised as risks, albeit smaller, with mitigation focusing on
building long-term capacity of stakeholders to respond to emergencies.
4.1. Key stakeholders and their contributions
UNICEF Ghana has many stakeholders at a national, regional and district level. At a national level, key
government partners within the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection (MoGCSP) include the
Department of Children, the Department of Social Welfare, the Domestic Violence Secretariat, the Anti-
Human Trafficking Secretariat, and the National Child Protection Committee (led by the Department of
Children). Within other Ministries and Agencies there is the Child Labour Unit within the Department of
Labour and the Child Online Protection Unit within the Ministry of Communications.
With regards to justice for children, the main partners are CHRAJ, the Ministry of Justice, the Attorney
General’s Department, the Judicial Service of Ghana and the Ministry of Interior overseeing the Ghana
Police Service. Birth registration is overseen by the Births and Deaths Registry. Important supporting roles
are played by the Ministry of Chieftaincy and Traditional Affairs, the Ministry of Education and the Ghana
Education Service, the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service, the Ghana Statistical Service, the
National Commission for Civic Education and the Office of the Head of the Local Government Service.
At a regional level, partners include the regional offices of the Department of Children, the Department
of Social Welfare and the Department of Community Development, as well as the Regional Coordinating
Councils. At a district level, the MMDAs are the key stakeholder together with the Departments of Social
Welfare and Community Development. In addition, community, traditional and religious leaders are all
important stakeholders.
34
UNICEF partners with other international development organisations on different issues, including the
ILO and the IOM on child labour and child trafficking, UNFPA on child marriage and gender-based
violence, and UNDP on gender, governance and standards for mining.
Major donors and partners have included the Governments of Canada and the Netherlands, DANIDA, the
USAID Displaced Children and Orphans Fund, and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA).
UNICEF has provided funding to several NGOs and civil society organisations to implement interventions
on child marriage, including Savanna Signature, International Needs Ghana, Defence for Children Internal
and Youth Harvest. UNICEF has also established a number of partnerships with private organisations,
including Airtel Tigo Ghana, MTN Ghana and Vodafone, for the implementation of mobile birth
registration and social and behavioural change campaigns.
35
PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION
As set out in the ToR for the assignment, the primary purpose of the evaluation is to support learning and
decision-making that would, in turn, support better child protection outcomes for girls and boys now and
in the future. In addition to this, the evaluation will hold UNICEF accountable for contributing to child
protection outcomes for children (or failing to do so) in Ghana since 2012. Finally, by examining, collecting
and analysing credible evidence, this evaluation will help to clarify the changes in child protection in
Ghana that have been brought about by UNICEF’s child protection programme, and whether the
programme has the right strategic focus to contribute to the development of child protection and social
welfare system in Ghana going forward. In order to reflect on the programme’s strategic approach, the
Evaluation Team will consider the assumptions contained in the theory of change included in the 2017
‘Child Protection Programme Strategy Note’.
The UNICEF Ghana Country Office is the primary intended user of the evaluation. The other users and
uses of the evaluation are set out in Table 5.1:

OBJECTIVES OF THE EVALUATION
As set out in the ToR, this formative and summative evaluation has six main objectives:
➢ To determine the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability of the Child
Protection Programme.
➢ To examine the results achieved by the UNICEF/GoG Child Protection Programme since 2012
for children, adolescents, families and communities in Ghana, and its contribution to national
priorities. This exercise should also look at the results of programme implementation in terms of
collaboration with other UN agencies, international and national NGOs, private sector
organisations, academic institutions and development partners, across national, regional and
district levels.
➢ To take stock of changes on child protection indicators included in the country programme
documents and annual workplan, and to provide evidence to inform future programming.
➢ To assess UNICEF Ghana’s leadership, coordination capacity, and ability to leverage resources
and partnerships towards child protection outcomes at national and sub-national levels through
advocacy and policy influencing, including knowledge management and evidence-generation to
inform policy decisions.
➢ To examine the existing linkages between the outputs of the child protection programme, as well
as linkages with other outcome and output areas of the UNICEF country programme.
➢ Deepen our focus on empowering disadvantaged adolescent girls to improve their wellbeing
with multiplier effects for their families, communities and societies.

SCOPE OF THE EVALUATION
7.1. Thematic scope
This evaluation covers the entire child protection component of UNICEF Ghana’s 2012 – 2017 and 2018
– 2022 Country Programmes. In addition to this, the evaluation considers the linkages between child
protection programming and other components of the Ghana Country Programme that relate to child
protection, namely: education, health and nutrition, social protection and social policy adolescent and
youth empowerment-related interventions, communication for development, and early childhood and
development.
7.2. Geographical scope
The geographical scope of the evaluation is expansive, covering programming nationwide across Ghana
at both national and sub-national (regional, metropolitan and district) levels; the evaluation includes
evidence collected in all 16 regions of Ghana.
7.3. Chronological scope
The evaluation covers the period from 2012 to 2020. It addresses the perspectives of a range of
programme beneficiaries, including children, adolescents and their families and communities as well as
key actors in the child protection sector.
39
CRITERIA AND EVALUATIVE QUESTIONS
The evaluation generates evidence in relation to 4 of the 6 evaluation criteria of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development/Development Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC), namely:
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability. The fifth criteria, impact138, has been looked at in
relation to outcomes and likely impact of the programme. In addition to these criteria, the evaluation
methodology will also incorporate UNICEF’s guiding principles of gender, human rights and equity. A set
of research questions were included in the TOR and were refined in collaboration with the Evaluation
Reference Group during the inception phase. They are set out below and relate to the four criteria listed
above.
8.1. Evaluation questions
Relevance
➢ To what extent have the child protection programme and its approaches been aligned (and
consistently so over time) with national priorities, SDGs and commitments of UNICEF (UNICEF
Strategic Plans) in the area of prevention and response to violence against girls and boys?
➢ To what extent has the child protection programme responded to UNICEF commitments made
to development partners, especially Global Affairs Canada and USAID?
➢ To what extent has the design of the child protection programme taken into account the
voices of girls and boys and their different needs based on age, gender, ethnicity and other
social identities, especially the most vulnerable?
➢ To what extent have the child protection programme and its approaches been aligned (and
consistently so over time) with national priorities, SDGs and commitments of UNICEF (UNICEF
Strategic Plans) in the area of prevention and response to violence against girls and boys?
➢ To what extent has the child protection programme responded to UNICEF commitments made
to development partners, especially Global Affairs Canada and USAID?
➢ To what extent has the design of the child protection programme taken into account the
voices of girls and boys and their different needs based on age, gender, ethnicity and other
social identities, especially the most vulnerable?
Impact / Effectiveness
➢ To what extent did the Child Protection Programme’s interventions contribute to the
intended results on the protection of girls and boys (covering all areas of the programme) as
per the country programme documents and subsequent annual work plans? What are the
results that can be attributed to the Child Protection Programme (v contribution)?139
➢ How have partnerships been mobilised so as to contribute effectively to the child protection
programme?140
138 The evaluation will identify impacts of UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme wherever possible, however, in line with the ToR, the evaluation
is expected to look for “likely links” between the programme interventions and child protection outcomes for children rather than establishing
“firm links” – we have therefore rephrased this criteria as “impacts and outcomes”.
139 This question is overarching and it was suggested that the response be integrated with analysis in response to other questions – particularly
EQ6, EQ7, EQ8, EQ9 and EQ10 – so as to avoid repetition.
140 See above.
40
➢ To what degree have the policy, institutional and legal frameworks been reformed to be in
line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, its optional protocols, and the African
Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child?
➢ To what degree has the national child protection system been able to respond to the needs
of vulnerable girls and boys, especially the most marginalised, that were separated or
exposed to violence? Do barriers continue to prevent women, girls and boys from accessing
services? How has UNICEF’s child protection programme addressed these?
➢ To what extent have behavioural change campaigns and community mobilisation efforts
contributed to the intended transformation of gender norms in communities? How has this
led to improved prevention and response to violence, reduction in child marriages and
prevention of unnecessary family separation?
➢ What has the level of satisfaction been among women, girls, boys and men, and
communities, with the quality of prevention and response services that they have received
through the child protection programme?
➢ To what degree has the child protection programme contributed to an alternative care
system based on family-based care options as well as to the implementation of the Care
Reform Initiative?
➢ Has sufficient attention been given to measuring, monitoring and reporting results including
results related to gender equality? How effectively has evidence been used to inform
programmatic changes and adjustments?
Efficiency
➢ How has UNICEF mobilised and used its resources (human, technical and financial) to achieve
its planned results for child protection? To what extent have resources (human, technical,
financial) been sufficient, both in quantity and quality?
➢ Do more cost-effective ways of achieving the same child protection results exist?
➢ How effectively have coordination mechanisms been working between UNICEF’s child
protection programme and other UNICEF programme outcomes (across education, health
and nutrition, social protection and social policy, adolescent and youth empowerment,
communication for development, and early childhood development) to create and sustain
linkages across sectors, and between child protection actors, especially related to community
engagement for the prevention of child marriage (KRC 6), violence against children (KRC 2)
and birth registration (KRC 4)? How complementary were the activities implemented jointly
with other UN agencies, development partners and NGOs (avoiding duplication, maximising
efficiency, leveraging added value)?
Sustainability
➢ To what extent are the benefits and achievements of the UNICEF supported programmes
likely to continue after the programme has ended? What measures were taken so that the
Government of Ghana and targeted communities could take ownership of the child
protection programme?
➢ To what extent has the child protection programme contributed to the generation of
capacities at national and sub-national levels? How likely are these to be used after the end
of the programme?
41
➢ What would be the strategy to follow to ensure an alternative care system based primarily
on family-based care and not on residential care?
➢ What are the enabling as well as constraining factors that are likely to influence replication
and sustainability?
Gender, equity and human rights
➢ To what extent were gender and human rights principles integrated into the design,
implementation and monitoring of the child protection programme?141
8.2. Evaluation matrix
The analytical framework for the evaluation has been driven by the evaluation criteria and questions set
out above. The evaluation team’s approach to answering these is detailed in an evaluation matrix (Annex
2), which sets out the specific information (indicators and sub questions) which is necessary to answer
the evaluation questions, and methods and data sources for measuring / answering these. The evaluation
matrix informed the development of the methodology for the evaluation and will guide analysis.
Specifically, the evaluation matrix contains:
1. The questions that the evaluation will attempt to answer (across the evaluation criteria of impact,
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and gender, equity and human rights);
2. Qualitative and quantitative indicators which emerge from / relate to the evaluation questions;
3. Data sources for answering research questions and measuring indicators;
4. And any limitations in data or the ability of researchers to analyse it.
141 This question is overarching / cross-cutting and it was suggested that relevant findings and analysis be integrated throughout the evaluation
report to avoid repetition and enrich analysis.
42
METHODOLOGY
9.1. Approach of the evaluation
The evaluation took an outcome-harvesting approach, collecting evidence of what has changed over the
course of the two child protection programmes and working backwards to determine whether and how
the programmes contributed to those changes. This approach was complemented by a quasi-
experimental approach to measuring the impact of the social and behavioural change interventions,
utilising difference-in-difference analysis to assess the extent to which changes could be attributed to
UNICEF programming.
This methodology is framed around the evaluation criteria of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development / Development Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC), namely relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency, sustainability, and coherence. The evaluation methodology has been developed according to
the UNEG Norms and Standards for Evaluation (2016) and also incorporates UNICEF’s guiding principles
on gender equality, equity, and human rights. Our approach is equity and rights-based, rooted in the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of
Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD)
and other key international standards. We pay special attention to vulnerable or ‘at risk’ groups of
children, particularly girls, children from ethnic minorities, and children with disabilities, to ensure that
their particular needs are identified, represented and addressed through our data collection and sampling
techniques, analysis and recommendations. Through these approaches, we include and represent a
diverse range of voices in the research.
The evaluation employs a mixed-methods approach to data collection, incorporating both quantitative
and qualitative methods and drawing on the strengths of both to gather data that is rich, accurate and
measurable. Triangulation between different methods also improves the validity of results.
The evaluation has taken a consultative and participatory approach with UNICEF, stakeholders and
beneficiaries in order to ensure that the findings are context-appropriate and high-quality and that
stakeholders have overall ownership of the process and outputs.
9.2. Methods, tools and sampling strategy for data collection
Data collection was implemented by our national partner, Participatory Development Associates (PDA).
Remote training was first held with qualitative researchers and fieldwork coordinators from PDA, who
subsequently delivered training to field researchers and enumerators in Ghana. Trainings covered the
implementation of the data collection methods as well as research ethics, child-friendly interview
techniques, and COVID-19 safety precautions.
Quantitative data collection
Service provider survey: A quantitative survey was carried out with social welfare officers and community
development officers at district level. The survey collected basic data on the types of child protection
cases referred to district level service providers, attitudes towards child protection issues among service
providers, and the child protection response, including the use of the guidelines and operating
procedures introduced through UNICEF’s child protection programming. The service provider survey was
not intended to be nationally representative but instead to capture the views and experiences of a range
of service providers. Thirty ‘intervention’ districts that received social workforce interventions from
UNICEF were selected for the service provider survey and matched with another 30 ‘comparison’ districts
43
that were selected to be as similar as possible in terms of population density, rurality, ethnicity and
language. However, eight of the comparison districts had received training from UNICEF on the case
management SOPs prior to data collection. These districts are, therefore, treated as intervention districts
in the final analysis. The selected districts covered a range of ordinary, municipal and metropolitan
districts in 12 out of the 16 regions. Within each district two social welfare officers or community
development officers were surveyed, with preference given to officers who had been in post longer. 120
social workers were surveyed in total including 71 men and 49 women.
KAP survey: In order to investigate the changes in the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of
communities targeted by UNICEF’s social and behaviour change interventions, a KAP survey was
administered in selected districts to children (ages 14 to 17), young people (ages 18 to 25) and adults (25
to 65). The survey was administered both in areas where UNICEF has conducted community engagement
work,142 as well as in selected ‘comparison’ districts which had not received interventions. The survey
originally planned to compare results both over time and between intervention and comparison areas to
provide an estimate of the contribution made by UNICEF’s programme. However, this approach was only
possible with the children’s data, as baseline data for the adult sample was not available.
The KAP survey was administered in six regions where UNICEF has carried out social and behavioural
change programming. There were 12 enumeration areas (EAs) which had both baseline data from 2013
and which had received social and behavioural change programming. These 12 EAs (‘intervention
communities’) were matched with another 12 EAs that had baseline data but did not receive
programming (‘comparison communities’). Comparison districts were matched to be as similar as
possible to the intervention communities in terms of community size, rurality, ethnicity, and language.
The aim was to achieve a sample size of 1,000 respondents (500 adolescents / young adults and 500
adults) in order to achieve a margin of error of 5 per cent. This involved interviewing 42 individuals in
each enumeration area, 21 adolescents and young adults, and 21 adults. A random walk method was
used to select households within an enumeration area. At each selected household, enumerators first
ascertained whether the household had an eligible respondent. If not, another household was selected.
If the household had more than one eligible respondent, the respondent to be interviewed was selected
randomly using a Kish grid. For child protection reasons, adolescent, young adult and adult household
questionnaires were not conducted in the same household.
A final sample of 512 adolescent / young adult surveys (270 female and 242 male) and 510 adult surveys
(280 women and 230 men) was achieved.
Administrative data collection: In the absence of national administrative data on child protection,
enumerators collected data on all child protection cases recorded by the districts in 2019 and 2020 in
districts where the service provider survey was implemented. The purpose was to give a sense of the
numbers and basic profile of cases being addressed at sub-district level. Enumerators used a validated
Excel template to record basic information on each case, including gender, type of case and referral
source.

Qualitative data collection
Two districts for qualitative data collection were purposively sampled from each of the 10 ‘old’ regions143
to give a total of 20 districts. The sampling aimed to achieve a diverse sample, incorporating metropolitan,
municipal and ‘ordinary’ districts, and ensuring that all interventions were represented. In addition, two
districts were selected as ‘comparison’ districts where UNICEF interventions had not taken place. Efforts
were made to ensure that districts from ‘new’ regions were also included, and the final sample of districts
covers 13 out of 16 regions.144 Table 9.1 shows the total sample achieved for qualitative interviews.
Sampling strategies for the selection of participants were purposive and non-random. This means that all
sample members were selected based on their satisfaction of criteria relevant to the evaluation
questions, and whose information was likely to be of use for developing and testing emerging analytical
ideas. Different sampling approaches were used for each type of qualitative interaction. Purposive
sampling prioritised diversity so that respondents of diverse backgrounds and with diverse perspectives
were included in the evaluation.
Qualitative interviews were guided by a set of standardised questions which guided the interaction but
allowed for the researcher to probe for more detail on aspects of particular interest.
Key informant interviews: Key stakeholders who play a role in the implementation of UNICEF’s child
protection programme and child protection more broadly were identified for interview at the national,
regional and district level. The purpose of the selection was to obtain particular knowledge, expertise and
accurate information in relation to indicators in the evaluation framework, from stakeholders with in-
depth knowledge of child protection, including stakeholders in relevant government agencies at national,
regional, and district levels, as well as NGO and CBO partners, social welfare and community development
officers, police officers including representatives from DOVVSU and AHTU, members of the judiciary, and
health and education professionals. Six key informant interviews were conducted at a regional level (with
the exception of Ashanti region where only five KIIs were conducted, giving a total of 59 interviews) and
ten at a district level within each region (100 in total).
In-depth interviews with children and their caregivers: In-depth life history interviews were carried out
with children whose cases had been subject to a child protection intervention (e.g. by district social
workers, regional councils, NGOs, etc.); who had been in contact with the justice system and who lived
in a residential home (or other alternative care arrangement). Where possible, interviews were also
carried out with those involved in the child’s case, including members of their family and the district social
welfare officer or caseworker assigned to the case. The purpose of the case study interviews was to learn
about these children’s experiences and the outcomes of their case from multiple perspectives.
A ‘typical case sampling’ approach was used to select four case studies in each district (80 in total). Cases
were selected in collaboration with implementing partners to represent typical child protection cases
(e.g. where children have received prevention and response services through UNICEF’s programme).
Implementing partners were asked to consider what criteria they associated with a ‘typical’ child
protection case, for example in terms of how the case was referred, the type of child protection case, and
143 The sampling for the evaluation used the old administrative regions and districts rather than the new regions and MMDAs created in 2018-19,
as these were the context for the majority of the programming being evaluated.

the type of service or intervention received and what the outcomes of the case were. Cases meeting
these criteria were selected with a view to achieving diversity in terms of demographic characteristics,
such as gender and age, as well as the type of child protection case and the type of service or intervention
received. The minimum age for interviewing children was 10 years.
Case file reviews: A sample of files kept by district social welfare officers documenting individual child
protection cases were reviewed in order to collect information on the types of cases being picked up by
the case management system and the quality of the response being implemented.
Focus group discussions: Participants were selected to represent diversity in terms of age and socio-
economic background within the community to ensure that a range of views were represented. Four
focus group discussions were carried out in each district, one with adult men, one with adult women, one
with girls and one with boys, and each group had six to eight participants. The minimum age for
interviewing children as part of focus group discussions was 12 years.

Fieldwork
All quantitative surveys were carried out face-to-face using tablets running ODK software. Tablets were
also used to record the case file review data. For qualitative interviews, researchers took detailed notes
and typed up transcripts to share with the evaluation team. For the administrative data, enumerators
either typed up the data directly into an Excel spreadsheet using their laptop, or recorded the data on
paper and entered it into Excel at a later time.
Two teams of researchers were used. The first team implemented the service provider survey, case file
reviews, qualitative interviews and administrative data collection. Training for this team took place from
18th to 20th November 2020, including a pilot of the tools. Following a review of the pilot data and
adjustments to the tools, fieldwork took place between 25th November and 7th December 2020. The
second team implemented the community KAP survey. They received training remotely between 8th and
10th December 2020, again including a pilot of the tools. Data collection for the KAP survey took place
between 12th and 20th December 2020.
9.3. Data analysis and quality assurance
Qualitative data analysis
All raw qualitative data were uploaded into NVivo software and coded to identify key themes, patterns
and relationships relevant to the research questions. The evaluation team used a thematic analysis, with
a focus on understanding how the child protection system functions to prevent and respond to violence
46
and child protection violations, and the role of UNICEF’s programme within that. Where possible, the
analysis compares findings between districts where UNICEF has and has not worked in order to
understand the contribution that UNICEF programming has made to child protection systems, community
awareness and attitudes, and coordination between formal and informal actors.
Quantitative data analysis
Quantitative data from primary data collection was analysed using Excel and Stata software. Preliminary
quantitative data analysis involved cleaning and checking the data to understand the extent and
randomness of missing data, which was found to be minimal. Initial analysis produced descriptive
statistics on the composition of the sample and the overall results, disaggregated by factors of interest
including intervention or comparison area.
The KAP survey analysis aimed to measure changes in key KAP indicators over time in the sampled
enumeration areas, comparing control areas and intervention areas to estimate the extent to which
UNICEF programming has contributed to these changes. For the child data, a difference-in-difference
analysis was used to explore the impact of UNICEF programming. An individual-level analysis was also
conducted to explore the association between KAP and background characteristics including gender, age,
ethnicity, and socio-economic status, and between participation in community activities and KAP
indicators, adjusting for background characteristics, to explore whether participation was associated with
greater knowledge or more favourable attitudes.
For the adult baseline data, we do not have statistics disaggregated by region or area were not available,
so the comparison was made at a national level, with the limitation that the populations for the baseline
and the follow-up survey are different as only six regions are being covered by the follow-up survey. The
role of UNICEF programming in the change in adult KAP could not therefore be addressed. However, the
individual-level analysis described above was also carried out for adults, allowing us to explore the
association between participation in UNICEF programming and KAP.
9.4. Ethical Considerations and Evaluation Principles
This evaluation has been guided by a tailored ethical protocol based on the Coram International ethical
protocol, the UNEG Ethical Guidelines and the Ethical Principles of Research Involving Children.145 This
protocol was adapted in line with the project’s methodology and data collection tools and plan. All
research was carried out in full accordance with the UNEG Ethical Guidelines and Coram International’s
own Ethical Guidelines (Annex 5) as well as UNICEF’s Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation Data
Collection and Analysis, and was guided by the evaluators’ obligations of independence, impartiality,
credibility, avoiding conflicts of interest, and accountability.
Coram International and Participatory Development Associates collaborated to ensure that all external
researchers had the necessary experience to carry out the research required. Training was provided to
PDA by Coram International on the ethical protocol and best practice issues for carrying out the relevant
research. Training carried out by PDA also emphasised the importance of the ethical protocol and
provided information on the safeguarding protocol to be followed in the event of any child protection
concerns. In addition, Coram International employed the following ethical safeguards for this
consultancy:
Review: The methodology and tools were reviewed and approved by the Director or Research Manager
before they were deployed.

47
Managing expectations: Researchers were trained to carefully explain the nature and purpose of the
study to study participants, and the role that the data will play in the research project. Participants were
informed that the purpose of the researcher’s visit was not to offer direct assistance in order to avoid
raising unfounded expectations.
Voluntary participation: Participation in the research was undertaken on a voluntary basis. Researchers
explained to participants in clear, age-appropriate language that participants were not required to
participate and that they were able to stop participating at any time without negative consequences.
Informed consent: Research participants were informed of the purpose and nature of the study, their
contribution, and how the data collected from them would be used in the study, through an information
and consent form, where possible and where this was appropriate and not intimidating for young people.
Procedures were in place both for signing forms and for demonstrating informed consent for those
participants who were not literate (see further details in Annex 5). Where possible, parental consent was
obtained for all children aged under 13 years. For children aged over 13, the decision on whether consent
from parents / carers is needed was made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature and context
of the research and the age and capacity of participants. Special care was taken to ensure that especially
vulnerable children gave informed consent.
Anonymity and confidentiality: Ensuring confidentiality and anonymity is of the utmost importance. The
identity of all research participants is kept confidential throughout the process of data collection as well
as in the analysis and writing up of study findings. Measures to ensure anonymity included interviewing
in private settings; not recording names; ensuring that research findings are presented in such a way as
to ensure individuals can’t be identified; and safe data storage.
Addressing child protection concerns: Prior to the data collection taking place, researchers were trained
on PDA’s child protection policies and procedures and familiarised themselves with child protection
referral mechanisms and child protection focal points. Procedures were in place to report any disclosure
of a child protection risk.
For more detailed information on ethical safeguards and risk management, see Coram International’s
complete Ethical Guidelines in Annex 5.

FINDINGS AND PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS
10.1. Relevance of the CP programme
Alignment with government and institutional priorities
To what extent have the child protection programme and its approaches been aligned (and consistently so over
time) with national priorities, SDGs and commitments of UNICEF (UNICEF Strategic Plans) in the area of prevention
and response to violence against girls and boys?
1. Evaluation findings demonstrate a strong alignment between UNICEF’s child protection
programme’s design and approaches and the Government of Ghana’s priorities in relation to violence
against children. This is reflected in GoG policy documents, including the National Medium Term
Development Policy Framework, which includes commitments to reducing the number of children who
become victims of violence and abuse,146 and the Government’s second Ghana Shared Growth Agenda,
which identifies a number of strategies for protecting children against violence, abuse and exploitation.147
Notably, the vast majority of these strategies were found to be aligned with and supported by UNICEF’s
CP programme. Furthermore, representatives of National Government Agencies consistently emphasised
the relevance of UNICEF’s support to their institutional mandates; particularly UNICEF’s contributions to
strengthening and integrating the legal and policy framework for child protection, a focus of the 2012-
2017 programme, and building the capacity of service providers to implement that framework, work
which occurred across both programme cycles. Government stakeholders expressed appreciation for
UNICEF’s collaborative approach to programming, which involved engaging in consultation with
government partners at all stages to ensure that approaches were relevant, coordinated and well-aligned
with the GoG’s priorities and plans:
Do you feel UNICEF’s approach is aligned with government’s approach?
Yes very much – UNICEF worked with the government to develop their action plan. It is done
together collaboratively so it is in line with our National Development Plan… I think UNICEF has
done very very well…. They really try to understand where we are coming from so they aren’t
‘shoving something down our throats’. The consultant we have been working with – he is always

trying to ensure that when something comes on board it is workable. He is trying to make sure it
is up and running. He goes to the district level, sometimes even without our knowledge! 148
2. UNICEF’s commitment to national priorities is also evident in their willingness to divert from
past approaches where these were not found to be well aligned with needs in Ghana. For instance, in
2010 UNICEF had supported the development of standards for residential care homes for children in
Ghana, . These standards were never applied in practice as they were considered to be ill-suited to and
unrealistic for the Ghanaian context.149 In 2017 UNICEF reviewed and simplified the standards to ensure
their compatibility with the context and developed a tool and checklist to support their implementation.
As is discussed further in the effectiveness section below, the revised standards are viewed as more
relevant to the context, and are being increasingly applied.
3. UNICEF’s programme design placed particular emphasis on preventing and responding to
violence against children (VAC), in line with Ghana’s commitments under the Sustainable Development
Goals, particularly SDG 16.2150. Protecting children from violence was featured as a key component of
frameworks for both country programmes, including output five of the 2012-2017 programme151 and
output 2 of the 2018 – 2022 programme152. A significant focus of programme interventions has been on
building the capacity of the national child protection system to respond to cases of violence against
children, and preventing VAC through community outreach and mobilisation campaigns.153 Prevention
work at the community level was recognised as particularly important given the widespread acceptance
of certain forms of VAC, such as corporal punishment.
4. Furthermore, the Child Protection Programme succeeded in integrating VAC prevention and
response work into a holistic, systems strengthening approach to child protection programming. The
move towards a systems strengthening approach to child protection work was well aligned with UNICEF’s
global strategy as articulated in the Global Strategic Plan 2014-2017 (the Plan emphasised system
strengthening under Outcome 6). It remains highly relevant under the current Global Strategic Plan 2018-
2021, which identifies system-strengthening amongst its eight change strategies. This shift entailed a
significant move away from previous approaches, which had focussed on addressing particular child
protection issues. As a UNICEF representative recalled:
The real shift we saw in Ghana was in 2012-2013 - from issue-based programming during the
country programme cycle that ended in 2011. A baseline assessment in 2012 recommended that
UNICEF move away from programming focused on a single issue, such as the street children
programme in 2010-2011… There was a global shift towards systems strengthening, but UNICEF
Ghana learned it the hard way - learned not to repeat the same mistakes. We’ve made a
deliberate attempt to bring that out and we’ve taken it very seriously.154
5. Indeed, since 2012, UNICEF has contributed to building the capacity of the Ghanaian child
protection system across all relevant spheres: the legal and regulatory framework; institutional
structures and coordination mechanisms; delivery of services; data systems and monitoring
frameworks; human, financial and infrastructure resources; and social participation.155

51
Meeting donor commitments
To what extent has the child protection programme responded to UNICEF commitments made to development
partners, especially Global Affairs Canada and USAID?
6. UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has received funding from a number of development
partners, but contributions from USAID and Global Affairs Canada have been particularly significant. The
Programme was found to have delivered effectively on its donor commitments, as evidenced by regular
progress reports, and donors expressed satisfaction with UNICEF’s ability to meet reporting
requirements and demonstrate results.
7. UNICEF’s CP Programme design is particularly relevant to donor priorities. It responds to Global
Affairs Canada’s particular interest in promoting gender equality and empowerment and protection for
women and girls, and USAID’s interest in improving childcare for children who are orphaned or separated
from their families. As is set out in the context section, both of these priorities are also highly relevant to
child protection needs in Ghana. Furthermore, rather than designing targeted interventions to address
these issues, the Child Protection Programme was able to integrate funding successfully into the
broader systems strengthening strategy described above.
Responsiveness to children’s voices and needs
To what extent has the design of the child protection programme taken into account the voices of girls and boys
and their different needs based on age, gender, ethnicity and other social identities, especially the most vulnerable?
8. Across research sites, respondents consistently described that UNICEF has taken a consultative
and responsive approach to programming; seeking out beneficiaries’ views and making relevant
adjustments to meet their needs better. When asked how UNICEF has engaged the voices of children
and young people in their programming, respondents tended to identify field visits: “from time to time
to time, UNICEF comes down to seek feedback from all beneficiaries irrespective of their status or
background”156; participatory programming, such as community mobilisation activities: “we provide
opportunities for them to share their views and opinions during community engagement”157; and
participation in more formal consultations, such as the example detailed below, amongst others.
Example: Children’s Participation in Legal Consultation
From 2017 - 2018 UNICEF undertook a comprehensive review of Ghana’s legal framework on children’s
rights to inform the amendment of the Children’s Act, the Juvenile Justice Act, and other related laws.158
The review aimed at identifying gaps in Ghana’s legal framework for child rights and developing
recommendations for how these can be addressed. Importantly, the review included consultations with
children to take their views on board.
The consultations took place over a period of two days, and included 50 children between the ages of 12
– 18 from across all ten regions of Ghana. Children were selected from diverse demographics and
backgrounds and a number of children with disabilities were included to ensure the representation of
their views. According to a report detailing the proceedings: “There was a general appreciation among
stakeholders of the significance of consulting with children, as legislative amendments would directly
affect them and generations to come.”159

Children were asked to discuss a number of questions aimed at capturing their views on particular child
protection issues as well as specific legal provisions, including corporal punishment, consensual sexual
relations and the right to legal representation, among others. Their views were incorporated into the
conclusions and recommendations of the review, which have formed the basis of UNICEF and
government partners’ efforts towards legislative reform.
9. Finally, and as is discussed further in the effectiveness section of the evaluation, UNICEF’s Child
Protection Programme has conducted numerous data gathering and research exercises designed to
inform programming approaches. Children have been included as participants in the vast majority of
these, such as the Most Significant Change Stories (a participatory monitoring technique aimed at
gathering lived experiences of normative or behaviour change), Knowledge Attitudes and Practice
assessments (2014 and 2018), Research on Children Before the Courts (2019), Research on Child Online
Practice (2017) and an Assessment of UNICEF’s Child Marriage Strategies (2017), to name a few.
10. In addition to actively seeking out children’s views, evaluation findings suggest that UNICEF
took a responsive approach to programming and was willing to make adjustments to accommodate
beneficiaries’ preferences and needs. Again, this was recognised by respondents who described different
instances where UNICEF incorporated participant feedback into their programming. As one stakeholder
recalled:
I remember the toolkit was not laminated. The next version was all laminated. This evaluation is
another example… They come to test tools with stakeholders and use the views of the
stakeholders to improve the tools.160
11. Generally, UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme was found to be highly relevant, designed in a
sensitive and inclusive way with the intention of meeting the needs of diverse groups across gender,
ethnicity, religion and other social identities. However, evaluation findings suggest that in practice
certain groups of children have been more difficult to reach than others. In particular, a number of
respondents mentioned that street children require additional support and have been neglected by
prevention and response services delivered through the national child protection system:
The national child protection system does not address the needs of street children at all. Maybe
it does for other children.. Street children in particular are not aware of any services available to
them in the first place, so that is a major barrier.161
12. Street children are a particularly difficult group to reach and to engage. UNICEF should consider
how future programming can draw on the views of street children and address their particular
vulnerabilities.
Preliminary conclusions on the relevance of UNICEF’s CP Programme
REL 1. UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme’s design and approaches have been well aligned with the
Government of Ghana’s priorities in relation to VAC and child protection more broadly, particularly in the
areas of legal and policy reform and capacity building. [Paras 1 – 3].
REL 2. The Programme integrated VAC prevention and response work into a holistic system strengthening
approach, building the capacity of the child protection system across relevant areas. [Paras 4 – 5].
REL 3. UNICEF was found to have delivered effectively on its donor commitments and the programme
design was well aligned with donor priorities. [Paras 6 – 7].

REL 4. The Child Protection Programme was found to be relevant to the needs of children in Ghana, due
to its consultative and responsive approach. [Paras 8 – 10].
REL 5. Despite this, particularly vulnerable groups, such as street children, may require additional support
to fully benefit from national CP services. [Paras 11 – 12].
10.2. Outcomes and effectiveness of the child protection
programme
To what extent did the Child Protection Programme’s interventions contribute to the intended results on the
protection of girls and boys (covering all areas of the programme) as per the country programme documents and
subsequent annual work plans?
What are the results that can be attributed to the Child Protection Programme (v contribution)?
How have partnerships been mobilised so as to contribute effectively to the child protection programme?
To what extent were gender and human rights principles integrated into the design, implementation and monitoring
of the child protection programme?
Effectiveness of policy, institutional and legal reform
To what degree have the policy, institutional and legal frameworks been reformed to be in line with the Convention
on the Rights of the Child, its optional protocols, and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child?
13. Outcome 1 of the 2012-2017 Child Protection Programme set as its goal the approval of a Child
and Family Welfare Policy and alignment of the Children’s Act with the Policy. A further goal, contained
in Outcome 2 was the development and approval of a ‘Justice for Children Policy’ with amendments to
the Juvenile Justice Act to align it with the policy. The focus on legal reform continued in the 2018-2022
Child Protection Programme, with Output 1: child and family welfare, justice for children and birth
registration-related laws and regulations are aligned with child protection policies and international
standards and, in particular, “The Children's Act, the Juvenile Justice Act and the Criminal Procedure Act
are reviewed in line with child protection policies and international standards by 2020.”
Strengthening the policy framework
14. The National Child Protection Policy framework was developed and approved with support from
UNICEF under Output 1 in 2013. Following on from this, two key policies were developed: the Child and
Family Welfare Policy, adopted in February 2015, and the Justice for Children Policy, adopted in
November 2015. These policies, together, provided the first comprehensive vision and roadmap for child
protection systems strengthening in Ghana; setting out aims, objectives and orientation.162 The policies
are guided by and aligned with international standards, and incorporate the four general principles of the
UNCRC,163 as well as other international key principles, such as the right to legal representation, privacy
and the right to a fair trial. Further, the system envisaged by the two Policies reflect international
standards and best practice, focusing on prevention, child and family services, and rehabilitation and
social reintegration. UNICEF has also supported the National Development Planning Commission to
develop the Ghana National Medium-Term Development Policy Framework 2018-2021 which has the
improvement of child protection and family welfare and ensuring the rights and entitlements of
children.164 The key activities are building an inter-sectoral framework to ensure collaboration, reporting

and accounting on child protection and family welfare programmes; the development of a Child
Protection Management System; implementing a national social protection floor for children and
expanding social protection to reach all vulnerable children and the introduction of the District Integrated
Social Services Programme for children.
15. By outlining the roles and responsibilities of key state institutions and major stakeholders at all
levels, as well as the relationships between the formal and informal structures, the Policies provide the
institutional framework for the child protection system.165 Importantly the Policies have also acted as
drivers for further legal and policy reform.166
16. UNICEF’s support, technical assistance and advocacy in relation to the development of the
Policies was highly effective and central to this significant achievement. The policies represent major
achievements in the enabling environment around child protection, and engagement with key
stakeholders has raised the profile of child protection.
The ongoing legal reform process
17. The developments of the Child and Family Welfare Policy and the Child Justice Policy revealed, as
expected, the need for legislative amendments to ensure that child protection laws reflected and
implemented the policy aligned with international standards.167
18. A small number of legal reforms were completed under the 2012-2017 Programme, such as an
amendment to the Children’s Act to align the Law with the newly ratified Hague Convention on Inter-
Country Adoption. In addition, a comprehensive legal reform process was begun in 2017 led by the
MOGCSP supported by UNICEF and Global Affairs Canada. While started in the 2012-2017 Programme,
the review continued during the 2018-2022 Programme.168 The proposed legal amendments went
through a process of consultation with national, regional and district-level stakeholders coordinated by
the Department of Children. This was followed by the development of position papers, which enabled
consensus on particularly contentious key amendments to be agreed.169 The proposals for legal
amendments were submitted to the Government in 2019. The results include the Registration of Births
and Deaths Act 2020 and the Cybersecurity Act 2020.
19. The extensive amendments proposed and still being considered include: repealing the
Children’s Act and replacing it with a new Act, as well as amendments to the Criminal and Other
Offences Act, the Juvenile Justice Act and the Anti-Human Trafficking Act. Proposed amendments to the
Children Act include incorporation of regulations and standards170 relating to care and protection of
children, giving them a statutory basis; strengthening the legislation on the prohibition of corporal
punishment; introducing new legislation to protect and support child victims and witnesses during
criminal proceedings; amending the legal definitions of rape and sexual assault; bringing the definition of
child prostitution in line with the OPSC and introducing new legislation to address emerging issues around
child online protection.171
20. The development of the Child and Family Welfare Policy and the Child Justice Policy represented
a significant development in aligning the policy and institutional framework in Ghana with international

child protection standards. The legal reform process, if completed as foreseen, will provide Ghana with a
comprehensive legal framework for child protection and child justice aligned, to a high degree, with
international treaties and conventions. In addition to the success of bringing these activities to a
conclusion, this evaluation found that UNICEF’s leadership in the process of reform has been particularly
effective and has paved the way for successful implementation of the new policies, as well as setting the
ground for further, future reform.
21. UNICEF’s support for the process of legal reform has also been highly effective. Its financial and
technical support for research studies, baseline studies and legal reviews etc. on pressing, and
sometimes contentious issues that arose during the process of legal reform, allowed decisions to be
made with the benefit of empirical evidence. This in turn led to better informed and stronger advocacy,
which in its turn created an understanding of the need for reforms on the part of stakeholders. In
addition, extensive and inclusive stakeholder consultations at all levels raised the profile of child
protection issues and stimulated debates, while at the same time galvanising support for, and
legitimizing, the reform process as it moved forward.172 The process promoted ownership for the
reforms and fostered relationships with stakeholders, all of which were essential for successful
implementation of the reforms, and also for further programming and future reform.173
22. Interviews with stakeholders confirmed that UNICEF’s support was understood to be
instrumental in driving the child protections systems strengthening process forward, particularly in
relation to policy, institutional and legal reform. Stakeholders at different levels referred both to the
changes they had seen within their particular area of work, as well as at systems level.
23. The important contributions made by UNICEF and its comparative advantage in relation to
effective ‘upstream work’ with Government partners was particularly noted by stakeholders: I think
UNICEF is doing the thing they need to do – strengthening systems at national level. No other donor is
doing that. That role is really important….I really appreciate how well they work with national
government. I think the UN – their influence and traction with government is an advantage. 174
24. During the period since 2012, significant developments have also been seen in the alignment of
policy, institutional and legal frameworks with international standards in relation to specific child
protection issues, as set out below.
Alternative care
25. In relation to alternative care, important steps were taken towards creating a more robust
framework and system in line with international standards and ensuring the best interest of children
in need of such services.175 UNICEF supported these processes through technical assistance and
advocacy. New Foster Care and Adoption Regulations, based on key provisions from the UNCRC, CEDAW
and the 1993 Hague Convention on Inter-Country Adoption were developed in 2014 and approved by the
Parliament in 2018.176 In 2016 amendments were also made to the Children's Act to reflect Ghana’s
accession to the Hague Convention. Amendments included the establishment of a Central Authority for
adoption, restricting the court decisions on adoption to the High Court and bringing adoption and
fostering options in line with the Hague Convention.177 Through these reforms, gaps in the legal, policy

and institutional framework which had been highlighted by the UNCRC Committee’s Concluding
Observations in 2015 were successfully addressed.178
Child marriage, child trafficking, child labour and child online protection
These are all areas where UNICEF has supported legal reform and engaged in advocacy, and which came
to a successful conclusion. To address specific gaps and bottlenecks in the policy framework, UNICEF
provided support to the finalisation of the National Strategic Framework on Ending Child Marriage
(2017-2026) and its operational framework, which was publicly launched in 2017.179
26. New regulations on the prohibition of trafficking came into force in 2015.180 UNICEF supported
the MoGCSP to develop a National Action Plan (NPA) for the Elimination of Human Trafficking. The
commencement of the implementation of the NPA saw the formation of the Anti-Trafficking Unit
established by MoGCSP to coordinate the implementation, thus providing a strengthened institutional
framework.181
27. UNICEF provided technical and financial assistance to the MoELR to review the 2009-2015
National Plan of Action on the Worst Forms of Child Labour in light of the new Child and Family Welfare
Policy and launched a new plan for 2017-2021.
28. In order to address the growing concerns around child online protection in Ghana, UNICEF
supported national stakeholder consultations on the review of child online protection framework and
its costed implementation plan.182 It also supported the development of the Cybersecurity Bill, which
was passed by Parliament in 2020. The Ministry of Communications through the National Cyber Centre
launched the Child Online Protection Portal in October 2020 and provided a revised Child Online
Protection Framework.183 The intention is for the portal to receive reports of child sexual abuse materials
available on the internet and work with network providers to ensure their removal. UNICEF worked
closely with the lead agencies, IOM and UNFPA in the areas of trafficking, child marriage, and online
protection, mobilising partnerships effectively.184
Justice for children
29. Although the Juvenile Justice Act 2003 established a relatively comprehensive framework for
children who offend, implementation of the Act has been weak, with the Justice for Children Policy
describing “a disconnect between law and practice”.185 The Policy focuses on prevention of offending;
strengthening programmes for rehabilitation and social reintegration; the strengthening of formal and
community justice systems and the protection of child victims and witnesses. The Justice for Children
Policy brought together all the relevant stakeholders, the police service, the judicial service, the Office of
the Attorney-General, CHRAJ, the Legal Aid Scheme and social welfare.
30. The proposed amendments to the Juvenile Justice Act and the Criminal and Other Offences Act
include provisions to protect the interests of child victims and witnesses at all stages of criminal
proceedings, which is currently missing from legislation. This should ensure that victims and witnesses
are supported to participate effectively, protected from secondary victimisation and that child-friendly
interviewing and investigation techniques are used throughout proceedings. Other amendments include

including data and identity protection, age determination and reform of child panels.186
31. In sum, the period since 2012 has seen extensive and significant developments in aligning the
policy, institutional and legal frameworks in Ghana with international standards. The evaluation finds
that UNICEF’s technical assistance, financial support as well as its support to policy dialogue and
advocacy have been instrumental in achieving these outcomes. In particular, the key achievements
include the launch of the Child and Family Welfare Policy and the Child Justice Policy and, under the
current programme cycle, the comprehensive legal reform process on track to be completed in 2022.
Together, these developments provide a comprehensive framework for the Ghanaian child protection
system.
32. While policy, institutional and legal reform may no longer need to be the central focus of
programming, there remains a need for some further, limited legal reform to ensure full alignment with
international conventions and norms, particularly in relation to online protection for children. There is
still a need to ratify and accede to relevant international conventions and protocols, including the
Optional Protocol to the CRC on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography187 and to
enact new legislation or amend existing laws, as well as clear guidelines on how online abuse or violations
should be addressed.

Effectiveness of the national child protection system
To what degree has the national child protection system been able to respond to the needs of vulnerable girls and
boys, especially the most marginalised, that were separated or exposed to violence? Do barriers continue to prevent
women, girls and boys from accessing services? How has UNICEF’s child protection programme addressed these?]
Do you think the Ghanaian child protection system sufficiently addresses the needs of all children in
Ghana, including the most vulnerable?
No. I am saying that we are getting there. If I say it has addressed them then it means we are there. I
feel more needs to be done. It’s a journey and a very long journey but we have started it.
- Regional Director of Community Development
33. UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has made considerable contributions to strengthening the
capacity of the national child protection system to respond to the needs of at-risk children over the course
of both the 2012 – 2017 and 2018 – 2022 programme cycles. This work falls largely under Outcome 1 and
Output 2188 of the 2012-2017 programme, aimed at building the capacity of child protection service
providers to address child protection risk in line with national policy standards and standard operating
procedures, as well as Output 2189 of the 2018 – 2022 programme; that most vulnerable and
disadvantaged girls and boys have access to services to prevent and respond to violence against children.
Building an institutional framework for the delivery of CP response services
34. When UNICEF’s 2012 programme cycle began, Ghana lacked an institutional framework for the
delivery of child protection response services at local level. Despite the fact that the Children’s Act of
1998 mandates district assemblies to protect the welfare and promote the rights of children, a 2012
mapping and analysis of the child protection system concluded that: “there is no clear structure for
delivery of social welfare and child justice services at the community level” 190. Whilst the mapping found
that a handful of districts had child protection teams or committees operating, these tended to be ad-
hoc projects, and were often limited to addressing specific child protection issues. According to the
mapping, such services “have generally not been conceptualised as the lowest rung of the social welfare
service delivery framework. Many do not have clear linkages to district-level social welfare authorities,
and are dependent on external funding”191. The mapping and analysis also noted a lack of protocols or
procedures to guide social welfare officers in how to provide an appropriate response when a child was
identified as being ‘at-risk’. In sum, a comprehensive and systematic approach to providing a social
welfare response in cases where children are at risk of harm was found to be lacking.
35. In light of these gaps, both UNICEF and the Government of Ghana developed a more strategic
vision for child protection work, adopting a system strengthening approach.192 In addition to supporting
reforms to the legal framework (described in section 5.2.1 above), UNICEF supported the government
to build the capacity of the formal child protection system to respond to the needs of at-risk children,
including those who have been separated and exposed to violence, in a more coordinated and
systematic way. This approach is articulated in the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection’s
(MoGCSP) recent ‘Capacity Building Strategy for Strengthening the Social Welfare Services Workforce’193,
188 ‘Child protection service providers demonstrate strengthened and coordinated capacity to prevent, promote and respond to child protection
abuses in line with national policy and standard operational procedures’.

developed with UNICEF’s support, and drawing upon a ‘social welfare workforce capacity assessment’194
conducted by UNICEF, MoGCSP and the Office of the Head of Local Government Service in 2019. UNICEF
also provided support to the development of standard operating procedures for child protection case
management, which were published in 2018. Since then, the SOPs have been rolled out progressively,
supported by UNICEF’s Policy-to-Practice and USAID DCOF initiatives, which have built the capacity of
Departments of Social Welfare and Community Development to deliver child protection response service
in line with the SOPs. UNICEF’s support has also included collaborating with the schools of social work
and community development in the University of Development Studies to integrate child protection into
the curriculum and establish a certificate course for child protection.195
36. Evaluation findings indicate that UNICEF’s contributions have resulted in the establishment of a
comprehensive child protection response service delivered through district administrations (MMDAs)
as part of a broader national child protection system. These changes were recognised and valued by
respondents, who emphasised the importance of building an institutional framework for child protection
work. As one Regional Social Welfare Director explained, “structures have been developed. We now have
the Department of Social Welfare in all districts. Various committees (community, district, and regional
child protection committees) are in place.”196 Indeed, it is clear that district level authorities have
increasingly taken on responsibility for child protection work, as indicated by the number of MMDAs who
have child protection interventions in their medium development plans.197 Yet respondents also noted
that a significant amount of work remains to be done to ensure that the institutional framework for
service delivery translates into more accessible and responsive child protection and social welfare
services on the ground. In the cynical view of one stakeholder, “there is a lot on paper, but nothing
practical is done. The main challenge has to do with the authorities knowing exactly what to do and how
to do it. Policies are not meant to be just formulated but implemented.”198
Identifying and responding to child protection risk
37. It is difficult to determine the exact extent of child protection response in Ghana, given that
national data on district level child protection interventions was not available at the time that the
evaluation was undertaken. According to administrative data gathered in 57 of the 60 districts visited as
part of the evaluation, social welfare authorities responded to a total of 1,763 child protection cases over
the period of 2019 and 2020199, with 654 cases recorded in 2019 and 1,107 recorded in 2020. The change
in caseload suggests that response services at district level are expanding and may reflect greater
awareness and recognition of reporting channels within communities. The number of cases recorded
varied significantly across districts, however, ranging from a minimum of 2 cases to a maximum of 216.
Unsurprisingly, metropolitan districts had a larger average caseload (with 63 cases on average) when
compared to municipal and ordinary districts (which had an average of 28 and 26 cases, respectively).200
38. As is set out in Figure 1 below, the vast majority of child protection cases were classified as child
maintenance cases (986 cases or 56 per cent), followed by custody cases (331 cases or 19 per cent) and
parental neglect (277 cases or 16 per cent).

39. These findings are highly consistent with results from the service provider survey. Survey
respondents overwhelmingly identified child maintenance, parental neglect and custody cases as the
most common child protection concern in their community, while juvenile offending, emotional abuse
and sexual abuse were mentioned far less frequently (Figure 2 below).201 ‘Other’ concerns rarely
identified by survey respondents included teenage pregnancy (5 respondents), child trafficking (3
respondents), drug abuse (2 respondents) and missing children (2 respondents).

Degree of concern (combined score)
40. Qualitative data also supports these findings, with district social welfare officers describing their
caseload as heavily dominated by child maintenance cases, and to a lesser extent cases of neglect and
abandonment. When asked about the most common types of cases the child protection system is
responding to, a representative of the Department of Children at national level quickly replied, “the issue

common concern.
61
of non-maintenance of children – people don’t want to pay child support or they don’t have money. And
it is a huge challenge for social welfare”202.
41. These findings are problematic, suggesting that the child protection system is not yet fulfilling its
core function of identifying and responding to cases where children are at risk of harm. Ensuring that
absent parents provide financial support to their families is likely to promote positive outcomes for
vulnerable children and may help prevent family separation. Yet addressing child maintenance and
custody cases is not typically the role of a child protection system. Meanwhile, the low number of cases
involving child abuse identified by the CP system is highly concerning, indicating that a significant
proportion of cases where children are exposed to violence are not receiving an appropriate child
protection response. When asked about violence against children, the majority of social welfare officers
replied that they rarely see this type of case. Instead, a number of key informant interviews at district
and regional level suggest that VAC cases are typically handled by the Police Service’s Domestic Violence
Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU), rather than by district social welfare authorities. This finding appears to
be a continuation of previous practices: the 2012 Child Protection Systems Mapping reported that “for
most children, entry into the formal child protection system is as the result of a report to DOVVSU.”203
42. This pattern is problematic for several reasons. Firstly, it suggests that cases of violence against
children are only identified when they reach a very high threshold and that a number of cases which could
benefit from a social work intervention but aren’t yet considered to be a criminal matter may be missed
by the system. Indeed, data from DOVVSU also indicates that very few cases of child abuse are coming
into the national CP system: according to data contained in Ghana’s combined sixth and seventh reports
to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, DOVVSU reported having responded to a total of 348 children
‘exposed to harm’ over the years 2014 – 2019, an average of only 58 cases per year.204 Cases involving
sexual offences against children were much higher, averaging 1,094 per year for the same period. Whilst
it is positive that cases of child sexual abuse are being reported to law enforcement, these figures
suggest that cases where children are at-risk of other forms of violence or abuse, particularly cases that
don’t reach a criminal threshold, are not receiving a child protection response.
43. Another potential issue is whether DOVVSU has sufficient capacity to provide a holistic child
protection response in cases of child abuse, including cases of sexual violence. Whilst the unit does have
social workers and psychologists on staff to work with victims, its primary focus is on investigation and
criminal prosecution, rather than delivering social work services aimed at identifying and addressing harm
or underlying risk factors. Furthermore, a mapping of the Ghana Police Service conducted in 2016 found
there was a gap in the skills and resources required for crisis counselling and psychosocial support.205 This
highlights the importance of engaging social services in responding to cases of child abuse, in line with
the Children’s Act, 1998, which holds that any person with information on child abuse, or a child in need
of care and protection shall report the matter to the Department of Social Welfare206.
44. Several MMDA social workers described having an effective working relationship with DOVVSU
and identified this as one of the positive changes that has occurred in recent years:
The current system of operation has enabled social welfare and DOVVSU to collaborate
effectively. Previously, DOVVSU would decide to work on a case and do family tracing without
notifying social welfare. Sometimes the case would be sent to court and the social welfare office

would not be in the know…. However because of the inter-sectoral collaboration and sensitization
going on, the approach has changed.207
45. Yet evaluation findings suggest that coordination between DOVVSU and social welfare
authorities remains weak in many localities. A district level social welfare officer described the situation:
Abuse cases are not normally reported to us. They go to DOVVSU. But we have told DOVVSU that
if cases are reported and there are instances where social welfare is needed, they should call our
attention and then we will take it up from there. They should deal with their criminal aspect, and
we should deal with the social aspect!208
46. Administrative data also suggests that referrals from DOVVSU to social welfare authorities are
relatively rare; only 1.7% of the child protection cases recorded in the 57 districts where data was
gathered were referred by DOVVSU. And whilst a number of respondents reported that collaboration
between DOVVSU and social welfare is working well, others described a dysfunctional relationship.
This may be due to the fact that Department of Social Welfare and Community Development are
perceived as lacking the capacity or resources to respond effectively to CP cases. As one DOVVSU
representative frankly explained:
If I may add, we are supposed to collaborate with the Department of Social Welfare to make the
work of child protection easier, but the truth is that they are even more financially and logistically
challenged than we are. Most of the time we have to handle cases on our own because referring
them to social welfare would only prolong the issue, because they are financially
incapacitated…209
A gender breakdown of CP response data
Administrative data suggests that district social welfare services are similarly responsive in cases involving
both girls and boys; cases were fairly evenly split by gender, with 51 per cent of cases involving girls and
45 per cent involving boys.210 Child maintenance cases were slightly more likely to involve girls and
custody cases were slightly more likely to involve boys, which may reflect gendered social norms which
place greater value on boys than girls. Cases of theft and child labour were more common for boys, while
girls were more likely to be victims of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation and child marriage.211
Barriers to identification and referral
47. Evaluation findings suggest that effective and reliable referral channels between frontline
professionals and district level social welfare authorities are lacking in many districts, undermining
identification of cases where children are at-risk. According to administrative data records from MMDAs,
the vast majority of cases were referred by family members (79 per cent), followed by the police (10 per
cent). A small number of cases were referred by community members or leaders (3.2 per cent and 1.8
per cent respectively) and by the Domestic Violence Victim Support Unit (1.7 per cent). Education and
health professionals were responsible for a negligible number of referrals (10 and 5 cases, respectively).
The service provider survey yielded similar results. Family members were also the most common referral
source cited by social workers (48 per cent), followed by community members (23 per cent) and the police
(15 per cent). Again, teachers and health professionals were not identified as common sources of
referrals.

48. Given that social workers’ caseload is heavily dominated by child maintenance and custody cases
it is not surprising that the majority of referrals come from family members. Yet the lack of referrals from
other important sources such as law enforcement authorities, community leaders and health and
education professionals is likely to have contributed to the low numbers of child abuse cases reaching
social welfare authorities, and undermined the ability of the CP system to respond to child protection
need.
49. There is some evidence that districts that have received UNICEF interventions, particularly
those that were part of the ‘policy to practice initiative’, are more likely to receive referrals from the
police, community members and DOVVSU (Figure 3).212 This may be due to greater awareness in these
districts of the role of the Department of Social Welfare and Community Development and greater
cooperation between police and social workers. However, the number of referrals from health and
education professionals is still very low even in these intervention districts.

which reduce the likelihood that child protection cases will be reported to relevant authorities. These
range from persistent stigma around child abuse and attitudes which are accepting of domestic
violence, to a lack of awareness of reporting channels and practical barriers, which make accessing
services challenging or costly. The following explanations provided by social welfare authorities are
particularly illustrative:
Well, the barriers I have seen are the availability and nearness of the facility to the caregivers.
Most of the services provided are in the district capitals. Sometimes caregivers do not have the
means to travel to these places to access the services provided. So, accessibility is a major
barrier.213
--
Poverty is a very huge barrier [to accessing services]. And ignorance of the existing structures on
child protection. Religion has a way of silencing people. Or a desire to uphold the family honour.
For example, a case where a father abused his daughter and the mother thinks the child should
keep quiet. …214

51. These barriers to access are certainly not unique to Ghana, and are likely to continue to pose a
challenge to the national child protection system for years to come. Yet several respondents described
cases where social pressure not to report child abuse was found to be so severe that it prevented even
the most serious cases from being reported or receiving an appropriate response:
We also realized that more often than not abuse cases are not being reported to the police which
are the first contact in these matters. This is so because they see themselves as one family, and
reporting - especially if the perpetrator of the act is a family member - is seen as a sort of betrayal.
Even those that are reported, we don’t get the support of the families to pursue the case further
to its logical conclusion.215
--
When an issue of child defilement is reported at DOVVSU families come and request to take the
case home even though the cases are criminal cases. The families end up talking to the police and
asking the victims to withdraw the case. Sometimes they even threaten the victims with death. I
remember Youth Foundation had one case where a 7-year-old was defiled and the father
threatened the mother, asking why she reported the case to DOVVSU since it was a close relative
that defiled the child. Because she realized that her life was at risk she had to back off. It is difficult
to even prosecute such cases because on the day of court the witness will not even show up in
court because of the threats on their lives.216
52. The above example demonstrates the need for greater alignment between the child protection
and justice sectors, and improved access to witness protection, as well as community engagement and
awareness campaigns to reduce the stigma around different forms of child abuse and to address
gendered power imbalances. These are areas that UNICEF has targeted in its programming (results are
discussed in greater depth in section 3.2.3 on behaviour change and community mobilisation). It also
illustrates the importance of strengthening referral channels from other sources, such as health,
education, and community leadership, to ensure that cases are referred to child protection authorities
even where family members fail to report them.
CP response and the implementation of case management procedures
53. UNICEF has worked closely with partners to build the capacity of social workers to respond to
child protection cases through a case management approach, in line with the Government’s newly
published Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). 217 In order to assess the extent to which the SOPs are
applied in practice, a survey of government child protection service providers (the service provider
survey) was conducted in 60 districts, with two respondents surveyed per district.218 33 of the districts
had received UNICEF interventions aiming to build social worker capacity in line with the case
management SOPs, while 27 had not received training on the standardised forms and case management
SOPs and so are referred to as ‘comparison’ districts. As UNICEF has delivered training in all 260 districts
on the preparation of medium-term development plans and annual reports, the comparison is made
specifically in terms of the districts’ approach to case management and use of the SOPs and forms.
54. Social workers’ case management practices were assessed against the stages laid out in the case
management SOPs, namely identification, assessment, planning, implementation, follow up and review,

and closure. Findings on the implementation of case management, and the degree to which procedures
are aligned with the SOPs, are presented below. More detailed results can be found in Annex 6 to the
report.
Overall, 80 per cent of respondents had received training on the case management SOPs. As expected,
those in intervention districts were more likely to have received this training than those in comparison
districts, though 66 per cent of those in comparison districts had still received training.219 Respondents in
comparison districts were less likely to report having been trained by UNICEF and more likely to report
having been trained by regional government.220 In the end-of-survey comments, several respondents
requested further training on the case management SOPs, including pre-service training for new staff
members and in-service refresher trainings.
Alignment with case management SOPs: One key worker
55. Ideally a child and their family should be assigned a case worker or manager who is able to provide
individualised support based on the child’s particular needs, and who can develop a relationship of trust
and support with the child and family. Around a third (34 per cent) of social workers surveyed reported
that this is always the case in their district, 23 per cent said it happens most of the time, 19 per cent that
it happens sometimes, and 24 per cent that it rarely or never happens. Social workers in intervention
districts were more likely to report that cases are assigned to a case manager compared to social
workers in comparison districts.221
Alignment with case management SOPs: Identification and registration
56. During registration, the social worker should register the case; provide a case reference number;
open a case file and enter basic information on the child and the case and decide whether the case is
statutory, life or health threatening, and therefore requires the involvement of the police or health
services. Almost all social workers (98 per cent) reported that they inform the police or health services
when the case if deemed to be life threatening, while 62 per cent said it happens if the case is statutory.
Alignment with case management SOPs: Assessment
57. According to the case management SOPs, an initial screening should be carried out in each case
to determine the level of risk, and this should be followed by a more comprehensive or ‘in-depth’
assessment. The initial screening should be done within 24 hours or, if this is not possible, then within 48
hours. Almost half of social workers (48 per cent) said that an initial screening is always completed, 13
per cent said this is done for most cases, 28 per cent for some cases and 11 per cent said it is rarely or
never done. In the case file reviews, 36 per cent of files had evidence of an initial screening. Social
workers in intervention districts were more likely to report that an initial screening is carried out as a
matter of course and were also more likely to know that the screening should happen within 24
hours.222
58. During the initial screening, a level of risk should be assigned to determine whether the child is
‘safe’ or ‘unsafe’. The case management SOPs suggest four levels of risk, of which the fourth level is ‘not
at risk’. Half of social workers (49 per cent) said that all cases are given a formal risk classification, 10 per
cent said most and 18 per cent said some cases are classified in this way. Social workers in intervention

66
districts were more likely to say there is a formal risk classification system, while nearly half of social
workers in comparison districts (46 per cent) said this is not in place.223
59. For cases in which a child protection risk is identified, a further in-depth assessment should be
carried out. The in-depth assessment should include interviews with family members and other relevant
stakeholders and should gather information on the child’s situation, including their health and
development, their education, their integration into the family and the community, and the household’s
living conditions and socio-economic situation. The majority of in-depth assessments recorded in the
case file review involved interviews with both the child and their parents or caregivers, and several
noted that home visits were made and evidence gathered about the family environment. While two of
the cases of neglect stated that medical reports were involved in the assessment, there was little
evidence in other cases that the child’s health, education or development had been assessed,
suggesting that in-depth assessments could be made more holistic in order to better reflect the child’s
needs.
60. Respondents reported interviewing 5.2 people per case, on average. The child’s parents or
caregivers were the most common interviewees (97 per cent of social workers reported that they would
typically interview them), followed by the child themselves (interviewed by 96 per cent), other family
members (71 per cent) and neighbours or other familiar people (61 per cent).
Alignment with case management SOPs: Planning
61. During the planning stage, the social worker should develop a case plan in collaboration with the
child and the child’s family. The case plan should outline a set of actions to assist the child and/or their
family to respond to concerns raised about their well-being. As well as specific actions, the plan should
detail who will be responsible and set deadlines and goals to make sure the appropriate help and support
is provided. Around a fifth of social workers said that formal case plans are rarely or never developed, 42
per cent said a case plan is developed for some cases, 17 per cent for most cases and 23 per cent for all
cases; however of the 40 per cent of social workers who said case plans are developed in all or most
cases, actual case plans were only observed and verified for 64 per cent of these.
Content of case plans: Just over half (53 per cent) of the case files reviewed included case plans. Only 39
per cent of the case files reviewed had evidence of the child’s own wishes or perspectives on the case,
suggesting that case planning could be made more child-centred. Most of the descriptions of the case
planning include concrete actions to be taken, for example setting child maintenance payments, finding
accommodation for a child, and organising counselling, mediation and education. Many also specified
who was responsible for carrying out the actions or for monitoring the case to ensure that actions were
taken by others, though several did not include this information. Social welfare officers were most
commonly mentioned as having responsibility, though there is also evidence of other organisations being
involved, for example residential homes, the courts, the Health Insurance Office, and district or regional
level bodies. There is little evidence of deadlines or goals being set against which to measure the success
of the intervention, which may make case monitoring and closure more difficult and lead to delays in
child protection response.
Alignment with case management SOPs: Case implementation, follow up and review
62. The case manager should ensure that actions are implemented according to the case plan and
within the agreed timeframes, including referrals to relevant service providers, and follow up to provide
on-going support and document the case management process. The SOPs recommend that cases be
223 For all cases: 59% v. 32%; Pearson chi2=20.91; p<0.001.
67
reviewed at least every 3 months. In the service provider survey, 70 per cent of social workers said that
follow up is carried out in all or most cases, with intervention districts more likely to report follow up
being carried out.224 The majority of social workers reported meeting the SOP target, with 40 per cent
saying that cases are reviewed every 3 months and 50 per cent reporting monthly reviews.
Alignment with case management SOPs: Case closure
63. In order to close a case, the social worker needs to consult with and receive authorisation from
the case manager, who must be confident that the child’s safety and well-being are secure before
providing such authorisation. The majority of social workers (93 per cent) reported that cases are closed
by the case manager, 6 per cent said they are closed by whoever is available, 8 per cent by a regional
level social worker, and 13 per cent by an ‘other’ person. The Head of the Department was the main other
example given, though a few social workers said that the child or the child’s family may make the decision
to close the case.
64. The most common reason given by social workers for case closure was that the issue is resolved.
The death of the child was more likely to be mentioned by social workers in intervention districts,225
perhaps because this reason is rare but is specifically mentioned in the case management SOPs. There is
some evidence that those in comparison districts were more likely to say that cases can be closed when
the family refuses to cooperate226 or if nothing could be done to help the child.227 Neither of these
situations should result in case closure, as it is not clear that the child is safe and protected in such
circumstances.

UNICEF’s contributions to the implementation of case management
65. Whilst the findings set out above indicate that the application of case management procedures
in line with the SOPs is imperfect, a considerable proportion of service providers do report to be
following the SOPs when responding to CP cases. This is an important achievement and significant
change from past practice. As one member of UNICEF child protection team explained to researchers,
224 Follow up in all or most cases 75% v. 61%; Pearson chi2=14.19; p=0.003.
225 59% v. 32%; Pearson chi2=8.37; p=0.004.

68
“before, when discussing child protection response with social welfare, no one would talk about case
management – some were doing a bit of casework, but on a sheet of A4 paper, just writing down the issue
or problem”229. Furthermore, the results above clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of UNICEF’s
interventions: the implementation of case management procedures was found to be consistently
stronger in districts that received UNICEF support compared to those that did not.
66. Evaluation findings demonstrate that UNICEF has succeeded in building the capacity of district
level social welfare staff to deliver child protection response services in line with the Government’s
case management SOPs. The degree to which this has translated into outcomes for children exposed
to violence or other forms of child protection risk is less clear, however, particularly given that these
cases were rarely found to be reaching the child protection system.
The availability of response services
67. Evaluation findings suggest that in most districts a number of referral services are available for
children in need of protection, as is set out in the chart below. Counselling services, family reunification
and social welfare support were the most common services provided, reported by over three-quarters of
social workers surveyed. Two-thirds of social workers reported that medical services or costs are
provided, but less than half said that legal services or costs are provided. Around half of social workers
said that emergency accommodation or alternative care is provided in their district. Other services
identified by services providers include probation services, day care, NGO monitoring and child or family
tracing.

68. Findings also point to a number of critical gaps in response services. When asked to identify
services which are not available in their district but would be helpful to them, the most needed service
identified by social workers was drug and alcohol rehabilitation (identified by 63 per cent of respondents),
followed by emergency accommodation (57 per cent), job placements (43 per cent) and vocational
training (37 per cent). Legal services, alternative care and life skills support were also all mentioned by at
least a quarter of respondents. Other gaps in services identified by respondents included services for
children in conflict with the law, such as correctional centres and probation services.

230 An asterisk (*) is used to denote services where the difference between intervention and comparison districts was statistically significant
69
69. Qualitative findings indicate a lack of family-based alternative care services, a gap which is
discussed in further detail in the section on alternative care reform below. Respondents also emphasised
the need to develop specialised psychological services to help victims overcome trauma. Whilst basic
counselling services are available in Ghana, more specialised psychological services are reported to be
limited. The lack of sufficient emergency shelters was also raised in qualitative interviews, with many
respondents describing difficulties finding appropriate emergency accommodation for children:
The officials at DOVVSU send these children to us because they cannot keep them behind bars.
We also try to make enquiries about their families and get contacts to see if we can trace their
relatives. If that is not successful, we announce on the radio stations with help of the police report.
If nobody shows up, we are forced to take the children home. The major challenge here is the lack
of shelter homes…231
70. Finally, a number of respondents explained that even where services are available, a number of
persistent barriers disrupt the ability of children and families to access those services. In both the service
provider survey and qualitative interviews, respondents identified that a lack of sufficient resources,
particularly budgets to cover home visits, disrupt the provision of counselling and other services.
Others mentioned that hidden costs for service-users, which create insurmountable barriers to
accessing critical services, particularly medical and legal services. A number of social workers expressed
a specific concern about the fees associated with medical services for victims of sexual violence. These
points to the need to ensure that MMDAs allocate a sufficient budget to cover transport and other costs
associated with child protection response services.
Child protection response and child marriage
Child Marriage has been a significant focus of UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme throughout both the
2012 – 2017, and 2018 – 2022 programme cycles. In addition to including social and behaviour change
initiatives, interventions to promote girls’ empowerment and support to GoG-led regulatory efforts,
programming has focussed on strengthening the capacity of child protection service providers to respond
in cases where child marriage had occurred.
Evaluation findings suggest that child marriage is increasingly recognised as a child protection issue by
social welfare authorities. In qualitative interviews, many social workers listed child marriage as being
among the types of cases to which they respond. Yet several respondents described that they continue
to face challenges addressing the issue, particularly in cases where children choose to get married, rather
than being pressured to enter a marriage by parents or community leaders. As one child protection
authority explained: “now it is the children themselves who are going into child marriage - it is like peer
pressure is causing it” .232 This experience is consistent with the findings of a 2017 ‘Assessment of
Strategies and Approaches to Address Child Marriage in Ghana’, which suggests that the majority of child
marriages in Ghana occur when teenagers become sexually active or become pregnant.233 The
assessment identified teenage pregnancy, particularly outside of marriage, as well as community
concerns with adolescent sexual activity as among the main drivers of child marriage; when children
‘choose to get married’ this typically means they have moved in with a boyfriend or girlfriend, often
because this is the only socially acceptable context in which to have a romantic or sexual relationship.

70
The service provider described the response to such a case in her community; “The [NGO] had a case
where the teenage girl went to live with the boyfriend. The NGO even went to boy’s house to convince her
to go back to her parents’ house with a package to give her skills training (hairdressing) and she refused.
She later came back to take the package after getting pregnant. They had no option than to decline to
provide it to her.”234
This response is problematic for a number of reasons. If the NGO did in fact deny services to the girl
because she had become pregnant, this is likely to reinforce stigma around teenage pregnancy and may
actually increase her vulnerability. This is inconsistent with UNICEF’s programming approach which seeks
to promote opportunities for teen mothers to stay in education. The case study also reveals the need to
address the underlying drivers of teenage pregnancy and child marriage, by promoting young people’s
access to sexual and reproductive health services and confronting cultural norms around adolescent
sexuality, in addition to promoting girls’ access to opportunities.
Establishing effective data systems
71. As has been mentioned elsewhere, an integrated child protection database containing
standardised administrative data on child protection cases in Ghana is not yet in place. This is a
significant gap in the child protection system, which has made it difficult to monitor the child protection
system and understand how it is working in practice, or to strengthen the system by ensuring planning
is evidence based. UNICEF is working closely with government partners to fill this gap, through
establishing a digital child protection information management system (CPIMS), using the software
platform Primero.
72. The importance of strengthening data systems was recognised by respondents at district,
regional and national levels, who emphasised the importance of moving to a digital data platform that
can facilitate coordination between relevant agencies. As a representative of the Office of the Head of
the Local Government Service explained, “when we are able to get the national network connecting all
the assemblies to the head office we will be in a better position.”235 This work is of utmost importance to
child protection system strengthening and should be prioritised in the coming years. Yet as respondents
cautioned, the roll out of the CPIMS is likely to require significant capacity building support to ensure that
users have sufficient skills and technology to use it effectively.

Child protection response and the justice system
73. UNICEF’s CP Programme included a focus on strengthening the capacity of Ghana’s law
enforcement and judicial service to provide justice for children as both alleged offenders and victims and
witnesses of crime. In particular, the 2012 – 2017 programme aimed to build the capacity of justice
system actors to apply principles and laws on child justice and promote the availability of programmes in
support of young offenders, child victims and witnesses (Output 6), and to build the capacity of
community based processes to both prevent and respond to juvenile offending through informal means
(Output 7). The 2018 – 2022 programme seeks to build on this work by strengthening the capacities of
formal and informal service providers to provide equitable, quality and coordinated child-friendly justice
services to girls and boys and their families (Output 3).
74. For several years, from 2014-2016, UNICEF collaborated with the Ministry of Chieftaincy and
Traditional Affairs and the National House of Chiefs to engage with traditional leaders and strengthen
community justice mechanisms.237 Yet towards the end of the 2012-2017 programme a decision was
made to move away from this approach, and to focus instead on strengthening the capacity of the formal
justice sector.238 Whilst traditional leaders are still engaged in prevention activities related to justice
for children, it was determined that informal justice approaches were likely to perpetuate gender
inequalities, including through failing to hold male perpetrators to account. This is a positive example
of UNICEF’s ability to incorporate programmatic learning into their approach and willingness to make
adjustments in light of emerging evidence, both from Ghana and other contexts.
236 In 2019, Local Government Services reported that 78% of MMDAs implemented child protection protocols (see:
http://lgs.gov.gh/index.php/general-documents/#609ba499d1).

72
75. UNICEF’s support to the formal justice system has included significant investment in police
capacity, including through the development of two sets of Standard Operating Procedures (one on
cases involving child victims and witnesses and another on cases involving children alleged of
offending) and incorporating child-friendly policing into the police curriculum. This work was done in
close collaboration with the Ministry of Interior and other relevant government bodies, who supported
the roll out of the training throughout the country. A representative of DOVVSU at national level recalled
the successes of the programme: “looking holistically, measures were put in place to train staff members
to acquire important skills for responding in children’s cases. The Domestic Violence Unit and Anti Human
Trafficking Unit, key agencies that handle children’s issues, were given a specialised training to be able
respond to these cases… My last training was in February – at the end of the day the officers really
understood their responsibilities”239.
76. The 2018 – 2022 programme focussed in particular on reform of the formal justice system,
drawing on the findings of research undertaken in 2018 which examined the extent to which Ghana’s
justice system incorporates child-friendly policies and procedures.240 The research revealed an overall
lack of child-friendly procedures in the justice system, which UNICEF has been working to address in close
collaboration with the Ghanaian Judicial Service. Notable successes include: the decision to designate
one circuit court in each region of Ghana to focus on gender-based violence cases, including child sexual
abuse; the development of operational guidelines for the GBV courts and a GBV training manual for law
enforcement; and the Government’s overall “buy in” to the process.241
77. Evaluation findings suggest that a significant amount of work remains to be done to ensure that
children have access to child-friendly justice services, however. A number or respondents described that
problematic practices persist, such as the following example, given by a DOVVSU representative:
Here in Ghana when a child is abused and police or an officer of the domestic violence unit
prepares the case for court, the child is addressed by the lawyer as an adult. I witnessed this
a lot in the Volta Region when I served as the Regional Coordinator of DOVVSU. Once we lost
a case involving a 3-year-old child who couldn’t respond to questions in court and because of
that, the accused person was discharged. I feel it is a challenge as far as child protection is
concerned - lawyers treat children as adults during court proceedings.242
78. UNICEF has recognised the need to continue justice reform work. In addition to acknowledging
the need to make services more child friendly, UNICEF expressed concern that slow and onerous justice
procedures, which require multiple court visits by children and families, create barriers to access to
justice; “cases end up being settled out of court because families get tired”. 243 This challenge was
consistently raised by respondents. When asked to identify the main gaps and challenges in the CP
system, one Social Welfare Officer replied: “The slow motion of the justice system. I find this particularly
troubling because according to the Child Act, all child related cases must be addressed within 6 months.
However, a lot of cases sent to the courts do not see any settlement because of the consistent adjournment
of these cases.”244
79. Whilst justice reform remains a challenge, evaluation findings indicate a shift in the

several stakeholders emphasised that social welfare is increasingly engaged in addressing cases where
children exhibit offending behaviour:
The national child protection system has been able to respond to the needs of children in
Ghana to some high extent. For example, when a child is involved in a criminal act, violence,
or abuse the society will want to jail him/her but social welfare does not look at that aspect
but rather the reformation of the person. 245
80. Indeed, administrative data from district level social welfare authorities indicates that social
welfare officers are engaged in responding to juvenile offending, even if in relatively low numbers: 1.1
per cent of the overall caseload of social workers involved cases of theft and another 1.1. per cent
involved other forms of juvenile offending.
81. Stakeholders pointed to a lack of sufficient services for children with offending behaviour.
Several mentioned that diversion services remain limited: “diversion is being rolled out gradually.
Sometimes follow up is difficult and the case load is huge – the government needs to build this service”246.
Meanwhile others referred to a lack of appropriate juvenile correction facilities and, concerningly,
persistent instances where children are treated as adults within the justice system:
A juvenile offender is put on remand in this region, they have to be sent to a JCC in another
region because the only facility in the region has been abandoned. We have heard that, the
police, due to a lack of resources for handling these juveniles across the region, sometimes
compel minors to inflate their ages in order for the police to be saved the stress. Sometimes
too, these minors are kept at adult facilities in the region. exposing them to all kinds of
criminal elements.247
--
We all know that children are not supposed to be put in adult cells, but when we go to the
prisons to do inspections we come across children there. The police try to swell up somebody’s
age to enable them hold on to that person. This year a boy of seventeen years was arrested,
but had been schooled to admit to the crime. He should have been handled at juvenile justice
court but was not.248

Children’s access to birth registration
82. Since 2012, UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has dedicated significant resources to
promoting access to and uptake of birth registration in Ghana. Output 4, under Outcome 1 of the 2012 –
2017 programme aims for: ‘more children under the age of 5 [to] have their births registered’. UNICEF’s
birth registration work continued into the 2018 – 2022 programme under Output 4: ‘Birth Registration
services are more efficient for the registration of girls and boys under 5 years of age’.
83. UNICEF recognises birth registration as an important part of an overall child protection system.
Whilst the link between a birth certificate and protection outcomes is complex and requires the fulfilment
of numerous other conditions,249 a birth certificate can play a role in ensuring recognition of a child’s age,
nationality and entitlements to access basic services and protections under law. It is also a legal
requirement in Ghana, and a basic right under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Finally, birth
registration is critical from a policy and planning perspective; birth registration can enable governments
to plan service delivery more effectively in order to meet children’s needs, as part of a broader system of
civil registration and vital statistics.
84. When UNICEF’s 2012 – 2017 programme cycle began, data from the Births and Deaths Registry
(BDR) suggested that national birth registration coverage was around 60 per cent. Whilst significant gains
had been made in the previous decade (birth registration coverage increased dramatically from only 30
per cent in 2003 to 70 per cent in 2009), progress stalled in 2009 and even began to decline slightly.
Furthermore, considerable disparities existed between different regions in Ghana as well as between
urban and rural areas: in 2012 81 per cent of children born in the Northern Region of Ghana were
registered, compared to 51 per cent of children born in Vola region.
85. In order to understand the nature of the problem, UNICEF funded research on the barriers and
bottlenecks affecting birth registration in Ghana in 2012.250 The findings identified a number of supply
side barriers and concluded that insufficient resourcing is a key driver of limited coverage. In its
recommendations, the study called on the GoG to establish a sustainable funding model for birth
registration and promote equitable access to meet growing demand.
86. In an effort to address these barriers, UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme made significant
investments in strengthening the birth registration process in Ghana. This has included supporting a
comprehensive assessment of the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) system in Ghana by the
249 See for example, Coram Children’s Legal Centre and the International Observatory on Statelessness, ‘Birth registration and children’s rights: A
complex story’, Plan International, 2014.

75
Ghana Statistical Service251, which informed the development of a Strategic Plan for the Improvement of
the CRVS system in Ghana from 2018 – 2022. A key component of the strategy has been to develop a
digital systems for the registration of births and deaths. Whilst evaluation findings suggest that progress
towards implementation has been slower than envisaged in the plan, the process has galvanised
support amongst key government stakeholders, who were found to recognise the value of investments
in CRVS.252
87. UNICEF’s technical support has focussed on the establishment of digital approaches, which would
increase efficiency and reliability across all stages, from the initial registration of a birth, to the
consolidation of data, to storage and record keeping. A major component of this work was the delivery
of mobile birth registration service (m-birth) in partnership with the telecom operator Tigo.253 M-birth
was initially piloted in ten districts with low registration rates in Brong Ahafo, Ashanti, Eastern and
Western regions. The pilot was gradually expanded and rolled out in 8 regions254 from May 2016.
88. By May 2018, 673,051 children’s births had been registered through m-Birth, comprising a
significant majority of births registered in some regions.255 Infant birth registration rates increased from
63 per cent in 2016 to 80 per cent in 2019.256 Following the success of the m-birth initiative, a technology-
enabled system has been scaled-up across the country with investment from the Government of Ghana,
reducing reliance on paper forms and increasing the quality and efficiency of the birth registration
process.
89. A rapid assessment of the initiative concluded that m-birth had increased the efficiency and
accessibility of the birth registration process and contributed to an increase in overall birth registration
rates. Furthermore, m-birth programme allowed for real-time monitoring of birth registration, enabling
targeted support to be given to districts with low registration rates. The rapid assessment found a
number of areas for improvement, however. 257 In addition to recommending supply of a greater number
of higher quality tablets, it identified a need for strengthening work based registration services for low
uptake groups, such as market dwellers, farmers and others working in the informal sector. It also
recommended integrating delivery of birth registration services with other services targeting children,
particularly child immunisation services, which have achieved higher coverage.258
90. Evidence suggests that health services are indeed an effective way to promote the joint delivery
of birth registration services. For instance, UNICEF worked in partnership with the Ghana Health Service
during Child Health Welfare Promotion week to organise a drive for birth registration in 2017. Monitoring
data from m-birth has revealed a significant increase in registrations during this period.259 Qualitative
respondents also recognised the effectiveness of collaboration with health care providers: as one births
and deaths officer told researchers; “we were able to liaise with nurses in the municipality and we have
registered almost all children before they turn 1 year!”260 UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has
recognised the potential for collaboration with health authorities and is advocating for information

sharing and coordination between Ghana Health Service and the Births and Deaths Registry, to take
advantage of high vaccine uptake rates and facilitate birth registration.261
91. Whilst it is clear that UNICEF has made significant contributions to strengthening birth
registration in Ghana, available data suggests that registration rates are still below the targets set in
UNICEF’s 2012 – 2017 programme (set out below). Concerningly, substantial differences in registration
rates across demographic groups persist, with just 55 per cent of children in the poorest households
registered compared to 86 per cent of those in the richest, and 64 per cent of rural children registered
compared to 80 per cent of urban children.262 This suggests persistent barriers in supply and demand
need to be addressed.
92. A further challenge is that birth registration is now being delivered through two parallel systems:
UNICEF’s m-birth system, used to register infant births, and the Government’s own online system, used
to register late birth registrations (though the system has functionality to register infant births).263 In
addition to promoting birth registration uptake in future programmes, including through collaborating
with health services, it will be critical that UNICEF works with government to support the integration of
these two systems, especially in light of the new Births and Death Registration Act 2020.

Effectiveness of alternative care reform
To what degree has the child protection programme contributed to an alternative care system based on family-
based care options as well as to the implementation of the Care Reform Initiative?
93. UNICEF has worked closely with the GoG to promote the reform of alternative care throughout
both the 2012-2017 and 2018-2022 programme cycles, with the aim of moving from a system that is
primarily reliant on residential institutions to one centred around family based care. The Government’s
concern about the issue emerged after a survey conducted in 2006 revealed a sharp rise in the number
of residential care homes in Ghana, from only 10 in 1995 to 148 in 2006264. This was viewed as a highly
problematic development in the Ghanaian context, which has a longstanding tradition of family and
community-based solutions for children lacking parental care. As one DSW representative recollected:
A rise in children’s homes is usually the result of a war or epidemic or other reason – but there
was really no need for children to enter institutional care at that time. Our first line of protection
is our communal way of living. So if someone doesn’t have parents there will be an uncle
somewhere who is more than willing to take care of the children…So social welfare had to find
out why this was happening.265
94. In order to tackle the problem, the GoG launched the Care Reform Initiative, an effort aimed at
reducing the number of residential care institutions in the country, establishing government oversight of
residential care homes and ensuring that basic standards of care are in place, as well as promoting the
development of family-based alternatives to residential care. UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has
provided extensive support to the GoG in all three of these endeavours. Much of this work falls within a
5-year programme, the Accelerating Child Care Reform Programme, funded by USAID’s Displaced
Children and Orphans Fund.
Reducing and reforming residential care
95. UNICEF’s contributions have enabled the GoG to establish a strong regulatory framework for
residential care homes, comprised of the ‘National Standards for Residential Homes for Children in
Ghana’,266 approved in 2018, ‘Standard Operating Procedures for Inspection, Licensing, and Monitoring
Residential Homes for Children in Ghana’,267 and a ‘Manual for the Routine Monitoring of the Alternative
Care System in Ghana’268. This framework has provided the Government with the tools necessary to
reduce the number of residential care homes for children in Ghana and ensure that existing institutions
meet a certain standard of care.
96. Existing evidence suggests that whilst the National Standards and Standard Operating
Procedures are increasingly being applied, they are far from being fully implemented. A geographical
mapping and analysis of Residential Homes for Children undertaken by UNICEF in collaboration with the
MoGCSP and DSW revealed that in the first quarter of 2017, 25 per cent of known RHCs had been
licensed269. A more recent survey of residential care in Ghana showed modest improvements; it found
that at the end of 2019 30.9 per cent of RHCs had a valid license (an additional 25.9 per cent had a license

that was deemed to be invalid).270 Qualitative evidence from the evaluation suggests that the government
is committed to implementing the National Standards, with several respondents describing that the
inspection process is being rigorously applied. As one NGO representative recalled: “our shelter manager
came and shared standards and they have closed some shelters. Even ours – we are one of the leading
organisations but they assess us… From the body language I can see it is a serious thing. They have closed
some shelters and they said that we should implement some standards or they would take away our
license – so I would say yes, they are taking it seriously”271.
97. In addition to supporting national initiatives, the Child Protection Programme has provided
considerable support to Regional Departments of Social Welfare (DSW) to implement care reform,
through establishing OVC Coordination Committees in each region, supporting the development of
regional deinstitutionalisation plans, promoting monitoring and the closure of non-compliant
institutions, and developing strategies for reducing the number of children in residential care, including
through family tracing and reunification. These efforts have achieved significant support from regional
and even district level governments. A number of social welfare authorities interviewed for the evaluation
identified deinstitutionalisation as a priority of their work:
4-5 years ago DSW came up with support from UNICEF and other partners, to find ways of closing
most of such orphanages and where children can be relocated or unified with their parents…we
have been working in these child protection issues since 2016 to date.272
98. The Care Reform Initiative appears to have contributed to a change in practices. A 2018 analysis
noted a decline in newly established private residential care homes for children in ‘hot-spot’ districts and
a voluntary reduction in the number of children admitted to existing facilities. Importantly, findings
indicate that these trends were due, primarily, to the Care Reform Initiative; “most residential care homes
indicate they had either stopped admitting new children or were focusing on reintegrating children in
response to directives from DSW”273. According to more recent figures, at the end of 2019 were 139
residential care homes in Ghana, and around 3,500 children living in residential care.274 These figures
suggest that UNICEF is likely to have achieved the expected result of reducing the number of children in
care by 20% over the course of the 2012 – 2017 programme.275
99. Whilst there does not appear to have been a dramatic reduction in the total number of residential
care homes in Ghana as a result of the Care Reform Initiative, it is important to acknowledge that care
reform is an uphill battle. UNICEF has supported the government to close numerous residential care
homes since 2012, yet new homes are constantly being established. As a member of the UNICEF CP team
explained, “it is difficult to know exactly how much progress has been made. In November 2019 there
were 139 residential homes, so it looks like we have only closed a few homes, but more have popped up
in the meantime.”276 Furthermore, even while UNICEF has contributed to a significant shift in attitudes
and approaches to alternative care amongst Government authorities and communities alike, several
stakeholders noted a number of persistent barriers to deinstitutionalisation:

276 Personal communication during interview with the UNICEF Ghana Child Protection team, 25 March 2020.
79
Another challenge is working with the homes to get their buy in because this is their livelihood…
there was backlash at the beginning because they get funding to do this work from churches and
foundations. There is huge support in this country for orphanages in general. If a high profile
politician wants to do something, the best thing they can do is be seen to support an orphanage.
There is a feeling that orphanages are good things.277
100. Whilst UNICEF and government partners have had some success in overcoming these challenges,
by providing homes with alternative models for delivering care and support, it is clear that
deinstitutionalisation should be viewed as a long term initiative. Further discussion on the achievement
of sustainable alternative care reform in Ghana is contained in the sustainability section of this report.
101. Finally, UNICEF has directly supported the reintegration of children in residential care into family
based settings through DSW and NGO partners, with around 1750 children moved from residential homes
and reintegrated into family-based care over the course of the 2017 to 2019 programme.278 The
effectiveness of reintegration work was found to have varied significantly across institutions and
service providers. A number of stakeholders raised concerns that reintegration was not adequately
supported, resulting in some children being placed in homes where they were at-risk of harm, or even
returned to a residential care home: “When children are reintegrated or reunified social workers don’t
have the resources to do the level of follow up that needs to happen. Often times children are going back
to original homes – the economic reasons that they left still remain. You will find that children say things
are better in the orphanage, where they get three square meals a day.”279
102. In addition to lacking sufficient follow up, a number of respondents explained that reintegration
support was overly standardised, failing to address the unique circumstances of each child’s case. As
one government stakeholder explained:
A lot of the packages weren’t well thought of – you can’t have a one-size-fits-all package. Most
of the time the reintegration is done in a hurry. The social workers that do the reintegration need
more information, more training about how to reintegrate the child - have you assessed the home
properly? Have you assessed the child in the institution, linked the family with social protection,
ensured all the original driving issues were addressed? Do we have SOPs on how to reintegrate
from when the child first enters the home? Back then they would do reunification and think it was
reintegration”.280
Preventing unnecessary family separation
103. The difficulties discussed above are to be expected; reintegration of children from residential
homes into a family environment is a challenging undertaking, particularly where children have been
living in residential care for many years.281 Where social welfare services are underdeveloped, this is even
more likely to be the case. As is discussed further in section 5.4 on the sustainability of UNICEF’s
programme, in order to reduce the number of children in residential care it is essential to strengthen the
social welfare workforce, to ensure that children are only placed in residential care as a last resort and

address problems in the family before they reach crisis point, preventing children from entering RCIs in
the first place.282
104. Given this, UNICEF’s work to strengthen the capacity of social workers to respond when children
are at-risk of harm (discussed in detail in the above section on the effectiveness of the child protection
response), is a step in the right direction. As a UNICEF staff member explained, “There is a strong
gatekeeping mechanism in the case management SOPs - when social welfare takes decision to place a
child they have to go through list of 9 options - first 8 are family-based care, community-based care. The
last resort is residential care.”283 UNICEF’s awareness campaigns also included an emphasis on the
importance of family-based care. This programming, which targeted religious and community leaders,
managers of residential care homes and local government, sought to reduce the overall demand for
residential care services in Ghana, and encourage authorities to pursue other options.
The beginnings of family-based alternative care
105. As part of the Accelerating Child Care Reform Programme, UNICEF has supported the
establishment of family-based solutions for children without parental care, drawing on the longstanding
traditions of kinship care and informal fostering which exist in Ghana. This involved advocacy efforts to
support reform of the legal framework around alternative care (achievements are detailed in section
5.1.1 above). Notably, Foster Care Regulations were passed in 2018 which stipulate the guiding principles
for foster care in Ghana, including: the responsibilities of the Department of Social Welfare; the processes
and procedures for the application and accreditation of Foster Care Agencies, the consideration of
eligibility, suitability, training and licensing of foster parents, and the identification and placement of a
child in foster care; the rights and responsibilities of children in foster care, foster parents and biological
parents; and the responsibilities of the Department with regards to foster care arrangements.284
106. Building on this achievement, UNICEF developed a Foster Care Operational Manual to provide
guidance to the Department of Social Welfare officers and Foster Care Agencies on the delivery of
foster care services.285 Finally, UNICEF has supported the roll out of capacity building to regional
authorities to identify, orientate, train and license foster parents. To date DSW has trained over 500
foster parents and over 120 children have been placed in foster care, a significant increase from previous
years when fostering was essentially non-existent in Ghana.286 Several foster carers were interviewed as
part of the evaluation, while the majority of these placements appeared to have been successful, follow
up support was found to be insufficient. As one foster parent explained: “The government should be very
concerned about such kids who go through such situations. It will be nice to receive some financial support
from them. Though sometimes social welfare calls to check up, it would also be better if they come to
check how I am taking care of the child.”287
107. A number of stakeholders noted that a lack of necessary resourcing has undermined the foster
care service. When asked about the challenges facing the child protection system, one respondent
explained; “Let me first emphasize on the foster care service delivery. The Regional Foster Care Placement
Committee is mandated to meet on timely basis to place abandoned children. The work is supposed to be
voluntary. People join this committee and agree in principle to work voluntarily, but the problem is when

the work begins you can’t find them to sit. If these committees are unable to meet, children that need to
be placed cannot be placed. Prospective foster parents need to be trained, but there is no resource
available for this exercise.”288
108. Evaluation findings reveal that the alternative care system in Ghana is still heavily reliant on
residential care; qualitative data on the nature of child protection response suggests that children are
still sent to residential institutions where it is not possible for them to return to their families, and foster
care options remain limited. UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has laid the groundwork for the
development of a system centred on family-based care options. As one stakeholder aptly summarised,
“[foster care] is burgeoning in Ghana. The bones are in place and there is potential.”289
Effectiveness of behavioural change campaigns and community mobilisation
To what extent have behavioural change campaigns and community mobilisation efforts contributed to the
intended transformation of gender norms in communities? How has this led to improved prevention and response
to violence, reduction in child marriages and prevention of unnecessary family separation?
What has the level of satisfaction been among women, girls, boys and men, and communities been with the quality
of behavioural change campaigns and community mobilisation efforts that they have received through the
programme?
109. Under Output 2 of the 2012-17 programme, UNICEF worked with the government to create the
Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) Strategy for the Protection of Children in Ghana.290
This expansive document set out the framework for nationwide behaviour change campaigns and
community mobilisation efforts concerning child protection, designed to transform attitudes and
practices at the community level, in order to strengthen VAC prevention and response mechanisms.
These campaigns covered topics such as gender equality, female empowerment, child marriage, harmful
traditional practices, sexual abuse, physical abuse, child labour, child trafficking, child rearing and positive
discipline (Corporal Punishment), Child Online Safety, and the prevention of family separation and
promotion of family based care.
110. Initiatives at the national level (under the SBCC) included the use of mass and social media to
raise public awareness concerning child protection issues, and create platforms for engagement,
discussion and debate. For example, in 2017 UNICEF worked with the Government to launch the
‘Ghanaians Against Child Abuse’ (GACA) campaign291 which used various channels including digital social
media, public billboards, and community mobile theatre performances to create awareness about child
abuse, and reduce the acceptance of social practices (such as corporal punishment) that have negative
impacts on children. The GACA initiative included the ‘Safe Schools Programme’ which sought to reduce
the prevalence of violence at school, including in the context of violent discipline, sexual harassment and
bullying. Meanwhile, between 2018-19 UNICEF ran ‘Girlz Girlz Power’: a TV talk show with 16 episodes
covering issues such as child marriage, gender roles and stereotypes, and girls’ education.
111. At a local level, UNICEF worked with Departments of Social Welfare and Community Development
(DSWCD) and NGOs to run social and behavioural change initiatives in 56 districts. UNICEF funded and
oversaw the development of the Child Protection Community Facilitation Manual and Tool-Kits, which

were further updated in 2018 and 2019 to add more modules.292 The tool-kits included training manuals
and resources such as flash cards, interactive games, activities and information packs for stimulating
conversation on a range of child protection themes. Community ‘facilitators’, including local traditional
and religious leaders, were trained on the use of this tool-kit to raise awareness and discussion about
relevant child protection topics (e.g. child marriage) within communities, through games, activities, the
use of local ‘durbars’ (meetings) and community theatre performances. Initiatives at the local level also
involved the creation of safe spaces and clubs in communities to engage adolescent girls and boys in
awareness-raising activities, and train them in being ambassadors for change. The tool kits have a
dedicated monitoring and reporting system.293
Awareness, participation and satisfaction with change campaigns
112. The findings from the KAP survey indicate that the national GACA campaign has had widespread
reach in communities across Ghana, potentially reaching as much as a fifth of the entire population.
Almost 1 in 5, 19.8 per cent, of respondents in the KAP surveys said that they were aware of the campaign:
adults (22.2 per cent) were more likely than children (17.4 per cent) to say that they had heard of the
campaign. There were no significant differences observed between UNICEF intervention sites, compared
to comparison communities, indicating that the campaign is indeed achieving national level reach.
113. By far the most common means through which respondents had heard of the campaign was via
TV, radio, jingles or programmes (69.8 per cent), suggesting that more traditional forms of media remain
the primary means through which child protection messages are reaching communities. By contrast, only
8.4 per cent of respondents had become aware of GACA through digital platforms.

114. Significant differences were observed between intervention and control sites concerning the
mediums through which respondents had heard of GACA. Respondents in intervention sites (29 per cent)
were more likely to have heard of GACA through a community event or discussion than in control
communities (11 per cent). This reflects the more intensive community-based activities supported by
UNICEF at a local level in intervention communities.
115. Over two thirds, 68.3 per cent, of respondents who had heard of GACA, reported engaging or
participating in the programme in some manner. Participation usually entailed more passive activities
such as watching a tv programme or listening to the radio. Only a minority of participants had engaged

in the campaigns in more ‘active’ ways, including through sharing or liking a social media post, becoming
a GACA champion, or discussing issues raised in the campaign with friends and family. Participants in
intervention sites (24.2 per cent) were significantly more likely to have actively engaged in GACA than
those in comparator communities (9.7 per cent).
116. Survey results indicate that for those respondents who chose to engage, reactions to the GACA
campaign were largely positive. Almost ninety per cent of respondents who said that they had engaged
in the campaign felt that they “learned something new” as a result of the activity. Eighty four per cent
said that they felt that it was “likely” that the campaign would change people’s attitudes towards child
protection and ninety-three per cent said that they would recommend the campaign to a friend or family
member. Interestingly, children were significantly less likely than adults to say that they had “learned
something new” as a result of the campaign, perhaps indicating a need for more “child friendly” or child-
tailored messaging.
117. In addition to their knowledge of the GACA campaign, respondents in the KAP surveys were asked
whether there were any “events or activities” in their community to discuss or raise awareness of child
protection issues (e.g. child marriage, child labour, child trafficking or child abuse). Just over 1 in 3
respondents (34.4 per cent) in intervention sites, and 1 in 4 respondents (24.2 per cent) in comparator
communities answered “yes” to this question.

118. Over two thirds (70 per cent) of all respondents in intervention communities said that they had
participated in awareness raising activities: mainly through attending meetings, highlighting the
impressive reach and scale of community mobilisation efforts. One in ten children and young people in
intervention communities said that they had participated in children’s clubs.
119. Beneficiary satisfaction with locally based child protection activities in UNICEF intervention
communities was also found to be very high. As many as 97.5 per cent of respondents said that they had
learned something new as a result of child protection clubs and activities; 99.2 per cent said that they
would recommend these activities to a friend, and 88.2 per cent said that they thought the activities were
likely to change people’s attitudes towards child abuse and protection.
120. These highly positive results were also reflected in qualitative interviews and focus group
discussions with beneficiaries. Participants were happy to share their experiences of community
sensitisation programmes; they were able to articulate what they had learned about child protection
during various events and activities, and express the ways they felt they had benefited, as well as their
perceptions of the benefits to the broader community:
84
The campaign has been very helpful. They encourage the girls and promote their
interest in education. They educate [the community] on girls’ education and its
implications [benefits] for the family.294
…
We have discussed topics including various forms of child abuse, sexual and
reproductive health, drug abuse, the rights and responsibilities of children including
right to lead, right to education, right shelter, right to play, right express your
feelings. We trust [the facilitators] and they have given us good advice, because it
gives us information about how we are supposed to be treated as children - in our
home, school and any part of our community. It also teaches us how we are
supposed to behave as children in order not to get into any trouble.295
121. The interactive and participatory methodological approach to the campaign, through the use
of the SBCC toolkit was seen as particularly effective in promoting community engagement. As one key
informant explained:
You know, before the toolkit, you [would] only go to communities and give ‘long
speeches’ but now we have tug of war, and flash cards and so now the audience do
the talking, discussion, and come out with their own solutions.
122. Despite these positive indications, there were, nonetheless, a sizeable minority of participants
who declined to engage in the campaign and mobilisation efforts (around a third of all respondents
who had heard of the campaigns, as reported above). When asked their reasons for not engaging, most
participants explained that they were otherwise occupied by other commitments and priorities: “I’m
always busy with work”; “I was taking care of my sick mother”. On the other hand, others expressed
negative ideas or indifference towards campaign messaging, including stating that the campaign was “not
interesting”, “not relevant”, and unlikely to change people’s behaviour in practice. In qualitative
interviews participants suggested that engagement in mobilisation efforts could be improved if
participants were to receive some compensation or financial support to enable them to take time off
from other essential activities; for example, one participant explained:
The only gap I have noticed has to do with mobilization. Mobilizing the community is
very difficult. When they sit in the gathering for about 30 minutes to 1 hour, they expect
that we give them something for their time spent. They don’t see it as they're being
educated, they rather see it as a waste of their time.
Impact of community change campaigns
123. As well as achieving widespread reach and endorsement in communities, analysis of the data
from the KAP surveys provides some evidence that UNICEF’s campaign and mobilisation efforts may be
having a significant impact in contributing to transforming community norms and behaviours related
to child protection. Respondents in the KAP surveys were asked a range of questions about their
attitudes and practices in relation to a variety of relevant topics including: family separation, violence
against children, child marriage, child justice and help seeking behaviour. Changes in results from baseline
(2013) to endline (2020) were compared in both UNICEF intervention296 and non-intervention

communities. Overall the findings indicate a significant improvement over time in attitudes and
practices across a range of issues.
Family separation
124. To measure attitudes towards family separation, respondents were asked a series of questions
about whether it was safe for parents to send children away from home for a variety to reasons, including
for the purposes of education, care or work. Analysis of the data revealed a strong and consistent
change from baseline (2013) to endline (2020) in community attitudes towards the safety of sending
children away from their families, and a shift towards recognising the child protection risks associated
with these practices. For example, almost a third of respondents (30.2 per cent) at baseline said that it
was “safe” to send a 7 year old child to an orphanage, believing that the child would have better
opportunities than at home; this percentage dropped to just 13.9 per cent who thought this was safe in
2020 (chi-square, p<.01). Furthermore, almost 1 in 4 (23.1 per cent) of respondents at baseline agreed
that it was “safe” for parents to send their 13 year old daughter outside the community to do housework,
compared to just 1 in 20 (5.7 per cent) of respondents at endline (chi-square, p<.01).

125. Triangulating these results with qualitative interactions reveals a widespread recognition of the
risks of separating children from their biological parents at endline: “[those children] would have no
food to eat. Some bad man may defile the girls and they may turn into street children.”297 In cases where
children are left orphaned or abandoned, there appears to be a strong culture of endorsing informal
fostering and adoption of orphaned and separated children within families and communities, which has
been supported by UNICEF’s work on promoting family based care:
In our villages, it is not possible for [children] to not have a relation with any family.
So the family they are close to, automatically becomes the next of kin, and [that
family] will be responsible for their welfare, irrespective of their background, until they
are able to locate their family relations.
126. Despite the significant change in attitudes from baseline to endline, the extent to which
improvements can be directly attributed to UNICEF’s programme remains unclear. Difference in

86
difference analysis298 revealed no significant differences in changes in attitudes over time in UNICEF
intervention communities compared to comparison communities (even when controlling for a range of
other factors such as age of respondent, their gender, rurality, wealth and education).
127. There could be several reasons for this. On the one hand much of UNICEF work has been through
national level campaigns, which have reached both intervention and control groups equally. On the other
hand, there appear to be other groups and organisation intervening in comparator communities to
deliver child protection activities at a local level: indeed around 24.9 per cent of respondents in
comparator communities said that they were aware of local activities to raise awareness about child
protection (compared to an only slightly higher 30.2 per cent in intervention communities). Finally there
may be other countervailing forces and differences between intervention and control communities, not
measured in the KAP surveys, impacting on these results.
128. In addition to comparing results from baseline to endline, evaluators also analysed the difference
in results at endline between respondents who said that they had engaged in local child protection
interventions, compared to those who did not engage, using propensity score matching.299 Significant
results were observed for two of the questions about family separation, concerning the safety of sending
a child to an orphanage to access opportunities300, and the safety of sending children into residential
boarding schools outside the community.301 These findings indicate that attending a local child
protection awareness raising activity was associated with a change in attitudes towards the safety of
institutionalised forms of care: providing direct evidence of the impact of UNICEF’s
deinstitutionalisation messaging. (No similar effects were observed for the other questions concerning
family separation).
Violence against children
Physical abuse such as corporal punishment is very common here in the community. That is the most
common way, we use to control our children’s behaviour. It’s not bad to punish your children when they
go wrong.302
129. The KAP survey asked children about their experiences of violence; findings indicate that rates
of violence against children remain high in communities across Ghana, particularly amongst girls.
Almost 1 in 3 (29.5 per cent) of children and young people reported being subject to any type of violence
in the last month. Emotional violence was most prevalent with over 1 in 5 (21. 9 per cent) of respondents
experiencing this in the last month. 11.7 per cent of children and young people said they had been subject
to physical violence in the last month, and almost 1 in 10 (9.3 per cent) of children and young people (the
majority of whom were girls) said that in the last month they had been “touched in a way that made them
uncomfortable”. Over 1 in 5 (25.8 per cent) of children and young people said that they had experienced
violence at home in the last month, and 1 in 7 (14.3 per cent) said that they had experienced violence at
school.303

130. As with the results concerning family separation, analysis of the data demonstrates a small but
significant reduction in rates of violence against children from baseline to endline.304 However, there
were no significant improvements in rates of violence in UNICEF intervention compared to control sites.
In fact, the data reveals some small indications of potentially negative effects, with evidence of increased
levels of emotional violence and domestic violence perpetrated against children in intervention sites at
endline; (increases which were not observed in comparison communities).
131. Evidence from qualitative interviews and focus groups may help partially explain these negative
results. Whilst social norms endorsing violence against children are widespread and entrenched, drivers
of violence against children include structural factors such as poverty, low levels of education, lack of
opportunity, gender inequalities and children’s position of dependency in families and communities.
These are complex factors that may not be effectively addressed by sensitisation messaging alone. As
one key informant explained:
We are operating in an environment of severely negative social norms. You have 94 per cent of
children experiencing violent discipline; 1 in 3 girls’ first sexual encounter was forced. [It’s] really
basic starting point trying to convince society at large about good practices.
132. One of the things we have done a lot is community mobilisation with child protection toolkits.
And for violence issues, it is a hard sell. What I have seen is that during those events there seems to be
good interaction with child protection officials – they understand the roles. What is harder to get at is
whether at the end of the days they are making a difference. You have a lot of training events which go
on, excellent policies, you have the framework for service delivery, but [violence] is strongly influenced
by social norms.” [Emphasis added]
133. Beneficiaries in focus group discussions discussed some of the core issues underlying cases of
child abuse in their communities: issues such as poverty, alcoholism, family breakdown, and a lack of
access to social welfare and other support services were consistent themes:
[In cases where] parents have divorced, when the father doesn’t take care of the child - for
example paying school fees - the mother directs that anger to the child and that leads to violence
against the child.305
…
A [case] happened in this community - a man slept with his daughter. They were both drunkards.
The community could not do anything about the matter, and as we speak the man and the girl
are dead. There is no organisation in this community that gives support to cases like this.

134. In addition to asking children about their experiences of violence, respondents in the KAP survey
were asked about their perceptions and attitudes towards violence against children perpetrated in the
context of violent discipline, as well as their ideas about the roles of caregivers in protecting the rights
and wellbeing of children more broadly. Once again, the data indicates a strong and positive
improvement in attitudes over time.306 Respondents in interviews often attributed this directly to
UNICEF’s programme:
Previously, it was common for a mother to beat the child mercilessly, but due to the education
provided by the UNICEF, the parents are getting to understand that they don’t have the power to
abuse their kids. The programme has provided very important advice for parents on the right ways
to train their children, which represents significant improvement as compared to the previous
situation.
135. Nevertheless, analysis of the KAP survey data indicates that the rate of change in attitudes has,
in fact, been significantly slower in intervention compared to control sites (even when controlling for
demographic factors, such as age, gender, wealth, education and location) possibly indicating an
(unintended) negative effect of the programme.307
136. Again, there are likely to be a number of possible reasons for this. First, as discussed in relation
to attitudes concerning family separation, there may be other countervailing forces (not measured in the
survey) which are impeding attitudinal shifts towards VAC in intervention sites. More rapid
improvements in attitudes in comparator sites may have been influenced by UNICEF’s national level
campaigning work, such as the GACA campaign. In addition, it is conceivable that control communities
have benefited from public awareness campaigns delivered by other organisations and partners.
137. Finally, it is possible that there has been some resistance or backlash to anti- VAC messaging in
communities that have received more intensive, local level interventions. Given that these programmes
and activities are challenging deeply entrenched social and cultural norms, some amount of community
resistance would be unsurprising, especially in the short term; as one key informant put it: “it is very
difficult to change [people’s] minds because of deep rooted cultural practices.”308 Evidence of participants’
scepticism concerning key messaging around the eradication of VAC was sometimes apparent in focus
group discussions. A group of adolescent girls surmised:
These days a parent cannot discipline or correct a child when the child is going wayward. [Our]
community norms and taboos are not being regarded anymore. For instance - look at the way the
girls are dressed and the way they live now. No one corrects them, [everyone is] quiet. There is
need to reintroduce some of these old activities and the norms that used to prevent children from
these unwanted activities they get themselves into.309
138. Finally, some key informants suggested that there is a lack of corresponding action reinforcing
key child rights messaging, leading to cynicism and resentment about the purpose of child protection
campaigns and their ability to affect change: “those things will just cause people to abuse children
more!”310 A key informant recommended:
Though the education and sensitization is being done, sometimes, further assistance is required
in terms of financial support, which the system is not able to provide. So, there are financial

limitations which sometimes prevent the system from being able to address child protection needs
sufficiently.
Child marriage
139. Ending child marriage (acceptability) in communities has been a key focus on UNICEF community
mobilisation campaigns, with considerable resources directed towards this goal. Once again evidence
from the KAP survey indicates that these efforts may be working: attitudes towards child marriage
appear to have improved over time, with significantly lower levels of acceptance of child marriage in
2020 compared to 2013.311 Whilst 1 in 4 respondents found child marriage acceptable in 2013, this was
found to have reduced to 1 in 7 by 2020. As with attitudes towards family separation, rates of change in
attitudes concerning child marriage were found to be broadly similar across intervention and control
sites, making it difficult to determine the extent to which these changes can be directly attributed to
UNICEF’s programme.

140. Importantly child marriage of girls was found to be significantly more acceptable than child
marriage of boys, both at baseline and at endline.312 This suggests that whilst communities may be
absorbing messaging about the risks and harms of marrying children early, gendered inequalities in
attitudes towards age and marriage remain widespread. These findings, together with evidence of the
continued higher rates of violence directed against girls compared to boys (set out in the section above)
indicates that mobilisation efforts have not yet been successful in transforming structural gender norms
and inequalities.
141. In addition to being asked about their personal attitudes towards child marriage, respondents in
the KAP survey were asked to speculate on the prevalence of child marriage in their communities in
practice. Respondents were asked two questions: “how many people in this community do you think get
married under the age of 18?” and “how many people in this community do you think get married under
the age of 15?” Interestingly, respondents at baseline were significantly more likely than at endline to say
that these marriage “never” or “only rarely” happen in their communities.313 These results cannot provide
reliable evidence on actual rates of child marriage (as they are based on community perceptions), rather
they may indicate a growing awareness by endline of the prevalence of child marriage in communities:
perhaps reflecting respondents’ increasing willingness to acknowledge and accept child marriage as a

prevalent and significant child protection concern. A group of adolescent boys discussed the situation in
their community:
Some children are given in marriage at age 15 to men old enough to be their fathers. They are
given in marriages in exchange for cows, sheep and other domestic animals. A lot of them are not
able to write their BECE and some also are pregnant because of that.314
142. Despite an improvement in attitudes over time, it appears that child marriage remains a
significant child protection concern in communities across Ghana, despite legal prohibition, with a third
of respondents at endline agreeing that child marriage happens “a lot”. A group of community members
described some of the challenges that parents face that may drive them to force their children into early
marriage, despite their knowledge that it is wrong: “some parents owe [money] to some men, and when
they are not able to pay the debt, they decide to cancel it off by giving their daughter’s hand in marriage.”
One mother described how she had exposed herself to two days of beating from her husband after
helping her daughter to escape from an arranged child marriage:
My own daughter was given out for marriage without my consent. I refused [the marriage] and
quickly sent my girl away to Kumasi. I was beaten by my husband for two days but I endured it.
After two days he stopped and I am free. So we the women in this community do not agree to our
children marrying at tender ages. The problem is, we do not know where to run to for help.315
143. In the KAP surveys, respondents’ level of education, and the ‘rurality’ of their location were found
to be the strongest predictors of child marriage acceptability: with respondents with higher levels of
education and those from more urban areas significantly less likely to find child marriage acceptable than
respondents from more rural and less educated communities. These findings are indicative of some of
the demographic and structural drivers of child marriage acceptability, and highlight the need for
integrated programming, which seeks to transform attitudes, whilst addressing other aspects of
vulnerability, including household economic stress, domestic violence, and access to education and other
opportunities and support.
Child justice
144. Section I of the KAP surveys focused on asking respondents about their knowledge and attitudes
in relation to child justice, including in cases where children were either victims or witnesses of serious
crimes, or alternatively, suspected or accused of criminal offenses.
145. The data demonstrates significant improvements in community attitudes towards child justice
over time. Respondents at endline were significantly more likely than respondents at baseline to say
that “small problems like stealing small amounts, getting into fights or being drunk” caused by children
under 18 should be dealt with through informal or restorative justice measures (e.g. mediation with
victim, or counselling and rehabilitation delivered by a local service), rather than through punishment or
criminalisation.316 Furthermore, as many as 94.7 per cent of respondents in 2020 were able to name at
least one underlying vulnerability which might lead a child into committing a crime, compared to only
just over half (55.4 per cent) of respondents in 2013. In particular, one in four (24.8 per cent) of
respondents in 2020 identified past experiences of violence, abuse or neglect as an underlying driver of
childhood criminality, compared to just 1 in 9 (11.2 per cent) in 2013.

various forms of domestic abuse, and respondents’ willingness to report serious crimes to the police and
other formal authorities. Roughly 1 in 3 respondents (33.1 per cent) in 2013 felt that serious crimes such
as violence with a weapon or causing serious injury, murder, rape or sexual abuse could be resolved
within the family/ household; by endline this had dropped to just 1 in 7 (14.8 per cent). Furthermore,
79.9 per cent of respondents felt that such crimes could be referred to the police, compared to only just
over half (51.7 per cent) of respondents in 2013. These findings were supported by qualitative interviews,
which attributed these changes in attitudes to greater awareness and recognition of children’s rights:
Now people are becoming enlightened, unlike those days when people can just commit crime
and go scot free. Now, because we have these children’s rights - the United Nations rights on
children and others, because of that people are cautions and afraid to tamper with the rights
of children.317
147. On the other hand, evidence in qualitative interviews revealed that stigma and shame concerning
domestic conflict remains a significant factor in preventing reporting of serious crimes against children in
practice. As one adolescent girl explained:
If I have domestic problem at home, l may not have the courage to tell anyone outside my
home because people will insult me for selling my home affairs to the public. People will even
stereotype me for discussing family matters outside.318
Help seeking
“Speaking up is not something that Ghanaian kids learn in school and that goes across society.”
148. The final section of the survey measured knowledge and practices concerning help seeking in
cases of child abuse. Once again the results reveal significant improvements from baseline to endline,
with respondents expressing more willingness and more knowledge of how and when to seek support
in cases of violence and abuse. Over half (56.6 per cent) of children and young people in 2020 strongly
agreed that “I know who I can tell if someone hurts me”, compared to a significantly reduced 37.5 per
cent of children in 2013; and 3 out of 5 (61.2 per cent) agreed that “I understand what kind of touching
is acceptable and unacceptable”, compared to just 1 in 3 (34.0 per cent) at baseline. Finally over a third
(34.5 per cent) of children and young people at endline said that if they were badly hurt by someone they

92
would report the incident to the police, compared to just over 1 in 5 (22.0 per cent) of children at baseline.
These results are supported by evidence from qualitative interviews:
Just a few months ago a young girl about 16 years of age walked into my office by herself to report
a crime. [It was a] case of sexual harassment which gives a sign of an improvement in the system
through sensitization of child rights and advocacy. Nowadays if the child’s right is being trampled
upon, [children] know where to take the case to and sometimes people around will direct the
child.319
149. As with other results, however, there were no significant differences observed between rates of
change in UNICEF intervention compared to comparison sites, meaning that it is hard to ascertain the
extent to which improvements in help seeking outcomes can be directly attributed to UNICEF’s
campaign and mobilisation efforts.
150. Furthermore, findings indicate that, despite progress, there remain significant barriers to
reporting cases of child abuse, violence and neglect. For example, even at endline, only just over half
(51.2 per cent) of all children and young people said that they would report a case where someone badly
hurt them to any formal authority (including a police officer, health worker, education professional, or
local government officer).
151. Evidence from the qualitative interviews indicates that barriers to reporting include: a lack of
knowledge and awareness about local support services; a lack of understand of procedures for seeking
support; myths and misconceptions about services within communities; inefficiencies in the delivery
of support services which have led to a lack of confidence and trust (including perceptions that the
system is “too slow” and “ineffective”); and traditional and cultural believes and practices that
continue to privilege seeking family-based, or local and informal support for resolving community
issues.
152. In the survey data the key demographic variables associated with lower levels of help-seeking
were education and geographical location: respondents with lower levels of education, and those living
in rural areas were significantly less likely to say that they would seek help in cases of child abuse, than
more educated, urban dwellers.320

Effectiveness of monitoring and reporting
Has sufficient attention been given to measuring, monitoring and reporting results including results related to
gender equality? How effectively has evidence been used to inform programmatic changes and adjustments?
153. Since the beginning of the 2012 programme cycle, UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has
devoted significant resources to measuring, monitoring and reporting on the results of programming. In
addition to regular monitoring activities, evidence has been gathered through a series of assessments
and evaluations relating to specific areas of programming (see Annex 7).
154. The challenge of measuring changes in child protection outcomes, particularly those related to
social and behavioural change, was recognised by UNICEF early on and significant improvements have
been made over the course of the two programmes. The child protection team worked closely with the
country office Monitoring and Evaluation team and recruited a child protection specialist in 2015 to build
the programme’s monitoring and evidence measurement capacity.321 This appears to be reflected in
improvements in internal monitoring systems from 2015 onwards.
155. Internal monitoring systems include a tracking system to monitor activity implementation and
fund utilisation against anticipated results.322 In the 2012-17 programme, many indicators were not
assigned baseline or target measures, making it difficult to assess whether the programme had achieved
its anticipated results. Reporting on the indicators was not always done effectively. For some outputs the
indicators reported in annual Results Assessment Module (RAM) reports differ from those in the
workplans, which is inefficient and means that the workplan indicators have no reporting against them.
Other opportunities to report on these indicators, for example, through the research studies
commissioned, have also been missed, suggesting that reporting on these indicators has not been
prioritised.323

94
156. For the 2018-22 programme, monitoring of results appears to have improved. The use of the
TrackMe system clearly sets out the indicators and associated activities to allow for easy monitoring, and
output indicators have clear definitions, baseline and target measures. Targets are set both overall and
annually to allow for measurement of progress throughout the programme. The Results Assessment
Module allows for annual monitoring of the indicators and annual reports are also made on Strategic
Monitoring Questions.324
157. Reporting to donors is done primarily through annual or biannual reports which report
achievements against programme components or outputs. 325 These reports take a primarily qualitative
approach to reporting results without the integration of more quantitative information, particularly
evidence related to increases in knowledge or satisfaction with services which could help to more robustly
demonstrate results.326
158. Field visits have been an important aspect of the programme’s approach to monitoring, with the
field level presence in the Tamale office being strengthened to allow for closer monitoring of results in
the field throughout the course of the two programmes.327 In the words of a representative from the
Ghana Education Service, “They are always in the field to ensure that what is reported is what actually
has taken place.”328 Many stakeholders commented on the field visits, which help UNICEF and their
partners to develop a shared understanding of the issues being addressed and strengthen partner
capacity to monitor initiatives.
159. In addition to field visits, the programme has developed an “app” to track the implementation of
community engagement activities such as the child protection toolkit. This facilitates real-time reporting
on activities and has improved reporting between community and national levels. In recognition of the
difficulties in measuring results from social and behavioural change programming, an innovative ‘Most
Significant Change’ (MSC) story approach was taken.329 This participatory approach provides a way to
measure qualitative indicators such as ‘child protection’ through the systematic collection and analysis
of stories of change provided by programme participants and other stakeholders.330 Training was
delivered to government and civil society partners in 2014 and 2015 and in 2017 to participants at a
regional level from organisations including Departments for Social Welfare and Community
Development, GES, NCCE, and NGOs.331 The MSC approach enabled the identification of dominant child
protection issues and demonstrated examples of positive changes in behaviour and attitudes resulting
from UNICEF’s programme. Stories also highlighted challenges and areas for improvement in
programming.332 The approach itself is a useful monitoring and evaluation tool but does require investing
in building the capacity of partners, who may not have a background in qualitative interviewing, and
securing their cooperation. The limited cooperation and buy-in from Community Development Officers
would need to be addressed in order to use the MSC approach as an integral monitoring tool. The
assessment of the MSC approach also found that some community members struggled to recall stories

related to changes in attitudes and behaviour (as opposed to tangible changes such as infrastructure),
which could reduce the effectiveness of this approach for monitoring such changes.333
160. Both the Child and Family Welfare Policy and the Justice for Children Policy have operational plans
for their implementation, supported by the 2018 -2022 Child Protection Programme. The Department of
Children is responsible for monitoring policy implementation and this process is tracked and reported
through the National Child Protection Coordination Committee and regional level committees.334
161. Most partners at the district and regional level reported that evidence from monitoring is used
to inform adjustments to programme activities:
Whenever the report is presented to UNICEF, questions are asked, and recommendations are also
provided which enhances the work and inform changes or adjust the program.335
162. When we go for evaluation meetings, I present my feedback. I can’t write, though I can read [a
little]. I however know that what I tell them during review meetings reflects in their next approaches.336
163. Other participants, however, expressed doubts that the data they provide informs new projects
or to help improve practice at a district level. A representative from a donor agency commented:
There is a feeling that data is for reporting [on what has been done] – there isn’t a culture of using
data for decision making or planning. Oftentimes when you talk to social workers you find that
they see data as useful for reporting but when you ask how it is used… I don’t find there is a culture
of using data. Social workers don’t look at their caseload and make decisions on how to focus
their work for that week.337
164. While monitoring is carried out and reports are made to UNICEF on a monthly or even bi-monthly
basis on what activities have been carried out, results may not be sufficiently monitored after
implementation to provide evidence of the impact of UNICEF activities. One partner commented that
“we engage the community but at the end of the day, maybe we visited a community two or three times
a day… but we don't go back to monitor what is going on now or… evaluate to see [the] differences.”338
Monitoring and reporting results related to gender equality
165. In 2015 a gender audit process found that UNICEF staff lacked adequate skills and knowledge on
gender assessments and mainstreaming.339 Efforts have been made by the child protection programme
to remedy this through the recruitment of a dedicated gender specialist. The 2018-22 programme has a
Child Protection Programme Gender Strategy which is guided by UNICEF’s Gender Action Plan. The
strategy includes building a strong evidence base to support gender equality actions, improving sex-
disaggregated data collection and analysis, strengthening capacity for gender data collection, analysis,
documentation and learning, and investing in monitoring, documentation, performance tracking and
evaluation to support the scale-up of evidence-based programmes by government and partners. The
Social Welfare Information Management System (SWIMS) is identified as an important opportunity for
sex-disaggregated data collection and gender analysis.340
166. Across programme activities, results are sex-disaggregated where relevant and partners reported
that gender equality is monitored and that disaggregated data is collected and used to inform

programming. Many partners cited data on teenage pregnancy as having been important both in
informing UNICEF’s PASS intervention and in monitoring the success of its implementation.
Research conducted to inform programming
167. Several research studies, evaluations and assessments have been carried out over the course of
both programmes (see Annex 7). Investing in formative evaluation and research was highlighted by
UNICEF as an important way to challenge assumptions and to inform more effective programming:
For instance, in the case of child marriage again, we did some programming with the belief that
it was caused by certain things... That people didn’t know any better. [The assessment of
strategies to end child marriage] revealed how it is due to structural issues across sectors and that
was a lesson learned.341
168. The assessment included a series of recommendations, described by UNICEF as ‘vital and helpful’.
Several of these recommendations have been implemented during the 2018-2022 programme, for
example designing a gender strategy and focusing on a more holistic programme with linkages to areas
such as teenage pregnancy and education.342
169. Recommendations from the formative evaluation of the ‘policy to practice’ initiative have also
been integrated into the 2018-2022 programme to inform the scale up of the initiative to the national
level. This has included the development of Intersectoral Case Management SOPs to better embed
coordination in district governance systems and revising and strengthening the OHLGS training manual
to promote capacity strengthening among social welfare officers in monitoring, reporting and
information management.343
170. UNICEF described the baseline assessment on child protection knowledge, attitudes and practices
as “a watershed moment”344 in setting out the approach for the child protection programme. The study
demonstrated the scale of child protection issues in Ghana and hence the need for a systems-
strengthening approach, as well as the high acceptance of violence against children, which demonstrated
the need for prevention work. This ultimately contributed to the development of the child protection
toolkit and the GACA campaign.
171. While the study informed programming and was used extensively to advocate with
government stakeholders, using the data to effectively measure programme impact in the long term
has been something of a missed opportunity. Unfortunately, the UNICEF office did not store all of the
original datafiles securely and were only able to produce the child data for this evaluation to use as a
baseline. In addition, the data that was retained only related to a small number of the current
intervention areas. The need to retain data and make it available in the years following is an issue that
needs to be urgently addressed by UNICEF Ghana.
Building partner capacity to monitor and measure results
172. The programme is reliant on partners, particularly MOGCSP, to carry out monitoring and collect
data on results. However, monitoring systems at the outset of the programme were weak or non-existent.
Both programmes have recognised this and invested in strengthening the internal monitoring capacity of
Government departments and partners. During the 2012-2017 programme, UNICEF provided technical
support for the restructuring of the Social Protection Directorate at the MOGCSP, including the
establishment of a Monitoring and Evaluation Unit.345 To facilitate decentralised monitoring of social

welfare services at a district level, technical support was provided in 2017-18 to the Office of the Head of
Local Government Service (OHLGS) to develop and include indicators related to child protection and
sexual and gender-based violence in their performance management system.346 The National
Development Planning Commission (NDPC) also delivered training to planning and social welfare staff in
all districts on writing good quality progress reports and including child protection in medium-term
development plans. The NDPC assessed the quality of the 2019 district annual progress reports and found
that compliance with requirements had increased significantly, making more data available for evidence-
based decision-making. The report also highlighted a number of remaining challenges, including poor
record-keeping by district departments, limited capacity for monitoring and evaluation activities, and
limited reporting on child and social welfare indicators. The report recommends that UNICEF conducts
further sensitisation with district authorities to support them to monitor child and social welfare-related
interventions in their annual progress reports.347
173. Support was also given to the Ghana Police Service in 2015 and 2016 to reform its database and
case tracking system to improve record keeping and ensure more robust data for monitoring cases
involving children.348 Ghana Police Service now has a system in place to track and report data at the
national and sub-national level on reported cases and convictions of violence against children. While data
is disaggregated by sex, age, and type of violence, it does not include information on children with
disabilities.349
174. Further capacity building work has included improving the monitoring of children in alternative
care. Standard Operating Procedures and standardised monitoring forms were developed to improve the
documentation of case management and to improve the quality of the data collected by social workers.
As described in the section on ‘establishing effective data systems’, the programme also aims to establish
a national child protection information management system. This process began during the 2012-2017
programme but is mainly being implemented during the current programme. UNICEF has developed a
Social Welfare Information Management System (SWIMS) and delivered training but at the time of
writing the system was yet to be rolled out in most districts, with 34 districts live on SWIMS and 144 social
welfare officers registered as SWIMS users. Social workers interviewed for the evaluation were
anticipating that SWIMS will make information sharing much easier and more efficient:
After the training, I have seen that I just need to email something on a case to a caseworker in
Kumasi, it will be simple, I just have to export the case since people sometimes do relocate... What
we used to do is email and then post but SWIMS, I think it will get better.350
175. Monitoring and evaluating the roll-out of the SWIMS system will be important to identify and
address challenges and to ensure that momentum is maintained.
Preliminary conclusions on the effectiveness of UNICEF’s CP Programme
EFF 1. UNICEF’s technical assistance, financial support and support to policy dialogue and advocacy have
been instrumental in achieving a strong legal framework for child protection in Ghana, in line with
regional and international standards. [Paras 11 – 32].
EFF 2. Evaluation findings clearly demonstrate that UNICEF’s contributions have supported the
establishment of a comprehensive child protection response service delivered through district
administrations (MMDAs) as part of a broader national child protection system. [Paras 4 – 5].

EFF 3. Multiple data sources confirm that child protection response service are dominated by child
maintenance and custody cases, and that at present very few cases of child abuse are identified and
addressed by the CP system. Findings identified numerous barriers to reporting, identification and
referral, including a persistent tendency to rely on DOVVSU to respond to child abuse. [Paras 37 – 52].
EFF 4. UNICEF’s Programme succeeded in strengthening the capacity of social welfare authorities to
deliver child protection services in line with the Government’s case management SOPs. A considerable
proportion of service providers report to be following the SOPs when responding to CP cases and the
implementation of case management procedures was found to be consistently stronger in districts that
received UNICEF support compared to those that did not. [Paras 53 – 66].
EFF 5. UNICEF’s considerable investments in strengthening the capacity of the judicial service and law
enforcement authorities to deliver child-friendly justice services have galvanised support amongst duty
bearers and led to a shift in approach. Yet evaluation findings suggest that a significant amount of work
remains to be done to ensure that children have access to child-friendly justice services. [Paras 73 – 81].
EFF 6. UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has made significant contributions to strengthening the birth
registration process in Ghana, including through piloting digital systems for birth registration, yet barriers
to delivery and uptake continue to limit registration rates. [Paras 82 – 92].
EFF 7. Evaluation findings demonstrate that UNICEF’s contributions have advanced alternative care
reform in Ghana, including by enabling the GoG to establish a strong regulatory framework for residential
care homes which is increasingly being implemented. [Paras 93 – 99].
EFF 8. A number of persistent barriers, including difficulties effectively reintegrating children into family
environments and a lack of family base alternative care services, continue to hamper the transition for a
system based primarily on residential care. [Paras 99 – 108].
EFF 9. UNICEF’s behavioural change and community mobilisation work achieved an impressive reach and
was generally endorsed by participants. [Paras 109 – 122].
EFF 10. Evaluation findings indicate a significant improvement over time in attitudes and practices across
a range of issues, including: family separation, violence against children, child marriage, child justice and
help seeking behaviour. Yet despite the significant changes which occurred, there were no significant
differences in rates of change in UNICEF intervention sites compared to comparison sites, making it hard
to determine whether changes can be directly attributed to UNICEF’s programming. [Paras 123 – 152].
EFF 11. The challenge of measuring changes in child protection outcomes, particularly those related to
social and behavioural change, was recognised by UNICEF early on and significant improvements have
been made over the course of the two programme cycles. [Paras 154 – 156, Paras 158 - 164].
EFF 12. UNICEF has invested in a number of research studies, evaluations and assessments which have
been used effectively to inform programming and challenge assumptions. [Paras 167 – 170].
10.3. Efficiency of the CP Programme
Use of resources in the CP programme
How has UNICEF mobilised and used its resources (human, technical and financial) to achieve its planned results for
child protection? To what extent have resources (human, technical, financial) been sufficient, both in quantity and
quality? Do more cost-effective ways of achieving the same child protection results exist?
176. UNICEF’s Child Protection programme was successful in mobilising significant financial resources
to support its system strengthening approach over both the 2012 – 2017 and 2018 – 2022 programme
99
cycles. This is a notable achievement given that UNICEF Country Offices have often struggled to obtain
funding for CPSS work;351 with ‘issue based’ programming tending to be more popular amongst donors
who are keen on reaching large numbers of children and focussing their efforts on priority issues. This
tendency is reinforced by the fact that CPSS work often requires investment over many years, and may
not reach a high numbers of beneficiaries in the short term.
177. The Child Protection Section was innovative in recognising that issue-based and systems
strengthening approaches are not necessarily incompatible: that funding for an ‘issue’ can be
incorporated into, and used to form part of, a systems strengthening approach. They have successfully
directed issue-based funding towards promoting a broader systems strengthening agenda. As one
member of the CP team explained: “if we do have issue-based money we can invest it in system-
strengthening programming. For instance the funding from USAID for the Care Reform Initiative was
specifically for alternative care, but the way it has been used has been much broader.” 352
178. Whilst credit should be given to donors for remaining flexible and supporting an integrated
systems strengthening approach to child protection work, it is clear from interviews with programme
staff that UNICEF was instrumental in envisaging this approach and negotiating with donors to justify its
value, while committing to meet donor priorities. In addition to bringing in significant funds, this approach
has the potential to be more efficient, by promoting coordinated services at scale and avoiding
duplication.
179. Finally, UNICEF’s programme was designed to utilise resources in an efficient way through a set
of mutually reinforcing interventions, strengthening key components of the child protection system. For
instance, the community mobilisation and behaviour change programming (which received the largest
proportion of programme funds, see figure 13) was intended as a prevention tool: both to prevent
violence and other child protection risks, and at the same time to avoid overloading burgeoning child and
family welfare services with child protection cases.353 As is discussed in the effectiveness section of the
report, however, community mobilisation programming and child and family welfare services have faced
a number of challenges and the potential benefits of this design have yet to fully materialise.

What I have realized is that the Department [of Social Welfare and Community Development] lacks
funds to do their work
- NGO Worker
180. Evaluation findings clearly demonstrate that district level child protection services remain
severely underfunded, resulting in significant disruptions to their effective delivery. This challenge was
noted in the National Development Planning Commission’s 2019 report assessing annual progress reports
from MMDAs.354 It was also raised by nearly all social welfare officers interviewed for the evaluation, as
well as other stakeholders who identified insufficient funding as one of the greatest barriers to effective
child protection response work. The following explanation, by a social officer in a municipal district, is
typical:
Moving from the office to the community is very challenging. We write to the municipal assembly
for funds but we get no response and as result, sometimes we need to use our own money for
transport. There are a lot of cases that need follow-up but as a result of transport costs among
others, it becomes a challenge and therefore we end up doing some of these visits over the phone
when we should be going there to see things for ourselves. So, as a child protection officer, issues
of transport and movement to the communities pose challenges.355
181. UNICEF has acknowledged the lack of sufficient resources for frontline social workers, and the
Child Protection Programme has included several initiatives aimed at advocating for budget
commitments from Government at central, regional and MMDA levels. These have included a 2014 –
2015 analysis estimating the cost of child abuse, which made the business case to the GoG for investing
in child protection prevention and response, as well as advocacy to promote the inclusion of resourcing
for child protection in municipal budgets and Regional Development Plans. Whilst this work has resulted
in some successes356, notably an increased prioritisation of CP in national, regional and district level
planning and budgeting processes357, it has yet to translate into sufficient funding for child protection
response services.
182. Adequate funding for local child protection response services is critical to ensuring that
resources are used efficiently within the child protection system. When front line service providers lack
sufficient human or financial resources, the child protection system is unlikely to identify child
protection risk or coordinate an appropriate response across a network of available services. Without
this component of the child protection system in place, the efficiency of other investments made by
UNICEF, the GoG and other partners, are likely to be undermined, as cases are missed and duplication
and fragmentation are more likely to occur.
Coordination and collaboration
How effectively have coordination mechanisms been working between UNICEF’s child protection programme and
other UNICEF programme outcomes (across education, health and nutrition, social protection and social policy,
adolescent and youth empowerment, communication for development, and early childhood development) to
create and sustain linkages across sectors, and between child protection actors, especially related to community
engagement for the prevention of child marriage (KRC 6), violence against children (KRC 2) and birth registration
(KRC 4)?

356 For example, successful advocacy resulted in increased budget allocation (3% of budget of MoGCSP)for the Central Adoption Authority and
Child marriage in 2019.
357 See for example, June 2019, ‘National Development Planning Commission, ‘Technical Review of 2018-2021 Sector and Medium Term
Development Plans’.
101
How complementary were the activities implemented jointly with other UN agencies, development partners and
NGOs (avoiding duplication, maximising efficiency, leveraging added value)?]
Coordination with other UNICEF programme outcomes
183. Child protection is a highly multi-disciplinary field of work which requires effective collaboration
and coordination across health, education, law enforcement, justice and social welfare sectors. UNICEF’s
Child Protection Section has taken advantage of the established relationships and expertise within the
UNICEF Ghana Country Office by working closely with other sections to strengthen engagement on a
number of programme areas, including violence against children (KRC 2) and child marriage (KRC 6). A
member of the child protection team emphasised the added value of this approach; “a lot of protection
issues don’t find an answer within child protection – they are cross sectoral – they have a health aspect,
and education aspect – now we have a lot more cross-sectoral work because we are recognising that the
answer to many of these issues is not just from child protection”358.
184. In the area of VAC prevention and response (KRC 2), the Child Protection Team has established
an effective partnership with the Education Section to deliver the Safe Schools Initiative.359 The project,
which involved close collaboration with the Ghana Education Services, aims to end corporal punishment
in schools, promote positive discipline techniques, address bullying and sexual harassment, and
strengthen identification and reporting of school-based violence.360 UNICEF’s Child Protection
Programme funded the development and implementation of resources for educators, students and
parents associations and partnered closely with the Education Section to promote their uptake.
185. The Child Protection Team has also collaborated with UNICEF’s Health Section to strengthen the
ability of the Ghanaian health service to identify and respond to cases of child abuse. As discussed in the
effectiveness section of the report, referral links between the health sector and district level social
welfare authorities are weak at present. In 2018, UNICEF CP supported the development of a set of
guidelines to support health workers in preventing and responding to child abuse, including supporting
child victims of violence and following the correct procedures for collecting and preserving evidence for
potential use in legal proceedings.361 Yet the guidelines have yet to translate into effective identification
of child protection cases. UNICEF is exploring the possibility of promoting their integration into training
curricula at teaching hospitals to ensure their effective implementation.
186. UNICEF’s CP programme has also contributed significantly to cross sectoral work on child
marriage. These efforts are in line with the recommendations of the 2017 Assessment of Strategies and
Approaches to Address Child Marriage in Ghana’, which emphasised the importance of engaging all
UNICEF sections in child marriage prevention work as well as ensuring multi-sectoral response
interventions which address underlying drivers of child marriage in a holistic way.362 The commitment to
a cross sectoral approach in this complex area of programming was recognised by a UNICEF staff member
outside of child protection, who observed that: “there have been significant efforts [by the CP team] to
do cross sectoral work and make sure contributions are aligned” 363. In addition, the Child Protection
Programme is working closely with social workers to promote the delivery of integrated response services
for girls who are at-risk of marriage, married or are teen mothers, including social welfare and protection

services, maternal health services, sexual and reproductive health services, education, livelihoods and
income generation support.
Complementarity and coordination in service delivery
187. Effective coordination is particularly important given the vast number of actors operating in the
child protection space in Ghana, which creates potential for duplication and inefficiencies in the delivery
of child protection work. Respondents consistently recognised that UNICEF is well placed to facilitate
coordination between child protection actors, particularly between government and civil society, and
noted their successes in doing so:
A lot of NGOs are implementing various kinds of child protection programmes in Ghana with
different tools and strategies. As a global organization, UNICEF can help rally these NGOs together
in order to streamline child protection systems in Ghana. This would also avoid the duplication of
resources and ensures efficiency.364
--
We have a network for CSOs working in child protection – the Ghana NGO Coalition on the Rights
of the Child. Yes, there are times we disagree but often we have collaborated, especially under
the UNICEF partnership – UNICEF has helped to facilitate the partnership.
--
Thanks to UNICEF we have a good working relationship with our NGO partners. UNICEF provided
good capacity training and most of our partners were involved from the outset. One person
cannot do it alone.365
188. And yet despite UNICEF’s contributions to improving coordination, evaluation findings suggest
that it often continues to pose a challenge. As one NGO representative explained: “sometimes it becomes
confusing as to who is doing what.”366 The effectiveness of coordination was found to vary across
localities, depending on the initiative and relationships of the service providers involved. A number of
stakeholders observed that cross-sectoral work has stalled because of service providers’ limited
resources: whilst collaborative working can save resources in the long run, it often requires upfront
investment in order to establish effective partnerships in the first place.
189. UNICEF’s recent support to the development of inter-sectoral SOPs for child protection and family
welfare services are likely to lead to further improvements in complementarity. The ISSOPs, which include
sector specific SOPs for all relevant agencies, have the potential to significantly improve inter-sectoral
coordination in the delivery of child protection response services. As one stakeholder explained: “what
the framework will do is to see how we can work together so we don’t duplicate efforts. Various
stakeholders are working in their field – this will harmonise our work, to make sure there is a standard
approach and that referrals and linkages are done properly. Before this all of the actors were just using
their own templates…”367 Finally, many respondents also emphasised the importance of an integrated
information management system for facilitating efficient coordination in child protection response.
Indeed, the roll out of the Social Welfare Information Management System (Primero) will ease
information sharing between relevant actors and may reduce barriers to efficient cross-sector working.

Preliminary conclusions on the efficiency of UNICEF’s CP Programme
EFFIC 1. UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme succeeded in mobilising considerable financial resources
to support its programme, in line with its system strengthening approach, and used resources efficiently.
[Paras 177 - 180].
EFFIC 2. A lack of sufficient resourcing continues to undermine child protection service delivery at district
level, and is likely to compromise the efficiency of other child protection investments made by UNICEF,
the GoG and other partners. [Paras 181 – 183].
EFFIC 3. UNICEF’s Child Protection Section has taken advantage of the established relationships and
expertise within the UNICEF Ghana Country Office, using a cross-sectoral approach to address child
protection issues. [Paras 184 - 187].
EFFIC 4. UNICEF is particularly well placed to coordinate between child protection actors and has
succeeded in creating linkages within the sector. The evaluation found that coordination continues to
pose a challenge, however, with the effectiveness of coordination and cooperation varying across
localities. [Paras 188 - 190].
10.4. Sustainability of the CP Programme
What are the enabling as well as constraining factors that are likely to influence replication and sustainability?
Sustainability of programme outcomes / CP changes
To what extent are the benefits and achievements of the UNICEF supported programmes likely to continue after
the programme has ended? What measures were taken so that the Government of Ghana and targeted
communities could take ownership of the child protection programme?
190. One of the most important advantages of a system strengthening approach to child protection
programming is its potential for sustainability. Evaluation findings suggest that this is the case in the
Ghanaian context. Many of the outcomes of UNICEF’s Child Protection programme have been
institutionalised, enshrined in law, policy or practice, and are therefore likely to continue even after
programming ends or changes its focus. Several respondents emphasised the value in this approach, and
attested to the fact that the government has increasingly taken ownership for programme activities. This
commitment is demonstrated by the fact that numerous MMDAs have priorities child protection
interventions in their medium development plans.368 Furthermore, UNICEF’s approach of funding NGOs
to work alongside government by supporting service delivery in the short term whilst government
increasingly takes responsibility for this work is also conducive to sustainability.369
191. Yet despite these positive measures, as is discussed elsewhere, UNICEF’s achievements at policy
level have yet to fully translate into results at the community level, across both prevention and response
work. These findings indicate that significant additional support is likely to be required to ensure that
child protection systems reform leads to outcomes for children across Ghana. This transition is likely to
be undermined by the GoG’s failure to commit sufficient resources to the delivery of services. As is set
out in the efficiency section above, the social welfare sector in Ghana is severely underfunded and
remains heavily reliant on donor support. This challenge was raised repeatedly by respondents, from both
368 See for example, June 2019, ‘National Development Planning Commission, ‘Technical Review of 2018-2021 Sector and Medium Term
Development Plans’.
369 See for example, interview with Challenging Heights, remote interview (zoom), 18 March 2020.
104
within and outside government, who repeatedly pointed out how donor dependence is likely to constrain
sustainability:
What do you think are the most important measures that are needed to improve child
protection in Ghana?
Commitment on the part of government. A lot of the work on children protection is being
spearheaded by external partners like UNICEF, World Vision, Plan Ghana etc. the Government
does not commit as much financial resources into child related interventions as donors do.
The moment these partners pull out, the projects suffer too. The Inter-Sectoral Standard
Operating Procedure could have a great impact. UNICEF is piloting it in some districts. But
the project like many others will die at the end because of lack of commitment including
resource commitment.370
--
And of course I’m also thinking that UNICEF can use their resources to encourage government
to commit resources to this area – leveraging their government to give a budget to these
issues. The government neglects social services because they say – you get funding from
UNICEF.
--
In five to ten years could government work without UNICEF?
It is not realistic. Social issues come up – and this will impact on families – and this will impact
on children. Government as we stand now will not be able to take all the responsibility. 371
192. This highlights, again, that UNICEF should continue to prioritise achieving budget commitments
from government in upcoming programme cycles.
Sustainability of capacity generation
To what extent has the child protection programme contributed to the generation of capacities at national and sub-
national levels? How likely are these to be used after the end of the programme?
The UNICEF’s programme has contributed to the capacity of national and sub-national actors. They have
trained them and provided materials... I am very sure the contribution would last.
- Regional Director of Social Welfare
193. UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has made considerable contributions to building the
capacity of Ghanaian government counterparts at national and sub-national levels. These contributions,
which are discussed in greater detail throughout the effectiveness section of the evaluation, developed
the government’s capacity to deliver a case management response to child protection cases, to monitor
residential care institutions, to apply child friendly policing techniques in cases involving children, and to
identify and refer cases where children are at risk of harm to social services, to name a few. These
contributions were recognised and valued by stakeholders across Ghana, and at national, regional and
district levels. As one enthusiastic respondent expressed; “as I have already emphasised, the Department
of Social Welfare has received tremendous support in terms of capacity building for their regional and the
district level staff. Amongst our external partners, UNICEF stands out” 372.
194. Furthermore, and as is evidenced elsewhere, UNICEF’s capacity building support was found to
have resulted in genuine improvements in the abilities and practices of beneficiaries. The impacts of

105
capacity building were recognised by many respondents, including a district level DOVVSU
representative, who articulated appreciation for UNICEF’s contributions:
UNICEF has contributed a lot to building the capacities of actors, as we are more knowledgeable
of how things are supposed to be done as far as child-related issues are concerned - how to
interview a child, how to treat a child, how to fish out information from a child. We know all of
these things because of the training organized by UNICEF. The knowledge we have acquired stays
with us and will go a long way in supporting the work we do.373
195. UNICEF’s programme design has been conducive to sustaining capacities in the longer term. In
addition to supporting the delivery of training, UNICEF developed materials, manuals and tools, which
can continue to be used by relevant agencies going forward. Indeed, several stakeholders emphasised
the importance of ensuring that training is ongoing and continuous in order to ensure its sustainability:
[The benefits from training] will last to a point. You know as we are training some people are
leaving the service while others too are retiring, so it must be a continuous training. The gap is
that only a few sections of people have been trained. The training should be opened up to include
more stakeholders and beneficiaries…374
It is a positive finding in this regard that UNICEF’s Child Protection Toolkit has been taken up and used by
NGO and government partners within their own programmes.
196. Additionally, where possible, UNICEF supported the integration of training materials into national
curricula to ensure their continued use. A notable success has been the incorporation of training on child
friendly policing into all police trainings,375 and supporting the development of a curriculum for the
Regional Police Training Schools.376 Whilst is too early to comment definitively on the sustainability of
capacities generated through the Child Protection Programme, particularly given that many capacity
building efforts are in their early stages, evaluation findings clearly indicate that they have the potential
to continue after the Programme’s conclusion.
Sustainability of alternative care
What would be the strategy to follow to ensure an alternative care system based primarily on family-based care
and not on residential care?
197. As is set out in the effectiveness section above, UNICEF has made significant contributions to the
reform of alternative care services in Ghana, laying the groundwork for a transition from a system based
on family-based care rather than residential care. And yet a significant amount of work remains to be
done to realise this transition. In particular, despite the amount of work that has been done to promote
oversight and closure of residential care institutions in Ghana, as well as the reintegration of child from
residential care institutions into family care, new residential care homes continue to open and children
continue to be admitted to them. As one UNICEF staff member described the problem: “we did a survey
within institutions in the past three to four months and we found that there are more kids in residential
care than we thought and the conditions are not great. The team is aware of where things stand – but
there is a question of ‘what next’?”377
198. Evaluation findings indicate that a lack of early intervention in child protection cases and limited
child protection response services in Ghana have served to constrain UNICEF’s efforts at alternative care

106
reform. As is mentioned in the effectiveness section of the report, cases where children are experiencing
abuse and neglect rarely receive a child protection response until the case escalates to a crisis point, at
which stage it may be too late to address underlying risk factors, and the child is likely to be temporarily
or permanently placed in residential care. Until child protection response services are strengthened,
removal from the parents is likely to continue. Further, until a viable foster care service is in place,
children are likely to continue to be placed into residential care. Without a focus on funded foster care,
alternative care reform is unlikely to be sustainable.
199. At the same time, capacity constraints on district level social welfare services, such as lack of
budget to conduct field visits, undermine the ability of social welfare and community development
officers to provide sufficient support to children who are reintegrated from residential care into a family
setting, increasing the likelihood that reintegration will fail and children will end up returning to
residential care.
200. The UNICEF Child Protection Programme should continue to invest in the development of family-
based alternative care services, such as foster care and, potentially, supported kinship care, in line with
the Foster Care Operational Manual. This will require additional capacity building, as well as dedicated
resources towards, and increased oversight and support for, foster care services. There will always be a
population of children in need of alternative care in Ghana, and until a well-functioning foster care system
is in place, demand for residential care services for children is likely to persist.
Preliminary conclusions on the sustainability of UNICEF’s CP Programme
SUST 1. Evaluation findings confirm that many programme outcomes have been institutionalised,
enshrined in law, policy or practice, and are therefore likely to be sustained, with the Government
increasingly taking ownership for programme activities. [Para 191].
SUST 2. These achievements require considerable government investment in order to fully translate into
the outcomes for children in the short term, and to ensure that these outcomes are sustained in the
longer term. [Paras 192 - 193].
SUST 3. The Child Protection Programme has succeeded in building the capacity of child protection duty
bearers at national and subnational levels. Interventions were designed to promote sustainable
improvements in capacity and contributions are likely to be sustainable. [Paras 194 - 197].
SUST 4. A lack of early intervention in child protection cases and limited child protection response services
in Ghana have served to constrain UNICEF’s efforts at alternative care reform. These gaps must be
addressed to make alternative care reform sustainable. [Paras 199 - 201].
107
LESSONS LEARNED
The findings indicate that Ghana has taken significant steps towards building an effective child
protection system over the course of 2012 – 2020. Many of the activities have achieved or gone beyond
the expected output but, not unexpectedly, some aspects of the programme have not been fully
achieved and, as all would acknowledge, there is still further work to be done to ensure a fully
functioning child protection programme. This evaluation has thrown up a number of lessons to be
learned.
1. Legal reform is more likely to be successful when it is evidence based, drawing on analysis of
existing laws, research that provides solid empirical evidence on the issues at stake and wide-ranging
consultation and engagement of stakeholders. Going through these processes not only facilitates more
effective legal reform: it ensures buy in from key stakeholders, raises public awareness and interest on
child protection issues, stimulates debate and has the capacity to contribute to changes in attitudes,
values and practices.
2. Building a fully functioning child protection system involves not only the introduction of a
legislative framework, but also a number of other elements, including effective governance
structures, a continuum of services, human, financial and infrastructure resources; robust data
collection and monitoring systems; minimum standards and oversight and mechanisms for child
participation and community engagement. These require a long term commitment. Even when
governance and regulatory frameworks are in place, the task of raising public awareness, training all
relevant stakeholders on new policies, laws and practices and ensuring full implementation of new
laws, structures, systems and practices, takes time. As a result, child protection system strengthening
may require three or four country programme cycles before the child protection system strengthening
reaches a level of maturity.
3. The identification and referral of suspected child abuse cases to the appropriate body is an
essential step in child protection system building and requires both effective referral processes and
widespread training and awareness raising over a period of time. Education and health services are
the most likely to come into contact with children who have suffered or are at risk of suffering violence,
abuse, neglect or exploitation and it is vital that they receive repeated and continued training in order
to understand and use the referral process. Without effective referral, the child protection system
cannot deliver effective response services for children who have experienced violence, abuse or
neglect.
4. Prevention and early intervention are more effective, efficient and sustainable than response for
child protection cases. Acting early when risk is first identified can prevent many cases reaching
crisis point and requiring an emergency response. Adequate resources for frontline child prevention
services are critical to promoting the efficient use of resources with the child protection system and
more likely to address the best interests of children.
5. Coordination amongst different bodies with child protection duties and roles is key to ensuring
effective implementation of the child protection system. Local coordination bodies which focus on
the functioning of the child protection system are a mechanism for ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Without this component of the child protection system in place, the effectiveness and
efficiency of the various bodies is likely to be undermined, with cases missed and duplication and
fragmentation of child protection services.
108
6. In order to ensure that social messaging campaigns are effective and to minimise the risk of negative
reactions, resistance and backlash to campaign messaging, it is necessary to ensure that services
which support that messaging (social welfare, livelihoods, access to education, justice) are available
on the ground. This is particularly the case where campaigns are aimed at challenging deeply
embedded attitudes and norms.
7. Developing family-based, alternative care services, and especially foster care, frequently presents
a challenge. Adequate provision of sustainable foster care requires appropriate funding and cannot
rely wholly on the goodwill of community members, regardless of how willing community members
may be. Budgeting for the delivery of child protection services must include funding for foster care and
support of kinship care if the needs of children for family-based alternative care are to be
delivered. Foster carers also require support from the social services workforce to assist them in
looking after children, who frequently face loss, grief, a lack of education and poor physical and mental
health.
8. Gender empowerment programming may produce unintended consequences, including, in some
cases, the entrenchment of particular gendered norms. It is important to be sensitive to the way that
messaging and services designed to protect adolescent girls (for example by discouraging teen
pregnancy or early marriage) may interact with existing gender norms and power dynamics, and
ensure that programming avoids reinforcing stigma or discrimination.
109
FINAL CONCLUSIONS
This evaluation demonstrates that UNICEF Ghana’s Child Protection Programme has made significant
contributions to strengthening the national child protection system in Ghana across both the 2012 –
2017 and 2018 – 2022 programme cycles. In addition to being well aligned with UNICEF’s global
strategies, the Programme’s system strengthening approach was found to be highly relevant in the
Ghanaian context given that Ghana lacked both an integrated legal framework and an institutional
structure for the child protection system when the 2012 Programme began. The Programme was found
to have delivered effectively on commitments to donors, and the consultative and responsive
approach which UNICEF adopted across its programming has ensured the relevance of interventions
to beneficiaries, including children themselves.
The evaluation found that UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has been delivered effectively, and
has achieved important results in line with its broader system strengthening agenda. UNICEF’s
contributions enabled the development of a strong legal framework for child protection and supported
the establishment of a comprehensive child protection response service delivered through district
administrations as part of a broader national child protection system. Furthermore, UNICEF’s
Programme succeeded in building the capacity of stakeholders to conduct child protection prevention
and response work in line with that framework. Yet child protection response services continue to be
dominated by child maintenance and custody cases, with very few cases of child abuse identified and
addressed by the CP system. Findings identified numerous barriers to reporting, identification and
referral, including a persistent tendency to rely on police authorities to respond to child abuse.
UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has succeeded in strengthening the capacity of the judicial
service and law enforcement authorities to deliver child-friendly justice services. The programme has
made significant contributions to improving the effectiveness of birth registration, and advanced
alternative care reform. Yet across these areas of programming, additional work is required to ensure
that UNICEF’s achievements fully translate into outcomes for children across Ghana.
UNICEF’s behavioural change and community mobilisation programming achieved an impressive reach
and was broadly endorsed by participants. Whilst evaluation findings indicate significant
improvements in attitudes and practices across a range of child protection issues, there were no
significant differences in rates of change in UNICEF intervention sites compared to comparison sites,
making it hard to determine whether changes can be directly attributed to UNICEF’s programming.
The Child Protection Programme was successful in mobilising considerable financial resources to
support its system strengthening approach, and used resources efficiently, including through drawing
on partnerships and facilitating coordination between relevant actors. Resource constraints were
found to undermine the efficiency of the child protection system however, particularly at district level.
A lack of sufficient funding for child protection response services is likely to compromise the efficiency
of other child protection investments made by UNICEF, the GoG and other partners.
UNICEF made significant efforts to mainstream gender equality throughout the child protection
programme, including by recruiting a dedicated gender specialist and developing a Child Protection
Programme Gender Strategy for the 2018-22 programme. Social and behaviour change programming
has raised awareness on gender equality and appears to have contributed to shifts in some norms,
particularly those related to women’s economic empowerment and child marriage. However, much
110
work remains to be done to address entrenched norms, particularly around sexuality and gender roles
and responsibilities, and to reduce the high levels of violence reported by girls in Ghana.
Evaluation findings confirm that many of the outcomes of the Child Protection Programme have been
institutionalised or taken over by Government, and are likely to be sustained when the Programme
ends or changes focus. Yet as mentioned above, UNICEF’s achievements will require additional work
and considerable government investment in order to fully translate into outcomes for children in the
short term, and to ensure their sustainability in the longer term. Priorities for future programming are
set out in the recommendations below.
111
RECOMMENDATIONS
Having brought about so much change to the policy, legislative and practice framework with respect
to child protection and juvenile justice, it is recommended that in the next Country Progamme, UNICEF
should focus on consolidating and implementing the reforms to ensure that they produce the
anticipated improved outcomes for children.
13.1. Training
Output 6 of the 2012-2017 Child Protection Programme concerned integration of standard operating
procedures, guidelines and court procedures into the training curriculum of professionals working
within the child justice system. This was followed in the 2018-2022 Child Protection Programme:
Output 3 requires guidelines and training manuals for the judiciary, probation officers and evidence of
application of the SOPs. Child-friendly policing was successfully integrated into the police training
curriculum and is delivered. However, pre-service or in-service training on child friendly procedures,
child justice and child protection is not currently a mandatory requirement for magistrates, judges or
lay members of the Court taking such cases.
Further training for the judiciary and other law enforcement personnel working in the justice system
and in child protection would be beneficial, and it is recommended that UNICEF:
➢ Work with the Judicial Training Institute to integrate child protection and child justice into
the pre-service and in-service training curriculum of magistrates and judges and make such
training compulsory.
For relevant findings see paras 73 - 75.
The majority of social workers have received some training on case management, but the KAP Survey
and qualitative data indicated that further training is needed and has been requested by social
workers. Further qualitative evidence indicates there is a need for more training on reintegration of
children with their families. It is recommended that UNICEF:
➢ Support universities offering social work courses and bodies providing vocational training
for social workers to review curricula and develop course materials that reflect the most
recent amendments to policy, law and practice.
➢ Provide technical assistance and support to the Ghana Association of Social Workers to
develop training on child protection that can be delivered both in face to face in-service
training courses and on-line.
For relevant findings see paras 102 - 104, 174.
In 2018, the Child Protection Programme supported the development of a set of guidelines to support
health workers in preventing and responding to child abuse, including supporting child victims of
violence and following the correct procedures for collecting and preserving evidence for potential use
in legal proceedings.378 At present the Guidelines are not integrated into the training curricula of
378 Ghana Health Service, ‘Child Protection Guidelines for Health Workers’, 2018
112
medical students and there is a lack of in-service training on the Guidelines. It is recommended that
UNICEF:
➢ Give priority to advocating for integration of the guidelines into pre-service and in-service
training of medical staff to ensure their effective implementation.
For relevant findings see para. 185.
13.2. Referrals
The findings of this evaluation suggest that referral of child protection cases to the Department of
Social Welfare and Community Development at district level remain low. While police referrals have
increased, it is noticeable that despite the Guidelines for health professionals; the ‘Safe School’
Guidelines and a revised Code of Conduct for teachers and school staff, referral of child protection
cases from the education and health sectors remain at a particularly low level, suggesting that these
bodies are not identifying and responding to cases where children are at risk of harm. Training on the
recognition of abuse, its signs and the referral pathways is likely to be effective in increasing referrals.
It is recommended that each health clinics, hospitals, pre-schools and schools should nominate at
least one child protection focal point or ‘champion’, who should receive training and be responsible
both for raising awareness of child protection amongst children, school staff and health
professionals and for making case referrals to the Department of Social Welfare and Community
Development.
For relevant findings see paras 37 - 53.
13.3. Case management
While UNICEF has worked closely with partners on promoting the uptake of standard operating
procedures, the data obtained for this evaluation shows that 56 per cent of cases dealt with by social
workers relate to non- provision or non-payment of child maintenance. Custody disputes account for
a further 19 per cent. This means that 75 per cent of cases, three-quarters of all cases dealt with by
social welfare in 2019 and 2020, related to private disputes between parents and / or family members.
While not underestimating the impact of children of these private law disputes, these issues are not
generally be regarded as ‘child protection’ cases. The time spent on these cases inevitably detracts
from that which can be spent on cases involving violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation. It is
noticeable that apart from neglect cases which form 16 per cent of case load, other forms of child
protection cases dealt with by social workers including cases of physical abuse, sexual exploitation and
juvenile justice cases are small. It is recommended:
➢ That social workers should no longer deal with cases related to the non-payment of
maintenance, and that responsibility for this should pass to a new service attached to the
Family Tribunal.
➢ UNICEF should provide technical assistance to the Department of Social Welfare and the
Ministry of Justice on alternative mechanisms for dealing with maintenance cases, such as a
Child Maintenance Service attached to the Family Tribunal.

13.4. Community based services (fostering)
There is a strong culture of informal fostering and adoption of orphaned and separated children within
families and communities, but this does not extend to formal fostering of children unknown to the
foster family. New foster care regulations were adopted by Parliament in 2018, and although over 500
foster parents and over 200 children have been placed in foster care, a significant increase from
previous years when fostering was essentially non-existent in Ghana, there are still an insufficient
number of foster carers to provide for children in need of family based alternative care, whether on a
temporary or permanent basis. At present, formal foster care appears to run largely on a volunteer
basis, with no compensation for foster carers or for members of the Regional Foster Care Placement
Committee. In addition, there is currently no funding for the recruitment and training of prospective
foster carers. Children placed in foster care may need considerable support, and well trained,
experienced foster carers. An effective, efficient and sustainable foster care service cannot be provided
on a purely voluntary basis. Foster carers need to be compensated at least to the extent of covering
the child’s expenses and some may need to be paid a small retainer if they are to remain available as
foster parents. It is recommended that UNICEF:
➢ Continue to advocate with the Ministry of Gender and the Ministry of Finance to provide
further resources to the Foster Care Fund and, in particular, to cover the expenses of a foster
child while placed with foster carers. UNICEF should also continue to advocate to DSW at
different levels to provide social work support to foster families.
➢ Continue to provide technical assistance to local district councils to develop a sustainable
foster care service.
➢ Consider innovative measures to support foster care in the short term by, for instance
making it a condition of registration for residential homes, that each must provide social
work support to a specified number of foster carers.
For relevant findings see paras 105 - 106, 125.
13.5. Coordination between social welfare and the police
Findings from the evaluation suggest that VAC cases are often handled by the Police Service’s Domestic
Violence Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU), rather than by district social welfare authorities. Whilst in
some locations MMDA social workers described having an effective working relationship with DOVVSU
and identified this as one of the positive changes to the child protection system of recent years,
coordination between DOVVSU and social welfare authorities was found to remain weak in many
localities, with some respondents describing a dysfunctional relationship between the two bodies. The
failure to work together may, if not addressed, lead to the development of two parallel systems,
fragmenting the local child protection response. DOVVSU lacks sufficient capacity to provide a holistic
child protection response, but territoriality and the desire to provide a domestic violence centred
approach rather than refer the children to the Department of Social Welfare and Community
Development may lead to the threshold for intervention in child protection cases being raised.
The recently developed inter-sectoral Standard Operating Procedures for Child Protection and Family
Welfare by the MOGCSP and UNICEF address the roles and responsibilities of the Department of Social
114
Welfare and Community Development and DoVVSU, but DOSVVU and the Department of Social
Welfare and Community Development would benefit from more practical guidance.
It is recommended that UNICEF support the development of a joint working protocol specifically
between the DoVVSU and the Department of Social Welfare and Community Development setting
step by step the procedural measures to be taken by each body when a relevant referral is received,
the time frames for those steps and the coordination mechanisms to be put into place to ensure a
joint and holistic approach to domestic violence and child protection. It is recommended that this
task should be completed within the current programme and accompany the roll out (and training
on) of the Inter-Sectoral Standard Operating Procedures.
For relevant findings see paras 41 - 46.
13.6. Information management systems
Evaluation findings confirmed that an integrated child protection database containing standardised
administrative data on child protection cases in Ghana is not yet in place. This is a significant gap, but
one that UNICEF is working closely with government partners to address, through developing a digital
social welfare information management system (SWIMS), using the software platform Primero. The
roll out of SWIMS is likely to require significant capacity building support to ensure that users have
sufficient skills and technology to use it effectively.
➢ UNICEF work in close collaboration with the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social
Protection, MoLRD and decentralised Departments of Social Welfare and Community
Development, and other relevant stakeholders to roll out the Social Welfare Information
Management System in all districts and as well as some relevant services providers (NGOs,
RHCs, etc.).
➢ UNICEF support the roll out of the SWIMS through the provision of coaching, training and
(where necessary) information technology.
The system should include a database for child protection services delivered by multiple agencies,
including those provided by social welfare officers and community development officers, as well as
other first responders, such as DOVVSU, NGOs and other service providers.
For relevant findings see paras 165, 174 - 176.
13.7. Children’s services plans
There was little evidence that districts were aware of the level of need of children within their area or
that they had plans which would enable them to meet that need. Without knowledge of the need for
child protection services, MMDAs are stumbling in the dark when it comes to knowing what services
to make available within their district. Preparing a bi or tri-annual children’s plan would enable MMDAs
to provide more effective and efficient child protection services. In preparing the plan, reference
should be made to the Social Services Directory which covered available services in 260 district areas .
Case management data and records should also be reviewed to help assess the likely demand for
services within their district. This information would assist the district in deciding what services to
provide and to budget accordingly. For instance, the information contained in the Directory and the
demand review would allow the district to determine how many children are likely to be in need of
alternative care over the course of a year and to ensure that they recruit sufficient foster carers to
115
meet that need. It would also enable them to decide where, geographically, preventive services are
most needed to ensure access.
It is recommended that UNICEF consider providing technical assistance to the intervention areas
under Output 1 to draw up a children’s plan before the end of the 2018-2022 Child Protection
Programme to enable effective budgeting.
For relevant findings see paras 67 - 70.
13.8. Social norms
Social norms endorsing violence against children in Ghana are widespread and entrenched, and
changing such attitudes requires ongoing, persistent, community awareness programmes. UNICEF has
succeeded in raising the recognition of child protection concerns amongst government, service
providers and within the population more broadly through a series of innovative communication and
local community programmes under both the 2012-2016 and the 2017 -2020 Child Protection
Programmes. While the KAP study shows a significant improvement over time in attitudes and
practices across a range of issues, such as placement of children in residential care or in boarding
schools, there has been less of a change in attitude as regards the use of corporal punishment and
towards child marriage in rural and less educated communities. It is recommended that UNICEF :
➢ Deliver campaigns messaging in tandem with services to families (social welfare, livelihoods,
access to education, justice etc.) to avoid creating ‘sensitisation fatigue’, and minimise the risk
of negative reactions, resistance and backlash to challenging messaging.
➢ Conduct a ‘gender sensitive analysis’ of its behaviour change campaigns, to consider the
extent to which these programmes are having their intended effects. In some cases
messaging and services designed to protect adolescent girls (for example by discouraging teen
pregnancy or early marriage, or promoting the entry of women and girls into areas of work
previously gendered male) may interact with existing gender norms and power dynamics, to
exacerbate stigma, discrimination and inequalities (e.g. creation of double work burden for
women and girls, further entrenchment of discrimination against pregnant girls, etc.)
For relevant findings see paras 109 - 152.
