EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Overview of the intervention
The IALA programme was set up in 2017 and run until 2020 with funding from the IKEA Foundation (IF) as a
multi-year, multi-country intervention covering three countries – Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan – to improve
the lives of adolescents by increasing their influence over decisions affecting their lives. The programme sought
to empower adolescents and young adults aged between 10 and 19 years, by enhancing their knowledge, improv-
ing their access to information, and supporting their rights to healthier and safer lifestyles. Besides adolescents,
IALA also had interventions directed towards parents of adolescents as well as community and religious leaders,
who were all identified as crucial change agents in creating a suitable environment for engendering the new prac-
tices imparted to adolescents. In Afghanistan, the programme was implemented in all eight districts of the
Bamyan province and in three out of the seven districts of the Badghis province.
The overall objective of the IALA programme was to reduce the harmful traditional practices that adolescents in
Afghanistan are exposed to and empower them as agents of change with the knowledge and confidence to reduce
their exposure to these. IALA had three main goals: 1) reducing child marriage, 2) lowering the incidence of teen-
age pregnancy, and 3) enhancing female educational outcomes in the form of increased secondary school (re)en-
rolment. The programme also encouraged a healthy and creative lifestyle by imparting important life skills to
adolescents and creating a space for them to discuss the topics they consider important for their wellbeing and
overall empowerment. These discussions were facilitated by the creation of the Multipurpose Adolescent Groups
(MAGs), that provided a safe space for adolescents to communicate the barriers and issues afflicting their ability
to participate in making choices that affect their lives. The programme set two outcomes1: 1) that by the end of
the programme, adolescents from two target provinces are able to communicate with each other and policy mak-
ers to share information among peers through various avenues (such as social media forums, mobile technolo-
gies) and traditional methods of communication at the local levels, and at least 52,334 (50% female and 50%
male) adolescents are mobilized as agents of change for themselves and their communities through engaging in
adolescent groups/Shuras; 2) that by the end of the programme, 60,651 religious leaders, elders, parents, and
influential individuals from communities in the 11 districts of the 2 target provinces support adolescents, espe-
cially girls, to access services, participate in decision making, and prevent their exposure to harmful traditional
practices leading to abuse and exploitation.
Objectives and intended audience
This report focuses on examining the theoretical causal chain of the IALA programme and on assessing the pro-
gramme’s performance based on the key criteria of relevance, fidelity, coverage, effectiveness, and sustainability.
The report identifies which aspects of the programme worked well, and outlines good practices, lessons learned,
and recommendations - with the objective of providing evidence of what works and shedding light on what is
required to remove barriers and promote enablers for the successful delivery of similar programmes for the tar-
get groups. Based on the key mechanisms and findings outlined in the report, it is possible to adjust assumptions
and expectations and to reassign levels of effort to activities and outputs.
Since IALA involves many actors, there is a varied audience that can benefit from this report. At the programme-
matic end, Aga Khan Foundation Afghanistan (AKFA) and World Vision Afghanistan (WVA) will benefit from the
insights provided regarding programme implementation, while UNICEF can benefit from insights regarding pro-
gramme design. The report can further inform other institutional and international actors working on child pro-
tection and child rights in Afghanistan and the broader South Asia region, by providing insights and offering op-
erational recommendations for future programming. The report can inform them about the assumptions and
steppingstones that might be similar or require context-specific adaptations, and thereby ensure the design or
implementation of programmes can be successful for the intended objectives.
Evaluation methodology
This summative evaluation of IALA was conducted using a purely qualitative approach. Prior to this, a baseline
study was carried out in 2017, and a follow up midline quantitative impact study was conducted in 2019. The
data collection for IALA Afghanistan’s endline was originally envisaged to be undertaken on a much larger scale,
to answer all research questions relevant for the evaluation. The plan was to increase the sample size by inter-
viewing respondents from additional villages in Bamyan and Badghis (using recall data to perform matching) and
by extending the analysis to Herat and Daikundi, both provinces that were not included in the midline evaluation
(but for which we had baseline data). However, with the COVID-19 pandemic and the active conflict in the country
between the Taliban and the government forces at the time of the evaluation design, the possibility of an extended
data collection became untenable, and it was hence decided that the summative evaluation would rely only on a
qualitative component to address the gaps that midline data were unable to address.

vi
For the current study, semi-structured in-depth interviews (IDIs) with a purposive sample of beneficiaries, com-
munity members, teachers, and trainers were supplemented by key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant
staff and officials. To explore the programme in-depth, insights from both implementing partners (Agha Khan
Foundation, World Vision) and participants were gathered. For programme implementing partners, KIIs and for
beneficiaries IDIs were conducted in both treatment provinces (Bamyan & Badghis). KIIs helped to gather infor-
mation and critical perceptions on programme design and implementation, while the IDIs identified success sto-
ries, changes, challenges, and perceptions about the programme.
The findings from the qualitative data were analysed using Process Tracing (PT) to understand whether the re-
sults of the IALA programme are consistent with its Theory of Change and to see if alternative explanations can
be ruled out. PT is a case-based approach to Causal-Process Observations (CPOs) which enables the examination
of specific cases in greater detail. For this evaluation, a combination of theory-testing PT and explaining-outcome
PT approaches were employed. Theory-testing PT was used to test the validity and assumptions of the Theory of
Change developed in the midline evaluation. Explaining-outcome PT helped to obtain a good understanding of
how the causal mechanisms worked, by breaking down the outcomes into a series of intermediate outcomes and
testing the intervening steps against competing hypotheses, based on the evidence gathered. The PT method
helped the C4ED team determine whether the apparently interlocking components of the IALA programme were
effectively united in a process to produce the final desired outcomes, namely the increased educational, health
and social empowerment of adolescents in the selected Afghani provinces of Badghis and Bamyan.
Key findings
The IALA programme adopted a holistic approach, which was found to have overall engaged the right participants
for adolescent empowerment. The programme adopted a unique content and design by placing adolescents at
the centre of the intervention, while also engaging relevant groups of adults in their target areas (parents, com-
munity and religious leaders). The programme’s contents were found to be relevant to the target groups, both for
adolescents’ contexts and learning needs as well as for parents and leaders. The practical learning style was con-
sidered engaging and useful to both adolescents and communities.
IALA’s implementation faced some challenges in delivering its activities and outputs, with the biggest one being
the COVID-19 pandemic, which halted most programme activities in the last quarter. Various other challenges
emanated both from both the contexts in which the activities were carried out and from design and operational
aspects of the programme. These challenges had tangible effects on implementation and acted as barriers to the
target groups’ full utilization of the programme. One set of challenges was connected to communities’ traditional
social and gender norms and the characteristics of their contexts and practices, which presented difficulties for
engaging adolescents and community members and for sharing the messages from the programme. Such chal-
lenges included: some communities’ resistance to changing views and behaviours towards adolescents’ rights,
particularly at the beginning of the intervention and in more remote and/or rural areas; the need to adapt to a
gender segregated MAG structure in some areas due to socio-cultural traditions; a high proportion of illiteracy,
which called for changes in training design and introduced difficulties to MAG operations; and communities’ live-
lihood conditions, which included child labour, affecting the attendance and participation particularly of vulner-
able adolescents. The challenges connected to the programme’s design and operations included: a limited and
insufficiently systematic engagement of parents and leaders in MAG activities; a potentially insufficient adapta-
tion to some local conditions, including seasonal activities, and the needs of the vulnerable adolescents in the
MAG structure and mentoring; a limited budget for community activities and lacking budget for MAG premises;
and some delays incurred in the implementation of community-level activities (development of action plans in
Badghis).
Regarding Outcome 1 of IALA2, the findings show that adolescents acquired relevant knowledge regarding their
rights and life skills applicable to their lives, and that they were able to communicate with their peers, at most
times with their families and sometimes with community and religious leaders, although communication with
policy makers could not be established. Adolescents acted as agents of change for peers and families in their
communities, campaigning outside the MAGs to promote access to education and the prevention of child mar-
riages. They did this via different means, including peer to peer mentoring, reaching out to the families in their
communities, and sometimes talking to community or religious leaders to help them solve problems. They also
carried out various awareness raising campaigns and other social actions. There is also evidence that the most
effective communication occurred not through the use of technological aids or radio but rather through activities
such as peer-to-peer outreach, door to door and artistic activities.
2 By end of the programme, adolescents from two target provinces are able to communicate with each other and policy makers
through various avenues (such as social media forums, mobile technologies) to share information among peers and traditional
methods of communication at the local levels, and at least 52,334 (50% female and 50% male) adolescents are mobilized as
agents of change for themselves and their communities through engaging in adolescent groups/Shuras.
vii
Regarding Outcome 23, though sensitisation of religious leaders (RL), community leaders (CL), parents, and com-
munities at large took place, there is considerable unevenness in the extent to which the adults in the communi-
ties were reached, and how this translated into their engagement in actions of child protection in line with Out-
come 2. As IALA used Islamic teachings to centre its messaging on child rights to a large extent, it could circumvent
societal resistance. Communities were to a large extent appreciative of the teachings received on children’s rights,
a knowledge that they reported to not have had before. However, it is evident that messages were interpreted
differently by each category of respondents, and that there were different levels of commitment to each set of
messages. There is almost universal appreciation of the importance of education for the future of children, though
most stakeholders acknowledged that economic realities affect a person’s access to education. This is especially
important, as adults’ support for adolescent education is for both boys and girls, but girls are much more affected
by societal norms on education. Child marriage is a topic which shows more variation in the levels of acceptance
by distinct stakeholder groups. There is evidence that some RLs have the view that marriages should only happen
after puberty. However, most RLs considered marriages to be advisable above the age of 18, even though they
could be permissible earlier. Parents tend to have the view that adolescents should only get married after the legal
age, though child marriages occurred or where in some cases prevented by individuals taking part in the pro-
gramme. There is some evidence that spaces have opened up for adolescents, and that they are included in deci-
sion-making; however, parents continue to be the ones taking the final decisions. Early pregnancy was not found
to be very salient among respondents. Those who mentioned it, typically referred to it as one among the many
problems caused by child marriage, which reflects the inextricable links between the social norms of pregnancy
and marriage.
Key conclusions
The findings suggest that the IALA programme has raised awareness of the importance of the rights and protec-
tion of adolescents in the target areas of Afghanistan, both within target communities and among government
counterparts. IALA put adolescents at the centre of the intervention and promoted their empowerment not only
through raising awareness of their rights but also through providing relevant and applicable skills that adoles-
cents could relate to and incorporate to improve their circumstances and contexts. Moreover, IALA brought about
a practical approach to teaching and learning which was instructional in terms of teaching contents and teaching
practices; adolescents’ learning experience was boosted first-hand by giving them a key role in the MAG structure
and organisation and by becoming peer educators from the get-go. MAG’s practical approach, which was different
from school, was considered complementary, useful, highly valued, and something that adolescents had not seen
before. Thus, IALA’s teaching contents and styles were both new and relevant to their target population.
Even though IALA’s activities seem to have raised the awareness of communities about children’s rights, espe-
cially considering that these were mostly new topics for the community members, not all have embraced these
ideas. With the sudden and still ongoing political transition since the take-over of political power by the Taliban
in August 2021, many of these gains are threatened. For example, there are indications that despite the greater
awareness of the importance of education within the population, access to education has become impossible or
much more challenging with the closure of schools and the increased exclusion of girls from schools. Moreover,
an increase in child marriages of girls was identified as a potential danger under the new Taliban administration.
Key recommendations
➢ Consider the target groups’ economic realities in programme design.
➢ Explore potential linkages with government actors and the private sector for supporting options of set-
ting up more higher learning courses, TVET classes, or alternative approaches, such as livelihood train-
ing accessible for girls, to address barriers to female empowerment
➢ Strengthen trainers’ preparation for teaching illiterate children and mixed groups, including disabled
children.
➢ Ensure systematic engagement of key adults, particularly parents, through targeted activities/educa-
tional programmes.
➢ Plan for enhancements to training and cascade learning through longer-term, spaced out, and varied
incorporation of contents and inclusion of adolescents in design, to boost their engagement.
➢ Establish closer programme monitoring by UNICEF with centralised oversight of monitoring data.
➢ Reconsider the channels used for messaging.
➢ Provide a specific budget for MAG premises and plan for an increase of budgeting for community activi-
ties.
➢ Plan for programme continuation and expansion to neighbouring villages.
3 By end of the programme, 60,651 religious leaders, elders, parents, and influential individuals from the community in the 11
districts of the 2 target provinces support adolescents, especially girls, to access services, participate in decision making, and
prevent their exposure to harmful traditional practices leading to abuse and exploitation.

1 BACKGROUND
1.1 COUNTRY CONTEXT
Afghanistan is a mountainous and landlocked country of about 39 million inhabitants (2020), most of whom live
in tribal and kinship communities in rural areas (World Population Review, 2022). The country’s decades-long
armed conflicts coupled with deeply ingrained harmful traditional practices, such as child marriage, has had se-
vere emotional and health consequences for women and children (Li et al., 2018).
As of 2021, Afghanistan entered the early dividend stage of the demographic transition with a steady decrease in
birth rates and an increase in the working age population, resulting in an economic window of opportunity. To
seize this opportunity, it is crucial that Afghanistan makes the necessary investments to anticipate the ‘adolescent
bulge’ entering the labour market in the coming years. Adolescents currently constitute 26% of the population
(UNICEF ROSA, 2019). However, the country’s growing adolescent population is prone to many risks, as they have
suffered from years of violence, abuse, and harmful traditional practices that affect their lives. To take the example
of exclusion from education, factors such as being female, social norms, and child marriage, as well as traditional
and religious beliefs are responsible for keeping adolescents – especially girls – out of school. Evidently, exclusion
from education has profound impacts on adolescents and, when coupled with pre-existing socioeconomic chal-
lenges, gives rise to child labour and early marriage (UNICEF, 2021). The situation for this vulnerable segment of
the population is further exacerbated by both the Covid-19 pandemic and the recent regime change in Afghani-
stan (UNICEF, 2022).
Although marrying off children under the age of 15 is illegal in Afghanistan, it is a common practice, particularly
in rural areas. For the period 2005-2019, the rate of child marriage by the age of 18 was at 28%4. Poverty, strong
patriarchal values, and poor access to education all drive child marriage in Afghanistan. According to UNICEF data
for 2017, the adolescent birth rate was 62 per 1000 girls aged 15-19, which can be seen as a consequence of early
child marriage and of lacking or limited access to reproductive health services5. Child marriages usually serve to
strengthen ties with rival families and ethnic groups, as part of deals, or to settle debts and disputes. Poor families
often end up selling daughters for large dowries from wealthy people, and the husbands are usually much older.
The decisions to sell off girls for marriage are made by men, while wives, mothers, sisters and the girls themselves
have little or no say. Furthermore, a quarter of women suffering from obstetric fistula, which can condemn women
to ill-health and ostracism, were below the age of 16 when they married (UNFPA Afghanistan, 2021).
As of August 2021, Taliban assumed national political power in Afghanistan, and the new political developments
have pushed the country into economic crisis with immediate repercussions across an economy already facing
daunting development challenges (World Bank, 2021). Leadership transitions and implications for basic services
and financial systems have brought further turmoil to a country that has experienced four decades of prolonged
conflict, recurrent natural disasters, chronic poverty, and disease outbreaks, including COVID-19 (UNICEF, 2022).
It is estimated that about 24 million people – of which about 12 million are children – are in need for humanitarian
assistance (ibid.). Moreover, the recent political transition has consequences for vulnerable populations in the
country, especially women and children, with UNICEF (2021) reporting a rise in child marriage due to the political
and economic situation.
The IALA programme was developed to be implemented in two provinces of Afghanistan: Bamyan and Badghis.
Bamyan is in the centre of Afghanistan, with a population of 368.395 people, 190.310 of which are males and
178,085 of which are females (2011). During the same period, half the population was 16 years old or younger.
Bamyan scored higher than the national average on literacy rates (38.1%) in the population aged 10 years and
above, with the male and female literacy rates being 50% and 25%, respectively. Around 5% of the population of
Bamyan aged 5 years or older suffered from at least one functional difficulty (Bamyan Socio-Demographic and
Economic Survey, 2011). In 2018, the rate of child marriage in Bamyan rested at 31% (UNICEF, 2018).
Badghis is located in the western part of Afghanistan, bordering Faryab, Ghor, and Herat provinces, and Turk-
menistan, with a population of 499.393 people, 254.854 of which are males and 244.539 are females. Only around
3% of the provincial population is urban, while 97% live in rural areas. Badghis has a literacy rate of only 11%,
with the male and female literacy rates being 14% and 7%, respectively (Provincial Development Plan: Badghis
Provincial Profile, 2010). Notably, Badghis is among the provinces with the highest rate (55%) of child marriage
(UNICEF, 2018).
Afghanistan ratified the Convention of the Rights of the Child in 1994 and is committed to protecting the right to
life and education of every child. Respecting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is enshrined in its Consti-
tution. Furthermore, Article 43 sets forth the right of all citizens to a free education up to the B.A. level (Islamic
Republic of Afghanistan 1/26/2004). Since 2001, education has been a priority area of action for the government
and is managed by the Ministry of Education (MoE), the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE), and religious

organisations. In 2005, strengthening early childhood care, providing children with a free and compulsory pri-
mary education, achieving gender parity and equality, and improving the quality of education were on the politi-
cal agenda as part of the Education for All agreement (MoE, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, UNICEF, USAID and
Samuel Hall 2018). This measure was completed by the first National Education Strategic Plan (NESP) in 2006
and the Education law in 2008 in order to improve access and quality education, and to turn education into a
driver of the economic and social recovery of the country (MoE, UNICEF, USAID and Samuel Hall 2018). As part
of the third NESP (2017-2021), the MoE outlined a new working framework with civil society, the private sector,
and NGOs, recognising the vital role played by parents and communities in the promotion of education. In addition
to the public-school system, the MoE is also working with partners on alternative school modalities to address
gaps in education. Policy guidelines for Community-Based Education (CBE) were developed in 2008 and updated
in 2012 and 2018 to facilitate the cooperation between both formal and informal systems (Islamic Republic of
Afghanistan, Ministry of Education 2018). This strategy falls in line with the government’s goal to provide each
Afghan child with a holistic and inclusive education, and to bring out-of-school children (back) to school.
The IALA programme was closely related to and contributed to these efforts. It directly addressed a number of
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (see Section 1.2). With an SDG Index Score of 53.9, Afghanistan is ranked
137 out of 165 countries (Sachs et al. 2021). Afghanistan integrated the SDGs into its national development plan
(ANPDF I+II) and made slight progress, for example with regard to SDG 4 (education). Yet, the COVID-19 pan-
demic, and in particular the political transition to the Taliban administration in 2021 represent a massive setback,
the precise effects of which remain to be seen.
1.2 PROGRAMME SUMMARY
The IALA programme was set up in 2017 and run until 2020 with funding from the IKEA Foundation (IF) as a
multi-year, multi-country intervention covering three countries - Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan - to improve
the lives of adolescents by increasing their influence over decisions affecting their lives. The programme sought
to empower adolescents and young adults aged between 10 and 19 years, by enhancing their knowledge, improv-
ing their access to information, and supporting their rights to healthier and safer lifestyles. Besides adolescents,
IALA also had interventions directed towards parents of adolescents as well as community and religious leaders,
who were all identified as crucial change agents in creating a suitable environment for engendering the new prac-
tices imparted to adolescents.
In Afghanistan, the programme was implemented in all eight districts of the Bamyan province and in three out of
the seven districts of the Badghis province. The majority of the programme-supported communities are rural and
remote, where adolescents often drop out of school or do not enrol due to local traditions and attitudes towards
education, especially towards adolescent girls, and due to the distances from educational infrastructures, result-
ing in high illiteracy rates and early marriage6.
The overall objective of the IALA programme was to reduce the harmful traditional practices that adolescents in
Afghanistan are exposed to and empower them as agents of change with the knowledge and confidence to reduce
their exposure to these. IALA had three main goals: 1) reducing child marriage, 2) lowering the incidence of teen-
age pregnancy, and 3) enhancing female educational outcomes in the form of increased secondary school (re)en-
rolment. The programme also encouraged a healthy and creative lifestyle by imparting important life skills to
adolescents and creating a space for them to discuss the topics they consider important for their wellbeing and
overall empowerment.
In alignment with the programme’s theory of change, the programme engaged three “pillars,” each of which had
a role in increasing the self-efficacy of adolescents, especially girls:
I. Adolescents, organized into groups as change agents; knowledgeable about their rights and entitle-
ments; participating in forums and discussions;
II. Families, communities and decision makers as knowledgeable protectors of adolescents from rights
abuses; and
III. Public authorities equipped with skills and able to provide services, as upholders of adolescents’ rights.

The IALA programme set out two outcomes7:
• Outcome 1: By end of the programme, adolescents from two target provinces are able to communicate
with each other and policy makers through various avenues (such as social media forums, mobile tech-
nologies) to share information among peers and traditional methods of communication at the local levels
and at least 52,334 (50% female and 50% male) adolescents are mobilized as agents of change for them-
selves and their communities through engaging in adolescent groups/Shuras.
• Outcome 2: By end of the programme, 60,651 religious leaders, elders, parents, and influential individ-
uals from the community in the 11 districts of the 2 target provinces support adolescents, especially girls,
to access services, participate in decision making, and prevent their exposure to harmful traditional prac-
tices leading to abuse and exploitation.
In order to achieve these outcomes, the key programme interventions developed by IALA were:
1. Providing life skills training and information about rights & entitlements via radio programmes to ado-
lescents organised through their in-person participation in Multi-purpose Adolescent Groups (MAGs) and
via radio programmes.
2. Conducting community trainings with influential community members such as community leaders, reli-
gious leaders, parents of adolescents on topics related to child rights, gender equality, adolescent em-
powerment, protection from violence including preventing early marriage and promoting girls’ educa-
tion.
3. Working with governmental/non-governmental entities to enhance the quality of service provision for
hard-to-reach adolescents and improve educational outcomes via accelerated learning modalities.
IALA directly targets, through the interventions, three key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through the
Multi-purpose Adolescent Groups (MAGs) and its umbrella of activities, it sought to promote health and well-
being (SDG 3) by addressing issues of reproductive health and harmful traditional practices (HTPs). Through the
MAGs and community-level activities encouraging school enrolment and contributing to literacy, and the support
of Accelerated Learning Centres (ALCs), the programme contributed to ensuring equitable access to education
and promoting learning opportunities (SDG 4). The programme also aimed to directly promote gender equality
(SDG 5) by adopting a gender approach throughout programme design and implementation – targeting girls’ par-
ticipation and addressing key impediments to girls’ equality - especially with regards to child marriage, early
pregnancy, and access to education. The programme also indirectly targeted poverty reduction (SDG 1) through
providing education opportunities and advocating against illiteracy as avenues of potential in reducing social and
economic inequalities (SGD 10).

For the implementation of IALA, UNICEF ACO engaged with the Consortium Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) and
World Vision Association (WVA) as implementing partners, as well as with the following governmental entities:
the MoE, the Ministry of Haj and Religious Affairs (MoHRA), the MoIC, the MoLSA, the Ministry of Women’s Affairs
(MoWA), and the Afghanistan Education Production Organisation (AEPO), with financial support from the IKEA
Foundation. The total programme budget amounted to 759,150 USD, with 642,000 USD contributed by UNICEF8.
Figure 2: Stakeholder Map
Adolescents aged between 10 and 19 years were the
main target group and beneficiaries of the intervention. A
total of 176 MAGs were established through the IALA pro-
gramme, 144 in Bamyan and 32 in Badghis. A total of
3,665 adolescents (1,702 male and 1,963 female) joined
the MAGs, with 66% in-school (including ALC) and 34%
out-of-school children (IALA Final Report, UNICEF
2021b).
The intervention also targeted parents, community and
religious leaders as key influencers to foster an enabling
environment for the adolescents. It engaged 35,970 influ-
ential community leaders, comprising community elders,
Community Development Council (CDCs) members, and
Child Protection Action Network (CPAN) members,
through training and mentoring on child rights, gender,
and the importance of girls’ education; carried out follow-
up monitoring of 166 religious leaders trained on child
rights in Islam by UNICEF and the Department of Haj and
Religious Affairs (DoHRA); and conducted 176 community discussions with parents, families, and other commu-
nity members to raise awareness on harmful traditional practices, with the development of 176 action plans to
prevent and address them at community level.
Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) and World Vision Afghanistan (WVA) were UNICEF’s implementing partners in
Bamyan and Badghis respectively. AKF led the development of the programme’s life-skills training package in
coordination with WVA and delivered the Training of Trainers for both districts, while WVA led the development
of the Community Discussions training package that was tested during the first Training of Trainers conducted
by WVA.
The Afghanistan Education Production Organisation (AEPO) supported IALA activities through several inter-
ventions in Bamyan and Badghis. AEPO produced a total of 890 (445 Dari / 445 Pashto) radio scenes of the New
Home New Life drama and broadcasted a variety of storylines; produced and broadcasted a total of 26 (13 Dari /
13 Pashto) radio educational feature programmes nationwide (including in Bamyan and Badghis); was in charge
of publications of the New Home New Life Magazine and AEPO Wall Calendars with education messages; devel-
oped the training package for self-expression through short story development and writing for adolescents and
conducted Training of Trainers; carried out training of adolescents on how to participate in radio debates; and
arranged live radio debates.
UNICEF and the MoHRA conducted the training on Child Rights in Islam with Mullahs (religious leaders) in the
two IALA provinces, while the MoE was in charge of Accelerated Learning Centres (ALCs), for which UNICEF pro-
vided technical and financial support. The Ministry of Women’s Affairs (MWA) and the Ministry of Information
and Culture (MoIC) were also involved, as they launched a National Action Plan to Eliminate Child Marriage to-
gether with United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Afghanistan in 2018, which aimed at improving the imple-
mentation of supportive laws and services (MoLSA and UNICEF 2018).
1.3 EVALUATION BACKGROUND
The present evaluation constitutes the qualitative summative evaluation of the IALA programme implemented in
Afghanistan. It seeks to build on and provide a more nuanced perspective to the quantitative results of the midline
evaluation conducted in 2019, thus enabling the assessment of the intervention as a whole.
The evaluation used a qualitative approach which focused on understanding the underlying mechanisms that
have led to the results of the quantitative midline evaluation and to assess the programme’s performance based
on the key criteria of relevance, fidelity, coverage, effectiveness, and sustainability. The focus has been on under-
standing the mechanisms that led to results, identifying key barriers and impediments, and outlining lessons

learned and best practices for the achievement of outcomes. The evaluation also offers insights for cross-country
comparison and learning for the summative evaluation of the three-country intervention.
The qualitative summative evaluation was conducted by C4ED between October 2021 and January 2022. 90 indi-
vidual data collection sessions were carried out in 10 villages of the target provinces (five in Bamyan and Badghis,
respectively). The sessions consisted of in-depth interviews (IDIs) with direct beneficiaries, teachers, and train-
ers, and key informant interviews (KIIs) with core NGO and UNICEF staff. The fieldwork was conducted through
C4ED’s local partner, Almansoora Solutions Ltd., and took place between December 2021 and January 2022.
The evaluation took place during a particularly challenging and insecure period for Afghanistan, following the
Taliban regime takeover in August 2021. It was marked by high unpredictability of the processes surrounding the
transition, newly imposed guidelines and restrictions across the country (e.g., school closures, stay-at-home or-
ders for women), and a deteriorating economic situation, derived from both the internal instability and external
economic pressures. There were high levels of violence reported in parts of the country, internal displacement,
and migration of Afghanis to neighbouring countries. These circumstances deeply affected programme partici-
pants in the target provinces and required replanning of the evaluation exercise on several occasions.
The evaluation team discussed the design, methodology, and data collection strategies with UNICEF, ACO, and
ROSA staff to ensure that requirements were met from a methodological perspective and kept them informed
about emerging data challenges that needed to be circumvented. UNICEF regional offices and the implementing
NGOs AKF and WVA were involved in consultations regarding fieldwork possibilities and the gathering of contex-
tual information, stakeholder engagement, and the types of respondents to be selected for interviews. They also
had a consultative role in refining the selection of villages from the list provided by the evaluation team based on
the midline evaluation. UNICEF regional offices, AKF, and WVA were also involved in field facilitation of the eval-
uation team, the provision of monitoring data, and support in replacing respondents when these were unavailable
or unwilling to take part. Governmental partners were not included in the evaluation as a result of the conflict-
situation and the institutional uncertainty at the time of the study. Unclear links between UNICEF and govern-
mental offices due to the circumstances surrounding the political transition during this period was an element of
further uncertainty for the team’s mobilisation in the field. This was partially mitigated by the availability of the
regional UNICEF offices’ staff and the implementing NGOs’ teams, offering support to the evaluation team during
fieldwork, as well as by our local partner’s knowledge and understanding of the areas where data collection took
place.
As a result of the complexity and uncertainty of the context, the evaluation underwent several design and data
collection changes and adjustments in consultation with UNICEF and the implementing partners AKF and WVA
to ensure that fieldwork could proceed without placing risks on neither respondents nor the evaluation team.
One of these adjustments was the elimination of any form of group data collection session (focus group discus-
sions), to increase respondents’ privacy and safety. Furthermore, locations were selected by finding a balance
between heterogeneity, accessibility, and security of access.
The identification of participants for interviews was also a highly complex task in this context, requiring the ad-
justment of strategies. The displacement of programme participants particularly in Bamyan, the lack of connec-
tivity in some target areas, and the refusal of some participants to take part in the evaluation due to the context
of insecurity meant that the team had to find replacements for several respondents in different categories, in
coordination with the implementing partners. This resulted in a more complex and longer fieldwork than fore-
seen. An additional difficulty was the evaluation team’s lack of access to systematic monitoring data on the inter-
ventions per each selected village.
In consideration of all the above-mentioned circumstances, methodological and data collection compromises had
to be made with regard to locations, methods, and modalities of access to respondents to ensure that fieldwork
could be completed with minimal setbacks. Despite this, the evaluation team managed to complete the 90 inter-
view sessions foreseen in the revised plan and to incorporate the perspectives of a wide variety of stakeholders
who took part in the programme, including direct beneficiaries (adolescents, parents, community, and religious
leaders), trainers, teachers, and core staff from the implementing partners.
Implementing partners were consulted on rights holders prior to the evaluation launch to ensure that the ap-
proach taken would account for their needs, rights, and challenging contexts. Rights holders were directly in-
volved, firstly in the piloting exercise of the evaluation, which was conducted to ensure that the tools designed
were relevant and appropriate from a rights-based approach, methodologically sound, and catered to the target
groups and their contexts. Secondly, rights holders were involved as key participants in the data collection exer-
cise, which sought to engage and involve them to effectively capture and understand their perspectives and view-
points. This was done by way of in-depth interviews with open-ended questions and semi-structured guides
which allowed for exploring emerging topics as well as themes of interest and relevance to interviewees. It should
be noted that the evaluation had a primary concern in ensuring that the various perspectives of rights holders (as
well as of duty bearers) would be contemplated in data collection and analysis, which is why the evaluation in-
cluded a wide range of stakeholders to be interviewed. These perspectives were incorporated into the qualitative
content analysis, together with concerns, best practices, and recommendations offered by both rights holders and
duty bearers. Participants more directly involved in programme implementation (adolescents, mentors, and
5
programme staff) were also the ones who more actively offered their knowledge on lessons learned and perspec-
tives on how to make things better in the future in accordance with their needs and contexts.
2 EVALUATION PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES, AND SCOPE
2.1 EVALUATION PURPOSE
The main purpose of the summative evaluation was to gather evidence that will inform, firstly, the UNICEF coun-
try office and the implementing partners AKF and WVA on the programme results. The report identifies which
aspects of the programme worked well and outlines good practices, lessons learnt, and recommendations, with
the objective of providing evidence of what works and shedding light on what is required to remove barriers and
promote enablers for the successful delivery of similar programmes for the target groups. Based on the key mech-
anisms and findings outlined in the report, it is possible to adjust assumptions and expectations and to reassign
the levels of effort to activities and outputs.
Furthermore, the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the evaluation will be used to improve program-
ming for adolescents and scale up similar programmes in other provinces, if possible. They will also feed into
efforts at the level of the UNICEF Regional Office for South Asia (ROSA) to compile lessons learnt across the three
countries that are part of the broader multi-country initiative.
By providing evidence of what works and offering operational recommendations for future programming, the
report can further inform other governmental and non-governmental organisations in Afghanistan working in
the fields of education, child protection, and children’s rights, as well as international actors active in these fields
in the country and the broader South Asia region. The report can help inform the reader about the assumptions
and steppingstones that might be similar or require context-specific adaptations and thereby ensure the design
or implementation of programmes can be successful for the intended objectives.
The summative evaluation’s goal was to understand the underlying mechanisms that led to the results of the
quantitative midline evaluation and to assess the programme’s performance based on the key criteria of rele-
vance, fidelity, coverage, effectiveness, and sustainability. The evaluation used a qualitative approach, which was
underpinned by, and extended, the overarching Theory of Change (hereinafter ToC) for the IALA programme
elaborated in the midline evaluation report. The focus was placed on understanding the mechanisms that led to
results, identifying key barriers and impediments, and outlining lessons learnt, successes, and best practices for
the achievement of outcomes and for future programming.
The evaluation results are expected to contribute to the strengthening of child protection and child rights’ pro-
gramming in Afghanistan by providing evidence of what works and recommendations on what can be improved
to enhance the target group’s knowledge and access to information and to support their rights to healthier and
safer lifestyles. The study recognizes children’s agency, resilience, and capacities in determining what decisions
will meet their best interests, whilst contributing to an evidence base to support the work of institutional and
international actors in the field.
2.2 EVALUATION OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE
The following core objectives guided this evaluation of IALA:
• Assess the suitability of the programme approach to the local context and in meeting the priority needs
of adolescents in the programme areas (relevance).
• Assess the adherence of programme implementation to design and identify the underlying reasons for
any divergence in implementation across programme sites (fidelity/coherence).
• Measure availability, accessibility, and uptake of programme interventions by intended beneficiaries
and clarify any differences across key beneficiary groups (coverage).
• Identify and document successes, challenges, and gaps in the IALA programme in Afghanistan and pro-
vide recommendations to guide better design and implementation of similar interventions in the future
(effectiveness).
• Identify which programme interventions have taken root and continued to proliferate in beneficiary
communities after the end of the programme’s lifespan if any, and why communities have continued
their engagement in these interventions but not others (sustainability).
Relevance: The study focuses on the analysis on how the programme was designed and to what extent the needs
of the target groups were met, and how the specificity of their contexts was understood and addressed.
Fidelity/Coherence: The study analyses the extent to which the programme was implemented as designed and
explores the reasons for divergencies.
6
Effectiveness: The study identifies what worked and what did not work in the interventions delivered and what
factors explain differences in the effectiveness of programme interventions, capturing best practices and lessons
learnt in the process, and exploring the mechanisms through which results were produced.
Coverage: The dimension of coverage in this qualitative study focuses on how target groups were identified and
engaged, to what extent the programme’s interventions were rendered accessible and available to them, and how
the uptake of interventions was perceived by the target groups and other key stakeholders. It does not seek to
provide answers on overall programme coverage in terms of statistically valid representativeness.
Sustainability: The study seeks to explore if programme initiatives have persisted through time and after the
programme’s end, if observed changes in the target groups and at community levels have been maintained or
discontinued, and what overall lasting impacts the programme has had on the target groups.
The summative evaluation focused on providing a nuanced understanding of the results of the midline evaluation
and on examining the Theory of Change (ToC) in connection with IALA’s two outcomes, linked to Pillars I (ado-
lescents) and II (stakeholders) of the programme results’ framework. Pillar III (service providers) was not a focus
of the evaluation. The scope of the evaluation agreed upon by the C4ED and UNICEF allowed for an analysis of
two main aspects:
I. Stakeholders’ views of the IALA programme’s implementation, and
II. IALA’s contribution to enhance adolescents’ empowerment.
Aiming to document and analyse the IALA programme in a comprehensive way, the evaluation covered a breadth
of aspects, from programme design and implementation processes and their suitability to local contexts, to
achievements, challenges, and varying perceptions about the intervention. It focused on three key aspects (pro-
gramme implementation, adolescent empowerment, and programme theory validation) across five key evalua-
tion criteria: relevance, fidelity/coherence, coverage, effectiveness, and sustainability (see Annex 2).
Questions about programme implementation covered issues such as the adaptation of MAGs to the local context
and adolescents’ priorities; challenges to implementation as it was planned; delays, uniformity, and divergence
that occurred during implementation; success of beneficiaries’ mobilisation strategies; effectiveness of partner-
ships with stakeholders; and successes and challenges of the programme’s sustainability components.
With regard to programme outcomes, and particularly IALA’s contribution to adolescent empowerment, the eval-
uation collected data from all involved stakeholders, with an emphasis on incorporating youths’ perspectives and
providing an account of their perceptions of change. Some of the aspects that the evaluation team aimed to expand
understanding on were: adolescents’ experience with and learning outcomes from the MAGs; how adolescent
participation and the interaction of boys and girls shaped the MAGs; to what extent the programme aligned to the
youth’s needs, contexts and requests; if and how the programme included vulnerable groups of children and what
challenges this posed; and how and why the effectiveness of the MAGs varied in different contexts and over time.
The scope of the evaluation was considerably affected by the difficult political, security, and seasonal conditions
in Afghanistan. The political transition in the country, and the resulting poor security situation throughout this
period created severe challenges for data collection, postponing field research on two occasions and requiring
methodological changes.
The insecure situation required significant changes in sampling and data collection approaches. Firstly, no group
sessions were conducted as part of the evaluation to ensure participants’ availability, privacy, and security. It
should be noted that group sessions would have been particularly valuable for gathering data on community-
level interventions; however, given the circumstances, they were substituted by an increased number of individ-
ual interviews. Secondly, migration, displacement, and heightened insecurity meant that many respondents were
unavailable, which affected the sampling strategy, particularly in areas of Bamyan, and made it necessary to re-
place respondents on various occasions. Thirdly, fieldwork had to be postponed on two occasions, and by the time
the security conditions had improved to the point where data collection was feasible, there was only a short time
to carry it out before winter set in. Thus, both the security situation and weather challenges required a sampling
strategy that a) minimised travel between data collection sites and b) reduced the time needed for data collection.
As a result, data collection locations were selected, to a large extent based on the following criteria: i) villages
with a higher number of MAG members (and therefore a larger number of potential respondents), ii) security
considerations, and iii) access and logistical convenience. Therefore, the sample was biased towards more central
locations with stronger participation, and thus the evaluation is not well suited to address questions of poor cov-
erage or the failure of interventions due to inadequate implementation. It should be noted, however, that this
issue was partially adjusted for by the fact that the unavailability of adolescents and mentors in some areas meant
that the evaluation team in fact had to travel to further away locations to locate and interview respondents. Nev-
ertheless, limitations of coverage of villages with lower levels of participation should be kept in mind and have
been considered in the analysis of findings.

3 EVALUATION DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
3.1 EVALUATION APPROACH
The evaluation adopted a Process Tracing (PT) approach to analyse whether changes expected to be related to
the IALA programme occurred and whether they were in line with its Theory of Change.
PT is a case-based approach using Causal-Process Observations (CPOs), which enables the examination of specific
cases in great detail (Beach and Pedersen, 2013). It is arguably the most important tool of causal inference in
qualitative and case study research (George and Bennett, 2005) and the most useful to meet the requirements
agreed by UNICEF and C4ED. PT, as used in this study, seeks to substantiate the existence of and to provide insight
into the scope and operation of causal mechanisms between the intervention and observed changes. In other
words, the approach helped to determine if, how, and why causal mechanisms embedded in the ToC have oc-
curred and what (expected and unexpected) effects they have had. To this end, the research team compared the
assumptions underlying the programme with the quantitative findings of the midline evaluation and the qualita-
tive evidence obtained at endline. It identified intermediate outcomes and tested the processes leading to them
against competing hypotheses (alternative explanations), based on the empirical evidence gathered. These tests
helped to establish if and when: (1) a specific process took place, (2) a different process occurred after the initial
event, and (3) whether the former was a cause of the latter (Mahoney, 2012). It is important to note that just like
most theory-based evaluation approaches, process tracing cannot conclusively establish causality unlike what is
possible with experimental and quasi-experimental evaluations. However, it can infer the presence of plausible
causal “mechanisms” and thus is very useful in theory-based evaluations.
According to Beach & Pedersen (2019, p. 11-12), PT can have three distinct research purposes: “testing whether
a causal mechanism is present in a case” (theory-testing PT), “building a theoretical mechanism” (theory-building
PT), and “crafting an explanation that accounts for a particular outcome” (explaining-outcome PT). The case-cen-
tric design of this study, focused on gaining comprehensive in-depth insight into the IALA programme, combined
the first and the third variants: theory-testing and explaining-outcome PT. The application of these two PT vari-
ants in this evaluation is further described at the beginning of Sections 4 and 5.
Theory-testing PT was used to test the validity and assumptions of the Theory of Change developed in the midline
evaluation and to analyse whether the respective causal mechanisms expected to lead to particular outcomes
were present and occurred as assumed. Explaining-outcome PT helped to obtain a good understanding of how
these mechanisms worked and was used to compare the evidence for several competing explanations and to
identify the ones that were most robustly supported by evidence. The problem of attribution is addressed in the
PT approach by carrying out “process induction” where a number of (competing) hypotheses that connect an
intervention to an outcome through a “chain” of causal mechanisms and intervening steps is identified (White
and Philips 2012). Each of these hypotheses is then examined against the evidence, which can then eliminate,
confirm, strengthen or weaken a particular hypothesis. By examining the entire series/chain of intervening
“links” against the evidence, we come to the series of linked hypotheses, which connects the intervention to the
outcome (Befani and Stedman-Bryce 2017).
The combination of both variants of PT, together with a broad empirical exploration of programme-related pro-
cesses and outcomes, gave the evaluation an open-ended, inductive character. Accordingly, the empirical evi-
dence, presented in Section 4, provided a comprehensive understanding of the intervention and the basis for
identifying, refining, and testing meaningful alternative hypotheses about causal mechanisms, presented in Sec-
tion 5. A narrow theory-testing exercise on its own, without a more open-ended exploration of processes and
outcomes, would pose the danger of missing important aspects that are crucial to understand how the interven-
tion was implemented and what it achieved in what way in the local contexts.
We found the combination of theory-testing and explaining-outcome PT with an open-ended empirical explora-
tion of processes and outcomes particularly suitable for the case of the IALA intervention that broke new ground
in targeting adolescents in Afghanistan. The approach supported our aim of covering all relevant factors and pro-
cesses contributing to, shaping, or preventing changes and outcomes. It helped to determine whether and how
the apparently interlocking components of the IALA programme were effectively united in a process to produce
the final desired outcome, namely the increased educational, health and social empowerment of adolescents.
Two main kinds of empirical tests were used as part of our PT approach. In PT literature, they are known as hoop
tests and smoking gun tests (Schmitt and Beach, 2015). A hoop test proposes that a given piece of evidence – a
CPO – must be present for a hypothesis to be valid. Failing a hoop test eliminates a hypothesis but passing a hoop
test does not confirm a hypothesis. Smoking gun tests, by contrast, propose that if a given CPO is present, the
hypothesis must be valid. Passing a smoking gun test lends decisive support in favour of a hypothesis, though
failing a smoking gun test does not eliminate a hypothesis (Mahoney, 2012). Hoop tests and smoking gun tests
were used in the IALA end-line evaluation to assess hypotheses. More specifically, departing from the existing
ToC and the findings of the midline quantitative evaluation, it was analysed (1) which activities, processes, and
changes have occurred during the duration of the programme’s implementation and (2) what CPOs influenced
the observed programme’s results and through which mechanisms. The theory testing variant PT is applied to
8
analysing findings listed in Section 4, structured by the five key evaluation criteria (relevance, fidelity/coherence,
coverage, effectiveness and sustainability). Explaining outcome PT as, presented in Section 5, seeks to establish
causal chains among events, processes, and explanations for changes that are believed to have occurred during
the programme.
3.2 THEORY OF CHANGE
In order to paint a clear picture of the ways IALA was meant to achieve its goals and to compare this with the
empirical evidence, it was vital to create a theoretical causal chain. This allowed us to structurally think about the
programme and highlights the channels through which it aimed to achieve impact. It also identified all assump-
tions that needed to hold for the causal chain to succeed and the possible difficulties in the fulfilment of these
assumptions.
The Theory of Change (ToC) that was tested using PT (see Section 3.1) is largely based on a theoretical results
chain elaborated in the midline report, which in turn built upon the programme ToC created by the UNICEF-IKEA
foundation during the design of the whole South Asian Programme for Improving Adolescents’ Lives. However,
as noted above, the ToC in this report does not cover the third pillar of the IALA programme, service providers.
Two of the building blocks of this ToC, i.e., the goals and outcomes, are stemming from the Afghanistan version of
the ToC prepared by UNICEF. Besides the goals and outcomes, we also used another building block – the outputs
– as defined in the IKEA-AFG ToC, although these are slightly blurred between outcomes and outputs. To support
our efforts of drafting an informed theoretical chain of results, we also examined literature on the targeted out-
comes and their mediators, as well as on the experiences with similar programmes and interventions in other
countries.

Stith et al. (2006) identified several assumptions which could be considered to generally apply to community-
based interventions. Firstly, a community must be ready to implement a programme, i.e., there should be enough
capacity, and the community must recognise that the problem exists, and the current measures taken – if any –
are not sufficient to cope with it. Accordingly, it is assumed that when adolescents are communicating their prob-
lems to authorities, they indeed identify early marriage, pregnancy, and school dropout as relevant. A survey of
adolescents’ major challenges in Afghanistan by Blum et. al. (2019) suggests that adolescents indeed find access
to education important. However, it is commonly valued more for boys than for girls. Survey respondents also
considered early marriage a significant barrier to schooling. This is in line with the report from the Asia Founda-
tion (2018), which identified illiteracy and lack of education opportunities as major challenges in reducing child
marriage.
Secondly, “partnerships” between key community stakeholders should exist in the communities. These can in-
clude a wide range of groups (i.e., not only the most influential ones), and are characterised by mutual trust. Fur-
thermore, a programme should fit to the previously identified needs and preferences of the community members.
Thus, the community and the relevant authorities should act and react adequately with the aim to alleviate the
challenges raised by adolescents.
Another assumption described by Stith et al. (2006) is that a programme is delivered according to its design: one
way to achieve balance between necessary adaptations to the context and population, and programme fidelity, is
to define the core components of the intervention. Programme implementation should largely be in line with the
design along those core components. Moreover, the required resources and supervision should be calculated and
clearly outlined for each stage of the implementation.
Taking into account the delicate situation of Afghanistan, it is important that the interventions are approved by
governmental (and non-governmental) entities, so that the process of change in social values does not result in
an adverse situation for those involved, even more so if these are life threatening. Moreover, as a general assump-
tion for any programme involving children, adolescents must have their parents’ support and acknowledgement
to (regularly) take part in the MAGs or life-skills training, which might be especially difficult for girls. Stith et al.
(2006) also indicate that all sections of the population – including the vulnerable ones – should be able to actively
take part in the meetings and other activities, so that not only the opinions of the most influential groups (e.g.,
wealthier or elder males) determine the course of action.
Thirdly, traditional practices in the intervention area must also be accounted for. This applies, for instance, to
Ailaq herding in Bamyan, which requires adolescents to leave the village for periods of time. Thus, it is assumed
that these “gaps” do not threaten the achievement of learning outcomes to be achieved by the programme. Finally,
it is important that the cascade method for knowledge dissemination is generally feasible, i.e., adolescents can not
only safely move outside of their residence in the village, but also know a differing set of people whom they can
approach.
Building on the empirical findings presented in Section 4, Section 5 analyses whether the assumed causal mech-
anisms leading to expected outcomes occurred. In this section, we split each outcome into a series of intermediate
outcomes and create a chain leading from one intermediate outcome to the next, with counterfactual hypotheses
at each step being tested against the evidence.
3.3 EVALUATION QUESTIONS
The research approach comprised a preliminary literature review, including in particular the findings of the mid-
line evaluation, to inform the design of the research parameters, and questions, which further guided the data
collection methodology. A conceptual framework developed in the initial stage supported the selection and fram-
ing of research questions and parameters, and how they interrelate with each other.
This evaluation focuses on those questions for which the qualitative methodology employed was best suited. The
questions were selected on the basis of: i) the strengths of qualitative research to deliver answers to questions
focusing on the ‘why’ and ‘how’ of processes and behaviours, and ii) the practical feasibility given the programme
timeframe, resources, and prevailing security and logistical conditions.
The Evaluation Matrix in Annex 2 presents a set of evaluation questions based on the key themes – programme
theory validation, programme implementation, and adolescent empowerment – cross-connected by the five eval-
uation criteria (relevance, fidelity, coverage, effectiveness, sustainability).
3.4 DATA COLLECTION
3.4.1 Methodology
The set of qualitative research methods comprised semi-structured, in-depth interviews with programme stake-
holders, including direct beneficiaries (adolescents, parents, community and religious leaders), with programme
implementers, including trainers and teachers, and with core programme staff from the implementing NGOs and
UNICEF.
11
The qualitative summative evaluation built on a baseline study carried out in 2017 and a midline quantitative
impact evaluation conducted in 2019. To explore the programme in depth, a diverse variety of stakeholders was
included in data collection for both treatment provinces (Bamyan and Badghis). Semi-structured in-depth inter-
views (IDIs) with a purposive sample drawn from adolescents, parents, community and religious leaders, teach-
ers, and trainers were supplemented by key informant interviews (KIIs) with programme implementers (AKF,
WVA), UNICEF staff, and officials. Even though service providers were not the focus of the evaluation, the team
had considered including government stakeholders (e.g., education services) in its KII sampling. However, due to
the institutional uncertainty and unclear linkages between UNICEF and the new administration at the time, it was
decided to instead address programme implementation staff. The KIIs provided information and critical percep-
tions on the programme design and implementation, while the IDIs helped to explore communities’ learning out-
comes, perceived changes, perceptions, and viewpoints about the programme.
The sample was drawn up keeping three conditions in mind: feasibility, inclusiveness, and rigor. The selection of
a smaller number of villages with a larger number of potential participants was done to reduce travel time be-
tween villages, as there were risks associated with travel and to ensure feasibility in terms of logistics. In this way,
the researchers were able to sample a larger number of respondents in multiple ways. The focus on a smaller
number of villages also helped to achieve theoretical saturation; that is identifying thematic issues in the villages
studied until there were no fresh insights left to uncover.
The methodology was guided by the Norms and Standards of the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) as well
as the UNICEF Evaluation Policy. The methodology was specifically designed to be child-sensitive and to allow for
important disaggregation of the data, in particular by stakeholder group, gender and location.
3.4.2 Study area
The target area for the endline evaluation were the provinces of Bamyan & Badghis in Afghanistan, where the
team selected ‘treated’ villages that were included in the midline evaluation. An initial list of potential sites for
data collection was compiled in consultation with the local partners, keeping in mind the feasibility considera-
tions discussed above (high number of potential respondents, logistics and security). Out of this initial listing, five
villages per province were selected for the qualitative study in accordance with the above-mentioned criteria.
Respondents were then selected from each of the villages on the basis of monitoring lists and with the support of
the UNICEF regional offices, AKF, and WVA in Bamyan and Badghis.

3.4.3 Sampling strategy
Data collection consisted of individual interviews (IDIs, KIIs). The total number of interviews remained the same
as initially planned, but the proportions of respondents from the different categories changed due to challenges
in accessing data and respondents. No ALC teachers could be identified in Badghis, as a result of which additional
KIIs were conducted, in consultation with UNICEF. In Bamyan, two MAG supervisors were interviewed due to the
unavailability of MAG mentors.

Initially, a stratified random sampling method was adopted for IDIs based on monitoring lists, but in the later
stages of the data collection and due to the unavailability of some targeted participants, the local research team,
in consultation with C4ED, conducted purposive snowball sampling to identify substitutes with a similar profile
(e.g., respecting age range, schooling category). Different procedures for selection were decided by C4ED in con-
sultation with the local team for identifying and locating each category of participants, as follows:
12
Adolescents (MAG Members): Adolescents aged 12 or above who took part in IALA through the flagship initia-
tive of the Multi-Purpose Adolescent Groups (MAG) were identified as a key group for interviews, with the highest
share of the sampling. The local research team coordinated with UNICEF, AKF, and WVA teams to collect the lists
of the MAG participants in each of the 10 villages. On this basis, the evaluation team proposed stratified random
sampling for selecting the participants out of defined categories in terms of: gender (a gender-balanced sample
was identified), age (adolescents younger and older than 15 years), and in- and out-of-school. The local research
team coordinated with UNICEF and implementing partners for identifying and contacting the respondents in the
areas. During the initial stages of planning, it was decided that the IPs (AKG & WV) in each region would accom-
pany the local research team in the field. However, due to their staff shortage, this was not possible, although they
were engaged for contacting adolescents and to ensure adolescents’ comfort and promote their confidence. Dif-
ferent situations were encountered in the two provinces, requiring a different approach to locate participants.
For Badghis, the local research team found all sampled respondents along with the substitutes based on the lists
and proceeded with data collection without requiring any changes to the sampling methodology. In Bamyan, the
local research team could not locate most of the sampled respondents nor the substitute respondents according
to the lists provided; therefore, snowball sampling was conducted, in close coordination with the AKF team.
Parents of MAG members: Parents of the participating adolescents were identified for interviews to incorporate
their perspectives and to explore changes and barriers in adolescents’ immediate environments. Parents of inter-
viewed MAG members were selected and interviewed on the basis of the lists provided by the AKF and WVA
teams. In case of unavailability of the parents of any MAG Member due to death or migration, the local research
team replaced the participants with the parents of other MAG Members who were available.
MAG Mentors/ Life Skills Trainers: MAG mentors who provided the Life Skills Trainings to adolescents in the
context of MAGs were included in the respondent sample. Lists of MAG Mentors were provided by the AKF and
WVA teams. However, as the locations given for mentors was their workplace, and the majority had left these due
to the programme ending, most mentors were difficult to locate. Due to the limited availability of MAG mentors,
randomized sampling was not feasible. The local research team in consultation with the local partners thus iden-
tified the available MAG mentors in the areas and interviewed them. In cases where more than the needed number
of mentors were available, the local research team selected the respondents randomly from those available.
Community/Religious Leaders: Community and religious leaders who took part in IALA activities (the training
Child Rights in Islam or in Community Dialogues) were identified as relevant stakeholders for interviews. Lists of
religious leaders who took part in UNICEF trainings were made available to the local research team; however,
these were not digitized and in many cases were not available in English. In Bamyan, locating religious leaders
was challenging for the local team as those sampled from the lists refused participation, mainly due to the political
transition. To address this issue, UNICEF provided the local research team with substitute respondents who
agreed to be interviewed. In Badghis, leaders from the list were interviewed by the local research team but
through convenience sampling, as there were difficulties in accessing them. These difficulties in reaching re-
spondents are considered in the analysis of the findings, in particular with regard to effectiveness.
Accelerated Learning Centre (ALC) Teachers: Locating teachers in charge of Accelerated Learning Centres
(ALCs) was challenging in both provinces. No ALCs could be identified in Badghis, whereas for Bamyan, a list was
provided by UNICEF. The local research partner then randomly selected respondents from the available ALCs and
contacted them by phone to conduct the interviews. To address the unavailability of ALCs in Badghis, IDIs were
replaced with additional KIIs in consultation with UNICEF.
Key Informant Interviews: Programme staff from UNICEF and from implementing NGOs (AKF and WVA) in-
volved in programme design and/or implementation, as well as government officials working on child protection
issues (as per availability) were identified as categories of respondents to be included in key informant inter-
views.
3.4.4 Research instruments / Guides and data collection
Seven interview guides were designed according to the typology of respondents:
• IDI guide for adolescents who participated in IALA’s Multi-purpose Adolescent Groups (MAGs)
• IDI guide for parents of adolescents who participated in the MAGs
• IDI guide for community/religious leaders who took part in training/community discussions
• IDI guide for MAG Mentors/Life Skills Trainers
• IDI guide for Accelerated Learning Centre (ALC) teachers
• KII guide for NGO implementers / UNICEF staff
• KII guide for national stakeholders
The guides were prepared to cover all important aspects of the evaluation matrix, while also allowing the re-
searchers to probe for more details. Semi-structured interview guides with open questions were drafted to en-
courage the respondents to discuss the topics from their own perspectives, to elaborate on their narratives, and
to be able to capture unexpected themes or areas of interest that were not considered in the design. Interviewers
were encouraged to probe on answers provided to ensure understanding of the participants’ points of view and
discussion of topics in their own words. Furthermore, this approach with open-ended questions was deemed
13
useful for discussing the types of topics that were of interest to the evaluation, many of which were of quite a
sensitive nature (e.g., social and gender norms) and considered as the best option to engage the target groups,
particularly the adolescents. The exploration of perspectives, experiences, and learning outcomes according to
gender was incorporated in all question guides, to ensure the comprehensive coverage of this factor.
The guides prepared were reviewed critically by C4ED to ensure they were in line with safeguarding protocols
and were child and gender sensitive. Separate IDI guides for adults and for adolescents were developed to ensure
that questions were age-appropriate, easily understandable, and relatable to their contexts. In addition, guides
for interviews comprised procedures to ensure participants’ comfort and privacy at the time of the interview;
informed consent for adults and informed parental consent in the case of adolescents; explanation of anonymity
procedures; inclusion of guidelines for stopping the interviews or skipping questions in case of concern; as well
as contacts of the field coordinator and/or implementing partner to reach out after the interview in case of need.
More details on these procedures can be found in Section 3.6: Ethical Considerations.
Interview guides were first prepared in English and then reviewed, contextualized, and translated into Dari by a
local research partner with excellent knowledge of the contexts in both provinces, following guidelines to ensure
context appropriateness while ensuring questions did not lose their essence. Question guides were tested during
the pilot phase and reviewed in a post-pilot session to ensure any adjustments required.
3.4.5 Data collection process
Two teams of local researchers were employed in Bamyan and Badghis. They were recruited within their respec-
tive provinces to ensure their understanding of the local contexts and to limit potential transportation challenges.
To carry out the data collection among severe security concerns and extreme weather conditions, the local re-
search team followed an established field protocol for sampling, locating and engaging respondents. Before the
interviews, verbal and recorded consent were obtained from all participants.
Interviews were conducted in person with all typologies of participants to ensure a higher level of engagement
and better sources of qualitative data. Interviews took approximately between 45 and 60 minutes with adoles-
cents and community members, and 60–80 minutes with programme implementers and relevant stakeholders.
Interviews were successfully recorded in all cases, after participants had been informed of the purpose of the
interview and consent had been obtained. Anonymity of responses was ensured to all respondents, noting that
their responses would be kept in confidentiality and were to be utilized only for the purposes of the research,
with no personal identifiable information to be quoted.
As data was uploaded throughout the fieldwork period, the evaluation team reviewed data quality and provided
feedback to the field coordinator. A data monitoring sheet with the tools carried out and the data uploaded was
completed daily by the field coordinator and used for data monitoring between the local research partner and
C4ED. Raw interview data were afterwards coded using MAXQDA software and stored securely in our cloud-
based servers.
3.4.6 Coding and data analysis
Qualitative content analysis was used to derive findings from the data collected in three steps: 1. Content analysis
of each piece of data collected (i.e., examining each interview separately); 2. Deeper thematic analysis; 3. Com-
parison of the different interviews/qualitative material (Flick 2011, 403ff. in Pfaffenbach and Reuber, 2005).
Qualitative content analysis provides a systematic way of extracting information from interviews and other qual-
itative data, while ensuring openness to unexpected outcomes (Gläser and Laudel, 2009). Each interview data
was coded in an iterative process that followed a coding structure developed on the basis of the evaluation ques-
tions and key themes outlined in the evaluation matrix. The evaluation team utilised MAXQDA software to struc-
ture and systematise each step. Next, the coded extracts were subjected to in-depth content analysis to identify
and explain patterns, trends, and discrepancies in respondents’ views and behaviours, as well as meaningful re-
lations between themes of interest under the evaluation questions. Furthermore, at this stage, researchers com-
pared and contrasted the findings from the midline evaluation and the qualitative summative evaluation for each
question and relevant theme. Subsequently, researchers re-clustered the data according to the Theory of Change
sequence, to establish if and to what extent the steps had been followed, as well as how and to what extent the
outcomes were realised. Qualitative content analysis is a very useful starting point for carrying out process trac-
ing (Gläser and Laudel, 2019)
3.4.7 Limitations and constraints
This section lists the various types of limitations and challenges faced during the evaluation, which were consid-
ered for methodological and sampling adjustments as well as in the interpretation of findings.
Non-MAG adolescents were not included in the sample: Therefore, the quality of the knowledge delivery and
reception of Life Skills Trainings (LST) between MAG members and non-MAG members could not be analysed.
This limitation, however, is confined to the aspect of MAG members’ communication with their peers, while their
14
communication and exchanges with community and religious leaders (CLs, RLs) and parents were covered from
both sides, i.e., from the adolescents’ own perspectives and from the parents’ and leaders’ perceptions.
Distribution of the respondents and disaggregation: The monitoring lists of the implementing NGOs were pre-
pared according to school locations which were named as villages. Since the schools would usually involve MAG
Members from the surrounding villages, the research team had to visit the nearby locations to meet the respond-
ents. This extended the team’s field coverage as well as the operations to ensure that the sample numbers were
met. Moreover, since it is challenging to get disaggregated data in Afghanistan, difficulties in disaggregating data
by gender, age, disability, and socially excluded groups remained a challenge.
Challenges in respondent outreach and selection: The research team encountered difficulties in meeting the
required numbers of respondents in the study areas according to the design, as a result of several contextual
issues. In Bamyan, it was difficult to find respondents from the M&E lists, as various dynamics limited their avail-
ability, including migration and changes to their circumstances. In some cases, the team resorted to village leaders
for assistance in finding respondents, relying on the snowballing technique. Challenges with the selection of vil-
lages persisted, and the research team engaged in consultations and on-site situational analysis considering pre-
vailing law and order, weather, and accessibility issues, to then proceed to locate substitute respondents meeting
the same criteria. MAG mentors were particularly difficult to locate as their contractual relationship with the pro-
gramme had ended, which meant that they had moved on to other jobs or locations. In addition, in Bamyan most
religious leaders refused to be interviewed, while some were also unavailable due to migration after the regime
change. The UNICEF team was contacted for support and the interviews were conducted with the religious lead-
ers who gave their consent to the UNICEF team. There were similar challenges with the availability of the ALC
respondents, as many were not present in the research locations, and none were located in Badghis. Overall, the
unavailability of respondents in Bamyan remained an overall challenge, which meant the team had to resort to
convenience sampling in some cases, as mentioned.
Respondent recall/ Full programme participation issues: Given the fact that programme activities had ended
one year prior to the interviews, some stakeholders had difficulties recalling the events and in providing answers
to the question guides, in particular parents. Moreover, illiterate respondents encountered more difficulty in an-
swering questions and were found to be less interested in the programme or having skipped sessions/activities.
The research team sought to resolve these issues through providing additional details, building rapport and prob-
ing, which facilitated the process.
Weather and road conditions: The primary data collection was delayed due to the political transition and the
resulting security situation in the country, which brought the fieldwork timeline at the brink of extreme cold
weather. At the time when interviews were initiated, some of the target locations had started receiving snowfall,
which created a huge challenge for C4ED and local partner teams. Given the mountainous geography of some
areas, difficult road conditions made it challenging for the research team to reach locations.
3.5 GENDER AND ADOLESCENTS’ RIGHTS
The evaluation took into consideration the principles and guidelines of UNEG (2014) for integrating gender and
human rights (in particular, adolescent rights) in the study, from the planning stages and tool design to the data
collection process.
The research team established research protocols based on UNICEF’s Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research,
Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis to ensure that the physical safety and emotional well-being of adolescents
was promoted and safeguarded during the entire research process. This included ensuring the respect of the best
interest of the adolescents and to do no harm. Accordingly, adolescents were first contacted through networks of
trust (implementing partners). Contacts to refer to were provided in case of need. Their privacy, confidentiality,
and data security were protected through established field protocols in interviews, transcription, and analysis,
and informed consent was obtained from their guardians and informed assent from themselves. This is in line
with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, ensuring that the child’s views are respected and that participation
in the study does not do any harm and is in the best interest of the child.
Adolescents’ rights and agency were considered in this target group’s engagement for interviews and in the for-
mulation of questions to explore the issues of relevance to them in the context of the programme. Evaluation
questions were designed in a way to allow for an intersectional analysis of boys and girls, as well as vulnerable
groups, like out-of-school and illiterate children. Attention was paid to the impacts of the intervention and any
unexpected effects on women and vulnerable groups. The team was also attentive to ensure that vulnerable
groups were included in the sampling, with representation of out-of-school adolescents as well as in-school ado-
lescents, and from villages that held different distances from the provincial centres.
Gender equality and the empowerment of (young) women (GEEW) was moreover integrated throughout the plan-
ning and implementation of the evaluation. Gender equality and women empowerment were considered in draft-
ing the interview guidelines. Gender aspects were interrogated in the findings to several evaluation questions, as
this dimension was considered essential in view of the type of programme being evaluated and the target popu-
lation involved: adolescents, and in particular, girls (see, for example, Sections 4.1.2 and 4.3.2).
15
The evaluation team was recruited locally to ensure their knowledge of the culture, customs, and practices of each
of the target provinces, and to be mindful of the implications of these in the implementation of the study, from the
revision and contextualization of the tools to the interviews and post-interview work. This also included the un-
derstanding of ethnic structures and the respect for local power structures that would allow the team to carry out
the interviews in these areas. Gender roles were also taken into consideration in accordance with the local con-
text. The team was gender balanced and it was ensured that qualified female researchers interviewed female
counterparts wherever this was relevant according to the local norms. Furthermore, the evaluation team ensured
a gender balance in the sample of adolescents to be interviewed, by selecting 50% female and 50% male, to ensure
equal participation in the discussion of experiences and the consideration of findings.
More details on the ethical considerations overall and for the protection of adolescents are given below.
3.6 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
C4ED is committed to ensuring that all research and evidence generation activities undertaken are ethical, par-
ticularly when research involves children and young people. Both C4ED and the local research partner Alman-
soora Solutions Ltd. are independent entities which had no conflict of interest in the pursuit of this data collection.
Research protocols addressing both ethics and protection were developed and applied throughout the evaluation,
in line with in-country requirements, UNICEF’s Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Col-
lection and Analysis, and UNICEF Office of Research’s Ethical Guidelines. Ethical clearance was obtained through
an external ethical review approved by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of
Human Research Protections in November 2021 (please see Annex 7).
The key ethical principles underpinning this research with children and young people were: (a) ensuring the best
interests of the child are at the heart of the research; (b) informed consent / assent obtained, in an entirely vol-
untary way; (c) no harm has occurred as a result of taking part (or refusing to take part) in the research; (d)
respondents are protected in terms of the confidentiality of the information they provide, and all information
collected is held securely; and (e) no payments made to respondents to induce them to take part in the research.
Moreover, given the health-related circumstances under which the research took place, implications due to COVID
19 were carefully considered. C4ED implemented the ethical protocols at all phases of the research from planning
(e.g., design of the questionnaire, selection of target groups and sample points), to fieldwork (selection of re-
spondents and data collection), to analysis (e.g., data handling and storage). In all aspects, the safety of both in-
terviewers and respondents was considered paramount.
The research is expected to contribute towards the strengthening of child protection and child rights in Afghani-
stan by providing evidence of what works and what does not work to enhance the target groups’ knowledge,
improve their access to information, and support their rights to healthier and safer lifestyles. The research find-
ings are expected to contribute to building an evidence base for lessons learned and good practices to support
child protection and child rights in Afghanistan and the wider region. They also provide insight into the experi-
ences, perceptions, and needs of Afghan adolescents and the actions that can be taken to improve their living
conditions and the fulfilment of their rights. The overall findings from the study provide an important basis for
the design of future interventions aiming to improve adolescents’ lives.
3.6.1 Engagement of participants, consent and safeguarding procedures
Consent information was prepared by C4ED, revised and translated by the local research partner, and read out to
each participant by researchers prior to the interview. All informed consent included ethical components regard-
ing: i) objectives and content of the study, ii) privacy and data security, iii) voluntary participation, iv) the right
to refuse or skip any questions without consequences, and v) source to follow-up regarding complaints or further
information on the study. Moreover, implications due to COVID 19 were carefully considered. Informed consent
and assent (in the case of adolescents) were obtained from all respondents who took part in the study. Consent
and assent were taken verbally and recorded to reduce any potential risks for respondents in carrying their in-
formation on paper in the uncertain circumstances of the country’s political transition.
A 3-step procedure for respondent outreach was followed:
1. Contact with the potential respondent was made through the implementing NGO, to inform about the
research and introduce the local research team.
2. Contact with the respondent was made by the local research team to ensure respondents’ agreement
and availability, and an appointment was scheduled according to the interviewee’s convenience.
3. Interview was conducted in person, as per the implementer’s recommendation and interviewee’s pref-
erence.
For the case of adolescents/MAG members, the implementer’s field staff was requested to act as the go-between,
as the MAG mentors were not easily located. First, parental consent for the interview was obtained, and then an
appointment was made by the local research team with the respondent, after being informed by the imple-
menter’s staff.
16
A safeguarding procedure was developed, contextualized, and implemented by the local research partner. Safe-
guarding is a key concern and responsibility in the delivery of this evaluation, particularly in the current context
of Afghanistan. Qualitative researchers were trained on key ethical principles and protocols for safeguarding chil-
dren in the training preceding data collection. Safeguarding questions were included in the introduction of the
question guides to ensure safe and private conditions for the adolescent interviewees. Appointments were made
in advance in accordance with interviewees’ requirements, to ensure a suitable timing and privacy as much as it
was feasible. Programme implementers were consulted for best options to ensure adolescents’ privacy. In addi-
tion, a contact/referral to relevant personnel from the implementing NGOs as well as for our field coordinator
was given, to ensure that adolescents could reach out in case of need.
3.6.2 Ethical procedures during data collection
To protect respondents’ privacy and ensure their safety and wellbeing, data collection was carried out through
individual interview sessions for all typologies of interviewees, and at times and locations of the interviewee’s
choosing. The requirements for the interview locations were that the location ensures the privacy and safety of
respondents. Due to the potential sensitivity of some of the questions, a distinct protocol for consulting minors
was observed throughout the entire data collection. This was strongly built on safeguarding principles and inter-
viewing techniques on sensitive topics and vulnerable groups.
The research team had a strong preference for collecting data in person, and the approach taken ensured ade-
quate social distancing was maintained and other protective measures utilized. The research employed several
procedures to ensure safety of data collectors in the field, including taking input from local actors, identifying
safest routes, and establishing a clear system for communication and support. In addition, researchers were in-
structed to refer any violations identified among the children by caregivers to the appropriate service providers.
All data were collected in audio recordings and paper/tablet formats. Once data collection was completed, the
audio recordings from the interviews were uploaded to secure, cloud-based servers only accessed by C4ED and
authorized parties, and then deleted from the researchers’ recording devices. Recordings were named according
to numerical codes and typologies of respondents, with no personal identifiable information recorded. Our data
protection policy (DPA) includes ensuring that data is not shared and/or utilized for any purpose other than this
evaluation.
Risks, challenges and mitigation strategies
Several challenges had to be faced and mitigated for the evaluation to take place, considering the political, insti-
tutional and security contexts, as well as the public health situation in the country.
Challenges to field data collection linked with the ongoing political transition were overall mitigated to the extent
possible, by ensuring continued consultation with UNICEF and implementing partners, working with local Afghan
researchers who had greater access to areas that are potentially inaccessible to outsiders, and monitoring of field-
work procedures and locations to ensure that researchers proceeded only if safe to do so.
C4ED sought to mitigate risks through a wide set of approaches. Firstly, on the institutional front, we sought the
endorsement of local authorities for the data collection exercise through UNICEF’s regional offices. International
and regional organisations were still operating in the regions where this evaluation took place, which showed a
certain disposition of the authorities to acceptance of their work. Secondly, the implementing NGOs and their
grounded district staff acted as intermediaries to reach respondents and to help ensure their safety. In addition,
we engaged a local partner for the study, who has prior experience in the areas where data collection took place,
including close networks with village leaders, which reduced risks considerably.
Considering the regime change, respondents could be vulnerable to social, legal, and political risks, particularly
in the case of women and girls. Past participation in the IALA programme was not identified as a risk by the im-
plementing staff. Although the information obtained was related to the programme activities, effects, and insights
into its implementation, the nature of the topics addressed by IALA (e.g., child marriage, girls’ education) was
considered sensitive in the present political landscape. These concerns were partially addressed by ensuring con-
sent from village leaders through implementing NGOs in the locations where data collection took place.
The COVID-19 situation at the time of data collection was stable in both provinces, and hospitals were working in
their normal routine rather than in an emergency situation seen at other points in time in Afghanistan. COVID-19
Standard Operating Procedures were followed by researchers at all times, including mask wearing, frequent use
of hand sanitizers, and following social distancing protocols.

4 EVALUATION FINDINGS
This section presents the evaluation findings organised by the five key evaluation criteria (relevance, fidelity/co-
herence, coverage, effectiveness, and sustainability). To enhance clarity in reporting, we privileged these five cri-
teria for clustering the results. However, it should be noted that under each criterion, questions on the three key
themes of the evaluation were explored (programme theory validation, programme implementation, and adoles-
cent empowerment) – as per the previously approved evaluation matrix presented in Annex 2. Empirical data
collected through qualitative methods (see sections 3.4.4 and 3.4.5) were then coded using MAXQDA software as
per the key themes and evaluation criteria and are summarised and discussed below. Qualitative content analysis
is a very useful starting point for carrying out process tracing (Gläser and Laudel, 2019).
The evaluation questions were developed based on the programme’s Theory of Change, which was outlined in
the midline evaluation. Questions were formulated to establish a clear pathway to generate evidence that could
help us understand the causal processes anticipated in programme theory, how these worked (or did not work)
in practice, and to test the assumptions made explicit there. At the same time, they allowed for unanticipated
aspects to be explored. Evidence from the qualitative summative evaluation was triangulated with the midline’s
quantitative results to answer each evaluation question; these findings are presented in the current section.
The evidence collected was then re-clustered according to the Theory of Change sequence, to establish if and to
what extent the steps had been followed. In Section 5, we apply the Process Tracing approach to analyse the
evidence collected and summarised in Section 4. In Section 5 we discuss how and to what extent the anticipated
causal mechanisms occurred and the expected outcomes of IALA were achieved for the target groups. This in-
cludes the testing of alternative explanations for the changes observed using intermediate outcomes and compet-
ing hypotheses.
4.1 RELEVANCE
4.1.1 Adaptability of IALA activities to adolescents’ needs and contexts
The contexts in which IALA operated are characterized by multifaceted challenges that affect adolescents. One of
the most prominent challenges mentioned by various stakeholder groups is poverty. IALA’s target areas are
marked by precarious living conditions, and lack of employment and financial resources to ensure good nutrition,
which leave families in difficult situations and which, combined with prevalent social and gender norms, fosters
the persistence of harmful traditions, such as child labour, child marriage, high dowry, and girl-for-girls ex-
changes. Vulnerable girls and boys are often deprived of an education, as they are involved in labour activities
due to the poor economic conditions of their families, with boys taking part in agricultural labour and girls in
household chores. Furthermore, girls’ education is affected by early marriage and prevalent gender norms that
undervalue girls and discourage the continuation of their studies. In addition, stakeholders mentioned the limited
access to healthcare, with health clinics usually far away or lacking resources. Additional issues include drug ad-
diction, particularly among the idle youth in the context of the poppy cultivation, and heightened insecurity. These
challenging socio-economic conditions have worsened in the aftermath of the political transition in Afghanistan.
During the time of the evaluation, families were experiencing heightened financial difficulties, food shortages, and
overall insecurity in their communities.
IALA sought to tackle three interrelated key challenges for adolescents in these contexts (early marriage, early
pregnancy, school attendance) through placing adolescents at the centre of the intervention for the first time and
working on awareness building of adolescents and their communities as well as on adolescent empowerment.
IALA activities thus sought to produce changes in social norms and practices, by way of strengthening the adoles-
cents’ place in society, providing them skills and empowering them to become agents of change, and raising
awareness of their rights within their environments (parents and influential community members) to promote
child protection.
The structure and activities implemented by IALA created an adolescent-friendly environment conducive to
learning and knowledge exchange among peers as well as between adolescents and the adults in their communi-
ties (mentors, teachers, parents, leaders, etc.). Even though the overall topics to work on were introduced by the
intervention and not defined by the adolescents, both the adolescents and adults agreed that the contents of the
activities were relevant and applicable to adolescents’ lives. All interviewed adolescents stated that IALA had had
a meaningful influence on their lives and had promoted positive changes by increasing their knowledge and en-
hancing their skills on a variety of topics of interest and relevance to them. The evaluation found that MAGs were
well adapted to the local context and adolescent needs in terms of the relevance of the contents and activities
prepared, the focus on gender and illiteracy, and the approach to social and gender norms from the Islamic per-
spective. However, MAGs did not sufficiently consider the economic issues that limited adolescents’ participation
and that foster the persistence of the three key challenges addressed, as well as the determining role of parents
in their contexts. Adolescents with less family support and economic problems are shown to have been more
absent from MAGs and less able to take advantage of the intervention, which signals the need to provide addi-
tional support or implement changes to its design, so that these challenges can be addressed in the future. MAGs
18
aimed at changing social and gender norms and practices but did not sufficiently engage with some of the condi-
tions that perpetuate them.
Firstly, it should be noted that MAG contents and activities were considered overall relevant to adolescents’
lives by the various stakeholders involved, as well as engaging and instructive. Contents tapped into important
needs and priorities in the adolescents’ contexts, through its focus on issues experienced by adolescents, on gen-
der, on education and on illiterate/out of school adolescents. The training programmes on life skills, self-expres-
sion, etc. were found to be appealing, instructional, and relevant to adolescents’ lives, with practical contents that
they could apply, including learning how to talk to and relate to others, how to make decisions and how to better
express their emotions.
The training topics were defined and planned beforehand, based on the manuals compiled by technical personnel
from AKF in coordination with UNICEF and WVA. Firstly, contents were taught in the Training of Trainers’ and
then cascaded to MAG members, and they were revised after an assessment on the original content. Topics were
discussed with mentors to ensure adaptability and acceptance by communities. Both implementers and mentors
considered the topics appropriate and mostly accepted by the communities.
“… if we thought some topics were sensitive, they would not be included, but most of the topics were very good and
included in the programme and were accepted by the community.” (KII 1, Programme staff, Bamyan, M)
“The curriculum we taught in the workshops we learned first. Then, according to the instructions given to us in the
workshops, we taught the subjects. The topics given were in book form. We had a discussion every month. All the
themes were very well adapted, because it was more in line with the tastes of the young people. In addition, most of
these topics included scenarios, teamwork, and practical work, so it was very consistent with these topics. The stu-
dents shared their interest and activities, and it was more enjoyable for us as coaches and to do the activities.” (IDI
28, MAG Mentor, Badghis, F)
Even though adolescents did not seem to be involved in the prior definition of these topics, they mentioned that
they could express their interest and were consulted about future topics to include. All in all, evidence from the
interviews suggests that they had a good appropriation of the contents through the trainings, subsequent coach-
ing sessions, and discussions in the MAG groups. Adolescents’ responses clearly show that they felt the MAGs
were about issues concerning their daily lives, and that topics were both engaging and instructional. Adolescents
also pointed out that they had not learned these contents anywhere else.
“… at MAG, subjects that are taught have a direct impact on the adolescents' lives. This group helps young people to
set their goals and get success. Even to increase their courage and learn leadership skills.” (IDI, 57, MAG Member,
Bamyan, F)
“It has been important in my life. All subjects have been related to my life, and I have achieved lots of information
which I did not know." (IDI 6, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
The most remembered and valued topics included decision-making, goal setting, confidence, management of emo-
tions, and critical thinking. All adolescents interviewed indicated satisfaction about the topics discussed, stating
interest in all of them and noting that they were all applicable to their lives. They were reluctant to report anything
they had not liked about what they studied in the MAG. They asserted that learning these skills had helped them
to improve their lives in various ways. Adolescents’ views in terms of the usefulness and applicability of MAG
contents are backed by the group’s mentors and supervisors.
“Yes, the issues were related to their lives, because they could solve their problems, for example, make their own life
decisions, because they had learned new things that they did not know before, after knowing, for example, they had
to become self-sufficient.” (IDI 38, MAG Mentor, M, Badghis)
“The MAG programme was totally adapted to teenagers’ activities. For example, self-knowledge, being a goal-ori-
ented person, and decision making was really essential to their lives.” (IDI 31, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
In addition, both adolescents and mentors emphasized the practical nature of the work done in the MAGs, which
fostered learning outcomes. Trainers considered the materials provided easy, instructional, and readily available
to teach, for both the trainings and the committee activities. Some mentors recommended that it would be best
to incorporate the adolescents’ speech and way of talking into the contents of the teachings, to increase their
interest and facilitate their understanding.
Besides the trainings, the activities developed at the MAG were considered relevant to the context, and adoles-
cents’ agency was incorporated in their design and implementation. The work in sub-committees better reflects
adolescents’ expression of interests and agency over the design of activities and inputs to contents. As per design,
MAGs were divided into four sub-committees by themes, which adolescents joined according to their preferences.
In the sub-committees, adolescents discussed together the ideas for activities to be implemented, which had a
blueprint provided by the organisation (e.g., educational campaigns to be developed in the first year), but which
gave adolescents space for prioritizing the topics they wanted to work on and the way of implementation. Boys
and girls in the sub-committees mostly made the decisions together, except in the areas where MAGs were de-
scribed to work separately for socio-cultural reasons. Through this work, adolescents had the opportunity to take
part in different types of activities that appealed to their needs and interests, including arts (e.g., theatre) and
sports.
“We organised activities through the conduction of meetings and coordinated between the members of the group.
After that, we all came together and did the activities.” (IDI 64, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
19
“The decision in MAG was by the students and also the teacher, and sometimes students divided into the groups and
voted about an activity. The activities decided were in the interest of the students. Yes, all the students made a
decision together and everyone heard each other’s speech.” (IDI 10, MAG Member, F, Badghis)
Despite MAG relevance to the local context and adolescent needs through its focus on contents and activities spe-
cifically designed for adolescents, gender and illiteracy, from a design standpoint MAGs may not have sufficiently
considered the economic needs that limited adolescents’ participation and foster the persistence of some harmful
practices. In this way, MAGs aimed at changing social and gender norms and practices but did not sufficiently
engage with some of the conditions that perpetuate them. In addition, MAGs as they were designed did not fully
account for the determining role of parents in their contexts. Adolescents with less family support and economic
problems are shown to have been more absent from MAGs and less able to take advantage of the intervention,
which signals the need to provide additional support or implement changes to its design so that these challenges
can be addressed in the future.
It is important to note that MAGs’ adaptability and suitability to the local context experienced some setbacks,
which derived from the conditions of the areas where they operated, and the type of participants included. These
presented challenges in terms of attendance and participation, particularly of vulnerable groups (see Sections
4.1.2, 4.3.2, 4.33).
The programmes directed at the adolescents’ immediate environments, including trainings and community dis-
cussions, can also be considered to tap into adolescents’ needs and priorities, even though they were not directed
at adolescents. Firstly, these programmes addressed topics which are most influential to adolescents’ everyday
lives, including child marriage, the importance of education and gender equality. Secondly, considering the rele-
vance of parental influence over adolescents’ lives and decisions, these programmes rightly involved key stake-
holders for adolescents’ needs and priorities -even if a more systematic approach could have been better matched
to parents’ determining role in adolescents’ lives.
4.1.2 Gender equality in MAG composition and structure
Figure 4: The structure of MAGs (Source: C4ED elaboration in midline report)
MAGs targeted adolescents in the age group of 10 to 19 years, with a gender balance (50% girls, 50% boys), and
a prominent number of out-of-school children (generally 12 out of 20) to foster their participation and inclusion.
The respect of socio-cultural norms in the target communities was considered in the organisation of MAGs. For
this reason, MAG activities were run separately for girls and boys in some areas, due to the traditional character
of communities. According to stakeholders, girls and boys shared the MAG meetings in most areas of Bamyan –
except in some areas, usually located further away from Bamyan’s center (e.g., Kahmard, Saighan, parts of Shibar),
while in Badghis it was more common to have the meetings separately, even though some MAG respondents there
mentioned working together as well.
"A: They decided the activities totally separately in different places. It was because our cultures do not accept it.
Q: Did the girls hear the voices of boys?
A: No, the girls did not hear the voices of boys" (IDI 31, MAG Mentor, M, Badghis)
20
“… the traditional nature of the communities were also some of our problems that we already discussed with MAG
supervisors in such communities. And even the traditional nature of the communities allowed us to run some pro-
grammes separately for girls and boys. These were all our problems. But in Bamyan, we held most of the meetings
with boys and girls.” (KII 1, Programme staff, Bamyan, M)
The MAGs also generally addressed some issues separately with boys and girls, in particular health, with women’s
health issues such as menstruation addressed with girls only.
The MAGs were structured into sub-committees, with four groups divided by themes (child protection, education
and health, sports, arts). Adolescents were consulted on their interests and joined the respective sub-committees.
Within each sub-committee, roles and responsibilities for each MAG member were allocated, including the selec-
tion of a leader, a deputy, and a secretary. This gave the adolescents a clear structure for their learning and in-
volvement, both within the MAG and in terms of community outreach. The leaders had a prominent role in helping
to manage and organise MAG activities, and the selection of this role based on peer voting helped to boost ado-
lescents’ self-esteem and position in the group. The set-up of these committees seems to have facilitated adoles-
cents’ participation and ability to give their opinion and strengthened their decision-making via a practical ap-
proach. In the committees’ meetings, adolescents discussed together the ideas for activities to be implemented,
including which topics to prioritise, what to do, when and where.
Interviewees expressed consistency regarding the MAG structure in terms of the set-up of four committees and
the selection of roles. In addition, they reported to have one or two supervisors, who oversaw the MAG’s opera-
tions and could replace the mentor if they were not available. The activities were structured, discussed, and the
implementation of community outreach activities outside the MAG organised around these committees. Mentors
helped in the organisation and set up of the discussions and activities, but decisions were taken by the adoles-
cents, in dialogue with the adult roles in the MAG.
“Well, decisions were usually made collectively, and the issues they wanted to do at school or community level were
discussed together, and the discussion was about what the activities should be and who should implement them,
and the materials or resources needed were fully understood. It all happened with the dialogue of supervisor, staff
and teachers”. (IDI 82, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, M)
Where mixed MAGs were organised, adolescents and mentors reported that group decisions were made together
between boys and girls, and that voices were heard equally. The mixed approach proved useful, according to
mentors, to improve girls’ and boys’ understanding of each other. Disagreements were solved by discussion, ne-
gotiation and conflict resolution, where life skills learned in the trainings could be put to use in a practical manner
already in their MAG set-up. Mentors’ intervention was of particular relevance to ensure that both boys’ and girls’
voices were heard and that agreements could be reached together.
“Yes, there was disagreement. We had negotiation, conflict, and decision-making in the group. Because there were
different people and there were various ideas that were solved by talking and consultations and choosing the right
decision”. (IDI 62, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, F)
However, where the MAG was gender segregated, exchanges were clearly more limited, and the voices of girls
and boys remained also separate.
“The girls and the boys all worked together and made their own decisions. By doing group work, they could both
increase their self-confidence and learn how to relate to each other. For this purpose, the best solution was for the
girl and the boy to work together, which is why in the group work what we did was that the girl and the boy were
discussing side by side and resolving issues.” (IDI 28, MAG Mentor, F, Badghis)
Adolescents described a high level of autonomy in making decisions about what activities to do in the context of
their committees in the MAGs. They reported consulting each other in their committees, discussing and hearing
all members’ opinions, and ultimately making a common decision on which activities to pursue according to their
interests.
“We organised activities through the conduction of meetings and coordinated between the members of the group.
After that, we all came together and did the activities.” (IDI 64, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
Mentors’ roles were seen in helping to organise the set-up, and in providing guidance and conflict resolution sup-
port when needed. Disagreements were reportedly solved by listening to viewpoints through a common discus-
sion until a decision was reached, which could include voting.
“If there were a disagreement in the group, we would ask both to sit down and we were listening to both side ideas.
After that, we would make an opinion that both of them were satisfied with.” (IDI 39, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
4.1.3 Role of literacy and inclusion of illiterate children
The in-depth interviews (IDIs) revealed that the literacy rate of many MAG members was not high enough to
access the information provided during the life skills trainings, as MAGs aimed at a significant percentage of out-
of-school children (12 of the 20 members), many of which were illiterate. Various stakeholders conveyed that
illiterate children had a more difficult time participating in, and grasping the concepts of the trainings, and it
seems that retention was more difficult for them than for literate children. This challenge/difficulty was ad-
dressed by the trainers through initiatives such as having practical sessions using visuals, paintings, stories, and
games, as well as encouraging the literate students to support their illiterate peers. After revisions of the trainings,
21
there were changes from having written materials to incorporating other visual-based and interactive ways of
teaching, including work in the form of games, role playing, drawing, and other types of activities.
“The more activities and workshops there are, the more useful it is. If the training is theoretical, it may not be good
for those who are illiterate, and if any practical activity is done, it will be just as useful and better. The activity was
more attractive in our group rather than more explaining.” (IDI 62, MAG Mentor, F)
“Yes, it was very effective for literate people to read the chapter but for some members, the games, the scenarios
and the roles were very valuable” (IDI 56, MAG Mentor, Badghis, F)
“I used to draw my subjects in a way that both the literate and illiterate would learn. For example, we would explain
a subject in decision making or in life skills section and we were asking them to paint for example. Both the illiterate
and the literate could draw the same picture. Both the illiterate and the illiterate understood the subjects through
painting and through practical work.” (IDI 30, MAG Mentor, Badghis, F)
Mentors also stated that it was necessary to repeat the topics more than once so that they could be properly
internalized by adolescents. Illiterate adolescents showed less engagement with the topics and the teachings at
the MAG, and it was more difficult to retain them throughout the programme. Mentors expressed that the mixed
combination of literate and illiterate teenagers was challenging to manage. They also mentioned that illiterate
children had more difficulties to participate in the activities of the committees.
“For those who did not go to school, the lessons were a little difficult because they could not write, read, and the
activities of the committees were difficult. But with cooperation of their president; those who could solve their prob-
lems amongst them consulted their union.” (IDI 29, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
MAG adolescents were encouraged to support their illiterate counterparts to help them incorporate the teachings,
for instance by sitting next to them in the trainings, and to solve problems when they could not. MAGs also had
an effect on promoting literacy of out-of-school children, by encouraging students to improve their literacy skills,
as well as by generating spaces to teach adolescents to read and write. In Bamyan, this also generated the launch
of literacy groups to teach their peers, with the support of mentors and teachers.
“MAG was very useful because there were people who did not even have a pen and book, but through this MAG, they
understand and become interested reading and writing and registered to school, they were very interested.” (IDI 5,
MAG Member, F, Badghis)
“We taught Multiple Adolescent Group members to read and write. Of course, we encouraged those who were illit-
erate and those who were literate to read these lessons together in groups.” (IDI 30, MAG Mentor, Badghis, F)
MAG members also mentioned that literacy affected their mentoring practice, as they found illiterate peers more diffi-
cult to teach, with more challenges to understand the contents they would share.
These findings suggest that whereas illiteracy was a challenge at first, this was overcome to some extent by revising the
training to be more accessible to illiterate children and through offering peer support by literate children. Though it is
likely that this challenge was not completely overcome, and illiterate children benefitted less, it had the unexpected
effect of motivating some children to learn to read and write.
4.1.4 MAG mentors/trainers’ profiles and skills
The MAG trainer positions were announced publicly via the organisations’ websites, and the selection was done
through open competition. Mentors were preferably recruited from education and social science backgrounds.
Many of the MAG mentors interviewed reported to be unemployed at the time of the evaluation. Mentors de-
scribed the selection being made up of different stages; firstly, a CV evaluation, then a written test, and finally
interviews for those who succeeded. Most mentors reported to be bachelor's degree graduates. After succeeding
in the selection process, mentors received life skills training (LST) for 15 days on all 40 modules, and later in the
programme they received refresher training. Mentors found that the topics and skills taught were useful for both
themselves and the adolescents and that it had positive effects on their own lives. They also reported that the
training received was sufficient to allow them to teach, and apart from the contents of the LST itself, it also trained
them on how to organise activities, how to cope with students and how best to transfer the knowledge to them.
“Actually, the way that they were teaching us was really useful. Moreover, they taught us how to convey our
knowledge to the students.” (IDI 31, MAG Mentor, M, Badghis)
“These trainings were very useful for me, and with them I was able to serve the community more. Among the train-
ings that were very useful for me were: peer pressure, creative thinking, problem solving, and banning children from
addiction, recognizing the harms of intoxicants, and there were other issues... with these trainings I was well pre-
pared to teach.” (IDI 28, MAG Mentor, F, Badghis)
Mentors did not talk much about challenges of their training. One of the issues mentioned regarded the late dis-
tribution of materials (after the start of the school year), which was remedied by the next year. In terms of con-
tents, one mentor in Bamyan mentioned that they wished the children’s rights section had been more thoroughly
explained, while another mentioned that it would be good to provide the support of health professionals to ad-
dress health topics in the groups. In addition, there were requests to have more visual materials and access to
digital aids (and skills), as well as more interactive activities, games, etc. to teach the contents, as these were
considered very useful, particularly for illiterate students.
22
“The other part is bringing some audio and video materials and resources that teenagers need; it can be a hard
drive or a projector that can be funded very cheaply” (KII 3, Programme staff, Bamyan, M)
MAG mentors were supported by supervisors and a group of trusted adult members of the community which
provided assistance to and oversaw the MAG activities, including members of the village councils, elders, and school
principals.
“In each group, there was an observer who could monitor the group's work at any time and supported the group
where they had a problem. For example, if there was a campaign in the area where teenagers had difficulty in
launching, these adults would support the team.” (KII 2, Programme staff, Bamyan, M)
“There was a group of 8 members in which elders of the community were members and supported us in the organ-
isation of activities.” (IDI 64, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
4.1.5 Suitability of village premises to host MAG activities
Centrality was sought for while selecting MAG venues. Schools were usually the chosen places to hold MAG activ-
ities, which were considered mostly accessible and appropriate spaces from the MAG mentors’ perspective. The
location was in fact close for many adolescents, particularly those living in the village, but far away for those who
came to the MAG from other places. NGO implementers liaised with the schools (who were in contact with the
Department of Education) and with councils at village level for the selection of appropriate locations, and in many
cases schools’ facilities were given out to MAGs without costs for the meetings. However, MAGs still faced prob-
lems, particularly during the winters when schools were closed and alternative locations had to be found, includ-
ing locations where heating was many times not available. Moreover, not all MAGs were given a specific location
for the whole duration, so MAG meetings would be held as well at other locations, including private houses,
mosques, village council venues or other spaces provided by the communities. As the possibility to choose MAG
venues was based on the available community resources, this sometimes resulted in the lack of appropriate space
and equipment for MAG meetings, which affected participation. There were accounts by the programme to try
and remedy this situation, for example by making some funds available to teenagers to rent meeting spaces in
private houses at later stages. The availability of funds for ensuring appropriate learning spaces is one of the
lessons learned from implementers.
“… in some places we had problems, and in some places, they gave us a room where we studied, in a class when there
were no students and we also hanged our charts, but in some other places the MAG location was specific.” (IDI 81,
MAG Mentor, Bamyan, F)
“Yes, the only problem they had was the lack of a teaching place. Mostly the houses were used for training. It is
better if they provide a better place for the next project.” (IDI 39, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
4.1.6 Relevance of content of ‘New Homes, New Lives’ drama for supporting
IALA’s outcomes
Listening to the radio was not something that generally featured when adolescents were asked about their free
time or other activities. Regarding the programme NHNL, one third of the adolescents interviewed reported to
have listened to it. This is comparable to the midline evaluation where 15 out of 29 adolescents interviewed dur-
ing the field mission had reported not listening to the radio at all, and only five had participated in community or
MAG radio listening sessions (P. 39, 2019). In the IALA baseline and midline data, the three main channels to learn
about rights and entitlements are friends and family (51%), mosque (41%), and TV (20%). Radio is thus not nec-
essarily a popular medium of instruction.
The topics recalled included early marriage, girls’ rights such as education and employment, and teachings about
behaviour, e.g., problems with lying. Adolescents who listened to the programme found it engaging and informa-
tive, and the topics relevant to their lives. They stated that they mostly listened to the radio programme at home,
alone, or with family members, and that they discussed the episodes with family and friends. Parents who also
reported to listening to the programme found the topics good and were satisfied that their children were listening
to them. There was no knowledge among stakeholders interviewed regarding the extent to which the programme
was listened to among target audiences or its effects, although it was noted by programme staff that TV is a more
appropriate medium than radio for reaching young audiences.
“I felt happy that I learned something from there and my experience was that girls who are under legal age should
not get married, because it has harmful consequences.” (IDI 6, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
Roughly one third of the interviewees reported to have participated in a community radio activity as well. They
reported that in the debates, they discussed underage marriage, children’s rights, and life skills, such as goal set-
ting, decision making, and self-confidence. Adolescents who took part showed a sense of self-confidence and em-
powerment through having been able to participate in this activity, through promoting the topics in this way to
their peers, and through asking questions to the experts who participated in panels.
“Our teacher introduced us. We went there, and there were seminars for two days, that in first day we were taught
how to ask questions, decrease stress and be confident. At the programme, the topics were underage marriage and
hard labour. I have participated several times. In there, we were asking our elders about what we did not know,
such as children’s rights.” (IDI 20, MAG Member, F, Badghis)
23
“It was regarding gender, children rights, and how long they are considered children, and what are their rights over
parents […]. It felt good. In addition to the questions that were in my mind, I also encountered questions from other
students and got familiar with those who were there.” (IDI 63, MAG Member, F, Bamyan)
This suggests that though radio may have had only limited utility for listeners, participants in the commu-
nity radio benefitted in terms of developing confidence and communication skills.
4.2 FIDELITY/COHERENCE
4.2.1 Alignment of activities with cultural norms and their local reception
Parents of MAG members interviewed expressed agreement with the content of IALA’s activities, which is why
they accepted that their children took part in MAGs, although some acknowledged to have been reticent at first.
From the interviews with various stakeholders, we conclude that parents in many communities showed re-
sistance toward the MAG groups, particularly at the start of the intervention, either by opposing the formation of
the groups or by not allowing their children to join, particularly girls. Thus, in some cases, MAG members needed
to be substituted. Achieving parental acceptance was of paramount importance, as adolescents needed their par-
ents’ written consent to attend the MAGs. Resistance was lower in cities and higher in smaller villages and remote
areas. Mentors mentioned that this early resistance was mostly addressed in time, as parents saw that the courses
and activities were teaching the adolescents useful, positive contents, and this prompted more parents to change
their approach and even to provide support and encouragement to their children.
“At the beginning, they really disliked the groups but later realized that the issues were very important and were
absorbed by the children, and then later they supported them”. (IDI 56, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, F)
“When the MAG programme started for the first time, in the first weeks the families were not satisfied, because the
results were not apparent. But then, when their sons/daughters shared their knowledge with them, the family got
more interested. Not only did they not disagree with their sons or daughters but also, they motivated and encour-
aged them as well.” (IDI 31, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
Efforts to sensitise and convince parents of the benefits of the group were also carried out by MAG mentors and
NGO implementing staff. In addition, the community-level trainings helped to sensitise parents and community
members about the MAGs and in this way lowered the opposition to the activities. It was a key feature that con-
tents were understood to be in line with the teachings of Islam, and thus appropriate to their communities, to
achieve a better acceptance.
“In some places they were very cooperative with us and helped us with many of our problems, but in other places
they were very opposed. But in general, the opposition was not significant. Because the training had already been
provided to them by UNICEF, which had decreased some of our problems”. (IDI 81, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, F)
Religious leaders considered that the trainings received on Child Rights in Islam were in line with Islamic law and
teachings and therefore expressed satisfaction with the contents received. They reported that they had acquired
new knowledge about important topics regarding children’s rights and their place in society according to Islam,
which included their rights to education, to not be involved in hard labour or early marriage, and children’s
healthcare.
For community-level trainings and discussions, local and cultural norms were also considered. In Badghis, there
were accounts of talks with men in mosques and with women in houses belonging to community members. Topics
concerned children’s rights, including early marriage, the right to education, and the value of girls. Elders, reli-
gious leaders, parents, and other family members joined the discussions. Most interviewees considered that com-
munities had overall positive reactions to the talks and that adults were pleased to learn about children’s rights.
However, interviewees also mentioned that some families or community members had expressed negative reac-
tions or questioned issues regarding the topics discussed, such as the age of girls for marriage or the reasons for
girls to attend school instead of staying home.
“People reacted positively, and they were happy to know about the rights of their daughters.” (IDI 13, MAG Parent,
Badghis, F)
“They contacted the members of the council and the elders of the community, and they reacted positively to these
talks.” (IDI 28, MAG Mentor, Badghis, F)
“… an illiterate family reacted negatively and said, “Why should a girl study instead of working at home?” (IDI 3,
MAG Parent, Badghis, F)
“Some people reacted negatively, but after a while they realized that studying is a good thing and thought that
everyone should study.” (IDI 3, MAG Parent, Badghis, F)
Religious leaders (RL) emphasized that it was important that programme goals were in line with and did not
contradict teachings of Islam. While some community members first felt that the way topics were addressed dur-
ing community discussions was not in line with their understanding of the Quran, religious leaders underlined
that according to their interpretation, IALA goals for awareness raising were aligned with what they preach about
Islam.
24
“Exactly the Prophet of Allah said that getting knowledge is a must for men and women that both should be trained
and participate […]. When the issue was explained with the proof of honourable verses and Hadith, they were con-
vinced”. (IDI 35, RL, Badghis, M)
For the future, parents, as well as community and religious leaders suggested additional actions that could be
taken, following the path that IALA had started. The suggestions mostly referred to establishing more schools,
educational courses, and hiring teachers (potentially those trained and employed through IALA before). This un-
derlines that IALA activities fell under the norms and interests of community members and leaders. Beyond IALA
activities, some parents also mentioned the need for improved security and employment:
“In the process, we have specific plans in the council, which are in the field of education, the establishment of schools,
and these are the other issues that we are planning, and I hope that we will be able to implement them in the future,
and our teenagers' benefit”. (IDI 35, RL, Badghis, M)
Beyond IALA activities, some parents also mentioned the need for improved security and employment:
“People want security and employment. My son went to Iran due to unemployment to feed his family. We desire that
peace comes in Afghanistan and equal rights should be given to boys and girls and start their education”. (IDI 51,,
MAG Parent, Bamyan, F)
4.2.2 Reception of trainings for religious leaders
The Child Rights in Islam training aimed to strengthen religious leaders’ understanding of children’s rights and
their importance based on insights from Islam. Leaders were provided with evidence from the Quran and the
Prophet’s teachings in relation to children’s rights and their protection, including contents related to child mar-
riage, child labour, children’s right to education, and the prevention of gender discrimination. Trainings were
conducted with Mullahs (religious leaders) by The Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs (MoHRA) with the sup-
port of UNICEF in the two IALA provinces.
Religious leaders considered the choice of the mosques to carry out the trainings on children’s rights in Islam as
appropriate, as the trainings discussed issues that concern Islam, and as the mosque plays a key role and refer-
ence in Muslim societies. They also deemed this a good location due to its capacity for spreading messages among
a wide audience.
The religious leaders who agreed to be interviewed reported being satisfied with the training and its contents.
They felt that the trainings were appropriate, as they were according to the teachings of Islam. They reportedly
shared their messages with community members in both formal settings (Friday prayers, Madrasa teachings in
separate rooms for girls and boys) as well as informal talks. They mentioned that, overall, parents were receptive
to the teachings and glad to learn about their children’s rights according to Islam, which they were mostly una-
ware of before.
Overall, the religious leaders interviewed seemed to accept the messages conveyed about adolescents’ develop-
ment and rights, including their right to education and the non-discrimination of girls. One of the topics which
seemed to have had a less uniform response was child marriage, as disagreements were cited on this topic in both
the midline and endline evaluations, particularly on the appropriate age for girls to get married. In the interviews,
some leaders stated that marriage for a girl could be done at the age of puberty, or 15-16 years, while most em-
phasized having at least the legal age of 18 years for both. Even leaders who mentioned the 15-16 years threshold,
still recommended that marriage happens later, for adolescents to be ready and in a better position. This can
plausibly be linked to the training’s focus on explaining the negative impacts of child marriage. If one distinguishes
between child marriage and early marriage, however, all RLs clearly rejected marriage before puberty and had
mixed views regarding marriage after puberty. Another issue which seems to have had a less uniform response
from religious leaders was decision-making regarding marriage, which some still considered a decision ultimately
to be taken by parents, even if in consultation with their children. While they agreed that boys and girls should
not be forced to get married but have a say in the decision, interviews with community members reported that
parents still take the final decision in most cases.
The themes child marriage and child labour created some resistance in the communities. In terms of child mar-
riage, the issues for the community were: the definition of a child’s age (when they are or are not a child), ambi-
guities present in the religious traditions, for instance parents bringing up the age of Aisha’s marriage to the
Prophet (9 years old), and the issue of economic necessity which, together with conservatism, drives the practice
forward. The perceived parents’ responsibility over children’s marriage was also a key issue, as this is still a prev-
alent norm. In terms of child labour, some parents argued that in their poverty-stricken conditions they needed
children to work to help sustain the families. In terms of education, resistance was related to parents’ economic
situation which pushed them to engage their children in work instead of sending them to school. Their reserva-
tions against older girls attending school were due to social and gender norms. However, overall messages re-
garding children’s access to education seem to have been better received than others.
Overall, leaders reported feeling confident about addressing community concerns and questions based on the
training received. However, they also pointed out that not all community members had changed their views, and
that further sensitization work on children’s rights was needed. Some behavioural changes and changes in norms
are still lagging due to conflicting social influences, such as economic needs and tribal rules, versus child protec-
tion and gender equality values.
25
4.2.3 Comprehensiveness of trainings for influential community members
Trainings for influential community members seemed to have been comprehensive enough in terms of their cov-
erage of children’s rights and protection. The community leaders interviewed expressed satisfaction with the
trainings and sessions, which were held separately from those for religious leaders. Community leaders stated
that they acquired knowledge that they did not have before about children’s rights and their place in society. The
new knowledge included how to consider and treat children, the protection of children against harmful practices,
such as early marriage and child labour, the importance of education, the value of girls, the importance of non-
discrimination between boys and girls, and children’s health.
"The positive point was that we learned a lot of things in this programme. For example, before that we didn't have
information about underage marriage, about the rights of children, but now we know all about the mentioned issues
and therefore we understand.” (IDI 32, CL, M, Badghis)
“One is, the rights of children in society, what are their rights and what are their values, the second is that early
marriage is untimely, the third is the education of adolescents, what kind of education should adolescents receive.
These are the three things we learned.” (IDI 37, RL, M, Badghis)
There is evidence that leaders substantially increased their awareness about these topics, of which, in their own
words, they did not have too much knowledge and understanding before. There is also evidence that this
knowledge and awareness has had a positive influence on their views on adolescents and on harmful traditional
practices, although this evidence points to less uniform effects than those regarding knowledge. One the one hand,
we find several accounts of leaders promoting children’s rights in their formal and informal speeches and their
interactions with families and community members. This includes anecdotal evidence of interventions to stop
underage marriages and to promote school attendance. On the other hand, the changes have not taken place con-
sistently, indicated by leaders’ differing views about the appropriate age for marriage and their considerations
that parents are ultimately the decision makers in marriage. There were conflicting responses, for example, with
some leaders stating that marriage for a girl could be done from an age of 15 or 16, and for boys from an age of
18 years (even though they recommended them to be older), while most emphasized the legal age of 18 years for
both. More details are provided in Section 4.4.
4.2.4 Community and religious leaders’ use of training contents
There is evidence that community and religious leaders engaged in IALA have used the new knowledge to support
adolescent protection in their communities, though the present qualitative study cannot determine the scale of
these practices, also because the team faced difficulties in locating religious and community leaders willing to be
interviewed at the difficult time when the data collection took place.
Community and religious leaders were recognised by all interviewed stakeholders as having a strong influence
in the target areas. Their knowledge sharing activities can thus have a strong multiplier effect. In the interviews,
leaders acknowledged the responsibility to share their knowledge, considering their position in society and in the
activity of Islamic communities. The leaders interviewed found the IALA’s teachings in line with the teachings of
Islam, which allowed them to adopt these and share them with their communities. The trainings seem to have
been successful in showing how Islam supports children’s rights and in encouraging leaders to engage against
harmful practices in their community.
“For example, untimely marriage causes a girl and a boy to separate. What other problem arises? According to the
Shari'a, they have the right to study, to come to the mosque, or to go to school, to study, to learn. These are the rights
they have over their parents. We taught these things to children.” (IDI 37, RL, Badghis, M)
“Well, as far as we learned from the training, we passed it onto others and made them aware, for example, of pre-
venting early marriages, which is both mentally and physically defective. Well, sometimes it happens because they
are economically poor.” (IDI 33, RL, Badghis, M)
The interviews provide evidence that leaders have shared the knowledge they gained about children’s rights with
adolescents and community members on children’s rights in both formal and informal settings. The high amount
of dowry and the socio-economic problems it creates were also raised by some leaders. Knowledge has been
shared through religious sermons at mosques, sessions at the Madrasas (separate for boys and girls), ‘formal’
community discussions, and in informal gatherings where topics of child rights were addressed. Religious leaders
considered the mosque a good location due to its capacity for spreading messages among a wide audience. The
importance of the mosque as a source of learning was also evident in baseline and midline data, according to
which respondents identified the three main channels to learn about rights and entitlements as being friends and
family (51%), mosque (41%) and TV (20%).
“On Fridays, Mullah Imam would discuss children's rights, the value of girls, and other issues.” (IDI 27, MAG Parent,
Badghis, M)
“There is no set time and whenever it is available, for example, if there is a party, ceremony, event, or reciting of the
Quran; those who have taken the course transfer their information.” (IDI 33, RL, Badghis, M)
“A: When we were free, we gathered people and talked about those issues which we learned.
Q: How useful was the learned thing for you?
A: It was very useful. Men didn’t know about side effects of early marriage; now they send their children to school
and try to teach them about life skills” (IDI 32, CL, Badghis, M)
26
There is some evidence that in addition to spreading information and knowledge, some community and religious
leaders played roles as agents of change themselves by contributing to prevent child marriage and to promote
access to education. For example, respondents mentioned that Imams started paying attention to the age of girls
and the consents of youth for the marriage to be carried out, and there were accounts of leaders aiming to prevent
child marriages by convincing the families of their harmful effects. There are also accounts of leaders talking to
families to support adolescents to go to school.
“In most marriage parties, they invite us for the recitation of the ceremony, but if boy and girl are teenagers, we try
to prevent the marriage.” (IDI 36, RL, Badghis, M)
“Approximately one and a half months ago our men were busy somewhere, and when they came back, they shared
information with me. There is a special case that was a family and they wanted to give their daughter to someone,
but she was a teenager; we discussed with them and convinced them to cancel this marriage.” (IDI 32, CL, Badghis,
M)
“If such a case occurred [child marriage], the elders of the community will meet to find a solution for it so that it
should not occur. In case, if it is not solved here then they refer to the district, where all the elders of the community
and other influential people gather and find a solution for it.” (IDI 45, MAG Parent, Bamyan, M)
“Of course, they were in common with clergies and old people of the area and also, they used their advice. For ex-
ample: if they wanted to return their classmate to school, they had to convince her/his parents with the help of
clergies and elders of the village.” (IDI 60, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, M)
It should be noted, however, that although evidence for increased knowledge and awareness among religious and
community leaders is clear, evidence of systematic activities linked to child protection is less strong and/or points
to less uniform effects. Despite the general acceptance of leaders’ messaging among community members con-
cerning child marriage, the importance of education, and gender inequality, conflicting social and economic con-
ditions – economic needs, cultural habits, and religious conservatism – were still mentioned as challenges to
changing norms.
Religious leaders considered the choice of the mosques to carry out the trainings on children’s rights in Islam as
appropriate, as the trainings discussed issues that concern Islam, and as the mosque plays a key role and refer-
ence in Muslim societies. They also deemed this a good location due to its capacity for spreading messages among
a wide audience.
“Especially we talked with mullah imams, because the mosque is the best place for publicity in Muslim societies.”
(IDI 32, CL, Badghis, M)
4.2.5 Implementation modality and partnerships between UNICEF, implementing
NGOs and service providers
The IALA programme was aligned with UNICEF Afghanistan country policy, UNICEF’s frameworks on the protec-
tion of the rights of the child, national frameworks of child protection and international frameworks including the
Convention on the Rights of the Child.
In order to address harmful traditional practices and their negative impacts on adolescents through the IALA
programme, UNICEF ACO engaged with the MoE, the Ministry of Haj and Religious Affairs (MoHRA), the MoIC, the
MoLSA, the Ministry of Women’s Affairs (MoWA), the Afghanistan Education Production Organisation (AEPO),
the Consortium AKF/WVA, with financial support from the IKEA Foundation. These institutions were involved in
different programme components, for which they coordinated periodically with UNICEF and partners, and mon-
itored the activities and visited the programme areas.
Each partner’s role and share of responsibility in the programme was considered by stakeholders to be clear and
understood by the rest. Memorandums of Understanding were signed at the beginning to this end. AKF and WVA
had executive roles, taking care of the implementation of activities according to design and planning, while
UNICEF provided technical supervision, financial support and monitoring. UNICEF monitored the programme
through internal personnel and also at specific points in time through third-party monitoring.
The partnership between UNICEF and the implementing NGOs benefitted from a long trajectory of previous com-
mon work in-country, including the implementation of joint programmes in education, health, nutrition, and
other areas. Furthermore, each NGO’s expertise in the country and in the programme development areas was
highlighted as a strength. This meant that both NGOs were active in each of the regions and had long-standing
activities there, which facilitated their knowledge and outreach to the different stakeholders at provincial, district,
and village level.
The experience of cooperation was regarded positively by the stakeholders interviewed. Partners met periodi-
cally for coordination meetings from the provincial to the local levels, and the overall position is that the different
offices (governmental, non-governmental and UNICEF) were getting involved to an appropriate extent in over-
seeing the implementation and effectiveness of each of the programme activities. In addition to the monthly meet-
ings, additional meetings were held when deemed necessary. The system allowed for the discussion of progress
and challenges, providing opportunities to incorporate lessons learned into the implementation. Coordination
meetings between stakeholders in the different institutions and the Department of Education were happening
periodically, holding monthly meetings where the discussion of progress and challenges took place, and addi-
tional meetings as necessary. Cooperation for implementation at the local level was also highly appreciated.
27
Stakeholders mentioned that local councils were cooperative with the DoE, directorates, and the schools, as sev-
eral MAG members were students at the local schools.
Some coordination issues were mentioned. For example, the fact that there were many people involved in the
programme from the different departments, and this caused that not always the same people would be involved
in the meetings, which made it more difficult for communication. Furthermore, monitoring of the programme was
complex, and it is not clear how much the information flows were being exchanged between organisations with
UNICEF, in particular in relation to villages.
Programme staff considered that it was important to sensitise staff from government departments to raise aware-
ness on adolescents’ rights. In fact, the interviewed stakeholders found that all government partners had raised
their awareness on children’s rights through the IALA interventions. However, after the programme’s completion,
the political transition to a Taliban-led government has changed the whole government apparatus as well as ed-
ucational and women’s policies. Information related to governmental actions in the area of child protection has
thus been unavailable. At the time of the evaluation, the links with government counterparts were still not de-
fined, and in consideration of the extremely unstable situation the evaluation team could not seek access to gov-
ernment authorities/service providers. Thus, the evaluation excluded pilar III, and focused on pillars I and II,
adolescents and stakeholders.
4.2.6 Activity completion, divergence in implementation and operational chal-
lenges
All stakeholder groups interviewed convened that IALA’s implementation did not face major issues in delivering
its activities and outputs, with the noted exception of the COVID-19 pandemic, which halted most programme
activities in the last quarter. However, several challenges emanating from both the contexts in which the activities
operated (’demand’ side), as well as from the programme’s design and operations (‘programmematic’ side) had
tangible effects on implementation, producing divergencies and operational challenges to be addressed. Some of
them have already been discussed in the previous sections.
On the ‘demand’ side, one of the factors which caused divergence in implementation and challenges were the
traditional gender and social norms varying between Bamyan and Badghis and within each province. In some
(especially the more remote/rural) areas of both provinces, but especially in Badghis, local norms did not allow
for mixed-gender MAGs (as planned) but required gender-segregated groups. This was the case also for commu-
nity level activities organised in these areas. Social and gender norms created challenges for implementers also
because they affected MAG attendance and participation, as well as community’s levels of acceptance/resistance
to MAG activities and messages. Communities with more resistance needed stronger sensitization work on the
part of both adolescents and adults.
Moreover, where the context made attendance more difficult or less engaging for adolescents (whether due to
prevailing norms, labour practices, community acceptance, or physical distance to educational infrastructure),
this implied more challenges for implementers to retain them and to monitor their activities. Also, as a few mem-
bers dropped out and needed to be substituted, for example in Badghis, which impacted on the trainings received
(e.g., additional refresher trainings). Another factor that produced divergence in implementation and required
design changes was illiteracy (see Section 4.1.3). Although all of these factors are related to the context and ‘de-
mand’ side, they also have a programmematic aspect, as MAG organisation did not sufficiently consider in the
design some of these factors which affected implementation, such as the work activities of vulnerable adolescents
and the timeline of MAG in consideration of seasonal practices.
Regarding the programme’s side, findings indicate that resources provided for operations were overall consid-
ered were sufficient and available for the whole duration of the activities, although there were issues reported on
insufficient funds/resources in some areas which produced challenges. For the case of trainings, arts and sports
activities, respondents specifically cited availability of adequate education materials which included manuals for
life skills trainings, books, pens, artistic and sports kits, etc.
“...the materials that were useful for us were given from the office. For example, in the artistic committee kits were
given and, in the sports committee, they gave equipment. For example, books were also provided by the Education
committee. What was needed for us they gave to us.” (IDI 62, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, F)
Trainers considered the materials provided easy, instructive, and readily available to teach, for both the trainings
and the committee activities. Nevertheless, some stakeholders indicated that there was late delivery of some of
the materials for the start of the school year, which was later remedied by planning the delivery in advance so
that they would reach the beginning of the next school year. There was also the request to have more visual ma-
terials and access to digital aids (and skills), as well as more interactive activities, games, etc. to teach the contents,
as these were considered very useful, particularly for illiterate students.
For the case of ALCs, there were mentions of some shortages of human resources, particularly in some areas. This
was mentioned by some mentors as well as by some parents, who would have been interested in more educational
resources for their out-of-school girls.
“…specified classes had a rule, and the students of the group did not have the ability for doing that. Just in our area
there were no teachers but in other areas there were a lot of teachers who were supported financially by the AKF
organisation.” (IDI 60, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, M)
28
Resources at community level and community participation also affected implementation, which is linked to both
demand and programme design. The availability of community resources and their disposition for IALA activities
by the communities were factors which caused divergence and sometimes operational challenges for the organi-
sation of MAGs as well as for the implementation of activities at community level. MAGs originally did not have
budgets devoted to the functioning of premises, and stakeholders mentioned challenges in ensuring that some
MAGs had places available for meetings, as they depended on the availability of spaces (and the disposition of
these) by the community. This implied that some MAGs had regular places to meet, while others may have found
this more difficult. Moreover, MAG’s community activities depended largely on the groups’ possibilities, as these
were voluntary. A lack of resources was sometimes mentioned for the implementation of MAG plans and activities
at community level, which led to some activities to not be performed.
“Plans that were prepared, a few of them were facilitated and a few were not facilitated on behalf of the organisa-
tion. Another problem was lack of budget in performing. And the members of groups were teenagers and did not
have financial ability for performing the plan. Lots of their plans were as an idea and remained as an opinion.” (IDI
60, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, M)
Community support did not just affect implementation in terms of material resources, but also in terms of support
to MAG the development and implementation of MAG activities. Where MAGs were supported by community
adults, adolescents found it easier to carry out awareness raising activities and saw their activities more legiti-
mised, which signals the importance of adults’ systematic inclusion in any future initiatives.
For the case of community-level activities such as action plans, the limited financing created difficulties to imple-
ment ideas presented by communities, when they exceeded the programme’s forecasted budget. Delays in devel-
opment of community action plans were reported in Badghis in comparison to Bamyan, and funding unavailabil-
ity afterwards made it not feasible to include these plans for Badghis in the programme before its formal end.
Another programmematic aspect which introduced variation in implementation was the fact that MAGs were
based around a school and not necessarily a village, with cases where not the whole IALA package was delivered
to one village but only particular components. There were villages where only one or two MAG members were
based, and where partly no community or religious leader training or community discussion had taken place (or
only one of the two had taken place). Thus, this limited the possibilities brought about by the otherwise synergetic
approach of IALA activities in each site. For the cases of MAG members who were not part of the MAG school
village, participation was more difficult due to physical distance and engagement was therefore affected.
Finally, it should be noted that the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020 further impacted programme implementa-
tion, requiring a halt to activities and some further modifications. The lockdown restricted travel, delaying pro-
curement of materials and producing changes to remote communication with and monitoring of beneficiaries. It
also implied the need to rethink activities and ways of further utilization of the MAG, for instance, for hygiene
awareness and prevention activities. The impact of COVID-19 on programme implementation also meant the sus-
pension of the last radio debate in Bamyan and made it impossible to deliver community action plans in Badghis
as per design.
4.2.7 Reliability, accuracy, and consistency of programme monitoring systems
Interviews with stakeholders showed that monitoring plans and mechanisms were in place for each of the imple-
menting organisations to track the different activities organised. Monitoring mechanisms, including forms to be
filled in by mentors, were developed for MAGs to ensure that adolescents participated on a regular basis in the
meetings and that MAG activities were tracked and recorded by the monitoring professionals. Mentors mentioned
receiving periodic visits from the implementing NGOs’ offices to check how activities were going. Moreover, peer
mentoring guidelines for MAG members also included monitoring forms to track the cascade learning activities.
However, the latter were more difficult to implement as adolescents mentioned that not everyone they shared
their knowledge with was included in the form. There were also problems with missing, incomplete or non-dig-
itized records, such as a lack of information regarding ALC teachers for Badghis and lists of programme partici-
pants in the leaders’ trainings only available on paper and only in Dari., which directly affected data collection
during the evaluation. This may have been due to the current difficult situation. Yet, monitoring data should have
a centrally available backup in the future.
In addition, despite the tracking systems developed and the involvement of various stakeholders in ensuring their
functioning, difficulties to provide data to the evaluation team signal that there was still a lack of sharing of dis-
aggregated information of programme implementation with UNICEF to understand the scope of activities within
each implementation village. Since MAGs were mostly based around a school and not necessarily a village, some
MAGs had members distributed across several villages, which could not be identified based on the school MAG
lists that the evaluation team received. In this case, there were villages where only one or two MAG members
were based, and where partly no community or religious leader training or community discussion had taken place
(or only one of the two had taken place). Thus, there was variation in the degree of implementation, with cases
where not the whole package was delivered to one village but only particular components.
29
4.4 COVERAGE
4.4.1 Reachability and participation of the intended target groups
The MAG interventions were to a large extent able to reach and engage participants from the intended groups.
Pre-established selection criteria aimed at the age group of 10 to 19 years, with a gender balance (50% girls, 50%
boys) and more out-of-school than in-school children (generally 12 out of 20). The findings show that there was
sufficient awareness by teachers and community leaders regarding these criteria, thus helping to largely reach
and engage participants with the intended characteristics.
Besides the criteria of minimum and maximum age, gender balance and the proportion of out-of-school children,
no other clear criteria for inclusion/exclusion of adolescents in the MAG were mentioned by interviewees. This
points to a lack of clarity in the communication of the full criteria for joining MAGs and/or the fact that the criteria
were not uniformly applied in MAG formation. Also, it is not clear whether the information about the possibility
to join the MAGs was available to all potentially interested adolescents in the schools or villages. Some MAG mem-
bers described being selected through teachers or headteachers at their school or by community members (e.g.,
heads of councils), while others noted that they had not heard of the group but were interested to participate
when they found out, and therefore joined at a later stage. There were also accounts that the implementers’ staff
stepped in, for example, to avoid cases where more than one adolescent from the same family was selected. The
lack of communication around the selection criteria and the seemingly limited information available about the
MAGs may thus have led to selection bias, e.g., more motivated and/or outspoken adolescents being selected for
participation.
According to the interviews with programme staff and mentors, there were generally enough in-school and out-
of-school adolescents in a village to create a MAG, although where this requirement was not met, the range was
expanded to nearby villages. School teachers, headmasters, local councils, and village leaders could be involved
in the selection of adolescents according to the predefined criteria. MAG mentors mentioned that in some MAGs
more than 20 adolescents were interested in taking part, although this was not possible due to lack of financing.
Adolescents were told that they would in any case benefit as a result of cascade learning activities. There was also
evidence that during the programme some adolescents dropped out and had to be substituted. Adolescents who
joined later said that they wished they would have been there since the beginning of the programme.
The guideline of 12 out-of-school children seems to have been generally followed, although some of the MAGs
interviewed had different compositions, including 50% of in and out-of-school children, or also in some cases just
a few out of school children when these could not be recruited. The groups were reported to have been split
equally in terms of gender, though, as discussed in Section 4.1.2, there were issues regarding the enrolment of
girls, particularly at the beginning, as some families had reservations or even objections about this activity.
MAG members and mentors interviewed stated that most adolescents attended the MAGs regularly, with ab-
sences being limited to few students. Many mentioned attending MAGs twice a week, per the planned structure,
while some reported lower frequencies such as once a week, twice a month or even once a month in some cases.
Problems with attendance of at least some members were mentioned for most groups, which reflected adoles-
cents’ living conditions described above.
One of the most common issues was limited accessibility and mobility brought by winter, including snow and rain
and the impacts of muddy roads. The distances to/from the MAG premises influenced this issue. Particularly,
students who lived further away from the MAG centre mentioned these problems and reported attending more
regularly in summer than in winter.
While the MAG interventions were able to reach and engage the desired participants, findings from the qualitative
study revealed several factors causing differential participation and performance in MAGs: age, gender, literacy,
poverty, family support and training methodology/style.
With regard to age, the majority of the participants indicated that older teenagers engaged more with the training
contents and grasped them faster than the younger ones. This implied a challenge for mentors to make the teach-
ings understandable and engaging for the different age groups. The influence of the critical factors gender and
literacy on participation and performance have been discussed in separate sub-sections (4.1.2, 4.1.3, and 4.3.2).
Poverty and lack of family support were important issues affecting adolescents’ attendance and participation in
MAGs. Adolescents from poverty-stricken families who needed to work or who were not encouraged by their
families to participate had more challenges to engage in the MAGs and take full advantage of these. These condi-
tions included the need to do farm work in the case of boys, which particularly affected their attendance in spring,
while girls often had to attend to house chores and other work at home. Lack of parental support particularly
affected girls (see Section 4.1.2). Beyond the notion that further support was needed for participants from pov-
erty-stricken families, no specific strategies seem to have been pursued for ensuring the retention of these vul-
nerable adolescents. There is evidence also of some students no longer attending the MAG (who then needed to
be replaced), which is one of the reasons that refreshers of life skills trainings needed to be offered.
With regard to the training methodology/style, the findings reveal that the traditional approach (reading and
writing) was beneficial mainly for literate adolescents (the majority of whom were in school), as opposed to illit-
erate out-of-school adolescents, who could only internalize the contents taught through practical sessions, in the
30
form of storytelling, role play, games, painting, and drawing. However, the practical sessions were also preferred
by literate adolescents, as they found them more engaging.
“Some of those teenagers had family problems, and some of them were disabled so they needed to be encouraged.
So, their courage and self-reliance could be increased. And they were taken care of by the boss”. (IDI 60, MAG Mentor,
Bamyan, M)
4.4.2 Role of gender in participation
The effects of gender on MAG attendance were mixed. Some MAGs stated that boys were more absent than girls,
while others noted that girls were more absent due to family issues. Other groups noted no gender-related differ-
ences in attendance. In the case of girls, the most common challenge derived from families’ lack of support to their
participation in the MAGs in the face of prevailing social and gender norms. Adolescents in both provinces re-
counted that some families had issues with allowing girls to come to the MAGs, which affected attendance, par-
ticularly at the beginning of the intervention. There were accounts of girls who had to be substituted as they were
not able to join and of girls having difficulties to take part because of social and gender norms. The situation seems
to have become better over time, as both some adolescents and mentors invested considerable efforts to convince
families to allow their daughters to participate.
“In the beginning, when the course was created, many families did not allow their daughters to stay in the MAG.
Finally, we convinced the people of the community, with difficulty.” (IDI 30, MAG Mentor, Badghis, F)
“The girls were interested themselves, but their fathers would not let their daughters. However, this has been re-
solved later, and an example of this was with a girl [in my group], for whom I talked to her father.” (IDI 81, MAG
Mentor, F, Bamyan)
On the perceptions of boys’ and girls’ performance in the trainings and overall learning in the MAGs, results are
mixed. Some mentors mentioned that girls and boys developed the skills equally, with no significant differences
between them, while other mentors reported that girls had performed better than boys in their groups – which
is remarkable, given girls’ more difficult starting positions, with a tendency of lower levels of confidence. One
respondent linked this to the fact that they were older, and older adolescents were reported to have achieved an
overall better understanding. Girls were generally found to show higher levels of participation and interest.
“At first girls were very low on courage and could not share their opinion; near the end of the programme girls also
were better.” (IDI 60, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, M)
“There is nothing without challenge and difficulties. When we went to Yakawlang the students had such low courage
that they couldn’t say their names or say something in front of the class. After we trained them, we saw lots of
changes at them, of course not one hundred percent but it was good, even there was no difference between girls and
boys” (IDI 62, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, F)
“According to my observations and those of most of my colleagues, the participation of girls was much higher than
boys. Girls are very interested in studying and doing these things.” (IDI 28, MAG Mentor, Badghis, F)
The higher levels of motivation and participation of girls was linked to their tendency to be out of school and have
less access to educational opportunities, which the MAG could now offer to them.
“They have never given a chance to the girls. And those groups were the first place where girls could participate a
lot. The girls were absent less than boys and participated more than boys.” (IDI 60, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, M)
“Most of the girls were more involved and active, because they were from the illiterate class. These girls were more
interested in these trainings, because they were deprived of schools and did not participate in any other courses in
the field of education, but the boys showed less interest because they had previously participated in educational
centres.” (IDI 28, MAG Mentor, Badghis, F)
MAG members who considered that there were no differences in terms of participation only described differences
regarding boys’ and girls’ preferences for different activities, such as leadership and sports for boys and culture
and expression for girls.
“Interest was the same. There was no difference. But there are some activities that girls are interested in and some
activities that boys are interested in, for example in culture committee girls are interested and in sport committee
boys are interested.” (IDI 62, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, F)
Some adolescents mentioned feelings of shame or shyness to speak in the presence of the opposite sex, but
the overall experience in the mixed gender groups seems to have been positive for both, and the structure
of the MAG seems to have facilitated participation. Mentors and MAG members reported overall that boys'
and girls’ voices were equally heard in the context of the MAG and decision-making.
4.4.3 Inclusiveness of vulnerable groups
The findings reveal that to a large extent, the interventions fostered inclusiveness of boys and girls and out-of-
school children in MAG member selection and participation through their core selection crtieria. However, socio-
economic conditions of families in the target areas, parental support, and learning and integration difficulties
linked to illiteracy were key conditions affecting participation and retention of the most vulnerable. Moreover,
there was no criteria reported by interviewees for selection of adolescents with disability.
31
Evidence indicates that community profiling was done with support from local councils and village leaders, and
thereafter vulnerable adolescents were selected and integrated into MAGs. Furthermore, the MAGs also deliber-
ately looked for vulnerable adolescents who were out of school to join and enjoy the benefits of MAGs.
“During the survey, first I got the profile of the whole village. Our next thing was meeting for the selection of mem-
bers. We tried to give a role to those who were vulnerable, which should be included in the committees and groups.”
(KII 2, Programme staff, Bamyan, M)
MAGs reached the target of having a significant percentage of out-of-school children, many of which were illit-
erate. As discussed in detail in Section 4.1.3, these groups faced challenges and needed more support than in-
school children. Programme staff thus made adjustments to meet the needs of these vulnerable groups by incor-
porating more visual and interactive teaching methods, by offering activities for literacy teaching, and by request-
ing the support of in-school MAG members. Yet, mentors noted consistently that illiterate adolescents showed
less engagement with the topics and that it was more difficult to retain them throughout the programme. The mix
of literate and illiterate children also proved challenging for their teaching activities.
Poverty and lack of family support were also important issues affecting adolescents’ attendance and participation
in MAGs. Regarding poverty and adolescents’ need to work, no other specific strategies were outlined for ensuring
the retention of this group of vulnerable adolescents. The lack of parental support, which particularly affected the
participation of girls, was addressed by considerable efforts to convince families to allow their children to partic-
ipate (see Section 4.4.2).
Besides the criteria of age (10-19 years old), gender (50% girls, 50% boys) and out-of-school children (preferably
12 out of 20), there were no additional criteria for the inclusion/exclusion of adolescents. It is also not clear
whether the information regarding the possibility to join the MAGs was available to all potentially interested ad-
olescents (see Section 4.4.1). The lack of further selection criteria, the potentially lacking spread of information
about the MAGs to all potentially interested adolescents, and the selection through teachers, headteachers, and
community members/leaders may have led to selection bias, for example, in favour of more motivated and/or
outspoken adolescents being selected for participation.
Additional selection criteria beyond age, gender, and out-of-school children, such as the socio-economic status of
families and disability, combined with specific support strategies for the most vulnerable, more systematic en-
gagement of parents to foster their support (e.g., educational programmes directed at parents), and a stronger
focus on activities for illiterate children in programme design could foster the participation and retention of the
most vulnerable groups.
4.4.4 Parents’ support and reception of MAGs and community discussions
Parental support was found to be a key factor in adolescents’ engagement with MAGs, with evidence showing that
adolescents who were supported by their families were more likely to perform better and take more advantage
of the MAGs than those whose parents were not involved or encouraging. The evaluation found that there was
some resistance towards MAG groups from parents in many communities, especially at the start of the interven-
tion. There were parents who opposed the groups or did not authorize their children to join. Parental permission
was a precondition for participation. Thereby, gender likely played a role in intra-family decision making. Alt-
hough our data is not conclusive on this aspect, we note that four of the fathers interviewed mentioned that they
had ‘allowed’ their children to study and take part in the MAG (with one of them mentioning both parents), while
only one mother explicitly mentioned this dimension of ‘allowing’ her daughter to take part. Furthermore, the
discussions about overall decision making in the household revealed that parents, and more frequently fathers
and elders, took precedence over adolescents.
There is evidence from all sets of stakeholders that, over time, parents, regardless of gender, became more sup-
portive of the groups and their children’s participation in them, as they realised that their children’s learning
outcomes were positive for them as a result of the sensitization efforts of programme staff and IALA activities.
The local concerns about the activities in the MAGs translated into having observers or groups of observers from
the community who were present at MAG meetings and sessions. This ‘observer’ or ‘supervisory’ role was men-
tioned more frequently by fathers than mothers interviewed.
“I did not agree at first, but when I saw that my son had changed a lot, I was very happy with the lessons.” (IDI 27,
MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
“When I monitored this programme and saw that it was very useful and self-contained. I monitored them and first
found that they were learning knowledge and literacy, setting in the community and how to talk with people.” (IDI
42, MAG Parent, Bamyan, F)
“Yes, I participated; I was supervising the courses that how are they studying and what kinds of activities are they
doing.” (IDI 7, MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
Mentors mentioned that most parents were collaborative, and sometimes even joined the groups’ activities, alt-
hough they also reported that there was little cooperation in some areas, particularly in smaller villages. Mentors
and programme staff also pointed out that without parental support, activities would not have been possible.
“Yes, most of them, especially the girls’ parents, collaborated with us. The girls’ parents were coming once a week
and monitored. In addition, sometimes they participated with us.” (IDI 31, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
32
“No programme could be implemented without support. For example, 1,500 members participated in a literacy
programme that had the consent of the community and their parents. Otherwise, no one would have participated.
The enrolment of 1,200 people in the school was also done with the consent of the parents. […] the members of the
group knew that they had the support of their parents, and if they had not supported them, nothing would have
happened.” (KII 1, Programme staff, Bamyan, M)
The majority of parents interviewed (both fathers and mothers) were aware of the activities that their children
took part in at MAGs, with only a few parents who did not know about them. Many also reported to have partici-
pated sometimes by attending meetings to understand what was being discussed and what their children were
learning in those spaces.
Parental knowledge about the MAG was a factor in their participation, as shown by the fact that those who were
not knowledgeable did not take part, but it was not a sole defining factor. Also, parental support of MAGs is not
exclusively linked to high levels of knowledge of MAG activities, as it seemed sufficient for parents to perceive
that the activities were valuable in teaching their children to be supportive. This is shown by cases where parents
were not very informed but still were supportive of their children when they had the perception that valuable
knowledge was being provided to them. All parents expressed satisfaction that their children were learning new
and useful things and that this had positive impacts on them, thus placing a high value on education – even when
this had not been the case prior to the MAGs. Some fathers highlighted a communal dimension in their value of
MAGs, mentioning that the programme allowed adolescents to learn something that would be useful/for the bet-
terment of their communities.
Although parental support was not exclusively linked to their knowledge of MAGs, increased parental knowledge
about the activities and communication with their children generally favoured greater engagement, as parents
got to know about upcoming activities by their children, such as trainings or discussions; had the opportunity to
get involved by looking/appreciating their work; or discussed with their teachers their learning, thus offering a
more supportive learning environment for their children. Furthermore, most parents who talked with their chil-
dren about MAG activities, had taken part at least once or sometimes in either MAGs or community discussions,
while those who did not discuss, had not done so. Yet, this intergenerational communication was not a sole defin-
ing factor in parental involvement.
As per design, MAGs were still perceived as something that the adolescents did, and thus parents were not con-
sidered a target audience with a specific involvement expected. Therefore, their participation seems to have been
based mostly on individual possibilities, time availability, dedication, and perceived relevance of this involve-
ment. Parents also do not seem to have been specifically targeted as ‘multipliers’, and only in very few cases, there
were descriptions of them having discussed the topics of IALA with community members (e.g., neighbours, other
families) to spread the knowledge or promote changes.
4.4.5 Support of community and religious leaders to adolescents for MAG and
community discussions
In addition to parents, members of the village councils and leaders, as well as school staff were involved and
supporting the MAG activities.
Reports from mentors suggest that at the beginning there was resistance by community leaders and members to
accept adolescents’ activities, considering their role in society, but this situation got better over time as they could
see that activities had good outcomes and benefits. Moreover, they mentioned that the trainings provided to lead-
ers were useful to help solve their problems of acceptance.
“Sure, they met with Imams, village members, and elders. If they had a problem, at first, the people of the society
didn’t accept them, but after seeing the activities of the teenagers, the people and the society asked for help from
Multiple Adolescent Groups’ group”. (IDI 62, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, F)
“In some places they were very cooperative with us and helped us with many of our problems, but in other places
they were very opposed. But in general, the opposition was not significant. Because the training had already been
provided to them by UNICEF, which had decreased some of our problems.” (IDI 81, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, M)
Supportive community and religious leaders took part in MAGs in various ways: as monitors or supervisors of the
activities, to ensure learning outcomes were relevant, appropriate and achieved; as referential people providing
guidance, information and discussing with children about their rights; and as facilitators for MAG activities and
problem resolution.
“We talked to the teenagers three to four times, and our discussions were about the Islamic beliefs, to learn healthy
ethics and to prevent them from doing hard labours.” (IDI 34, CL, Badghis, M)
“We met with them once a week and asked about their own rights and asked them what they learned. Always we
observed them.” (IDI 32, CL, Badghis, M)
There is evidence that adolescents reached out to religious and community leaders to discuss children’s rights,
and that the former were supported by the latter to consult about or address problems, but the evidence is not
uniform across MAGs. Almost half of the adolescents interviewed mentioned to have talked to leaders about some
issue of concern, most times in the context of the MAGs; of these, seven were girls. The rest of the adolescents
interviewed reported to not have reached out to leaders about any issues or problems and stated that they go to
their families in these cases. Adolescents who discussed issues with religious and community leaders mentioned
33
mostly the topics of early marriage, access to education, and harmful practices such as high dowry, and in some
cases also other topics such as healthcare and environment.
“Yes, several seminars were held, all members of the community came to participate, and community leaders from
the council chairman and their chairman came to our classrooms and closely monitored the project, where they
were learning new things”. (IDI 38, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
"A: Yes, I shared with the Imam about underage marriage, and he also shared it with people.
Q: How did you approach them, how did you address them and what was their reaction to you?
A: Their response was positive and he supported me. This is the only way to reach our goals.” (IDI 63, MAG Mem-
ber, Bamyan, F)
Through the MAGs, the life-skill trainings, the support from leaders and the interactions during community dis-
cussions, many MAG members experienced improved relationships between them and other community mem-
bers, including mutual respect, higher familiarity with each other and comfort to freely express their opinions.
This improved relationship with their communities were further backed by parents and MAG mentors inter-
viewed, who highlighted adolescents’ improved behaviour and respect.
“My relationship with community become cordial, and I participated in each discussion held in the community and
expressed my opinion. […] At the moment, my relationship with the community is very good. This relationship has
increased since I joined MAG and my knowledge has increased. After that, my value in the community has increased”.
(IDI 2, MAG Member, Badghis, M)
“Yes, the changes have taken place, for example, the observance of mutual respect. […] Mutual respect increased in
the community”. (IDI 64, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
“Yes, it is different. Before, I was unfamiliar with my community, but now people know me, and I also know them”.
(IDI 57, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
4.4.6 Participation of community members in Community Discussions
Results from the interviews show that community discussions took place in almost all areas targeted by IALA.
Only a few MAG members mentioned that community meetings had not been organised in their location (IDI 01,
MAG Member, Badghis, F).
While there was no clear pattern regarding the frequency of the meetings, they were either held periodically once
per month, sometimes three times in total, partly for two days in a row, or based on necessity that religious or
community leaders usually identified. Rooms in the villages were made available for these activities. Discussions
were sometimes held at mosques, while in other cases other places in the community were found, such as houses
belonging to council members.
“It continued for three days, and we invited most of the families which had children to learn about the rights and
needs of children and how they can make facilities for the education of them. It was held in mosques” (IDI 32, CL,
Badghis, M)
“Yes, there was a programme that was held in the mosque for two days and all members of our community partici-
pated in it”. (IDI 57, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
When interviewed about IALA activities at community level, parents mentioned not only discussions that were
organised as separate events by IALA, but also informal discussions as well as formal teachings by Imams inte-
grating the relevant topics, e.g., children rights and gender equality during prayers on Fridays. In this way, it is
clear that conversations about the topics taught by IALA were held at community level in different formats and
occasions, not just for the case of organised discussions.
“There is no set time and whenever it is available, for example, if there is any party, ceremony, event or reciting the
Quran; those who have taken the course transfer their information in those places”. (IDI 33, RL, Badghis, M)
“Currently, the situation is good. It’s done due to the necessity of the people. If there is a problem for the people, they
gather in the mosque and each of us expresses his views among the people”. (IDI 27, MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
Regarding participation in community discussions, there were no reports that certain community members were
not allowed to attend. On the contrary, both fathers and mothers confirmed to have taken part in the meetings,
partly as families, partly individually, as well as adolescents themselves, sometimes alongside with elders and
other persons holding leadership positions.
“There were other mothers, there were members of the community, there were leaders, there were Imams and cler-
gies as well”. (IDI 3, MAG Parent, Badghis, F)
For some discussions, they were divided into groups, however, it was usual for men and women to talk separately:
“Yes, it was done for girls and boys separately, and in some cases for older women, it was done by IALA”. (IDI 34,
MAG CL, Badghis, M)
“We trained men in a mosque and my assistant, who is a woman, trained women in their houses. We talked about
life skills, early marriage, and children rights.” (IDI 32, CL, M, Badghis)
Generally, community members seemed interested in the discussions, mentioned that these had been useful for
their communities, and reported to have appreciated receiving knowledge about their children’s rights, which
34
they had not been aware of before. Parents, mentors, and leaders mentioned that the level of awareness and un-
derstanding of community members was overall raised on issues such as child marriage, the importance of edu-
cation, and the rights of girls. The fact that children’s rights were transmitted according to Islam teachings made
the communities more receptive, as they considered something that was relevant to their contexts and not some-
thing that, for example, ‘came from abroad’.
“In general, these discussions made the people of our society more aware and more literate. People became aware
of the rights of their daughters, understood what rights their daughters have, what they should do, and what they
should not do. (IDI 3, MAG Parent, Badghis, F)
„It was greatly useful. Now people are accepting girls’ and women's rights. Also tell them to go to school and get an
education and now most of them are going to school.“ (IDI 53, MAG Parent, Bamyan, M)
Resistance was, however, experienced by some community members, although in every case, interviewees
acknowledged that this was not the majority of the participants, referring only to ‘some’ or ‘a few’ families that
had qualms with the messages transmitted. These included doubts on allowing girls’ education instead of them
staying home, resistance to not allowing early marriage when parents have entitlements over their children, and
discussions on child labour. Generally, interviewees associated more resistance with families who were illiterate
and/or of low economic means, but this could not be objectively verified by the qualitative study, as most parents
in the sample had positive reactions despite their illiteracy. In our sample, mixed community reactions were re-
ported in various villages in Badghis (Baghlar zad Morad, Dahan Baghak, Darwish Mohammadi, Khoda Amadaha)
as well as in Saigan and Yakawlang districts in Bamyan.
“Some of them showed negative reactions but some of them were happy because they were aware of their daughters’
rights.” (IDI 17, MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
“Yes, not all of them have changed their way of thinking, but many of these people understood that early marriage
is not a good thing and their children's rights should be taken into consideration.” (IDI 27, MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
Other challenges were found to get community members to participate in trainings and discussions, which were
the lack of incentives like financial incentives, transport costs or food were given at these occasions.
“Yes, some people don’t listen well and do not realize its importance. Some of them were not attending at all. More
importantly, most of them paid attention to the financial aspect of the programmes, which we did not have anything
to give them. That is why their attention was low and more towards the financial aspect of the programmes. In
total, these were the problems which I faced”. (IDI 77, RL, Bamyan, F)
Out of those who did not show interest, MAG members observed that some regretted their lack of interest later,
once they saw how adolescents improved their skills and benefited from the activities.
4.5 EFFECTIVENESS
4.5.1 Transfer of knowledge to adolescents and building of life skills
Overall, MAG members inter-
viewed reported to have gained
new knowledge and skills that al-
lowed them to make positive
changes in their lives and to pro-
mote change through knowledge
sharing and awareness raising.
The LST taught adolescents about
topics that they did not have
awareness of or knowledge about
before. Adolescents reported to
not have discussed the topics of
life skills trainings prior to the in-
volvement in the MAGs, as they did
not have information about them,
and lacked the skills and confi-
dence to do this.
“My experience by this training goes to the learning of life skill and setting of goals on which previously I had no
idea and now I am able to implement these skills in my life.” (IDI 2, MAG Member, Badghis, M)
“I had no information about self-esteem before and had even not heard its name. The other thing on which I had
no information was conflict. After joining MAG, I have learned these topics, which are new for me.” (IDI 57, MAG
Member, Bamyan, F)
In terms of the skills gained through the LST, adolescents highlighted the improvement of their decision-making,
and goal setting, strengthened self-confidence, and improved expression of emotions, particularly stress
35
management, anger management, and the learning of empathy. They highlighted that the knowledge and skills
gained were relevant to their lives and had applied at least some of them after MAGs. All adolescent respondents
reported to have improved their communication and interpersonal relationship skills, with most expressing that
this had happened both within and outside their homes. They mentioned that they had learned how to talk to
others, to express their feelings and their problems, and they had generally improved their interpersonal rela-
tionships. Moreover, they expressed greater confidence in themselves, for example to speak out in class to other
peers and to get involved in community outreach activities.
“I felt good, because we went to learn something and we had the courage to go in front of the classes, we stood in
front of the class, in front of all of my classmates and talked about an issue, for example, decision-making for in-
creasing our courage, so both our behaviour and our courage increased.” (IDI 26, MAG Member, Badghis, M)
“We did not participate before the youth committee and did not understand many things. After participation, now
we became aware of many things. When you meet someone in the community; be nice, talk well. Now, for example,
if my companion has a problem, and she always fights with me, I will take her intention away from me, I should not
accompany her in the fight. If they wanted to go to war with you, you have to treat them well.” (IDI 50, MAG Member,
Bamyan, F)
Parents and mentors backed these findings on adolescents’ acquisition of communication skills, expressing that
adolescents’ behaviour with their families and community had improved since joining the MAG, and frequently
mentioned an improved ability to establish relationships with others. Moreover, in most cases they confirmed
that adolescents were talking more inside the home and sharing their problems with them.
“Her politeness and education increased, and she had a good behaviour with other girls.” (IDI 11, MAG Parent,
Badghis, F)
“Before joining the group, the teenagers had very little communication, but after joining this group, they can com-
municate well with everyone, for example, between committee members and so on.” (IDI 65, MAG Parent, Bamyan,
M)
“Yes, he has changed a lot in the past, he could not tell us about his problems, but when the stress is gone, he can
express his feelings well.” (IDI 27, MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
“At first, he did not have good relationships outside, but after the MAG he became very good, he made good friends.”
(IDI 27, MAG Parent, M, Badghis)
“It was about that how to make decisions and building trust between each other. In addition, it was really focused
on making friends and on how to be a social person.” (IDI 21, MAG Member, F, Badghis)
Adolescents also mentioned to have improved the expression of their emotions, highlighting in particular the
management of stress, of anger, and the learning of empathy.
“We did not know how to sympathize or empathize with someone’s in sorrow and the teacher were always talking
about self confidence that we do not knew. After this class we knew what these are, and we put it into practice.” (IDI
24, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
“Controlling the anger, we liked them very much, because we did not understood things like that […] We benefited
a lot from them. Many of us controlled their anger. (IDI 43, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
Decision-making and goal setting is another skillset highlighted by interviewed adolescents after their participa-
tion in MAGs. They reported to have acquired knowledge as well as practical experience on how to make decisions
and how to set goals, and they underscored the importance that this has brought to their lives. Their expressions
pointed to a clear sense of empowerment. Parents and MAG mentors also identified an improvement in decision
making by the adolescents.
“A: Yes, of course. For instance, the decision making; it really helped me to solve very big problems.
Q: If you could choose the most important thing you learned from the life skills training, what would it be?
A: Being a goal-oriented person. We need to have certain goals in our life to change our life.” (IDI 21, MAG Member,
Badghis, F)
“It was much better than before, in the beginning, he could not make good decisions, but now he is very good at
making decisions.” (IDI 22, MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
“Yes, she participated in life skill training and learned to decide in her life, and she was good in her lessons.” (IDI 25,
MAG Parent, Badghis, F)
In addition, adolescents showed strengthened feelings of confidence in themselves after undergoing the trainings
and experience of the MAGs. This included trusting their own capabilities, being able to make decisions for them-
selves, as well as speaking up in their groups and talking to others outside of these (family and community mem-
bers). Adult roles including parents and MAG mentors confirmed this finding, considering that children had
clearly more courage than before in their lives, and they saw this through their interaction with their peers, family
and community members, as well as in their abilities to express themselves and make decisions.
“Self-confidence is very important. Since we saw the workshops, my self-confidence has become very strong, and we
highly recommended this to our other friends.” (IDI 46, MAG Member, Bamyan, M)
“[….] after that, our studying level has increased and when I wanted to make a decision, I believed in myself. I was
sure that I can do this.” (IDI 18, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
36
“In the past, a child could not talk properly or make decisions about their life, but now their courage has increased,
they can make good decisions and tell the family about their problems.” (IDI 39, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
“Yes, there have been many changes in my life. I did not understand many issues. I could not defend my rights. After
this programme, I defend from my rights. I continued my studies and prevented early marriages.” (IDI 20, MAG
Member, Badghis, F)
The knowledge and skills developed through the LST seems to have helped adolescents to face challenges identi-
fied at the beginning of the programme, such as access to education and the harmful effects of child marriage. As
a result of their increased confidence as well as their decision-making and goal-setting skills, adolescents felt
encouraged about making decisions in their lives and seeking to achieve goals, which has motivated them for
instance to return to school, to pay more attention to their studies, to convince their parents to allow them to do
so, and to motivate their peers that this was a worthwhile goal. Aware of their rights and empowered to set goals
and make decisions, adolescents sensitised their parents to support their education, with the belief that this could
enable them to have better opportunities, including working in well-regarded professions with a stable income
in the future (e.g., becoming doctors, teachers, lawyers, engineers) and getting involved in the improvement of
their own communities.
“… my family did not understand, after I told them about children's rights, they understood that they should send
my sister and younger brother to school for studying.” (IDI 26, MAG Member, M, Badghis)
“…[the] MAG causes that they find information about education and training and life skills. The education and train-
ing caused some students to go and recognize the people that they were not going to school with, and they taught
them and gave them motivation.” (IDI 31, MAG Mentor, M, Badghis)
Thus, the new knowledge and skills acquired seem to have prompted an overall sense of empowerment among
adolescents, which has changed relations with their parents (Section 4.5.3) and facilitated their active engage-
ment to promote awareness and changes in their communities (Section 4.5.4).
4.5.2 Adolescents’ communication within peers and the cascade learning ap-
proach
Adolescents felt that sharing their knowledge with others was their duty, as a main point of the group was aware-
ness, according to what they had been instructed in the MAGs, and they described to have worked both inside and
outside of school to share their knowledge with others. This finding coincides with the midline evaluation, where
MAG members were found to have communicated with various types of community members in and out of school,
including both younger and older in-school students, out-of-school adolescents, family members, friends, and
neighbours. As the summative evaluation, unlike the midline, did not cover non-MAG members in the sampling,
the effectiveness of adolescents’ peer-to-peer learning practices cannot be ascertained, as all data regarding this
approach can only be considered from the perspectives of the knowledge multipliers.
Adolescents did not report the exact numbers of people with whom they had shared the MAG learning outcomes
within their communities (of the required 15-20 people per group monthly). Yet, the interviews clearly indicate
that all but one of the adolescents had reached out to their peers to discuss the MAG topics, especially to their
friends and classmates, and that most had also discussed one or more topics with their families or other commu-
nity members (e.g., neighbours). Although in many cases adolescents seemed to have mentored others in their
immediate surroundings (friends, classmates, family), there are also accounts of MAG members who became very
active in knowledge sharing, making sure to expand their mentoring practice to people in the village. There were
many accounts of adolescents taking part in informal campaigns to raise awareness of the issues learnt at the
MAGs, e.g., going door-to-door to families to increase awareness about the importance of education. Adolescents
also promoted their peers to follow the same process and share the knowledge with others to expand the chain.
“I talk to my other friends, and they talk about anger and other topics and the topics that were discussed in the
group I shared with them. I shared good topics with them, and they were very happy.” (IDI 54, MAG Member, M,
Bamyan)
"A: Yes, I always discussed with my village girls about our lessons and other materials in our village.
Q: What was your discussion about?
A: We have discussed about confidence, stress and making decisions." (IDI 10, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
"I have contacted to 10 to 15 teenagers including my cousins, sisters and my students about this course and telling
them about this course […] I told them that do not accept underage marriages which is detrimental for your future,
be courageous and you should study if you want to have a bright future.” (IDI 24, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
Most mentoring exchanges seemed to have happened in informal settings, including gatherings, meetings, in their
houses, or even during agricultural activities. In addition, some more ‘formal’ and systematic mentoring experi-
ences were described, including MAG members sharing contents in class at school and carrying out organised
campaigns for awareness of certain key topics, such as early marriage or education. This finding is also in line
with the results of the midline evaluation, which found that mentoring sessions took place in a variety of contexts,
including on the way to school, on the way to collect water, at religious gatherings, in the mosque, and at home.
“Yes, I taught something that I learned in MAG to my friends, school classmates, and at home for my family. Every
day that I am free, with 5 or 6 children, we discuss education, sports, making decisions, having goals.” (IDI 12, MAG
Member, Badghis, F)
37
“Yes, I discussed it more at MAG and it is very important. We talked about the bad consequences of child marriage
and gave information to our classmates. We campaigned outside of MAG.” (IDI 57, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
“Our plan was that sir, how to pass on what we have learned here to others. We made great efforts to fulfil our
responsibilities. We usually worked inside and outside of the school as a result people changed a lot. We publicized
and people listened to us.” (IDI 64, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
Overall, the MAG members interviewed reported feeling confident and comfortable with transferring their new
knowledge on life skills to their peers. In most cases, they expressed having had positive experiences with men-
toring, with peers being receptive to their efforts and feeling happy about the contents they learned. Only a few
adolescents in our sample reported not feeling too comfortable about the experience (e.g., due to others making
jokes or not pay attention to what they taught), and one male interviewee said they had not shared their MAG
learnings with others. In general, adolescents considered that the mentoring experience was useful, in the sense
that their peers could grasp the concepts they had shared, and many mentioned that through reaching out to
other peers they had also inspired to continue their education.
Adolescents mostly felt that they had gained enough knowledge to teach others, and when they run into issues,
they reported they usually consulted their MAG mentors. Regarding challenges for mentoring, adolescents men-
tioned the need to go over the contents more than once with their peers to make sure they understood them, as
this was sometimes difficult, in particular child protection contents. Mentoring was also reported to be particu-
larly challenging for them in the case of illiterate adolescents, for whom learning was more difficult. Furthermore,
some MAG members perceived some distrust from their peers and communities towards the activities, although
this usually got better over time, as people became sensitized with the MAGs’ work and the positive changes in
adolescents. MAG members mentioned to not always have utilized the monitoring forms when they taught. An-
other challenge related to the spaces for mentoring. Limitations on girls’ mobility, for example, created con-
straints for mentoring, as they could not go to other villages or move around in theirs with the same freedom as
boys. They hence tried to talk to others inside the schools, or when they met in other social contexts.
Most adolescents interviewed reported to have spread their knowledge about the harmful effects of child mar-
riage by discussing it with their peers and their families.
“Yes, I was gathering my peers. I was telling them about early marriage. ‘Do not get married until your education
is over and continue your education’, and also it was about setting goals and how to have a goal in our life.” (IDI 23,
MAG Member, Badghis, M)
Adolescents also informed others about the value of education. MAG participants tended to inspire their peers,
who had not participated in the MAGs, to go to school. In some cases, adolescents also involved community and
religious leaders to overcome the challenges of families who refused to send their children to school.
“For example, there were families that did not let their children to go to school, we (me and my family) talked to
them and told them about children rights and motivated them to let their children to go to school. Then, our
speeches affected them very well. Not only did they let their children to go to school but also they motivated them
to study for a bright and better future.” (IDI 21, MAG Member, Badghis, M)
Despite challenges faced by MAG members when sharing their knowledge, it appears that cascade learning was
feasible in the sense that they felt motivated to carry it through and showed to have practiced it in their daily
lives, particularly with peers and family members. It is clear that some adolescents were more active than others
in this work, depending on their level of outspokenness and confidence to talk to others about the topics, as well
as on their possibilities/limitations to carry it out based on their contexts.
One limitation of the present study, as mentioned, is that it did not include non-MAG adolescents. Therefore, the
quality of the knowledge delivery of the LST and its reception among non-MAG members cannot be analysed in
comparison with the midline’s results, which showed a somewhat limited level of awareness of MAG among non-
MAG members (35% and 43% of both adolescents and parents in the intervention villages in Badghis and Bamyan
respectively). From the stakeholders’ accounts in the qualitative interviews, it seems that adolescents’ sharing in
line with the cascade learning approach may not have been as systematic as core trainings and that it was more
selective in terms of contents. For example, in terms of the LST training, adolescents seemed to have shared what
was most important for them and what they remembered best, with some focusing on decision making and others
on confidence, anger management, or empathy. Moreover, there were differences in focus according to the sub-
committee activities that members were part of, e.g., in terms of education or sports. This said, the interviews
suggest that: i) the core contents regarding harmful effects of child marriage, importance of education, and at
least some of the key life skills learned were shared; ii) the mentoring model was useful to assert their knowledge,
confidence, and sense of empowerment, thus having its own positive outcome for MAG members themselves. For
learning outcomes to be potentiated in a future intervention, more extensive MAG groups or other models for
knowledge sharing can be pivoted to ensure that contents reach all eligible adolescents within a village.
Adolescents reported having learned to better relate to each other and establish relationships with peers and the
community overall through their trainings and MAG participation. Adolescents appear to have gained trust in
themselves and in their relationships with their peers and in many cases mentioned that they considered they
could help to solve not just their own but also their friends’ problems through consultation with them. However,
their family (mostly parents, but also siblings) was seen as the first point of reference in case of problems.
38
4.5.3 Adolescents’ communication within their families
The programme seems to have contributed to improving intergenerational communication among MAG mem-
bers’ families. Most adolescents and parents interviewed discussed topics of the MAGs at home, including early
marriage and its harmful effects, children rights, and life skills. They did so with varying degrees of depth. In some
families, they only discussed what they learned or what they had done on life skills or self-expression training,
while in others they shared the various topics addressed at MAGs. Most adolescents interviewed in both provinces
reported to have spread and discussed their knowledge about child marriage and education with their peers
(friends, school classmates, out of school children) and their families (parents, siblings, relatives from their ex-
tended family). This is aligned with the results of the midline evaluation, where adolescents reported sharing the
contents of the LST with their families and mentioned gaining the confidence and ability to speak to their parents
about issues of child marriage, education, and other harmful practices, without significant differences by gender.
“Before joining the MAG group with my daughter, our information about life skills was very low and it also
had no value for me. Now I know its value and have good information about how important life skills are
for her and other teenagers.” (IDI 66, MAG Parent, M, Bamyan)
“Yes, I explained issues which they didn’t understand, for example early marriage. I explained to them what
to do and what not to do." (IDI 4, MAG Member, M, Badghis)
“Yes, I talked about everything. For example, to have mutual respect for each other. I also talked about early
marriages, decision making and conflict solving.” (IDI 23, MAG Member, M, Badghis)
Very few parents interviewed (three out of the 24) were completely unaware of their children’s activities in the
MAGs, stating that the adolescents kept to themselves. Even in these cases where parents were not involved in
the process nor in the learning outcomes managed by their children, they were reportedly glad to see them stud-
ying and learning, as they placed a good value on this. Overall, adolescents seem to have been sharing the contents
of MAGs and LSTs, which in many cases they had not discussed before. The midline evaluation yielded similar
results, showing an increase in the (frequency of) discussion of these topics. In addition, from both parents and
MAG members’ accounts, we draw that in most cases, adolescents were talking more at home after taking part in
the MAG, and that they were sharing their problems more with their parents.
“Yes, he has changed a lot in the past, he could not tell us about his problems, but when the stress is gone, he can
express his feelings well.” (IDI 27, MAG Parent, M, Badghis)
“Before joining the teenager group, they did not come to me and did not discuss guides any problems or concerns
with me and their family members. Previously, it was considered a shame” (IDI 53, MAG Parent, M, Bamyan)
According to participants’ accounts (adolescents, parents, and mentors), most families’ reactions to adolescents
sharing the contents of the MAGs were positive, even though there were different levels of resistance. Some par-
ents, especially in smaller or more remote villages, still opposed the contents. The resistance or opposition seems
to have lessened over time, however, as parents and community members realized that their children were gain-
ing knowledge that they considered important or useful, and as they saw first-hand positive changes in their chil-
dren as they took part in the MAGs.
“At first, the reaction of the society was not good, for example, they were telling that you are young, why do you
want to do these things, but they got better as time passed by.” (IDI 81, MAG Mentor, F, Bamyan)
“In the past, they did not support their children very well but after a while when they found out about the course,
they supported their children […] at the end when they saw that these are good topics for themselves and their
families and has a positive result, then they supported them.” (IDI 30, MAG Mentor, F, Badghis)
After IALA, spaces seem to have opened up in terms of decision making for adolescents, though the extent of these
spaces differ. In line with the qualitative results from the midline evaluation, the summative evaluation found that
parents still feature as the main decision-makers in families (and most frequently the fathers). Yet, there is some
evidence of changes in family dynamics in line with the midline’s quantitative findings, showing an increase in
parents’ consideration of their children’s views: most of the adolescents interviewed reported to now have the
confidence to reach out to their families in matters that concern them and mentioned that they were voicing their
opinions, were consulted by their families, and/or took part in decisions, even if the final decision is the parents’.
At the same time, many parents expressed that they allowed their children to make decisions about their lives
(including daily life and education). This enlarged space had practical consequences for adolescents, as in many
cases it led to changes regarding their lives, such as attending school, with adolescents convincing their parents
to study. A major concern for parents was that their children should make the right decisions, and parental ap-
proaches in their daily life decision-making differed from having a consultative role (giving advice, guidance) to
a more active one, including approving or disapproving of decisions made.
“I let my daughter make any decision even if she decides to go abroad for studying. I will let her go. I trust my
daughter so much and I know she makes the right decision.” (IDI 25, MAG Parent, Badghis, F)
“If our child decides to share with us, I consider the current situation, that if our child's decision is good, we also
agree with him, if it is bad, I do not agree.” (IDI 27, MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
These effects of adolescents feeling more confident to voice their opinions and of parents increasingly taking their
children’s opinion into consideration, can be seen as an achievement towards fulfilling the Convention on the
Rights of the Child by respecting the child’s views.

4.5.4 Adolescent communication with leaders, policymakers, and authorities
Most adolescents interviewed mentioned to talk with their peers and family if they have a problem. There is evi-
dence of many adolescents also communicating problems to community and religious leaders, although this is
less common and not uniformly found in the qualitative sample. Around half of the adolescents interviewed
(seven of which were girls) reported to have spoken to someone with authority in their communities about prob-
lems or concerns for adolescents, although many of these experiences were in the context of the group-organised
activities by MAGs, such as campaigns. Thanks to their participation in MAGs, adolescents reported feeling more
empowered in daily life and eager to promote change with respect to harmful traditions and norms in their com-
munities, which sometimes included talking to authority figures. Respondents declining any communication
solely came from Bamyan province in our sample (and mostly from Shibar).
“I discussed the early marriage with him [religious leader] and asked that he should convey this message to every-
one.” (IDI 43, MAG Member, F, Bamyan)
“Yes, for example cleaning of the community; we talked to head of our village about cleaning of our village.” (IDI 4,
MAG Member, M, Badghis)
“Yes, it has changed completely. In the beginning, if they [adolescents] had any problems, they could not tell anyone,
they could not have the courage, but after the MAG, their courage increased. They participated in social discussions”.
(IDI 38, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
While most respondents communicated the topics of early marriage and the importance of education to various
actors in general, several adolescents, parents, and few mentors and community leaders further confirmed that
MAG participants had also reached out to authorities, particularly regarding early marriage. In the reported cases,
authorities mostly included religious leaders, community leaders, and council members. In these cases, MAG
members reported to seek advice from leaders for solving problems (IDI 23, MAG Member, Badghis, M) and for
general guidance on different issues (IDI 46, MAG Member, Bamyan, M) as this MAG member stated:
“Yes, I have talked to Mullah-Imam, elders, chairman of council. If I ever had a problem or concern to discuss”. (IDI
48, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
Some MAG members mentioned to have discussed about early marriage with religious and community leaders
not only to prevent specific cases, but also to generally support awareness-raising:
“Yes, we have discussed early marriage with Imam or elders of the community”. (IDI 64, MAG Member, Bamyan, F).
“About my decision, that you meant the decision maker of the community, I discussed the early marriage with him
that should convey this message to everyone. […] His reaction was supportive and accept it to convey this to com-
munity and people”. (IDI 43, MAG Member, Bamyan F)
Religious and community leaders confirmed this:
“Yes, they [adolescents] refer to us. For example, I said before if there was a problem or an issue, they refer to the
elders and the members of the council, so the elders were cooperating in the performances, or they were helping as
much as they could to solve the problems”. (IDI 35, RL, Badghis, M)
“Yes, they [adolescents] report us about problems of society like early marriages and discussed about them”. (IDI
32, CL, Badghis, M).
Other MAG members emphasized that they especially consult the Imam (more than other leaders) (IDI 54, MAG
member, Bamyan, M). Few added that that they talked to organisations to address issues related to poverty:
“Yes, I talked with many organisations that village people are poor specifically our family is poor, and we do not
have many things”. (IDI 24, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
MAG mentors added that adolescents did not only reach out to leaders for advice, but that leaders simultaneously
also asked for assistance from MAGs and appreciated the communication with them:
“Yes, the children were doing this with the mullahs and heads of council. They were discussing, and the members of
the community were happy for that”. (IDI 39, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
“Sure, they met with Imams, village people, and tribal leaders. If they had a problem, at first, the people of the soci-
ety didn’t accept them, but after seeing the activities of the teenagers, the people and the society asked for help
from Multiple Adolescent Groups’ group”. (IDI 62, MAG Mentor, F)
“They contacted the members of the council and the elders of the tribe, and they reacted positively to these talks”.
(IDI 28, MAG Mentor, Badghis, F)
The evaluation did not find evidence of adolescents’ communication with policy makers or other types of govern-
mental actors from the discussions held. This finding is in line with the midline evaluation, which found that ad-
olescents resorted to family members, followed by the head of the local shura, and religious leaders as their pri-
mary contact point for complaints, not child protection service providers. None of the adolescents interviewed at
endline mentioned child protection services when asked about a potential reference point or contact person for
problems or complaints affecting them, naming instead again their parents first (in most cases), or village lead-
ers/representatives (in a few cases). With regard to the latter, local councils were mentioned to be involved along
with village leaders in the prevention of early marriages or to promote someone’s access to school.
40
“We had a family whose 10-year-old daughters were prevented from going to school. Fortunately, with the cooper-
ation of the people and the local council, we were able to convince their father to join the school.” (IDI 63, MAG
Member, Bamyan, F)
“They did a lot of work in this field and even went to those houses and held campaigns in this section. On several
occasions they reported, and our staff went with the district governor to those areas. For example, in Ahangaran,
we had a case of underage marriage there. They went there and delayed the marriage and the family promised they
would get married by reaching the legal age, which is 18 years.” (KII 2, Programme staff, Bamyan, M)
Although communication between adolescents and policy makers cannot be shown, there is evidence that a few
parents of MAG members got involved with education offices and councils. Furthermore, programme staff have
reached out to government counterparts when cases were reported by MAG members.
4.5.5 Community mobilisation for increased awareness on child protection is-
sues and consensus building regarding social norms
Adolescents described various types of community outreach activities that they were involved in to raise aware-
ness about children’s rights and prevent harmful practices in their communities. One of the key actions was the
sharing of the knowledge they gained to peers, parents, and other community members. As mentioned, all ado-
lescents reported having reached out to their peers to talk about the topics learned at the MAGs, including life
skills, child marriage, and education, while most also expressed to have reached out as well to their families and
to other community members. Another action performed by MAG members involved talking to families of ado-
lescents who were not sending their children to school to convince them to do so, as well as to prevent child
marriages in cases where families were supporting this practice. Adolescents described doing this individually or
as part of wider campaigns organised with their MAGs. This type of cases constituted anecdotal evidence in the
midline evaluation. The summative evaluation yielded more reports in the sample about actions taken to reach
families on the mentioned topics in both provinces. Some adolescents mentioned that they had also reached out
to elders and heads of councils about these issues, although this was not the majority of interviewees.
“Yes, I talked about the fact that one of the issues is girls and boys going to school. I had information about those
who did not go to school and went there and talked to their parents. Fortunately, some of them send their children
to school. Now, I felt good that I did some work for the community which is good for youth improvement”. (IDI 57,
MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
“There was a meeting in the group, and it was said how we should do things. And it was decided that a literacy
group should go to the area and the women should study. We assign two members from the group to work as vol-
unteer teachers. One was me”. (IDI 64, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
“Q: What do you remember from these discussions?
A: I have good and bad memories. My good memory is that we persuaded several families to send their children to
school, but my bad memory is that some families do not even allow us to see their daughter at school”. (IDI 57,
MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
Furthermore, adolescents described the organisation of social actions to improve their communities, such as lit-
eracy and cleaning campaigns, tree planting, building toilets, health awareness (e.g., during COVID-19), and cul-
tural and sports activities to promote children’s rights (e.g., community theatre productions about early marriage,
sports competitions in football and volleyball featuring boys and girls). More details on this are available under
Section 4.4.6.
“For example, our very good school and group; we held planting campaigns and even each of them planted 4 to 5
plants by themselves to encourage people to plant 1000 trees in the area in a day. And there were cleaning cam-
paigns to collect all rubbish. Another one was going home to home with parents who did not allow them to go to
school, we talked to them and convinced them to allow their children to go to school.”. (IDI 62, MAG Mentor, Bamyan,
F)
“Some people were involved in garbage collection in Yakawlang and other groups were so active that they were
able to build 50 toilets for people who did not have a toilet”. (IDI 56, MAG Mentor, F)
“It [theatre we played] was about early marriage and held in a village so that people should get aware and know
about the harms of it”. (IDI 64, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
According to adult stakeholders, MAG members showed stronger community involvement than before joining the
MAG. Mentors and programme staff also acknowledged that adolescents had faced difficulties in their community
outreach activities, particularly at the beginning, when they faced more community resistance, as there was less
knowledge and understanding about their activities and less legitimacy to them. Community members did not
understand and/or opposed adolescents reaching out to discuss these topics. However, this changed over time
through sensitization and awareness work. In fact, many adolescents interviewed described feeling an improve-
ment in their status and respect of their communities towards them after participation in the MAGs. There is also
some evidence of adolescents being invited to community discussions.
“My relationship with society got stronger. As, we taught life skills to society our relationship was much stronger
than that in the past”. (IDI 21, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
“In the first place, the same kind that is not given a chance in the societies of Afghanistan and the suggestions made
by them are not considered, and if it is taken into account, it is very rare. At first, they did not believe in teenagers,
41
and we asked them to let them know what they are doing. Even some of the next members attended the elders'
meetings, which was remarkable”. (KII 1, Programme staff, Bamyan, M)
Yet, despite positive changes, adolescents’ outreach remains limited in view of their role in society. Even though
respect for adolescents has improved as a result of IALA, and spaces have opened up for them in terms of decision
making – as confirmed by various adult stakeholders, their capacity is still limited as they are not considered as
main decision makers in their homes and in their societies.
Outside of the MAGs and the community trainings and discussions, there is limited evidence of systematic com-
munity actions taken in our qualitative sample. The community mobilisations promoted through MAGs appear to
have been the strongest community actions taken. There is evidence of actions being taken by religious or com-
munity leaders to raise awareness, prevent some child marriages, or promote children to go to school (as de-
scribed in the section dedicated to leaders). Beyond this, the qualitative data does not provide profound evidence
of communities systematically engaging in concrete awareness actions beyond IALA initiated initiatives. Yet,
there are some reports of those who have taken part in community discussions, to have reached out to other
community members like neighbours on an individual case by case basis, and some reports of occasional discus-
sions (at the mosques or informally) regarding problems raised at community level. There is also a case reported
of the child protection committee continuing to operate.
Community discussions focused on the promotion of equal rights for boys and girls, the prevention of early mar-
riage, and child protection in general, as parents and mentors confirmed. According to parents, mentors, and
leaders, these were very helpful to increase community members’ awareness of children’s rights, which had been
very limited before.
“We had workshops, we had gender workshops, we had children's rights workshops at the centre and district level,
and we even gave children's rights workshops in all districts”. (IDI 57, MAG Mentor, F)
“After the MAG, the community has really changed. Because every activity which was done, was conveyed by the
people of that place and this chain continued very well and the people were informing each other”. (IDI 31, MAG
Mentor, Badghis, M)
“They were so happy that they said that we regret the violence that we had used against our youth and children, we
know these methods were wrong’, and in the case of restoring children’s and girls’ rights and preventing early mar-
riages, we even see one or two cases where people who have plans to change the society, they went into the village,
intervene and prevent underage marriages and forced marriages.” (KII 2, Programme staff, Badghis)
With regard to community mobilisation, not only adolescents themselves, but also parents participating in IALA
activities and involved leaders actively supported the raising of awareness on topics that they learnt or got trained
about through IALA. Council chairmen asked MAG members about challenges for instance, and religious leaders
made sure to stay informed about the programme activities and topics in order to be able to provide assistance
in addressing any problems, like cases of early marriages, or if members requested assistance to talk to families
about their children’s schooling.
Moreover, it should be noted that a certain level of increased awareness and changes to social norms seems to
have spread and established on a public level through the holistic targeting of different groups (adolescents, their
parents, community and religious leaders) that IALA employed. Many parents and several MAG mentors con-
firmed to have observed changed attitudes and behaviour in the whole community around them, like reduced
dowry prices, increased parental approval to send not only boys but also girls to school, together with increased
appreciation of literacy, and wider awareness about risks deriving from early marriages, such as higher likelihood
of divorce and vulnerable conditions for adolescents.
“In general, these discussions made the people of our society more aware and more literate. People became aware
of the rights of their daughters, understood what rights their daughters have, what they should do, and what they
should not do”. (IDI 3, MAG Parent, Badghis, F)
“Yes, there have been many changes in people realising that underage marriages are very harmful. And they said
that they should marry their daughters at the legal age. […] In the past, people were preventing their girls from
going to school, but now they are not prevented from doing so, except for a few families”. (IDI 7, MAG Parent,
Badghis, M)
“Yes, the mindset of the people has changed. Understanding that they should not marry their children at young ages
should not violate their rights. […] The girls of our village became literate. People increased the rights of girls. Early
marriages disappeared from the village”. (IDI 9, MAG Parent, Badghis, F)
“Few people said that education is good for boys, but when they learned about their children's rights, they realized
that education is for both. […] In the past, people's awareness was low, but now there is a lot of public awareness”.
(IDI 22, MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
“Right now, the situation is better than in the past, and our people’s awareness has increased”. (IDI 11, MAG Par-
ent, Badghis, F)
Despite evidence that the target communities have reached better awareness of children’s rights through the
combination of IALA’s activities, there is also evidence that not all community members have changed their views
and behaviours, particularly in areas further away from provincial centres and with more rural or traditional
livelihoods.

Thus, findings on the effects on social norms are mixed. Although parents and leaders interviewed reported to be
against child marriage, there were mixed responses in terms of the extent of parents’ influence over decision
making about marriage, as well as some differences in terms of what constituted the acceptable ages for marriage.
While parents interviewed reported that children should have a say, views varied from youth having the decision-
making power, to (most commonly) youth making the decision in consultation with parents, while some parents
and leaders mentioned that this decision is still ultimately the parents’ (for more information on child marriage,
see Section 4.4.9). There is also less evidence about changes of other practices, such as girl-for-girl exchanges
(Alishani) and high dowry, which are considered to be still happening. Furthermore, mixed results on respond-
ents’ views on the activities which are deemed acceptable for boys and for girls shows less change in this regard.
Many respondents referred to activities not acceptable for girls, working outside the home, doing sports, exercis-
ing in open areas, and studying in far-away locations. Moreover, conflicting views on who are the decision makers
on marriage were found.
4.5.6 Contribution of IALA to adolescent empowerment, disaggregated by gender
IALA contributed to adolescents’ empowerment and participation in a variety of ways. We will analyse the results
through four domains9: i) sense of self-worth, self-esteem and self-efficacy; ii) being taken seriously (perception
of respect and encouragement to participate); iii) making decisions; and iv) public and civic engagement.
Findings from the qualitative study suggest that participation in IALA has contributed to increasing (i) adoles-
cents’ sense of self-worth, including self-esteem, confidence, aspirations to goals, abilities to speak out and chal-
lenge rights’ violations, and their overall sense of personal well-being. The majority of adolescents interviewed
showed strengthened confidence in themselves after taking part in the MAGs, including trust in their own capa-
bilities -both in their intellectual capacities such as setting goals and making decisions, as well as in their social
abilities to interact with others and make friends-.
“Self-confidence is very important. Since we had the workshops, my self-confidence has become very strong” (IDI 46,
MAG Member, M, Bamyan)
“At first it was difficult. Teacher’s encouragement increased my confidence and then I felt comfortable with myself.”
(IDI 6, MAG Member, F, Badghis)
“The changes were that in the past we were studying but not much; after that our studying level has increased and
when I wanted to make a decision, I believed in myself. I was sure that I can do this.” (IDI 18, MAG Member, F,
Badghis)
As a result of their increased confidence as well as their decision-making and goal-setting skills learned through
the LST and MAGs overall, adolescents have felt encouraged to make decisions in their lives and seek to achieve
goals. This has motivated them for instance to return to school or pay more attention to their studies. The new
skills developed, the increased confidence in their own capabilities and the sense of empowerment experienced,
motivated adolescents to pursue education as well as to convince their parents to allow them to do so and to
motivate their peers that this was a worthwhile goal.
This leads to the second domain (ii), where there is evidence that adolescents felt an increase in the respect that
communities have towards them and feel more encouraged to participate meaningfully in their groups and in
their communities than they did before taking part in IALA. Adolescents reported to practically not have discussed
the topics of MAGs prior to the involvement in these, as they did not have information about them, neither the
skills nor confidence to do this. Even though there is still resistance in communities regarding adolescents’ role
in society and limitations to their decision-making possibilities, parents, mentors and leaders expressed that ad-
olescents have a better relationship with their communities than they did before and that they are better consid-
ered and listened to. This is particularly in contrast with the beginning of the intervention, when adults felt great
distrust for adolescents’ activities and the ‘usefulness’ of their role in society.
“At first, they were very sceptical that young people might be able to be useful, but later their presences in society
and their own functions in society satisfied them. Many cases which were before against human values, due to the
presence of teenagers, people didn’t have the courage to do them in the community”. (IDI 82, MAG Mentor, Bamyan,
M)
“If I had not joined the MAG, my life would have remained the same, nothing would have changed in my life and I
would not have had a good value in society, but now my life has changed a lot and I have a special value in society.”
(IDI 2, MAG Member, Badghis, M)
“Yes, they [adolescents] could express their ideas and people were listening to them.” (IDI 25, MAG Parent, Badghis,
F)
Aware of their rights and empowered to set goals and make decisions, adolescents sensitised their parents to
support their education, with the belief that this could enable them to have better opportunities, including work-
ing in well-regarded professions with a stable income in the future (e.g., becoming doctors, teachers, lawyers,
engineers, etc.) and getting involved in the improvement of their own communities.

In terms of the third domain (iii), decision making power, the study finds mixed results. Over half of the adoles-
cents interviewed highlighted decision-making as a new skillset they had acquired, including both knowledge and
practical experience on how to make decisions and establish goals. They also underscored the importance that
these new skills have brought to their lives. In addition, there is some evidence of changes in family dynamics,
with most of the adolescents interviewed reporting to now having the confidence to reach out to their families in
matters that concern them, and in voicing their opinions, being consulted by their families and/or taking part in
decisions, even if the final decision is the parents’. At the same time, many parents expressed that they allowed
their children to make decisions about their lives (including daily life and education). This enlarged space had
practical consequences for adolescents, as in many cases it led to changes regarding some aspect of their lives,
such as attending school, with adolescents convincing their parents to study. In this sense, IALA seems to have
opened up spaces in terms of decision making for adolescents.
However, it should be noted that the extent of that space differs. Firstly, parents still feature as the main decision-
makers in families (and most frequently the father). A major concern for parents was that their children should
make the right decisions, and parental approaches in daily life decision-making differed from having a consulta-
tive role (giving advice, guidance) to a more active one, including approving or disapproving of decisions made.
In terms of marriage, all parents interviewed acknowledged early marriage as a harmful practice, stating that
there should not be any forced marriages and that consent should be given from all parties, with almost all setting
the acceptable age for marriage over 18 years old and usually over 20 years. Some parents mentioned that girls
and boys are the decision-makers, while others considered the parents to have a key role in this decision. Most
considered that marriage is a decision taken together in consultation between parents and adolescents. However,
some parents still believed that the decision was ultimately theirs, as guardians of their children and their future.
This ‘partial’ change in decision making was acknowledged in the midline evaluation. The endline convenes that
some space opened up for adolescents’ role in decision making after taking part in IALA, but unlike the midline
evaluation, it found that child marriage was disapproved of by all parents interviewed. However, barriers due to
conservativism and economic necessity were still found in the target communities (more in Section 4.4.9).
In the fourth domain (iv) of public and civic engagement, the summative evaluation found that adolescents have
a stronger sense of social justice, rights, and wrongs in terms of rights and their protection, which has created
encouragement for them to engage with their peers, families and communities to promote changes to the prac-
tices they consider harmful or detrimental. Adolescents’ increased confidence facilitated their involvement in
community outreach actions, including sharing knowledge of the topics learned in the MAGs and participating in
awareness raising activities in their areas to encourage social change.
[If MAGs had not happened] “I would not be in the place where I am now. I might have low self-esteem, would not
dare to teach others, and help the community to get an education.” (IDI 57, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
“Yes, there have been many changes in my life. I did not understand many issues. I could not defend my rights. After
this programme, I defend my rights. I continued my studies and prevented early marriages.” (IDI 20, MAG Member,
Badghis, F)
Adolescents have carried out various actions in this direction, including sensitization work with peers and their
families about the harms of child marriage and the importance of education; some also talking to community or
religious leaders (almost half of adolescents interviewed); and the organisation of social actions and campaigns
in their communities. One of the key actions practiced by adolescents was the sharing of the knowledge they
gained to peers, parents and other community members. All adolescents mentioned to have reached out to their
peers to talk about the topics learned at the MAGs, including life skills, child marriage and education, while most
also reported to have reached out as well to their families and to other community members. Another action
performed by MAG members involved talking to families of adolescents who were not sending their children to
school to convince them to do so, as well as to prevent child marriages in cases where families were supporting
this practice. Adolescents described doing this individually or as part of wider campaigns organised with their
MAGs. Some adolescents mentioned that they had also reached out to elders and heads of councils about these
issues, but this was not reported by the majority of interviewees. In addition, adolescents described the organi-
sation of social actions to improve their communities, such as literacy campaigns, cleaning and tree planting in
their villages, building toilets, health awareness (e.g., during COVID-19), and cultural and sports activities to pro-
mote children’s rights, including community theatre productions about early marriage and access to school men-
tioned in Bamyan, and sports competitions in football and volleyball).
“One of our activities was to bring a literacy course. During the festivities, most of the activities were from our group,
and we also played in the theatre. In the calligraphy and drawing fields, we held competitions in the holy month of
Ramadan.” (IDI 64, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
“It was a very interesting theatre and its goal was to send girls to school, and we were able to achieve more success
in that theatre […] Speaking is a thing that we go to a group when we talk, it is in the minds of children, but after a
while, it is forgotten, but theatre is an image that is created in the minds of children and stays in their minds for a
long time and there are many messages to be taken from it.” (IDI 54, MAG Member, Bamyan, M)
“…we supported them and provided them with equipment, and we had very big girl’s competitions in Bamyan prov-
ince that came to the stadium, and even other teams came from the villages and played volleyball, especially girls.
These were the activities the group did.” (IDI 82, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, M)
44
Many boys and girls interviewed recalled addressing the topic of sports at the MAGs. Some mentioned increasing
their awareness about the importance of sports for health and reported to have participated in newly formed
teams of football and volleyball at their schools, which also held competitions.
“Yes, one of our discussions which is a memory for me was sports, what we discussed in the sports committee: to do
sports every day during school break. I always exercised here. That is all we all had during the school break." (IDI
43, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
“Yes, in any case, we must raise our knowledge, whether it is information or sports. These are skills that are im-
portant for a better life.” (IDI 63, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
For girls, this participation in sports was a breakthrough, as sports was considered ‘taboo’ and not a socially ac-
ceptable activity. Accounts from respondents point to the work of the sports committees of the MAGs in this re-
gard, not just to organise the activities but also to overcome communities’ reactions. Holding sports competitions
where girls participated was recognised as a success by various stakeholders. Participation of girls in these events
was, however, lower than boys’, and this also varied according to locations and their customs. For example, there
were lower levels of participation in Kahmard and Saighan areas in Bamyan. Moreover, it should also be noted
that the attitude towards sports was clearly still ambivalent in the target communities where we carried out the
interviews (more so than other issues addressed by IALA), as key informants mentioned many communities’ ret-
icence, and some adolescents still reported that sports or certain types of outdoor activities were not appropriate
for girls.
“Football is good for boys but bad for girls in our area. More sports topics are not allowed for girls in our area.” (IDI
57, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
“Yes, in the sports sector, for example, girls cannot play football. On the one hand, there is no field and its conditions
are unsuitable, especially for girls.” (IDI 63, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
Key considerations for girls’ empowerment
Girls and boys taking part in the MAGs had different starting points in terms of their confidence and skills. This is
partly since many girls were illiterate or out of school, while more boys were in school, which was a factor in their
feelings of confidence and sense of self to participate. Girls were also more held back due to economic and cultural
reasons, which translated into them having difficulties to go to school or drop out altogether because of early
marriages or norms that found it inadequate for them to continue studying, especially when becoming older.
While some interviewees considered that there were no differences between boys’ and girls’ participation and
learning outcomes in the MAGs, there was a consensus among various stakeholder groups (adolescents, mentors,
KIIs) that overall girls participated more actively than boys and showed higher interest in MAG activities. As a
result, interviewees considered that girls either achieved the same level of empowerment and capitalisation on
learning outcomes as boys, or an even stronger one.
“When we went to Yakawlang, the students had so little confidence that they couldn’t say their names or say some-
thing in front of the class. After we trained them, we saw lots of changes in them, of course not one hundred percent
but it was good, even there was no difference between girls and boys” (IDI 62, MAG Mentor, F, Bamyan)
“Yes, especially most of the girls adapted the activities that we teach them well in their lives. In such things, girls
always performed better at this training.” (IDI 28, MAG Mentor, F, Badghis)
The reason for girls’ heightened motivation and participation was seen in their tendency to be out of school and
have less access to educational opportunities, hence appreciating the MAGs more. One respondent related it to
the fact that in their group, girls were older, and older teenagers performed better in general. Boys were generally
in school, although boys from vulnerable families suffered setbacks to education due to their involvement in work
(e.g., farming, herding).
Girls’ empowerment was constrained due to their difficulties to access higher education and to stay in school.
This is due to a combination of still prevailing social and gender norms, economic constraints, and structural
issues. Due to prevalent social and gender norms that discourage their education, girls are more likely to not be
allowed to go to school or, if they attend, are more likely to leave school early, due to child marriages and families’
lower value attributed to the education of girls. The latter is related to the understanding that girls should stay
within the home sphere and to norms that disapprove of older girls attending school. Economic constraints also
play a part, as girls are required to carry out household chores, and in case of limited possibilities of families, boys
are preferred over girls to attend school. In addition, there are structural problems that create further limitations
to girls’ empowerment, such as limited access to schools in their areas, with longer distances preventing girls
from attending due to cultural norms (a culture of limited mobility, of not being outside far from the house) and
security concerns, particularly in villages away from provincial centres. Parents interviewed mentioned that
there is also a lack of courses for girls in their areas.
“… some families don’t allow their daughters to go to school, they say that going to school at high ages is not allowed
religiously.” (IDI 13, MAG Parent, F, Badghis)
“Yes, most girls graduate from 12th grade, and they are no longer allowed to get an education.” (IDI 77, RL, F,
Bamyan)
45
“…a few people because of their bad customs and rituals, say that our daughter has grown up and there is no needs
for her to study.” (IDI 7, MAG Parent, M, Badghis)
“Only poverty can be an obstacle and a challenge for some. In our society, there are a small number of families that
differentiate between boys and girls. They allow boys but do not allow girls to study.” (IDI 57, MAG Member, F,
Bamyan)
“It is better than before, but there is no course for our daughter or daughter to study. They suffer from a lack of
courses.” (IDI 3, MAG Parent, F, Badghis)
Furthermore, there is less evidence of change of other social and gender norms, particularly those related to the
value of girls and the roles of girls and boys in society. These norms have clear impacts on girls’ possibilities for
empowerment and development. Differences in the treatment of boys and girls are still palpable in communities,
as per respondents’ experiences, in terms of boys’ being better valued than girls, having more freedom in the
social sphere, and being able to do activities that are not allowed for girls. Prevalent community views thus limit
girls’ activities and spheres of action, with activities such as working outside the home, doing sports, or exercising
in open areas, and studying in far-away areas, deemed acceptable for boys but not for girls.
“There were many differences, for example, boys could easily enter the MAG, work, or go from one place to another
or visit other groups, but most of the girls were not allowed to do so.” (IDI 81, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, F)
"Yes, there are so many things in our society that are good for boys and bad for girls. For instance, working out-
side is good for boys and it is bad for girls. In addition, sports are good for boys but not good for girls. Moreover,
going to the market and other places is good for men but bad for women.
Q: Who says whether these things are good or not and for whom?
A: My parents, they always teach that what is good and what is bad." (IDI 21, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
“Boys get more attention in society because they have an income, but girls just work in the house”. (IDI 32, CL,
Badghis, M)
“Perhaps this way of thinking goes back to the past period of ignorance. If there is a boy or a girl in a family, the
parents differentiate between them. The difference exists in the society in which we work, and this is where the
discrimination come from.” (IDI 79, RL, Bamyan, F)
Moreover, even though stakeholders convene on the advancements in awareness raising in the themes of child
marriage and the importance of education, there is less evidence of change of other traditional practices such as
girl-for-girl exchanges (Alishani) and high dowry amounts, which are considered to still be happening, and which
are highly detrimental to girls’ empowerment.
“Yes, poverty, unemployment, high Alishani [exchanging girl for girl], and high amount of dowry are all things which
cause problems for teenagers.” (IDI 7, MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
“Yes, dowry and Alishani are also common in our region, while Alishani should not be done.” (IDI 33, RL, Badghis,
M)
Despite adolescents’ clear advancements as agents of change in their communities, and evidence that many mem-
bers in their communities reached better awareness of children’s rights and were acting in consequence (e.g.,
parents allowing children to go to school), there is also evidence that not all community members have changed
their views and behaviours, and that some continue to practice child marriage, child labour and other harmful
practices. Respondents emphasized the need to continue to promote awareness among communities about the
harms that child marriage can create for girls and boys, and the importance of all children to continue their edu-
cation. The social position of adolescents in the community and societal pressures, restrict adolescents’ ability to
promote change within their communities, underlining the necessity for a holistic approach which targets parents
and community members systematically to ensure wider and sustained impacts.
4.5.7 Variations in MAG effectiveness across contexts and time
As discussed in detail in Section 4.3, the reachability and participation of adolescents in the MAGs was affected by
a range of factors, including socio-cultural norms, parents’ attitudes and levels of support, families’ economic
conditions (affecting the extent of child labour), geographic location and educational infrastructure. This trans-
lates into varying levels of effectiveness of the MAGs across contexts – and over time, as some of these factors,
such as parents’ attitudes, (could be) changed in the course of the programme.
In addition, literacy affected MAG’s effectiveness. Illiterate (mostly out-of-school) adolescents found it more dif-
ficult to take up teaching contents and were more difficult to be both engaged and retained in the MAGs (see
Section 4.1.3). Illiterate children also posed challenges for cascade learning, as MAG members considered it was
more difficult to teach them.
Spatial variations of these factors seem to imply spatial variations in effectiveness. For example, traditional gen-
der and social norms and poverty, which had negative effects on participation and communities’ acceptance of
IALA messaging, are more pronounced in rural areas further away from provincial centres. In some areas of
Bamyan and Badghis, communities showed higher levels of resistance to changing traditional gender and social
norms, restricting girls’ school attendance, adolescents’ rights to voice their opinions, and overall views about
children’s rights and place in society.
46
“... in some places, such as Kahmard, Saighan, and Ghandak, these places have less support, especially for girls, and
of course there are differences from the point of view of custom that prevails in those areas.” (KII 3, Programme
staff, Bamyan, M)
“In some places we do not allow girls up to grade 6, but in other places they allow up to grade 12”. (IDI 34, CL,
Badghis, M)
“... if you live in Badghis, or in other places, someone who is 15 or 10 years old will not be allowed to talk. The
traditional system that we and you have said that my father or my grandfather or brother is here, how can we talk?
And the same as the society tells them to leave and doesn’t care about them.” (KII 3, Programme staff, Badghis, M)
“Yes, of course, the differences were based on the fact that in some areas, some teenagers were more supported by
the family and shined more and more and were abler and absorbed the content of IALA programme, and in some
places and in some cases, those who have social, family and poverty problems were attracted less.” (KII 3, Pro-
gramme staff, Bamyan, M)
In addition, educational infrastructure affected effectiveness, as proximity or distance to MAGs/schools influ-
enced the attendance and engagement of MAG participants. Those living further away had to deal with accessi-
bility issues linked to distance, bad weather, and cultural limitations to mobility.
Many of these factors are interlinked and have a geographic dimension, with the more rural and more remote
areas, which exhibit more pre-existing challenges, and which thus would have been most in need of the pro-
gramme’s interventions (e.g., poverty was frequently linked to child marriage), showing a tendency to lower lev-
els of programme effectiveness, compared to less remote regions.
4.5.8 Contribution of ALCs to education of adolescents
Adolescents’ access to education remains limited in some areas, due to the lack of schools with higher classes,
particularly for girls. Shortages of teachers were also mentioned as a challenge. Furthermore, many schools were
closed during the period of the evaluation, and girls were not allowed to attend classes until further notice since
the takeover of the Taliban.
ALCs were a solution put in place through the MoE for students who had not been able to continue their education.
They were usually placed where schools were far away or out of reach for students, and for older students to get
back on track on their studies. The modality of ALCs allowed students to cover two classes in one year to com-
pensate for the lost time and was designed to be linked to the public school system to have adolescents re-instated
in the standard system afterwards.
“ALC classes were usually held for those who dropped out of school and did not even expect that one day it would
be convenient for them to return to school. It was a very useful method for most of them and this programme is
important for those who have not learned any lessons. These classes were good because they can study two classes
in one year and in 3 to 4 years, they can see that they have studied at the same level.” (KII 1, Programme staff,
Bamyan, M)
UNICEF set up ALCs in the target communities, which allowed a few out-of-school children to enrol. UNICEF pro-
vided training workshops for ALC teachers as well as educational materials. ALCs were not the focus of this eval-
uation, as the priority was to bring out those areas/components where clear links to IALA’s achievement of goals
were found. There were also limitations to identify potential ALC teachers for interviewees, as explained in the
background section. Yet, three interviews could be conducted with ALC teachers, which provided insights to un-
derstand the situation of these centres and their perspectives in the overall context of the IALA programme. No
ALC teachers were available for interviews in Badghis, and the implementers informed the field teams that there
were currently no ALCs operating there.
The ALC teachers interviewed in Bamyan noted that these centres had been operating, but that there were chal-
lenges, some of which had already been identified in the midline evaluation. One of them was the difficulty of
reaching 10 students to form an ALC, particularly in remote, mountainous areas with low accessibility. Another
challenge was the lack of female teachers in some areas, which impeded the formation of more ALCs, and which
also impacts students’ possibility of continuing their education afterwards. Provision of materials was considered
good by two of the three teachers, but one of them mentioned that there was a lack of books. Positive aspects of
the ALC training mentioned by respondents were the flexibility of the ALC model of schooling for out-of-school
children, the quality of classes, the practical nature of the materials for students to engage with, and the regularity
of the classes, including the fact that these were taught uninterruptedly also during the wintertime. The fact that
achievements could be seen in a short period of time as a result of this ‘condensed’ teaching model was also men-
tioned as a positive outcome.
Attendance of students was considered good by the three teachers interviewed, and interest of adolescents
strong. In the cases of the ALCs interviewed, all participants were girls, which were usually the majority and the
main target of the programmes, as they are the ones who are more likely to drop out of school. Yet, there were
challenges related to local practices affecting attendance, as in the case of one the ALCs, where four students
dropped out after getting married. One of the teachers mentioned reaching out to parents to try to convince them
of the importance of education for their girls and to allow them to attend class.
Most of the MAG adolescents and parents interviewed were not aware of the ALCs, and for those who were, only
one adolescent had taken part. Therefore, no clear linkages could be identified. One parent interviewed
47
mentioned that they would have been interested in having their children participate in an ALC, but none was
available in their area (a village in Shibar).
4.5.9 Overall achievement of IALA’s goals
The findings show that IALA has overall achieved its outputs and contributed to the achievement of its two in-
tended outcomes. It has been most successful in terms of adolescent empowerment, while there is still consider-
able room for improvement in social norms. An in-depth analysis of the programme’s performance in this regard
is provided through the Process Tracing approach in Section 5 of this report.
Interviews with all stakeholder groups consistently revealed that they were satisfied with IALA’s achievements.
First of all, beneficiaries convened that IALA had made adolescents and community members aware of children’s
rights, an insight which they did not have before and which they found important and relevant to their lives. This
included awareness regarding child marriage and its harms, the importance of education for both girls and boys,
the value of girls, the harms of child labour, and aspects regarding children’s health. Children’s and parent’s rights
were learned from the perspective of Islam, which made communities more receptive towards the teachings and
improved their acceptance of these issues in the communities.
“It was very important in my life because it was making us aware of everything, about our right, our parents' right
and all that we could learn.” (IDI 18, MAG Member, Badghis, M)
“The IALA programme kept the people of our society aware of education, underage marriages, life skills, and the
ways of achieving their goals. This is a great achievement for the society that the people of our society were not
aware of any of these issues before.” (IDI 7, MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
“We were very happy with teaching any issue that was in accordance of Islam, and none of the taught issues were
against it.” (IDI 34, CL, Badghis, M)
Secondly, as a result of this awareness, IALA activities managed to change many people’s views, attitudes, and
behaviours towards adolescents’ rights in the target areas.
The importance of children’s education was understood and accepted by many community members, which led
to more supportive attitudes (and even encouragement) for adolescents’, particularly including girls’, schooling.
This is seen as one of IALA’s major contributions.
“It has brought good changes to the society like how to solve their problems, set a goal, resolve conflicts and help
their children because there were some people who did not let their children to go to school but now everyone let
them, it is a change.” (IDI 23, MAG Member, M, Badghis)
“There was a lot of strictness about girls in our society. Girls were not allowed to go to school, girls were not allowed
to go far. In our society, there were people who did not leave their daughter to go from here to their next-door house.
When we saw things from this MAG and applied them, a lot of changes took place in the society. Now, there is no
one in our area who opposes his daughter not going to school” (IDI 43, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
In both provinces, actors mentioned that a significant number of adolescents who were out of school had gone
back, and that all adolescents who took part had increased their interest in education, as they saw it as a goal for
themselves and to improve their future. Moreover, children who became literate as a result of IALA and who thus
improved their self-confidence and self-worth is another major achievement of the programme.
“Yes of course; they helped us to get rid of the blindness of illiteracy, we were happy. They taught us how to read,
they really helped us for our future.” (IDI 24, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
“It made our children fully educated and they learned how to read and write. People were aware of their children’s
rights, and they were supporting their children. I support my daughter a lot to study and become a doctor in the
future.” (IDI 25, MAG Parent, Badghis, F)
Furthermore, the harms of child marriage were thoroughly conveyed by IALA activities. Adolescents, parents, and
leaders who took part rejected this practice and evidenced what they had learned regarding its detrimental ef-
fects for youth. Furthermore, stakeholders convened on their perceptions that child marriages have decreased in
the areas where IALA activities took place. Adolescents have become vocal in their rejection of these practices,
pivotal in convincing their parents, and have also managed to reach out to other community members and leaders
to seek prevention of these practices. Leaders have also shared their knowledge on the harms of these practices
through religious sermons, as well as informal sessions in their communities.
“Yes, because as you know, we understand that early marriages and hard work make the children miserable in our
society. We could defend our rights and do not let others to do these things.” (IDI 20, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
“Yes, for example early marriage were more before MAG but after MAG it decreased.” (IDI 6, MAG Member, Badghis,
F)
“…we had more than 15 cases in which a group of teenagers terminated the marriage of minors and launched var-
ious campaigns around early marriage in the school about false cultures, including working in the dowry section.
These are things that make people very happy” (KII 1, Programme staff, Bamyan, M)
Moreover, different stakeholder groups agreed that adolescents had increased their knowledge and skills as a
result of IALA’s trainings and stated that they had a better behaviour and were more active in the community.
48
It is clear from the interviews and accounts given that IALA has had a powerful effect on the lives of people in-
volved, who would envision their lives and their communities’ lives very differently without having had this in-
tervention.
“If I hadn’t been to the MAG… everything that changed in my life has changed because of MAG; things I learned now
that I didn’t know before, for example about sports, life skills, having goals, making decisions, finding friends.” (IDI
1, MAG Member, F, Badhgis)
4.5.9.1 CHANGES IN KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, AND BEHAVIOURS TOWARDS CHILD
MARRIAGE
The findings from the summative evaluation show an increased level of awareness of the harms of child marriage
among all beneficiary categories and a perceived decrease in the practice indicated by both target communities
and programme implementers across both provinces. Evidence of uptake of individual and community-level ac-
tions towards its prevention is strong within the context of the MAGs, although beyond and after this context it is
clearer on an individual rather than a communal level.
Most adolescents and parents interviewed reported having had little or no information on the detrimental effects
of child marriage prior to their participation in the programme. The MAG trainings, cascade learning, and com-
munity discussions were key for increasing their knowledge and awareness about these. All parents and adoles-
cents interviewed showed an increased knowledge on the implications and effects of early marriage after taking
part in IALA activities.
“At the time, when I had little information, I did not know the importance of those topics. When I came to MAG and
learned these, I became very sensitive to communicating the topics to those who do not have access to such pro-
grammes, to inform them. This will help to prevent the bad customs from our community and move toward im-
provement.” (IDI MAG Member 57, Bamyan, F)
Respondents identified several harms of child marriage, which included: the thwarting of adolescents’ lives and
prospects, the discontinuation of their education, the exposure of girls to physical risks linked to early pregnancy,
and the hindering of their rights to decide on their futures. As a result of the increased awareness, respondents
reported changes in their views and perceptions, considering early marriage a harmful practice which they were
opposed to. Generally, beneficiaries stated that marriages should happen only after the legal age of 18 years and
preferably over that (with the appropriate age for girls being usually a little lower than for boys), and that mar-
riages should happen by consent of the parties involved, respecting their rights to decide.
“Underage marriages could hurt both society and the partners. It is good to be avoided till the legal age. Because it
is detrimental, and partners cannot achieve their goals.” (IDI 21, MAG Member 21, Badghis, F)
“Sometimes when she came home, she was telling me about early marriages, pregnancy, and she was telling me that
people should not marry their underage girls because they will be pregnant at a young age and this causes so many
problems, like it is possible that the mother or the child can die.” (IDI 25, MAG Parent, Badghis, F)
As a result of this increased awareness of beneficiaries and their transformed understanding of child marriages,
the qualitative study could identify evidence of perceived societal changes at a larger scale in the target commu-
nities, where parents, MAG mentors, and community and religious leaders stated that, in their view, the practice
of child marriage had significantly decreased after the programme took place. The findings also show an increase
in actions among all categories of interviewees against the practice of child marriage, particularly among adoles-
cents, as well as by some community and religious leaders.
“A: I think they were more in the past.
Q: What is the reason that they became less now?
A: People were not informed enough in the past; but now people are educated, and they know about the results of
this issue." (IDI 58, MAG Parent, Bamyan, M)
“Early marriages were common, but we can say very clearly that they have decreased. I have mentioned before that
people have seen a negative result, that people’s awareness has increased, and underage marriages have decreased
too because in the villages and regions that we live they happen [only] rarely.” (IDI 35, RL, Badghis, M)
“Before the class, they did not know anything about underage marriages. For example, when they witnessed an
underage marriage, they did not do anything about it and did not have any reaction to it. It caused underage mar-
riages in society to become less prevalent, totally eradicating it in some places” (IDI 31, MAG Mentor, M, Badghis)
Adolescents’ shifts in attitudes and behaviours towards child marriage can be perceived both in their own lived
experiences as well as through the ‘outward’ activities they were involved in through knowledge sharing, aware-
ness raising, and actions to prevent early marriages in their families and communities. Firstly, interviewee re-
sponses revealed that adolescents had rejected the practice of child marriage for themselves after taking part in
IALA activities, even when they may have accepted it before.
“In the first fifteen days of our workshop, four girls from my team wanted to be engaged but when awareness was
given in the programme, they refused their engagement.” (IDI 56 MAG Mentor, Badghis, F).
“Some members of our group got engaged and were supposed to get married two months later, but as they were
below the legal age, so their wedding was postponed” (IDI 62, MAG Mentor 62, Badghis, F)
49
Moreover, there is evidence that adolescents have acted as agents of change to various degrees in their families
and communities, sharing the knowledge they acquired on child marriage and its harmful effects and promoting
the prevention of this practice by talking to their peers and families outside of the MAGs. Adolescents, parents
and MAG mentors recalled several accounts of adolescents actively getting involved in the prevention of child
marriage, by talking to the families of those to be married, and even to community leaders and local councils in
some cases.
“Yes, in the past, we used to accept it based on false customs, but now we realized that underage marriage is of no
value. Now we can share our ideas with the society to prevent ourselves and other girls from getting married” (IDI
63, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
“We talked about the negative consequences of child marriage and gave information to our classmates as well. We
campaigned outside of MAG too just to inform the other people of the society as well” (IDI 57, MAG Member, Bamyan,
F)
“Yes, I have said before that some people accepted, and it affected them. For example, my neighbour had a daugh-
ter who wanted to give to a husband, but when I went to the course, I realized that underage marriages are harm-
ful. I told my neighbour that your daughter is a child and doesn't give permission to get married. Fortunately, they
accepted, and they have not given their daughter to her husband”. (IDI 8, MAG Parent, Badghis, F)
“… there was a girl from our area whose marriage was planned in her early age, there was not much time left to
her wedding. When we joined this MAG, I shared that we must do something to prevent the wedding, not to destroy
the future of this girl. We met in the group and selected a few people and sent them to the girl's family [to say] that
this should not be done, that the bride was underage and should not be married because she does not understand
anything about life. By doing so, we were able to prevent that marriage.” (IDI 43, MAG Member, F, Bamyan).
The endline results suggest that child marriage could be prevented especially in cases when both parents and
adolescents took part in IALA activities; sometimes also when only adolescents participated, but possibly less so,
since parents’ involvement and influence on decision-making appeared to be important, and since the level of
adolescents’ sensitization of their parents varied. Most interviewed parents stated they had changed their views
about child marriage after becoming aware of its disadvantages and harms to their children, which prompted
changes in their approach towards their children’s lives and in their own behaviours. Many recounted for instance
not intending to make their children marry anymore and to wait until they are ready or even let them make the
decision, and to encourage their education.
“In the beginning, I was thinking of giving my son a wife, but these courses completely changed my mind, so I did
not force any of my sons to get married.” (IDI 27, MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
“Yes, I have talked about early marriage at home and came to the conclusion that a girl should finish her school and
education before marriage. Later on, they should decide about her marriage as per the Islamic rules and regula-
tions” (IDI 45, MAG Parent, Bamyan, M)
Further evidence of changed awareness and practices regarding child marriage comes from religious and com-
munity leaders. Leaders interviewed felt that IALA’s teachings were in line with their understanding of Islam,
which allowed them to embrace and share them with their communities. Community and religious leaders play a
vital part in multiplying the knowledge acquired, considering their position in Muslim societies, and the qualita-
tive evidence appears to show that they did this through religious sermons, education at the Madrasas, ‘formal’
community discussions as well as through informal gatherings.
In addition to spreading information and knowledge, community and religious leaders seemed to have sometimes
played a role as agents of change by getting involved in practices to prevent and reduce child marriage. For ex-
ample, respondents mentioned that Imams started paying attention to the age details and the consents of girls for
the marriage to be carried out, and that community leaders sometimes intervened in preventing child marriages
by convincing the families’ involved of its harmful effects.
“Well, as far as we learned from the training, we passed it onto others and made them aware, for example, of pre-
venting early marriages, which is both mentally and physically defective. Well, sometimes it happens because they
are economically poor.” (IDI 33, RL, Badghis, M)
“Now such a thing does not exist, and people observed it and the discussion of the teenager group was excellent.”
(IDI 53, MAG Parent, Bamyan, M)
“In most marriage parties they invite us for the recitation of the ceremony, but if boy and girl are teenagers, we try
to prevent the marriage.” (IDI 36, RL, Badghis, M)
As mentioned, most respondents reported that, in their view, child marriage had gone down considerably in their
communities. However, due to the methodological limitations of the study, it is neither possible to confirm the
actual changes took place (if any) nor to establish causality. To put this in context, the midline findings showed a
statistically insignificant reduction of child marriage in the intervention areas. Despite strong evidence of changes
in the understanding of child marriage provided by different stakeholders, and some evidence of changes in their
practice, and despite the overall perception by all respondents that child marriages have decreased as a result of
IALA, some informants also pointed out that not all community members changed their minds and that work
needed to be done on sensitization on this issue. Respondents considered that lack of awareness in combination
with poverty-stricken conditions are important factors where child marriage still happen.

4.5.9.2 CHANGES IN KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, AND BEHAVIOURS TOWARDS PREG-
NANCY
The findings show that pregnancy had not been a topic discussed by adolescents prior to IALA, and that their
knowledge and awareness of early pregnancy risks had increased as a result of their participation in programme
activities. Moreover, adolescents identified child marriage as the main reason contributing to early pregnancy
and discussed it in their knowledge sharing and awareness raising activities with peers, parents, and community
members to promote its prevention.
Adolescents shared that learning and discussing sensitive issues through IALA activities, like pregnancy and child
marriage, was a new experience for them. Some of them also expressed that it was difficult to do so due to feelings
of shame, shyness, and the limited information they had. However, according to MAG mentors, the discussion of
the topic was welcomed by adolescents, parents, and other community members. Adults reportedly appreciated
having gained knowledge about this and the potential harms it can cause to their children.
“They told us to not force our daughters to marry someone at a young age because of pregnancy endurance. People
had a positive reaction, and they did not ask their daughters for early marriage, and they found that if they asked
their daughters for marriage at a young age, they will face so many problems.” (IDI 25, MAG Parent, Badghis, F)
Many adolescent girls interviewed reported to have learned about the negative consequences that early preg-
nancy can have on them, including health, economic, and social impacts. Some boys also explicitly mentioned that
early pregnancies should be discouraged. The major risks mentioned by adolescents were poor health and com-
plications, difficulties in managing childcare, and limited opportunities and future prospects in their lives due to
shortened education.
“They told us that it is harmful for a girl to get pregnant underage and the family should avoid engaging girls at
the early age because of her future. Her future will be in danger if they do” (IDI 24, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
“Yes, if a girl becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby (…) it will be not good for both” (IDI 73, MAG Member,
Badghis, F)
Adolescents also learned about precautionary measures and self-care needed to ensure a safe pregnancy. Girls
reported having understood the importance of good nutrition and diet while pregnant, to be mindful of not lifting
heavy weights or engaging in hard physical exercise, and to be careful about the consumption of medicines.
“We learned that during pregnancy we must eat diverse and good quality food, and to not hold heavy things. They
taught us these types of things.” (IDI 41, MAG Member, F, Bamyan)
MAG mentors testified to the transformation of adolescents’ mindsets, from not knowing about this topic and
feeling shame in discussing it, to feeling empowered about knowing the health risks, harmful consequences, and
key issues for a safe pregnancy, and spreading this knowledge along.
“Their minds were completely changed. At first, the students did not know at what age they should get married, but
after teaching, at what age they should get married and become pregnant, they learned these issues and told their
parents about these” (IDI 30, MAG Mentor, Badghis, F)
After IALA, adolescents expressed concerns and increased awareness about health risks related to early preg-
nancy and underlined the importance of family planning to prevent unplanned pregnancies. Both adolescents and
parents identified child marriage as a main reason contributing towards early pregnancy, and thus emphasized
the importance of having children marry at the legal age. Adolescents gave avoiding early pregnancy as one of the
reasons for the need to prevent child marriage in their communities during their knowledge sharing and aware-
ness raising activities with peers, families and community members.
4.5.9.3 CHANGES IN KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, AND BEHAVIOURS TOWARDS EDUCA-
TION AND SCHOOL ENROLMENT
The results provide evidence on the changes that IALA has prompted regarding adolescents’ education. Inter-
views with adolescents, parents, mentors and community leaders show that IALA interventions – from MAGs to
community level activities –increased awareness of adolescents’ (and particularly girls’) rights to education and
the relevance of education for improving their lives and their future. This in turn raised children’s motivation to
attend school.
As a result of their participation in MAGs, adolescents increased their levels of confidence as well as their decision-
making and goal-setting skills, which encouraged them to believe that there were possibilities to achieve their
goals and prompted them to make decisions about their lives, such as returning to school. Even most students
who were already going to school reported to feel more motivated and encouraged to pursue their education.
Although MAGs offered a different training and education than school, MAG attendance appears to have increased
adolescents’ motivation to learn in general. Hence, for those who were out of school, this meant a motivation to
attend, and for those who were in school this meant dedicating themselves more to their studies. Additionally,
there is evidence of increased motivation by adolescents to inform others about the value of education. MAG par-
ticipants inspired their peers to go to school: peer dynamics reportedly led to interest in attending school among
51
adolescents who had not participated in MAGs, as they observed MAG participants’ learning outcomes, including
literacy.
“It is so crucial to study and make our future bright. In the first place, our parents should think about us and per-
suade us to study. And then I am so satisfied by this course because the teachers always were emphasizing [we could
have] bright and good futures.” (IDI 24, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
“For now, when adolescents are attending school, they seem really happy. Because they know that a bright future
is possible only with education and training. In general, they love learning, and they are enjoying this process.” (IDI
31, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
As a result of the shifts in mindsets and awareness of the importance of education, adolescents and their families
see more added value to their lives through education than they did before IALA. This increased awareness led to
several changes in the target communities’ attitudes and behaviours towards school attendance and education
overall.
Firstly, there was a reported increase in school attendance from many out of school children, particularly girls,
including those who had dropped out of school as well as those whose families previously did not allow them to
attend. Interviews across all categories of respondents confirm this finding.
“The courses had a positive effect on both the boys and the girls, causing the girls to go to school, even those whose
parents had not previously allowed them to go to school…” (IDI 38, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
“The change that I have witnessed is that now families are all allowing their children to go to school. This is a big
change that has happened to our society.” (IDI 27, MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
“A: Yes, it influenced their point of view even girls and boys who had dropped out of school were re-enrolled to
school.
Q: Is attending school by your adolescents’ group, important for their lives?
A: Yes, when they understood the importance of education, they rejoined the school.” (IDI 56, MAG Mentor,
Badghis, F)
“If they had not been in the MAG, their lives would have been in a state of disarray, they would have had no changes
in their lives. Now I am so happy that all of these children are literate, they are aware of their rights and became
interested in their lessons.” (IDI 39, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
In the cases where education had been discontinued, adolescents’ new perspectives and skills prompted them to
reach out to their families to allow them to continue their education. Many adolescents’ accounts show that, after
taking part in MAGs, they actively asked their parents to allow them or their siblings to attend school, which they
had not done before.
“… my family did not understand, after I told them about children's rights, they understood that they should send
my sister and younger brother to school for studying.” (IDI 26, MAG Member, Badghis, M)
“…[the] MAG causes that they find information about education and training and life skills. The education and train-
ing caused some students to go and recognize to the people that they were not going to school with, and they taught
them and gave them motivation.” (IDI 31, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
Adolescents also acted as agents of change for peers in their communities, campaigning outside the MAGs to pro-
mote access to education. They did so via different means, including peer to peer learning, reaching out directly
to the families of out-of-school children to discuss their right to access education, talking to community or reli-
gious leaders, and carrying out various awareness raising activities, such as participating in community discus-
sions, going door-to-door to families, and implementing artistic activities such as theatre to promote children’s
rights. In some cases, adolescents also involved community and religious leaders to overcome the challenges of
families who were refusing to send their children to school.
“As a result of this teenager group, we were able to help other girls who were out of school and get them back to
education.” (IDI 57, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
“They [adolescents] gave a very good proposal that said those people who studied till six grade and after that they
left the school, we want to speak with their parents to include them in school again. And we shared their opinion in
all the groups and after that, students went to their villages and spoke with parents and fortunately most of them
returned to school again”. (IDI 60, MAG Mentor, Badghis, F)
Adolescents’ advocacy work for promoting education of their peers faced challenges, as some families’ showed
resistance to let their children (particularly girls) attend school, often due to their socio-economic realities and
prevalent gender norms. In terms of socio-economic factors, the challenge of child labour in agriculture and herd-
ing activities in many villages was identified as a factor preventing school attendance. MAG members’ recollec-
tions show a sense of empowerment in their ability to face the challenges of families not sending their children to
school and in promoting the goals of attending school for the betterment of their peers, irrespective of their gen-
der or location.
“A: It was the issue of my sister going to school and I kept up with my family that this should be done. She must
come back to school.
Q. What was their reaction? A: Their reaction was first anger and later calm. Q. What happened in the end? A: In
the end we concluded that she must go to school.” (IDI 43, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
52
“In most of the places, people became interested and encouraged their children, but […] in some villages, some fam-
ilies sent their children to work instead of school, and then we talked to their parents and the elders of their village
to find a solution so that they could go to school as well. Eventually the result was that they took turns caring for
their sheep so that their children would have a chance to go to school.” (IDI 81, MAG Mentor, Bamyan, F)
The endline findings also show that parents’ attitudes towards the value of education played a key role in sup-
porting or preventing education for their children. Parents’ interviews showed that IALA’s activities had allowed
them to increase their knowledge and awareness about children’s rights, particularly their rights to education,
which should be equal between boys and girls. This happened both through adolescents’ awareness raising at
their own homes, discussing with their parents what they had learned at the MAGs, as well as through the train-
ings and community discussions on children’s rights, which many parent interviewees had attended as well.
“Now the majority of families understands and allows their daughters to study away from home, which is different
from before” (IDI 57, MAG Member 57, Bamyan, F).
“Yes, there were girls who did not go to school, or their families did not allow girls to go to school, but after this
training, they found out and the transferred students were able to even tell their family and be encouraged, and I
also told them how useful going to school is and the families allowed their daughters to go to school.” (IDI 29, MAG
Mentor, Badghis, M)
“… some people did not send their daughters to school. We studied and after going to their houses, we told them
that they should let their daughters to go to school. I myself at first when I was in the village I was going to school.
When I got older, they dropped me out of school. Since I joined this course, I joined back to school to finish the
course.” (IDI 18, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
Aware of their rights and empowered to set goals and make decisions about their own lives, adolescents sensi-
tised their parents to support their education, with the belief that this could enable them to have better opportu-
nities, including working in well-regarded professions and getting involved in the improvement of their own com-
munities. As a result, parents showed more conviction about the importance of education and more willingness
to allow their children to attend school, and in many cases encouraged them to go to school for a better future.
This effect was further backed by interviews with MAG mentors, community and religious leaders.
“Yes, they told us girls have so many rights over their parents, that they should learn and get an education like boys.
People reacted well and were happy. I myself enrolled my daughter in school and I am happy about that.” (IDI 25,
MAG Parent, F, Badghis)
“A: There were discussions that teenagers can study for a brighter future to serve their community in the future.
Q: How did the members of the community react to these discussions? What did people think?
A: The members of the community were happy and decided that the teenagers should study and serve their com-
munity.” (IDI 27, MAG Parent, M, Badghis)
Furthermore, interviewed parents seemed to highly value adolescents’ gained literacy through MAGs. This seems
to be especially beneficial for older adolescents, who got a chance through MAGs and ALCs to ‘catch up’ and attend
school, and who otherwise might have lagged and not found a chance to take up education at their age.
“Yes, for all the changes, I saw that the level of literacy in school had increased and those who were not in school
their education level was better than before, and their lives had changed a lot”. (IDI 39, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
“It made our children fully educated and they learned how to read and write. People were aware of their children’s
rights, and they were supporting their children. I myself support my daughter a lot to study and become a doctor in
the future”. (IDI 25, MAG Parent, Badghis, F)
Moreover, many parents valued that MAGs were not only teaching how to read and write and other useful skills,
but also “good behaviour”. Parents acknowledged that adolescents treated their parents and community in a bet-
ter way since taking part in the groups, showing more respect and better communication, and overall having a
better relationship with their communities.
“Yes, after joining the group, his behaviour changed in terms of learning capacity and knowledge. His behaviour
and treatment with family members and neighbours became good.” (IDI 15, MAG Parent, M, Bamyan)
“We are happy that they got rid of poverty, they study and do good work, they are not addicted [to drugs]; we are
happy that our village is well, their name is raised, they have become our pride.” (IDI 76, MAG Parent, M, Badghis)
Stakeholders’ reports suggest that IALA activities had a positive influence on increasing school enrolment and
decreasing harmful practices which prevent school attendance, such as child marriage, although these results
cannot be generalised by the qualitative study. What can be argued is that MAGs provided adolescents with skills
and motivation to get an education, as well as with advocacy skills that they implemented in their communities
to promote school attendance among their peers and their families. In addition to adolescents’ advocacy, trainings
and community level discussions allowed parents’ and leaders’ to also increase their awareness of children’s
rights and the importance of education, which prompted changes in their attitudes and behaviours towards ado-
lescent schooling and made them more inclined to allow and encourage adolescents to pursue their studies. More-
over, changed views on education also appeared to be related to changes in attitudes towards children’s rights,
in particular early marriage. As one MAG mentor pointed out:
“A lot of things have changed. In the past, people did not know about underage marriages. Especially in the villages,
it decreased unbelievably. Before this project, a lot of boys and girls were not allowed to go to school. But, after this
project, they realized the importance of these issues, especially when we conducted different kinds of sessions and
53
seminars. Finally, they let both genders go to school and underage marriages were avoided”. (IDI 31, MAG Mentor,
Badghis, M).
Yet, even though adolescents and their parents ascribed an increased value to education after taking part in IALA,
systemic challenges, such as difficult economic circumstances, lack of schools, non-availability of higher classes,
and disadvantages for girls in accessing education prevail in many areas. Despite respondents emphasizing the
importance of equal education opportunities for boys and girls, many still observe girls being disadvantaged and
less likely to attend school or to be in school for shorter periods of time as compared to boys. Moreover, govern-
ment regulations strongly influence the level of girls’ education, whereas girls themselves would generally prefer
to be able to go to school and be supported by the government to do so.
“There is a barrier for a girl to study away from home, but there is no barrier for boys. Girls and boys should be
given equal rights.” (IDI 57, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
“Another reason is that the school is mixed, and some families do not allow girls and boys to study in the same class.”
(IDI 65, MAG Parent, Bamyan, F)
“There is no high school in our valley. A high school is present in Shibar which is far away from our valley. The people
in our valley are poor and cannot not send their children to it. Moreover, the transport is also not good. Therefore,
[after] reaching up to 9th class they are unable to continue their education.” (IDI 53, MAG Parent, Bamyan, M).
“People had a good reaction and were happy that they have informed them from these issues but still some of the
people’s mind have not changed and is the same as its first state”. (IDI 11, MAG Parent, Badghis, F).
“I saw a lot of changes in people who did not allow their daughters to go to school. Not supporting their children.
Some of these people had changed their way of thinking, and some of the people have remained the same”. (IDI 27,
MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
More challenges to education and inclusiveness seem to be prevalent in remote locations, further away from cit-
ies. In addition, boys are not only usually favoured over girls to get access to education in case of constraints, but
they also seem to attend school for longer. While unequal treatment of boys and girls has not disappeared, most
respondents reported perceived improvements in terms of access to education for boys and girls compared to
the situation before IALA.
4.6 SUSTAINABILITY
4.6.1 Impediments to the continuation of activities and participation
The continuation of IALA activities after the programme ended has been adversely affected by several major ex-
ternal factors.
Firstly, it should be mentioned that towards the end of the programme implementation, COVID-19 posed disrup-
tions to the activities due to governmental regulations on social distancing and closure of schools. The programme
reacted to this by creating COVID-19 awareness activities and spreading knowledge about hygiene and social
distancing through the MAG participants. However, many activities could not be continued as foreseen.
The conditions brought about by the political transition to Taliban rule are viewed by all stakeholders interviewed
as a key barrier to the continuation of relevant programme activities and the fulfilment of IALA’s goals in gender
equality and access to education. At the time of the evaluation, many schools had been closed, girls were not
allowed to attend10, women were being ordered to cover their faces and remain at home. Many respondents men-
tioned that they had not met since the Taliban had come or had become disengaged.
“We did not follow the programme of the teenager group anymore. For the time being, they are no longer active, I
think more than maybe these insecurities and changes ended or what happened. I do not know after that, and we
did not follow up.” (IDI 53, MAG Parent, Bamyan, M)
"Q: How is situation of your community now? Does any activity run still or is any activity programmed to run?
A: No, it doesn’t now. Because of Taliban most girls cannot go out." (IDI 6, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
“Since the Taliban came, neither the committee nor the group of teenagers came, and we did not meet here any-
more.” (IDI 48, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
Participants were still expectant of any changes to the situation of school reopening and girls’ attendance to
school, which they considered a government responsibility. There was frustration and restlessness regarding the
further course for these developments, as parents and adolescents highlighted the importance of school for them.
“In the previous government, the married women were able to study, but now it is more difficult, and we cannot
study. For us and government should pave the way and let us study for a better future.” (IDI 24, MAG Member,
Badghis, F)
10 By March 23, 2022, the Afghan government announced that schools beyond grade 6 would remain closed for girls: https://to-
lonews.com/afghanistan-177237
54
Moreover, deteriorating economic conditions including unemployment, lack of access to financial support, and
nutrition were causing serious concerns for families in the target areas. Under the new conditions created by the
new Taliban rule, there were reports all over the country of young girls being offered in marriage.
“There are still some people present which differentiate between boys and girls. After the rule of the Emarat [the
current government], there is a special situation, especially for girls, and there are no lessons, and the family pays
a lot of attention to marriages. So, by having such prerequisites some early marriages also take place.” (IDI 77, CL,
F, Bamyan)
Beyond the current situation, there are also structural barriers, both infrastructural and socio-cultural, which are
still present and making an impact in the possible continuation of activities and the reaping of benefits for the
target groups. One is the still limited access to higher levels of classes/schools in the target areas, which particu-
larly girls are affected by, and which can only be deepened by the current school closures and related mandates.
Lack of separate classes for girls and boys also affects attendance. Moreover, poverty and child labour remain
strong barriers for higher and more consistent participation of vulnerable children.
“There is no higher secondary school, if it is established here. My daughter will go to there. She cannot go that far
to Shibar, where higher secondary school is present. Here, only 9th grade classes are being held in school and after
that it is difficult for girls to go as far as Shibar and other places.” (IDI 49, MAG Parent, Bamyan, F)
“ … against boys, the only thing that affects them the most is hard labour, and the question is why it should be done.
The reason is that their fathers are poor, and they dig wells, wheat bricks, reap wheat, and other hard work. Children
are more involved in hard work that deprives them from education. In the problems of our girls, there is no school
at all in their neighbourhoods. They are deprived of lessons and education. Only religious education is given to them,
and another problem is that underage marriages took place due to the poverty of fathers and families. The dowry
must be enough for the husband to pay, and if he cannot, their husband must go to Iran, find expenses, and then get
married.” (IDI 34, MAG CL, Badghis, M)
In addition, prevailing social and gender norms -particularly in remote areas with tribal customs – are still seen
as barriers to broader impacts. It’s understood that, although IALA has made big strides in raising awareness
about children’s rights and children’s protection in the target areas, bringing knowledge that was not there before
and sensitizing communities, changing socio-cultural norms, sensitivities and behaviours is a long process that
takes time. Girls and boys are still treated differently, with boys having more freedom outside the house and girls
being expected to stay indoors. Traditional norms means that some families still do not accept that girls go to
school, especially after they become older. The same undervalue of girls, coupled with economic problems, make
families inclined to child marriage practices (even if these have reportedly decreased according to stakeholders’
views) and to other practices such as girl-for-girl exchanges (Alishani), which were mentioned to still be happen-
ing.
“… the challenges that children are facing, especially girls, are the concern of some customs and traditions, which
should be worked a little in the field of awareness and provide grounds for children to be able to continue their
education and work with their parents and be helping and be partners with health training centres.” (KII 3, Pro-
gramme staff, Bamyan, M)
“Yes, there is. Early marriage is very rare, but girls by girls exchanging alliances and things like that happen and
exist right now.” (IDI 37, RL, Badghis, M)
Lack of awareness of children’s rights is usually linked by stakeholders to illiteracy. Stakeholders considered that
girls are treated less well in illiterate families and are less likely to be able to attend schooling. Promoting educa-
tion to end illiteracy at community level was also mentioned as an important factor.
4.6.2 Enablers to continuation of activities and participation
On the other hand, there are also many enablers for the continuation of activities. A key one is parents’ and com-
munities’ increased awareness of children’s rights and the momentum generated by IALA’s activities. Despite
early resistance, many people in the target communities have become accepting of the MAG activities, and the
positive changes seen in adolescents have meant that support for these and for adolescents at community level
has increased. The basis created for the programme, and the social networks it tapped into, is still there to a great
extent despite the migration and displacement that have occurred, and this platform can be utilized for any future
activities in the same direction. Furthermore, as the understanding of the importance of education has increased
among many parents in the target communities, so has the demand for education for their children. This is shown
by interviewed parents requesting for schools to be back as well as for the formation of more literacy groups.
“In the first place, the same kind that [adolescents] are not given a chance in the societies of Afghanistan and the
suggestions made by them are not considered, and if they are taken into account, it is very rare. At first, they did not
believe in teenagers, and we asked them to let them know what they are doing. Even some of the next members
attended the elders' meetings, which was remarkable.” (KII 1, Programme staff, Bamyan, M)
Considering the importance of parental support for both adolescents’ participation and their ability to fully en-
gage with the programme and achieve the learning outcomes, parents’ engagement can become a key enabler (or
a key barrier) for activities. A systematic parental involvement is therefore crucial for the success of the pro-
gramme.
Another key enabler is the wealth of knowledge created and sustained by MAG members, which can be tapped
into for continuation of activities. They also have developed strong experience of designing and implementing
55
actions at community level, which can continue to promote the institutionalisation of volunteering. Some MAG
members mentioned that they continue to informally share and discuss contents that they learned with their
immediate environments. Moreover, some MAGs are still active and undertaking voluntary work in the areas of
literacy, or carrying out activities for promotion of children’s rights, hygiene and cleanliness. Some types of post-
programme activities were reported in Bamyan centre, Keligan, Baghlar, KandiHa and Seyalayak. For instance,
there were accounts of adolescents in Bamyan centre continuing literacy teachings, and in Seya Layak MAG mem-
bers expressed discussing health issues such as the importance of hand washing. In some villages in Badghis
(Khoda Madaha, Dahan Baghak), some interviewees mentioned holding informal discussions in relevant topics
when needed in the community, while one interviewee mentioned that the child protection committee is still
active. The continuity of initiatives seems to be linked to the levels of internalisation that the community has
managed to acquire regarding the importance of the activities undertaken, as well as to the strength of their mo-
tivation for voluntary work.
“…in some places voluntary work is still done by group members in areas such as literacy and other work.” (IDI 82,
MAG Mentor, Bamyan, M)
“Yes, the activities which were in committee are still in progress. For example, the health, education, and children
protection committees. In addition, the children protection committee is still striving to prevent underage mar-
riages. Moreover, the education and training committee is encouraging people to study.” (IDI 31, MAG Mentor,
Badghis, M)
“Currently, the situation is good. It’s done due to the necessity of the people. If there is a problem, they gather in the
mosque and each of us expresses his views among the people.” (IDI 27, MAG Parent, Badghis, M)
Moreover, some community and religious leaders interviewed commented that they continue to share the teach-
ings and be involved in problem solving in their areas in issues that could affect adolescents; this was mentioned
as they have incorporated this task into their role and the consideration of their responsibilities, and they do so
in formal contexts such as sermons at the mosque or madrasas, or also in informal discussions.
“There is no definite plan. Due to the demanding time, when a problem arises, we realize that this may cause prob-
lems for the children of our society, so when we find that something does not have a good outcome, at that moment
we search for a solution.” (IDI 35, RL, Badghis, M)
“There is no set time and whenever it is available, for example, if there is any party, ceremony, event or reciting the
Quran; those who have taken the course transfer their information in those places.” (IDI 33, RL, Badghis, M)
Many parents and adolescents seemed to have remained highly engaged with the programme and expressed their
wishes for it to restart and continue educational activities. They expressed their wishes for the programme to
restart, and there was a clear sense of momentum to be ‘grabbed’ as an enabler for the continuation of the activ-
ities.
“Yes, there is so much enthusiasm. If it starts again, the previous members would definitely participate and those
people who have never been a member, they also seem really interested. Because this group is informative for the
people.” (IDI 75, MAG Member, Bamyan, M)
“For now, they do not let girls to go to school and study, but the boys are allowed. But we study with ourselves.
Please continue these courses, I love to study, help people, and fulfil my dreams about becoming a doctor. I will be
happy if you could help us.” (IDI 24, MAG Member, Badghis, F)
Many respondents, both beneficiaries and programme staff, pointed out that a continuation of the programme
would constitute an opportunity to consolidate the knowledge imparted and the changes that had begun to take
place, and that without this continuation the impacts would suffer.
“We may lose and forget the things we have already learned, and if they are renewed, we may learn new things.”
(IDI, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
“Yes, but there are some changes because if there is an activity in a society, there will be changes. If there is no
activity, the changes that have taken place will disappear over the time.” (IDI 39, MAG Mentor, Badghis, M)
“I would like to say that abandoning the programme in this way is a waste of what we have done so far, that is, we
did and completed a task, but we did not continue. For example, the force that we have built their capacity is there
and we can use those resources more. If this programme continues and a youth follow-up programme is taken from
the programmes that have worked so far, and if it works on a larger scale, it will be much better.” (KII 3, Programme
staff, M, Bamyan)

5 ANALYSIS OF FINDINGS USING PROCESS TRACING
On the basis of the summarised empirical findings outlined in Section 4, the evaluation team re-clustered the
evidence according to the Theory of Change sequence, to establish if and to what extent the steps have been fol-
lowed and outcomes achieved as a result of the intervention. As discussed previously in section 3.1, we have used
two variants of PT to guide the two parallel concerns of the evaluation: to validate the theory of change and to
identify and explain how and why certain outcomes happened and to what extent. Theory-testing PT was used to
test the validity and assumptions of the Theory of Change developed in the midline evaluation and to analyse
whether the respective causal mechanisms expected to lead to particular outcomes were present and occurred
as assumed. Explaining-outcome PT helped to obtain a detailed understanding of how these mechanisms worked
to produce the outcomes and was used to compare the evidence for several competing explanations and to iden-
tify the ones that were most robustly supported by evidence. Firstly, in section 5.1., we outline the evidence of the
processes that took place under IALA to test which underlying assumptions for the programme’s performance
held and which did not and why. Next, in sections 5.2 and 5.3., we analyse IALA’s achievement of outcomes using
explaining-outcome PT. The two variants can broadly be understood as examining whether all parts of the theory
existed and were working, and the other is a form of “tracing backwards”. The two variants however remain part
of the same method so are used here in a complementary manner without there being a clear-cut division.
5.1 THEORY OF CHANGE VALIDATION
Figure 5: Theory of Change (Source: Midline Evaluation, 2020)
5.1.1 Assumptions
The ToC foresaw two overall assumptions and a series of more specific assumptions according to different realms
of activities. The first overall assumption on adolescent activities being approved by parents, communities, gov-
ernmental and not governmental entities held partially true. As indicated in the previous section, there was re-
sistance found in the communities, particularly at the beginning, which incurred in some adolescents not being
able to participate or their group activities suffering from limited legitimacy. However, levels of resistance dif-
fered between communities. There is evidence that resistance was overcome over time, and overall, the levels of
resistance did not impede programme activities from going forward, with just some design changes happening to
ensure continuation (e.g., holding gender separate MAGs). The second overall assumption, on community mem-
bers being allowed and interested to take part in the activities, also held partially true. There was no evidence
found to suggest that community members were generally not allowed to join the activities, and there were
57
accounts of participation of various stakeholders within the community, although the levels of interest and in-
volvement differed. With regard to specific assumptions, we can conclude that:
• There were premises in a village (or village nearby), which could serve as a suitable venue for MAG activities
(held partially true), although this proved to be a challenge in some communities.
• The qualifications and availability of trainers was satisfactory to supervise the groups (held true). No evi-
dence was gathered regarding any substantial lack of trainer preparation, even though there were re-
quests to enhance training on certain aspects, including visual aids, child protection topics, and specific
training for illiterate children.
• There were enough in-school and out of school adolescents in a village to create a MAG (held partially true).
Some MAGs had to be created with adolescents from nearby villages, which produced challenges for their
accessibility.
• All activities were delivered in time and in full amount, and did not suffer from inadequate resources, for
e.g., books and chalk (held partially true). Most activities were delivered. However, there were some de-
lays in resource delivery which were later remedied, and some activities could not be held due to delays
(community action plans in Badghis) and external factors (COVID-19);
• Community members had access to the radio/mobile phones (e.g., to listen to the radio drama) (not held).
Most adolescents reportedly did not have access to mobile phones, and if they did have access to radio,
this was not considered a main medium of information and communication for them.
• Literacy rate was high enough to access the information provided during the CL/RL trainings and the life
skills, self-expression, and other trainings (not held). Literacy was a key challenge in training delivery, and
design changes needed to be incurred to deal with this widely present issue. However, succesful adapta-
tions such as using more visual material and role play were carried out.
• MAGs were meeting on a regular basis and some traditional practices (e.g., Ailaq), which require a long
absence from a village, are not leading to the deterioration of the learning outcomes (partially held). The
evidence collected suggests that MAGs were mostly meeting on a regular basis. However, traditional
practices, including farming and shepherding done by adolescents, were found to be an important factor
impacting attendance and engagement in MAGs.
• The cascade learning approach was feasible, e.g., all adolescents were not approaching the same set of in-
dividuals to pass on their knowledge (partially held, according to available evidence): the evaluation did
not include out-of-MAG adolescents; thus, conclusions regarding the cascade learning’s suitability for
them cannot be drawn. What can be affirmed is that the evidence collected suggests the cascade ap-
proach was successfully held to some extent, as all adolescents reported having shared their knowledge
with others (at least all with peers, most with family, and some with other community members as well).
• Trainings for influential community members were comprehensive enough to positively influence their
views on adolescents and harmful traditional practices (held true). According to the evidence gathered,
trainings seem to have been comprehensive enough in terms of their coverage of children’s rights and
protection.
• Adolescents identify early marriage, adolescent pregnancy, and school dropout as challenges that are rele-
vant to them and communicate those to the authorities (held partially true). The evidence collected sug-
gests that adolescents viewed these three topics as problems worthy of consideration, and there is evi-
dence of some adolescents communicating these to leaders. However, there is no evidence of them com-
municating with other authorities.
• The governmental/non-governmental organisations and institutions were acting upon the communicated
problems: service providers (Pillar III) were not the focus of this evaluation. The evidence collected sug-
gests that there were some mobilisation efforts from influential community members and programme
implementers towards authorities. However, the government apparatus was in flux at the time of the
study, and no further conclusions can be drawn.
• The services for adolescents existed and were accessible, i.e., schools for girls to (re-)enroll into are close by
for them to walk to without harm (not held, according to available evidence). Limited number of schools
and ALCs for girls and lack of access to these in some areas were identified by various stakeholders as
key challenges to girls’ empowerment. Moreover, at the time of the evaluation, many schools were
closed, and there was uncertainty about their reopening by the new Taliban administration (see also
footnote 5).
5.1.2 Inputs
According to the evaluation findings, most inputs outlined in the Theory of Change were delivered: MAG
trainers and supervisors were put in place following capacity building, and funds for creating life skills train-
ings, sports for development were overall provided; venues for trainings were overall made available for
participants, though this was only partially the case for MAG premises, as they depended on community
resources and there were occasional issuesfor groups to have appropriate venues. Funds were also consid-
ered insufficient for the realisation of some community-level activities and action plan (details on inputs are
available on section 4.2.6).
58
5.1.3 Activities
Inputs were utilised to carry out the wide variety of IALA activities foreseen in the programme design and
reflected in the ToC. The implementation did not face major issues in delivering its activities, with the exception
of the COVID-19 pandemic, which halted most programme activities in the last quarter. However, several chal-
lenges emanating from both the contexts in which the activities operated (’demand’ side), as well as from the
programme’s design and operations (‘programmematic’ side) had tangible effects on implementation, producing
divergencies and operational challenges (detailed analysis provided in section 4.2.6).
5.1.4 Outputs
The evidence collected suggests that some outputs outlined in the ToC were achieved by the programme, while
others partially so, with specific differences between the achievements of pillars I and II. Adolescents participated
in MAGs and shared their lessons learned with the communities, particularly with peers and families, while also
with community members to some extent. Adolescents communicated their problems, mostly to peers and fami-
lies, and some to leaders, while there is no evidence of their communication to other authorities, and they also
engaged in social actions to prevent harmful practices, mostly in the context of MAGs. There is also evidence that
some leaders used the information obtained for adolescent protection, propagating it formally or informally and
engaging in activities to promote protection. Outside of the MAGs and the community trainings and discussions,
there is limited evidence in our qualitative sample of systematic community actions taking place for protection.
Yet, there are some reports of community members and leaders reaching out to others on an individual case by
case basis, and some reports of occasional discussions (at the mosques or informally) regarding problems raised
at community level (details available in Section 4).
5.1.5 Outcomes
How do these outputs translate into achieved programme outcomes? In order to shed light on the outcomes
achieved by the programme and how these came about, the evaluation chose to utilise explaining-outcome pro-
cess tracing. To provide explanations on how and to what extent outcomes were achieved, we operationalised the
two outcomes outlined by the ToC by identifying the sequential steps needed to reach each, and then analysed
the extent to which each step was completed against the evidence collected - triangulating results from the quan-
titative midline and the qualitative summative evaluations. This more inductive and holistic exercise allows us to
trace and explain the processes that lead to fully or partially achieved outcomes, ensuring a holistic coverage of
the steps, as well as the incorporation of feasible explanations to rule out alternatives that could have led to the
outcomes.
The explaining-outcome variant of PT addresses the problem of attribution by carrying out “process induction”
where a number of (competing) hypotheses that connect an intervention to an outcome through a “chain” of
causal mechanisms and intervening steps is identified (White and Philips 2012). Each of these hypotheses is then
examined against the evidence, which can then eliminate, confirm, strengthen or weaken a particular hypothesis.
By examining the entire series/chain of intervening “links” against the evidence, we come to the series of linked
hypotheses, which connects the intervention to the outcome (Befani and Stedman-Bryce 2017).

Figure 6: Causal chain – Outcome 1
Outcome theory: By the end of the programme, adolescents from two target provinces are able to communicate
with each other, sharing information among peers, and with policy makers through various avenues, such as so-
cial media forums, mobile technologies, and traditional methods of communication at the local levels, and at least
52,334 adolescents (50% female and 50% male) are mobilized as agents of change for themselves and their com-
munities through engaging in adolescent groups/Shuras. The programme reached a total of 86,528 adolescents
(43,071 M / 43,457 F) and 90,224 young adults (46,244 M / 43,980 F) through 176 Multi-purpose Adolescent
Groups (MAGs).
5.2.1 Intermediate outcome 1.1a:
Adolescents learned about their rights
As shown in the previous result section, most adolescent respondents mentioned that they had become more
aware of their rights following their participation in IALA, as the following representative response illustrates:
“It was regarding gender, children rights, and how long they are considered children, and what are their rights over
parents […] It felt good. In addition to the questions that were in my mind, I also encountered questions from other
students and got familiar with those who were there.” (IDI 63, MAG Member, F, Bamyan).
These were all topics they had not previously considered (marriage, access to education, health, etc.), and several
respondents mentioned asking mentors and their parents for more information on their rights.
During the summative evaluation, most adolescents identified learning about life skills and their rights as a very
important outcome of their participation in MAG. Adolescents reported to practically not have discussed the top-
ics of the life skills trainings prior to the involvement in the MAGs, as they neither had the information nor the
skills and confidence to do this. For instance, one respondent stated, “I had no information about self-esteem be-
fore, and had even not heard its name. The other thing on which I had no information was conflict. After joining MAG,
I have learned these topics, which are new for me.” (IDI 57, MAG Member, Bamyan, F)
The fact that these topics remained salient even years after they learned about it shows its importance to the
participants (see also Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.9).
5.2.2 Intermediate outcome 1.1b:
Adolescents identify (1) early marriage, (2) early pregnancy, and (3) low access to education as problems
In the IALA midline and baseline data, approximately 45% of the adolescents identified bad quality of education
as a major concern, and 36% thought that the absence of schools is a challenge. In total, around 66% of the ado-
lescents thought that barriers to education were a major challenge they faced. However, only around 16% of the
interviewed adolescents considered early marriage to be one of the major difficulties in general, while 26% also
named child labour as one of the issues they face. In the summative evaluation, all adolescents interviewed ex-
pressed concern about early marriage, seeing it as a detrimental practice, and identified education as an im-
portant concern in their lives, for both boys and girls. Only very few respondents mentioned early pregnancy in
the summative evaluation. As there was a purposive sample accounting for gender balance, and the interviewers
were of the same gender, this could be considered somewhat surprising. However, the low salience of this topic
can be explained by the fact that early pregnancy had been subsumed by early marriage as a problem, i.e., early
pregnancy was seen as one argument (amongst many) against early marriage, but not considered separately as
an issue on its own (see Sections 4.4.9).
5.2.3 Alternative hypothesis (null) 1.1c:
There was no increase in awareness. Adolescents were already aware of their rights and problems OR
adolescents did not learn anything new and remained unaware of their rights and problems.
This hypothesis can be divided into three parts, a) the messaging or training did not reach the intended recipients,
b) the recipients were unable to access the messaging primarily due to illiteracy, c) the recipients did not find the
information novel or useful.
Evidence from the midline evaluation showed that countrywide media and messaging is only successful in reach-
ing a small share of the population. When analysing the source of media that makes the biggest impact in 2017,
the reach of television (23.2%) is the greatest, followed by radio (19.7%) and finally newspapers (3.3%) (Frölich
et al. 2019, p. 81). As part of the radio programme, adolescents in Bamyan and Badghis received training on child
marriage and the importance of education as a preparatory measure before they engaged in live debates and
discussions with civil society and government representatives. However, the adolescents’ interaction with the
radio programme remained inadequate as the reach of the programme is reported to be somewhat limited. In
60
addition, 15 out of 29 adolescents interviewed during the midline reported not listening to the radio at all, and
only five had participated in community or MAG radio listening sessions (ibid. P. 39). According to the IALA base-
line and midline data, the three main channels to learn about rights and entitlements are friends and family
(51%), mosque (41%), and TV (20%). Radio is thus not necessarily a popular medium of instruction (Section
4.1.6).
Interviewed adolescents showed strong engagement with the MAG concept and activities and reported that most
of their group members attended regularly and participated actively, with absences being of a few students only
in each group. Illiterate children had a more difficult time participating and grasping the concepts of the teachings,
and it seems that their retention was more difficult than for literate children. Yet, there are many accounts that
show that the MAGs motivated participants to become literate and to continue with their studies. Furthermore,
training materials were revised, and MAG mentors used drawing and other activities to foster engagement and
understanding of illiterate children (Section 4.1.3).
Efforts to adjust MAG activities were not limited to contents; MAG adolescents were encouraged to support their
illiterate counterparts to help them incorporate the teachings, for instance by sitting next to them in the trainings,
and to solve problems when they could not. In Bamyan, this also generated the launch of literacy groups to teach
their peers to read and write, with the support of mentors and teachers (see Sections 4.1.1 and 4.3.1).
The null hypothesis can thus be completely rejected, as it is clear that messaging reached the MAG participants
(though the role of radio is insignificant); information could be accessed even by out-of-school participants and
the participants found it useful, as almost all responses calling it meaningful and important even after several
years document.
Conclusion: Adolescents learned new skills and increased their awareness. Awareness was built especially re-
garding the importance of education. There was also some increase in awareness about the problem of early mar-
riage, with early pregnancy seen as a subset of this problem. Illiterate children had difficulty accessing and re-
taining information, but this was addressed by revising teaching to be more visual and engaging through activities
that improved the learning for illiterate participants. An unexpected benefit was that illiterate children were mo-
tivated to become literate as a result of MAG. Some of the biggest benefits were in the area of life skills, with many
participants mentioning that they developed an understanding of the importance of self-esteem. Another im-
portant finding was that most adolescents identified aggression as a problem, with several specifically mentioning
“telling peers and parents not to be angry” and “counting to 20 to reduce aggression” as something important that
they learned. Listening to radio did not play any significant role in this outcome, though participation in commu-
nity radio created a major improvement in the participants’ self-confidence and communication skills.
5.2.4 Intermediate outcome 1.2a
Adolescents developed their communication and advocacy skills
During midline, there was evidence that several adolescents and a MAG member in Bamyan wrote short stories
and an article that addressed, among other things, the importance of education after he had acquired the neces-
sary skills from the self-expression and writing training (Frölich et al., 2019, p. 28). During endline, respondents
mentioned having taken part in theatre and door to door outreach activities, which is also a strong sign of an
increase in communication skills.
During endline, all participant groups described a number of actions taken by adolescents to communicate their
learning outcomes. Adolescents’ increased confidence has facilitated their involvement in community-level ac-
tions, including talking with their peers, family, and community members about topics they had learned in the
MAG, and participating in activities of the MAG group in their areas, such as awareness-raising on early marriage,
promotion of education among adolescents, involvement in literacy groups, theatre, hygiene promotion, and en-
vironmental campaigns (see Sections 4.5.3 and 4.5.4).
All adolescent respondents reported having improved their communication and interpersonal relationship skills,
with most expressing that this had happened both within and outside their homes. Adolescents mentioned that
they had learned how to talk to others, to better deal with conflicts and manage anger, to express their feelings
and their problems, and they had generally improved their interpersonal relationships outside of their home,
including better relations with other people and an improved ability to make friends. Moreover, they expressed
greater confidence in themselves also from a communication standpoint, which has allowed them for example to
speak out in class to other peers and to get involved in community outreach activities (see Sections 4.4.2 and
4.4.4).
5.2.5 Alternative hypothesis (null) 1.2b
Adolescents were unable to communicate their learning (if any) resulting from intermediate outcome 1
61
There is significant evidence from 1.2a and 1.3a (see below) based on which the null hypothesis can be rejected.
5.2.6 Intermediate outcome 1.3a
Adolescents trained and/or reached out to others (peers, parents, leaders and community) to communi-
cate knowledge, problems, and actions.
Adolescents felt that sharing their knowledge with others was their duty, and they described to have worked both
inside and outside of the school to do so. Overall, the MAG members interviewed reported feeling confident and
comfortable with transferring their new knowledge on life skills to their peers. In most cases, they expressed
having had positive experiences with mentoring, with peers being receptive to their efforts and feeling happy
about the contents they learned (see Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.9).
Most adolescents interviewed spread their knowledge about the harmful effects of child marriage by discussing
it with their peers (friends, school classmates, out of school children) and their families (parents, siblings and
relatives from their extended family); there were only a few cases of adolescents who had not discussed this topic
with their parents. There are also several accounts of adolescents engaging the families of other adolescents, and
even sometimes community leaders, to help prevent child marriages in their areas (see Section 4.3.5).
There were also many accounts of adolescents taking part in informal campaigns to raise awareness of the issues
learned at the MAGs, e.g., going door-to-door to families to increase awareness about the importance of education.
MAG members also talked to families of adolescents who did not send their children to school to convince them
to do so, as well as to prevent child marriages in cases where families were supporting this practice. Adolescents
described doing this individually or as part of wider campaigns organised with their MAGs. Furthermore, adoles-
cents described the organisation of social actions to improve their communities, such as cleaning campaigns, tree
planting, health awareness (e.g., during COVID-19), and cultural and sports activities to promote children’s rights
(e.g., community theatre about early marriage, sports competitions in football and volleyball featuring boys and
girls; see also Section 4.4.5).
Evidence of adolescents reaching out to community and religious leaders to discuss problems was present but
much less uniform across MAGs than in the cases of reaching out to peers or families. Almost half of the adoles-
cents mentioned reaching out to community or religious leaders about issues important to adolescents in the
community.
5.2.7 Alternative hypothesis (null) 1.3b
Adolescents did not reach out to others, even if intermediate outcome 1.2a is evident.
The evaluation did not find evidence of adolescents’ communication with policy makers from the discussions held
with participants. None of the adolescents interviewed mentioned any child protection services when asked about
a potential point of reference for problems or complaints, naming instead their parents or village representatives.
However, the evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of outcome 1.3a, so the null hypothesis can be rejected.
Conclusion: One limitation of the qualitative study is that it did not include non-MAG adolescents. Therefore, the
quality of the knowledge delivery of LST and reception by non-MAG members could not be analysed. There is
strong evidence for outcome 1.3a, and adolescents showed considerable intrinsic motivation in reaching out to
their community, peers and parents. However, there is almost no evidence of their engagement with policy mak-
ers, and there is a clear difference in terms of the authority figures adolescents actually reached out to. It is highly
likely that there was some hesitation and large differences in terms of the target groups of their advocacy if it
involved authority figures.
5.2.8 Intermediate outcome 1.4a
Peers, parents and community leaders listened to the adolescents and act in response to it.
According to adult stakeholders, MAG members showed stronger community involvement than they did before
joining the MAG, which is evidenced by the various actions described. Mentors and programme staff also acknowl-
edged that adolescents had faced difficulties in their community outreach activities, particularly at the beginning,
when they faced more community resistance and less legitimacy. Community members did not understand
and/or opposed adolescents reaching out to discuss these topics; however, this changed over time through sen-
sitization and awareness work. Many adolescents interviewed described feeling an improvement in their status
and respect of their communities towards them after participation in the MAGs.
There were also examples of successful interventions where the advocacy of adolescents influenced parents and
community leaders (see Sections 4.5.23 and 4.4.4), showing that adolescents engaged in advocacy and were even
supported by their peers and/or families to influence others.

5.2.9 Alternative hypothesis (null) 1.4b
Adolescents’ communications (if any) are ignored
According to participants’ accounts (adolescents, parents, and mentors), most families’ reactions to adolescents
sharing the contents of the MAGs were mainly positive, even though there were different levels of acceptance/re-
sistance. Some parents still opposed these contents, with residents of smaller or more remote villages seemingly
having a more difficult experience with this. However, the resistance and/or opposition seems to have lessened
over time, as parents and community members realized that their children were gaining knowledge that they
considered important or useful for their children, and as they saw first-hand positive changes in their children as
they took part in the MAGs (see Section 4.5.3). There is also evidence of changes in parental attitudes and behav-
iours towards adolescents’ rights after they reached out to their families, including for instance more openness
to allow or encourage them to go to school and to make decisions.
5.2.10 Final outcome
Breakdown of outcome 1 in two parts:
Adolescents able to communicate with each other and policy makers to share information
As seen in the discussion of intermediate outcomes, adolescents were able to communicate with each other, their
families and village elders. Although communication between adolescents and policy makers cannot be shown,
there is evidence that a few parents of MAG members got involved with education offices and councils. Further-
more, programme staff have reached out to government counterparts when cases were reported by MAG mem-
bers.
There is also evidence that the most effective communication occurred not through the use of technological aids
or radio but rather through activities such as theatre and door to door outreach.
Adolescents are mobilized as agents of change
Adolescents acted as agents of change for peers in their communities, campaigning outside the MAGs to promote
access to education and expose the detriments of early marriage. They did this via different means, including peer
to peer learning, reaching out to the families of out of school children to discuss their right to access education,
and sometimes talking to community or religious leaders to help them solve problems. They also carried out var-
ious awareness raising activities such as participating in community discussions, going door-to-door to families,
and implementing artistic activities such as theatre to promote children’s rights. In some cases, adolescents also
involved community and religious leaders to overcome the challenges of families who were refusing to send their
children to school.

Outcome theory: By the end of the programme, 60,651 religious leaders, elders, parents and influential individ-
uals from the community in the 11 districts of the 2 target provinces support adolescents, especially girls, to ac-
cess services, participate in decision making and prevent their exposure to harmful traditional practices leading
to abuse and exploitation. The programme reached a total of 35,970 (17,584 M / 18,386 F) community leaders
through community engagement campaigns including development and roll-out of community action plans to
remove barriers to adolescent girls’ and boys’ access to education.
5.3.1 Intermediate outcome 2.1a
RL/CLs, parents, and community were sensitized about adolescents’ rights and harmful traditional prac-
tices
RLs learned about children’s rights from a religious/Islamic perspective through arguments from religious texts
on Child Rights in Islam training. During the training, they learned about girls’ needs and the relationships be-
tween quitting school and child marriage, girls’ vulnerability to verbal and sexual harassment, and equality be-
tween men and women as it relates to child rights. Religious leaders considered that the trainings received on
Child Rights in Islam were in line with Islamic law and teachings and thus expressed satisfaction with the con-
tents. They reported that they had acquired new knowledge about important topics regarding children’s rights
and their place in society according to Islam, which included their rights to education, to not be involved in hard
labour or early marriage, and children’s healthcare (see Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2). Religious leaders further em-
phasized that it is important that programme goals do not contradict teachings of Islam. While some community
members first felt that the way topics were addressed during community discussions was not in line with their
understanding of the Quran, religious leaders underlined that according to their interpretation, IALA goals for
awareness raising were indeed aligned with what they preach about Islam, and that this allowed them to convince
community members (see Section 4.2.4).
Influential community members were exposed to topics such as children’s rights, gender equality, equal access to
education, prevention of child marriage, and domestic violence, as well as the right to hygiene. Trainings and
sessions were considered by community and religious leaders to have been in accordance with the teachings of
Islam, and thus socially and culturally relevant (see Section 4.2.4). Community leaders stated that they acquired
knowledge through the trainings that they did not have before about children’s rights and their place in society.
The new knowledge included how to consider and treat children, the protection of children against harmful prac-
tices, such as early marriage and child labour, the importance of education, learning about the value of girls, and
the importance of non-discrimination between boys and girls, and children’s health. Trainings and sessions were
considered to have been in accordance with the teachings of Islam, and thus socially and culturally relevant (see
Section 4.2.1).
5.3.2 Alternative hypothesis (null) 2.1b
RL/CLs, parents, and community were sensitized about adolescents’ rights and harmful traditional prac-
tices but did not learn anything new
Trainings and sessions for influential community leaders seem to have been comprehensive enough, covering a
wide variety of child protection issues. There is evidence that leaders substantially increased their awareness
about these topics, of which, in their own words, they did not have too much knowledge and understanding be-
fore. Most interview responses showed that RL/CL considered the knowledge novel and useful. Therefore, the
null hypothesis can be rejected.
5.3.3 Intermediate outcome 2.2a
RL/CLs, parents and community accepted/took up views on adolescents’ rights and harmful tradi-
tional practices
RL/CLs seemed to accept the messages transferred regarding adolescents’ development and rights, including
their right to education and the non-discrimination of girls. There is evidence that leaders contributed to sharing
the knowledge they gained with adolescents and community members on children’s rights, bringing awareness
to their communities about adolescents’ place in society, the harmful effects of child marriages, the importance
of education, their rights to refrain from hard labour, the rights of girls and the importance of non-discrimination.
The high amount of dowry and the problems this creates socially was also raised by some leaders. Knowledge
was shared through religious sermons at mosques, sessions at the Madrasas (separate for boys and girls), ‘formal’
community discussions, as well as in informal gatherings where topics of child rights were addressed (see Section
4.2.4).
Messaging on the importance of children’s education was generally well received. However, there was some re-
sistance to other messages. One of the topics which seems to have had a less uniform response was child marriage,
as disagreements were cited on this topic both at the midline and in the endline, particularly on the appropriate
64
age for girls to get married. Some conflicting responses were found, for example, with some community and reli-
gious leaders interviewed stating that marriage for a girl could be done over 15 or 16 years of age and 18 years
for boys (even though they recommended that they be older), while most emphasized to have at least the legal
age of 18 years old for both (see Section 4.2.4).
Almost all RLs and CLs stated that marriage should only happen after puberty, and they relativised between the
age of marriage that was permissible and the age of marriage that was advisable (e.g., IDI 36 RL, M, Badghis; IDI
77, CL, F, Bamyan).
The messaging regarding child marriage seems to have been received partially by RLs/CLs and parents, but there
was only slight support for the idea that adolescents should make decisions about their marriage. However, there
were more mentions that adolescents should be consulted about their marriage (though the final decision would
stay with the parents).
5.3.4 Alternative hypothesis (null) 2.2b
RL/CLs, parents and community ignored what they learned (even if 2.1a is true).
The evidence does not suggest that RL/CLs, parents, and community ignored what they learned, but there was a
significant aspect of selective interpretation of the messaging, which means this hypothesis may be somewhat
true.
Conclusion
There is a mixed picture regarding the messaging and the recipients’ resistance to it. While the right of adoles-
cents, including girls, having access to education was well received, other areas, such as child marriage were only
partially accepted by some RLs/CLs (though all parents accepted marriage below the legal age to be wrong) and
the point about adolescents’ inclusion in decision-making found limited resonance. Different categories of re-
spondents took up the messaging to different degrees, and in cases where it conflicted too much with previously
held beliefs, they appear to have disregarded or relativised it.
5.3.5 Intermediate outcome 2.3b
RL/CLs, parents and community allow and/or encourage adolescents to participate in decision-making
After IALA, spaces seem to have opened up in terms of decision making for adolescents, even if the extent of that
space differs. Parents still feature as the main decision-makers in families (and most frequently the father), but
there is some evidence of changes in family dynamics, with most of the adolescents interviewed reporting to now
have the confidence to reach out to their families in matters that concern them. They also mentioned that they
voiced their opinions, being consulted by their families and/or taking part in decisions, even if the final decision
in many aspects is the parents’. At the same time, many parents expressed that they allowed their children to
make decisions about their lives (including daily life and education). This enlarged space had practical conse-
quences for adolescents, as in many cases it led to changes regarding some aspects of their lives, such as attending
school, with adolescents convincing their parents to study. A major concern for parents was that their children
should make the right decisions, and parental approaches in their daily life decision-making differed from having
a consultative role (giving advice, guidance) to a more active one, including approving or disapproving of deci-
sions made (see Section 4.3.4).
All parents interviewed acknowledged early marriage as a harmful practice, stating that there should not be any
forced marriages and that consent should be given from all parties, with almost all setting the acceptable age for
marriage over 18 years and usually over 20 years. Some parents mentioned that girls and boys are the decision-
makers, while others considered the parents to have a key role in this decision. Most considered that marriage is
a decision taken together in consultation between parents and adolescents, even if some parents still expressed
that the decision is ultimately theirs as guardians of their children (see Section 4.3.5).
5.3.6 Intermediate outcome 2.3c
RL/CLs, parents, and community intervene to prevent adolescents’ exposure to harmful practices
There is anecdotal evidence of interventions to stop underage marriages and to promote school attendance.
There is evidence that leaders contributed to sharing the knowledge they gained with adolescents and community
members on children’s rights, bringing awareness to their communities about adolescents’ place in society, the
harmful effects of child marriages, the importance of education, the rights of girls, and the importance of non-
discrimination. The high amount of dowry and the problems this creates socially was also raised by some leaders.
Knowledge has been shared through religious sermons at mosques, sessions at the Madrasas (separate for boys
and girls), ‘formal’ community discussions, as well as in informal gatherings where topics of child rights were
addressed.
65
5.3.7 Alternative hypothesis (null) 2.3d
RL/CLs, parents and community take no action even if 2a is true
Due to considerable evidence to the contrary, the null hypothesis can be rejected
5.3.8 Final outcome 2.4a
RL/CLs, parents and community support adolescents to access services
The vast majority of parents interviewed were aware of the activities that their children took part in at MAGs;
only few did not know about them. Many parents reported to have sometimes attended meetings to understand
what their children discussed and learnt in those spaces. Mentors mentioned that most parents were collabora-
tive, and sometimes even joined the group’s activities, although they also reported that there was little coopera-
tion in some areas. Mentors and programme staff also pointed out that without parental support allowing or en-
couraging their children to participate, MAG activities would not have been possible. There is also evidence that
children sought the support of community members, parents, and clergy to enable the access of other adolescents
to services (see Sections 4.3.5 and 4.4.5).
The political transition to the Taliban administration is seen by all stakeholders interviewed as a key barrier to
the continuation of relevant programme activities and the fulfilment of IALA’s goals in gender equality and access
to education. At the time of the evaluation, many schools had been closed, girls were not allowed to attend school,
women were ordered to cover their faces and remain at home. Respondents mentioned that they had not met or
had become disengaged since the Taliban had come. Thus, not only have services been affected but also access to
them is likely to be affected by this factor beyond the programme’s control.
5.3.9 Final outcome 2.4b
RL/CLs, parents, and community support adolescents' participation in decision making processes and
prevent exposure to harmful traditional practices
There is some evidence of changes in family dynamics resulting from the programme, with most of the adoles-
cents interviewed reporting to have the confidence now to reach out to their families in matters that concern
them. They also mentioned that they voiced their opinions, were consulted by their families, or took part in deci-
sions, even if the final decision was the parents’. At the same time, many parents expressed that they allowed their
children to make decisions about their lives (including daily life and education). This enlarged space had practical
consequences for adolescents, as in many cases it led to changes regarding some aspect of their lives, such as
attending school, with adolescents convincing their parents to study (see Section 4.4.3).
In addition to leaders’ spreading information and knowledge, there was some evidence of community and reli-
gious leaders having played roles as agents of change themselves by getting involved in practices to prevent and
reduce child marriage and to promote access to education by adolescents. For example, respondents mentioned
that Imams started paying attention to the age and the consents of girls for the marriage to be carried out, and
there were accounts of leaders participating in the prevention of child marriages by convincing the families of its
harmful effects. There are also accounts of leaders being reached out to get involved in talking to families to sup-
port adolescents to go to school (see Section 4.4.5).
5.3.10 Conclusion
Though it is clear that sensitisation of RLs/CLs, parents, and communities took place, there is considerable une-
venness in the extent to which it translated into the final outcome. As IALA managed to use Islamic teachings to
centre its messaging on child rights, it could to a large extent circumvent societal resistance. However, it is evident
that each message was interpreted differently and met with different levels of commitment by each category of
respondents. There is almost universal appreciation of the importance of education for the future of children,
though most stakeholders acknowledged that economic realities may affect a person’s access to education. This
is especially important, as the support for adolescent education is for both boys and girls, where girls have been
affected much more by societal norms on education. In contrast, child marriage is a topic that shows different
levels of acceptance by distinct stakeholder groups. RLs have the view that marriages should only happen after
puberty, while parents tend have the view that adolescents should only get married after the legal age. There is
some evidence that adolescents are included in decision-making, however parents continue to be the ones taking
the final decision. Early pregnancy was not found to be very salient among respondents with those who men-
tioned it, typically referring to it as one among many problems caused by child marriage, which reflects the social
norms of pregnancy and marriage being linked inextricably. Even though awareness of communities about chil-
dren’s rights seems to have been raised as a result of IALA’s activities, especially considering that these were
mostly new topics for community members, not all have embraced these ideas.

6 EVALUATION CONCLUSIONS
The summative evaluation of IALA aimed to improve our understanding of how and to what extent the pro-
gramme’s intended outputs and outcomes have materialised, and to better appreciate the mechanisms and pro-
cesses that have led to this. The analysis focused on programme theory validation, programme implementation,
and adolescent empowerment, which were cross-checked by five key evaluation criteria: relevance, fidelity/co-
herence, coverage, effectiveness, and sustainability. Another key objective of the evaluation was to identify key
barriers and impediments to the realisation of outcomes, lessons learned, and best practices, and to offer recom-
mendations for future programming.
The evaluation went through several hurdles, from delays in its original implementation plan due to the rising
insecurities leading up to the political transition to Taliban rule in August 2021, to the adjustment of data collec-
tion methods and outreach strategies to ensure feasibility in a highly complex and fragile context, as the study
was carried out just a few months into the political transition. Nonetheless, all planned data collection sessions
were completed, and a significant amount of data was collected in both target provinces.
Regarding Outcome 1 of IALA, the findings show that adolescents were able to communicate with each other,
their families and sometimes with community leaders, although communication with policy makers could not be
established. Adolescents acted as agents of change for peers in their communities, campaigning outside the MAGs
to promote access to education and the prevention of child marriages. They did this via different means, including
peer to peer mentoring, reaching out to the families in their communities, and sometimes talking to community
or religious leaders to help them solve problems. They also carried out various awareness raising campaigns and
other social actions, like theatre plays. There is also evidence that the most effective communication occurred not
through the use of technological aids or radio but rather through activities such as peer-to-peer outreach, door to
door and artistic activities.
Adolescents learned several new skills and increased their awareness on their rights, which they described not
to have had before. The qualitative evidence, in combination with the midline findings, suggests a stronger in-
crease in awareness of the importance of education, and some increase in awareness of the problem of early
marriage, with early pregnancy seen as a subset of this problem. Illiterate children had more difficulties in access-
ing and retaining the contents of the trainings, although this was partially addressed by revising teaching to be
more visual and engaging through the use of practical approaches, which also improved the learning for those
who were literate. An unexpected benefit was that illiterate children were motivated to become literate as a result
of MAG. Some of the biggest benefits were in the area of life skills, with many participants mentioning that they
developed an understanding of the importance of self-esteem, goal setting, and decision making. Listening to ra-
dio did not play any significant role in this outcome, though participation in community radio created a major
improvement in the participants’ self-confidence and communication skills.
Regarding Outcome 2, though sensitisation of RLs/CLs, parents and communities took place, there is considerable
unevenness in the extent to which it translated into the final outcome. As IALA managed to use Islamic teachings
to centre its messaging on child rights, it could circumvent societal resistance. However, it is evident that each
message was interpreted differently and met with different levels of commitment by each category of respond-
ents. There is almost universal appreciation of the importance of education for the future of children, though most
stakeholders acknowledged that economic realities may affect a person’s access to education. This is especially
important, as the support for adolescent education is for both boys and girls, whereby girls have been much more
negatively affected by societal norms on education. However, child marriage is a topic which shows different lev-
els of acceptance by distinct stakeholder groups. RLs/CLs tend to have the view that marriages should only hap-
pen after puberty, while parents tend to have the view that adolescents should only get married after the legal
age. There is some evidence that adolescents are included in decision-making, yet parents continue to be the ones
taking the final decision. Early pregnancy was not found to be very salient among respondents with those who
mentioned it, typically mentioning it as one among the many problems caused by child marriage, which reflects
the social norms of pregnancy and marriage being linked inextricably. Even though awareness of communities
about children’s rights seems to have been raised as a result of IALA’s activities, especially considering that these
were mostly new topics for community members, not all have embraced these ideas.
Qualitative data did not allow for any findings regarding adolescents’ access to services, and the third pillar was
not a focus of this evaluation. Moreover, decision making still largely lies in the family realm, hence leaders do not
have a lot of influence on it. Overall, however, there is evidence that especially religious leaders focus more on
getting adolescents’ consent to marriages, that they are approachable and available for support when adolescents
seek their assistance to solve problems and that the relation between adolescents’ and community members has
improved. This partly interlinks with outcome 1, which showed that adolescents became more confident and able
to express themselves and to stand up for their views.
IALA’s programme implementation faced several challenges emanating from both the contexts in which the ac-
tivities were conducted and from design and operational aspects. On the one hand, these challenges were
67
connected to communities’ traditional social and gender norms and the characteristics of their contexts and prac-
tices, which presented difficulties for engaging adolescents and community members and for sharing the mes-
sages from the programme. These challenges included: the need for gender-segregated MAG structures in some
areas due to socio-cultural traditions; some communities’ resistance to changing views and behaviours towards
adolescents’ rights, particularly at the beginning of the intervention and in more remote and/or rural areas; child
labour that limited attendance and participation, particularly of vulnerable adolescents; and high numbers of il-
literacy, which called for design changes to training and introduced difficulties to MAG operations. On the other
hand, there were also challenges connected to the programme’s operations, which included a limited budget for
community activities and no budget for MAG premises; some delays in the implementation of community-level
activities (development of action plans), a limited engagement of parents in MAG activities; and a potentially in-
sufficient adaptability to the needs of vulnerable adolescents in MAG structure and mentoring.
7 LESSONS LEARNED
Beyond programme implementation and the extent to which IALA achieved its outcomes as they were set out,
there are several important themes that the programme put in place and that are relevant to highlight here, in-
cluding relevant lessons learnt for addressing adolescent protection and empowerment.
Firstly, as the first programme directed at adolescents in Afghanistan, IALA developed a unique content and de-
sign, and created an important boost to awareness raising for the rights and protection of adolescents in the coun-
try, to both target communities and government counterparts. IALA put adolescents at the centre of the interven-
tion and promoted their empowerment not only through raising awareness of their rights but also through
providing relevant and applicable skills that adolescents could relate to and incorporate to improve their circum-
stances and contexts. Moreover, IALA brought about a practical approach to teaching and learning which was
instructional not only by way of contents but also in the practical experience of the MAGs; adolescents’ learning
experience was boosted first-hand by having a key role in the MAG structure and organisation, as well as by be-
coming peer educators from the get-go. MAGs’ practical approach, although different from school, was considered
complementary, useful, highly valued and something that adolescents had not seen before. Contents were both
new and relevant to their target population.
Furthermore, IALA deployed a holistic approach to the three interrelated problems it sought to tackle (child mar-
riage, child pregnancy, school enrolment), by way of approaching and engaging a wide variety of stakeholders
which proved of relevance to the promotion of adolescent empowerment, accompanied by a wide set of strategies.
Parents are key decision makers, and their support was found to be paramount for adolescents to not only be able
to participate in activities but also to engage and have better performance in their learning outcomes. Community
and religious leaders have key roles of influence in their communities, and thus getting their engagement to pre-
vent harmful practices is of extreme importance at community level.
Finally, the programme was highly valued by all stakeholder groups for raising awareness of adolescents’ rights,
providing them skills and self-confidence, and promoting their community participation. External factors, specif-
ically the political transition to the Taliban administration, have brought about changing regulations for education
and female empowerment that preoccupy participants. These effects had a big impact in limiting the continuation
of activities after the programme ended. However, participants expressed a desire for continuing their education
and learning, and for the programme to continue if possible.

8 RECOMMENDATIONS
Using the findings from the 90 qualitative interviews conducted with different sets of respondents, we have first
tried to gain an in-depth understanding of the IALA and its implementation. As a summative evaluation, this is
also an opportunity to reflect on the (perceived) successes and failure of IALA by beneficiaries and implementers.
Our interview guides were created keeping in mind the findings from the midline evaluation and thus add depth
to the results of that study, in addition to gaining new insights that are only possible in retrospect. Considering
the dramatically changed socio-political context in Afghanistan following the political transition in 2021, it is dif-
ficult to offer recommendations that are very specific to Afghanistan. As the findings here are also intended to be
used as inputs into the IALA synthesis report for South Asia, below we rank the recommendations in the order of
their generalisability to other contexts and future redesign of similar programmes. Following the narrative de-
scription and the rationale below, we also list the recommendations in tabular form.
Consider the target groups’ economic realities in programme design: Poverty was systematically recognized
by stakeholders as a key challenge in adolescents’ contexts, particularly in the present situation of Afghanistan
and as a factor related to harmful practices, such as the prevalence of early marriage and child labour. In view of
the high impact of poverty and overall economic conditions on MAG members’ attendance, engagement, and up-
take, the incorporation of economic factors in the approach of UNICEF towards adolescent empowerment is rec-
ommended for the next programming cycle. This can include targeted measures to support vulnerable adoles-
cents to be able to take part, the incorporation of specific methodologies and activities to compensate for any long
or frequent absences (e.g., a systematic peer support system in their villages), and/or the consideration of these
practices in the design and structure of the MAGs as a whole. Addressing economic factors can also be done by
combining IALA interventions with other UNICEF actions targeting, for example, employability and financial sup-
port, to enhance impact.
Explore potential linkages with government actors and the private sector for supporting options of setting
up more higher learning courses, TVET classes, or alternative approaches, such as livelihood trainings ac-
cessible for girls: Limited access to and insufficient availability of learning opportunities for girls, particularly
higher classes, was identified as one key barrier to female empowerment. It is advisable to explore options, po-
tentially together with government actors like the MoE and private sector organisations, to offer more gender-
separate courses at higher learning institutions, TVET classes, or alternative learning approaches, such as liveli-
hood trainings (in combination with literacy trainings). Any of these options should be purposely designed to suit
the interests and needs of female adolescents and combined with continuous awareness raising on the benefits
of girls’ education and training (hence income opportunities for families). Such education and training options
should not only be offered within cities, but also and especially in more remote areas. Another possibility is to
link community-based education (CBE)/Accelerating Learning Centres (ALC) for out-of-school MAG members to
enrol, capitalising on the MAG platform and the interest it promotes in schooling.
Strengthen trainers’ preparation for teaching illiterate children and mixed groups: The programme took
useful steps in the adaptation of its teaching methods and materials to better fit the capabilities of illiterate ado-
lescents that constituted significant numbers of MAG members. From the evidence collected through interviews,
mentors still faced challenges in overcoming the situation of teaching illiterate children effectively as well as for
managing the mixed teams of literate and illiterate adolescents, with their differing needs for support. Further
specific trainings may be recommended for the future on these challenges and how best to approach them.
Ensure systematic engagement of key adults, particularly parents, through targeted activities/educational
programmes: Engaging the adults in adolescents’ lives is key for their empowerment, considering the present
role that adolescents have in their communities and their families, and the importance of parents and other influ-
ential community adults for their participation, decision making and possibilities of better programme uptake. In
IALA activities, key adults’ level and regularity of participation varied greatly, which depended on several factors
including knowledge received on activities, level of involvement in youth’s lives, understanding of their role in
MAGs, etc. Considering these factors, more systematic involvement of parents and strengthened community par-
ticipation is recommended for future programming, to ensure that any initial distrust/reticence is overcome from
the outset and that learning outcomes and community outreach activities’ impacts are enhanced We propose that
this is done by: i) incorporating parents in educational activities/programmes, specifically designed keeping them
in mind, to ensure higher levels of participation and advocacy in the promotion of adolescents’ learning; ii) plan
for a more systematic and regular participation of religious leaders and influential community members.
69
Plan for enhancements to training and cascade learning through longer-term, spaced out, and varied incor-
poration of contents and inclusion of adolescents in design: In order to ensure a continued engagement of MAG
members and better cope with contingencies related to absences, life skills trainings and other trainings can be
provided in a more spaced out and varied manner throughout the programme’s implementation. The longer-term
model might also support the internalization of contents and the development of teaching and learning practices
and create possibilities for an expanded variety of teaching contents and for longer-term engagements of non-
MAG members through systematic support approaches (e.g., mentoring). This can be one way of potentially
strengthening cascade learning. Furthermore, on the basis of adolescents’ experience, systems to track learning
through the cascade approach could be revised, as it appears they did not comprehensively reflect adolescents’
knowledge sharing practices. The involvement of adolescents in design could help to both further tailor training
contents to their needs and to improve the cascade learning approach, building on adolescents’ wide set of expe-
riences and knowledge gained on this regard.
Establish closer programme monitoring by UNICEF with centralised oversight of monitoring data: Monitor-
ing systems for activities were established and followed by the implementing partners, according to all pro-
gramme implementers interviewed. However, the challenges faced by the evaluation in obtaining monitoring data
per intervention and village and some issues in data quality (e.g., inconsistencies in lists of participants, lack of
digitalisation of data on training attendance, etc.), point to the fact that UNICEF would benefit from a closer in-
volvement in programme monitoring data and in design/monitoring of tracking tools.
Reconsider the channels used for messaging: The use of mosques as part of the messaging strategy is supported
by the qualitative evidence. In contrast, radio appears to have played an insignificant role in terms of listener
engagement. In the future, other media more frequently used by adolescents should be considered if feasible,
especially television, the SMS platform and/or Internet for adolescents who have phones. Community-based ar-
tistic and sporting activities proved to be very engaging as well, but the current feasibility of these need to be
explored on a case-by-case basis and according to the fluid situation under the current administration, before
being considered feasible.
Provide a specific budget for MAG premises and plan for an increase of budgeting for community activities:
Although community resources and groups’ entrepreneurial spirits played a key role in the success of MAGs, and
this engagement was a commendable feature of the programme, setting up some basic support measures can help
the groups to better ‘stand on their feet’, particularly when conditions and contexts are more adverse, as well as
potentiate impacts of their activities. This could include the rental of a suitable space for meetings (with proper
conditions in the wintertime) and the provision of targeted support for community outreach activities of interest
to all MAG members. Moreover, the dedication of higher budgets for community development plans is recom-
mended to keep momentum and engagement of community members and allow communities to develop activi-
ties of higher impact.
Plan for programme continuation and expansion to neighbouring villages: The qualitative study found a
strong interest and enthusiasm for the programme from all participants involved, as well as a preoccupation from
some actors on the potential loss of the advances gained and the awareness raised in community members should
the activities not continue in the future. This is of particular relevance in the current context of Afghanistan under
the Taliban rule, the uncertainty around social expectations and rights, in particular girls’ education. Requests for
activities for the promotion of education and literacy were strongly expressed by parents and adolescents inter-
viewed. Considering the insufficient communication found with regard to all criteria for joining the MAG, a revi-
sion of the process of involvement of MAG members is recommended, to enhance transparency and ensure that
all those who are interested in taking part in the MAG are considered.

ANNEX 1. TERMS OF REFERENCE
Evaluation of the Programme
on Improving Adolescents’ Lives in Afghanistan (IALA)
1. Background1
Adolescence, defined by the United Nations as the period between the ages of 10-19 years, ushers in the transition
from childhood to adulthood – a period when many critical factors influence foundations for adult life. In South
Asia, adolescents make up 20 percent of the total population. In Afghanistan, out of a total of 27 million people
there are approximately 13 million children between 0-14 and 5.1 million are adolescents and youth.
Despite the recent developments in creating opportunities for adolescents in the past decade, several challenges
remain that impede their ability to participate in community life and express their opinions in social settings,
including at home and school on issues that impact their lives. In particular, protracted conflicts that continuously
destabilize the socio-economic and political structure of the country, also limit opportunities for adolescents to
develop. The conflicts in Afghanistan have caused displacements exposing adolescents to psycho-social harm and
increase their vulnerability to violence, abuse and exploitation. Living in a conflict affected insecure environment
deprives children of several rights: lack of safety and security, and lack of education following the destruction of
the education system during the Taliban regime. Although access to education for children has gradually im-
proved in Afghanistan, the security situation and adversely changed social systems have created limited safe
spaces for children and adolescents, especially girls, to interact outside of their homes.
At present, boys and girls remain vulnerable to gender-based violence and abuse in Afghanistan. Many forms of
violence and harmful practices experienced by adolescents are manifestations of social norms and lack of under-
standing about their long-term negative implications. For example, a practice called “bacha bazi” perpetrated by
warlords – where young boys are kept as consorts and subjected to slavery and sexual abuse – is prevalent in
some parts of the country. Adolescents are also exposed to other harmful practices; “baad” is an exchange of
young girls to resolve family disputes where girls are often treated like slaves and forced to marry much older
men, “badal” is exchange marriage to save the dowry to be paid to the boy’s family leading to many cases of forced
child marriage and “shikham bakshi” marries children off before they are born. In addition, girls who run away
from home are considered criminals and face detention or violent forms of punishment. Several case studies
highlight the health and protection risks faced by adolescents in vulnerable situations; working on the streets,
being deported from neighbouring countries, in detention for petty or political crimes or adolescents addicted to
drugs.
The second decade of life is a critical opportunity to break the inter-generational cycle of multiple deprivation in
a much shorter time frame, compared to the first decade that requires a much longer perspective. Adolescents
have the potential to become change makers and can contribute to eliminating society’s greatest challenges that
negatively affect their lives. UNICEF is committed to contributing to fostering an enabling environment and in-
creasing opportunities for adolescents to develop and have equal chances to pursue their individual and educa-
tional goals. For the first time, UNICEF has taken a regional approach to addressing the issues facing adolescents
in Afghanistan, India and Pakistan with the goal of improving the lives of adolescents by increasing their over
decisions affecting their lives. With financial support from The IKEA Foundation (IF), UNICEF is in the process
of implementing a multi-country programme focusing on improving adolescents’ lives through grassroots activi-
ties and social mobilization targeting harmful traditional practices. The programme will be implemented through
a three-pillar approach2:
i.Adolescents are agents of change for themselves and their communities;
ii.Families, communities and decision makers protect adolescents from rights abuses;
iii.Public services and authorities uphold adolescents’ rights to ensure their protection, health and ed-
ucation.
Using the three-pillar approach, UNICEF aims at contributing to the strategic result of the programme:
Increase the self-efficacy of adolescents, particularly girls to reduce their vulnerability to violence per-
petrated through harmful practices and nurture their ability to act as agents of change in their commu-
nities.
The corresponding programme on Improving Adolescents’ Lives in Afghanistan (IALA) covers two provinces,
Badghis and Bamyan. The programme aims to reach all adolescents in these provinces, effectively 25% of the
population in each province. Some 655,580 adolescents (50% female and 50% male) are expected to be reached
through this programme, with the following main results expected to be achieved by 2020:
i.Percentage reduction of women married at the age of 15 in the target provinces;
ii.Percentage increase of gross enrolment in secondary education in the target provinces;
iii.Percentage decrease in adolescent pregnancy.
The programme is expected to enable adolescents to participate in community activities and platforms for advo-
cating their own rights, especially of girls, to choose when and whom to marry; when and how many children to
have; and pursue their educational goals. Empowerment activities include communication strategies towards in-
creasing opportunities for adolescents to engage not only in community activities, but also actively participate in
sports and live healthy lifestyles. Along with empowering adolescents to express their voices, the programme will
75
also use existing national systems – including local governments, community development initiatives, schools,
faith-based organizations, etc. – to enhance adolescents’ knowledge of child protection issues and increase their
ability to identify and know what to do when they face violent behaviour.
UNICEF is committed to transparency and accountability in bringing about positive changes in the lives of chil-
dren and their families. To ensure that the combined efforts of UNICEF and IF under the IALA programme, an
evaluation, including a baseline and endline survey of the programme, will be conducted.
2. Evaluation Purpose and Objectives
The main purpose of the endline evaluation is to gather evidence that will inform the Government, IF, UNICEF
and other stakeholders on the results and lessons learned of the programme. The findings, conclusions and rec-
ommendations of the evaluation will be used to improve programming for adolescents and scale up similar pro-
grammes in other provinces, if possible. They will also feed into efforts at the level of the UNICEF Regional Office
for South Asia (ROSA), to compile lessons learned across the three countries that are part of the broader mutli-
country initiative.
The objectives of the evaluation are to assess five main aspects embedded of the programme, namely (i) rele-
vance, (ii) fidelity/coherence, (iii) coverage, (iv) effectiveness and (v) sustainability of the intervention, to identify
lessons learned and make recommendations accordingly.
3. Evaluation Scope and Main Questions
The evaluation was originally conceived as a quasi-experimental impact evaluation, covering four provinces. A
limited baseline survey was already conducted as part of the planned impact evaluation, some of the data of which
can be used to partially populate the “impact table”, which constitutes the programme’s results and monitoring
framework. The planned impact evaluation was discontinued for a range of reasons, including the precarious
security situation in two of the four provinces originally selected and well as the challenges resulting from the
COVID-19 pandemic. In the meantime, programme implementation has commenced in the two remaining prov-
inces, Bamyan and Badghis. The endline evaluation will cover the implementation period of the programme, i.e.
2017-2020.
The evaluation of the programme will therefore cover all districts of Bamyan and Badghis.
The evaluation will include the participation of adolescents, families, communities, schools, teachers, religious
leaders, shuras and Government stakeholders. It will address the structure of the programme’s Theory of Change
(ToC) and its assumptions to understand how the programme validation evolved in relation to the five aspects
abovementioned. Then, it will turn to several aspects of the programme implementation phases. The evaluation
will assess the delivery of the programme activities along with approaches adopted in mainstreaming equity,
gender equality and human rights into programme implementation. Finally, it will focus specifically on adolescent
empowerment, and especially girls’ empowerment, to evaluate how the programme uplifted adolescents’ partic-
ipation in decisions affecting their lives in the two regions of Bamyan and Badghis.
The evaluation will mainly focus on the programme deliverables. Since the evaluation will be based solely on a
qualitative data collection, findings will not be generalizable. They will, however, provide more insights into the
results produced by the midline evaluation. Therefore, the following groups will be involved in the study:
• Peer life skills training trainers;
• Multipurpose Adolescent Group (MAG) members;
• Adolescents
• Parents
• Community/religious leaders
The evaluation team is required to develop a set of research questions, based on the main evaluation criteria to
be applied in the evaluation. The three main domains of the evaluation will comprise the following: (i) Programme
Validation Theory; (ii) Programme Implementation; (iii) Adolescent Empowerment. In each of these three domains,
the validation will focus on the five main aspects of relevance, fidelity/coherence, coverage, effectiveness, sustaina-
bility.
These aspects are defined and include the following (indicative) questions3:
Relevance: the ways in which the programme met the needs of adolescents, especially of girls, as well as the de-
velopmental and programmematic priorities of Afghanistan; and the extent to which it is aligned with UNICEF’s
corporate Strategic Framework and Country Programme. Some examples include:
o How relevant were the MAG supervisors’ profiles and the trainers’ skills to
ensure the smooth running of the IALA activities as per the ToC?
o Was the content of the broadcasting New Homes New Lives drama on radio
relevant to support the IALA’s achievement of its outcomes and goals?
o Was the literacy rate high enough to access the information provided during
the CL/RL trainings and the life skills, self-expression?
76
Fidelity/Coherence: the extent to which delivery of the IALA intervention adhered to the protocols and pro-
gramme model originally developed as well as the coherence to local cultural norms unlocking the programme’s
potential. Some examples include:
o Were the activities proposed in line with the local cultural norms and approved and encouraged
by parents, local community elders and government/non-government elements?
o Were the trainings for RLs on child rights in Islam well received by the local communities? Were
they coherent to the IALA’s programme objectives without being insensitive to the local cultural
norms in Badghis ans Bamyan provinces?
o Were all activities created in time and in full amount?
Coverage: The extent to which the programme reached its intended target population. Some examples include:
o Were there enough in-school and out of school adolescents in a village to create a MAG?
o Were all groups of community members allowed and interested to take parte in the trainings
and community meetings, including women?
o Did the Sports for Development and Arts for Development manage to reach both boys and girls
in the communities were they were implemented?
Effectiveness: The extent to which the programme contributed to empowering adolescents and increasing their
abilities to act as the agents of change.
o Were the programmes created effectively tapping into the requests, wishes and needs of the
youth involved in the MAGs and the sub-committees?
o Were the life-skills trainings for MAG-members considered effective by the youth to equip them
with enough tools to face the challenges that they have identified at the beginning of the pro-
gramme?
o Were trainings provided to community leaders effective? Did they and the entire community
notice any meaningful change in how youth issues are dealt at the community level?
Sustainability: The extent to which the programme’s interventions are sustainable.
o Were funds for creating life skills modules, sports kits etc. financially sustainable to be sup-
ported over the length of the whole programme?
o Have activities proved sustainable throughout the whole duration of the programme so to en-
sure that elders, parents and influential individuals from the community support adolescents to
access services, participate in decision making and prevent exposure to harmful traditional prac-
tices?
o Were the village premises suitable to host all the MAG activities over the long term?
Overall, the evaluation is expected to adopt an equity, gender equality and human rights-based approach. This
approach will need to be integrated in detailed formulation of evaluation questions under each of the above-
mentioned evaluation domains and criteria.
The programme is not designed to demonstrate developmental changes that can be directly attributed to it (im-
pact). Therefore, the evaluation will not seek to determine impact in this sense. Also, impact, understood as long-
term developmental changes in the lives of right holders will not be determined as part of this evaluation, since
the programme lifespan covers only 3-4 years. The extent to which the programme has contributed to observable
developmental changes at the outcome levels, will be ascertained as part of the effectiveness criterion.
4. Evaluability
The theory of change of the IALA programme is aligned with the theory of change of the broader multi-country
programme. While the theory of change was built on available information in Afghanistan, there are significant
attribution gaps pertaining, in particular, to the achievement of impact-level results. Intended results at the out-
come level, based on the delivery of planned outputs, are deemed evaluable by this endline evaluation, however
only to the extent permitted by a limited qualitative data collection. The evaluation team will validate the existing
theory of change prior to designing the evaluation.
5. Limitations
Challenges may arise in terms of security and limited access to the target groups, as well as the current COVID-19
restrictions. In addition, timely implementation of data collection activities may be affected by the remoteness of
some of the districts. Limitations may also be linked to data collection in the context of sensitive ethnic, religious,
cultural and tribal norms of the target population, though the evaluation should seek to mitigate related risks as
much as possible. In this regard, ensuring a thorough knowledge of stakeholders prior to launching the evalua-
tion, and adapting methods of engagement, is essential.
6. Evaluation Methods
As agreed upon by UNICEF and C4ED, the endline evaluation of the IALA programme will be solely based on a
qualitative exercise. Therefore, this evaluation will not be as comprehensive in scope as those carried out in other
77
comparable national contexts currently included in similar UNICEF ROSA programmes. As a result, the set of
questions that can be answered from the IALA Afghanistan, for the synthesis work at the end of the three country
evaluations is limited and generally non-causal. However, the qualitative data collection will contribute to explor-
ing some of the most important findings and gaps identified during the IALA midline evaluation.
The detailed evaluation design will be finalized during the inception phase, and will draw significantly on existing
secondary data as well as previous and ongoing engagement with UNICEF and other key stakeholders. During the
evaluation, data will be collected from the following target populations:
• Adolescents;
• Families, communities and other decision makers;
• Public authorities
• Service providers
Primary qualitative data collection methods
• Focus group discussions
• Semi-structured interviews
• Key Informant Interviews
• Direct observations
This qualitative work, which is to be considered as the best option that C4ED can provide given the budget and
the timeframe set by UNICEF, will be the only component of the IALA’s summative evaluation. Therefore, the
evaluation report will draw solely on desk based research, primary qualitative data and secondary data sources.
Secondary data collection methods
Secondary data can be collected through the programme baseline database; programme documents and available
education sector databases (such as EMIS) from the Ministry of Education and UNICEF. The programme docu-
ments that can be obtained from UNICEF are:
• The programme description
• Logical Framework
• Monitoring Framework
• Programme action plan/intervention activities
• Programme communication strategies for development.
Sampling
The evaluation team is responsible for developing the most appropriate sampling approach. The sample sizes
should – to the extent feasible - be sufficient to provide in-depth insights into the results of the IALA programme
from the point of view of its beneficiaries. Given time and cost constraints, sample sizes may need to be modest.
Data Collection Tools
Data collection tools (IDIs, KIIs, and FGD protocols) must be culturally appropriate, and should adhere to guid-
ance on Ethical Research Involving Children.4 The form and contents of the data collection tools should be suffi-
cient for capturing correct information on the main indicators of the programme and deliver adequate level of
analysis that will illustrate a measurable change. In-Depth Interviews, Key Informant Interviews and Focus Group
Discussions with sampled groups must be anonymous, in the local language and documented with consent of the
interviewees. The research protocol should be subject to a formal ethical review.
Data Analysis and Findings
Data of the baseline, midterm survey and evaluation must be disaggregated by gender, location, ethnicity, lan-
guage, ages of respondents and other relevant determinants of inequity deemed appropriate. The effect of the
programme will be determined by looking the extent to which the programme contributed to increasing enrol-
ment in secondary education among adolescents, and assessing – to the extent possible - its contribution to de-
creasing child marriage and pregnancies among adolescents.
7. Evaluation Management
The evaluation will be managed by the Research & Evaluation Specialist at UNICEF ACO under the supervision of
the Chief of the Social Policy, Evaluation & Research (SPEAR) Section. SPEAR Section will lead the evaluation pro-
cess and assure the quality and independence of the evaluation process and that it is conducted according to the
UNICEF Evaluation Policy and UNEG Norms and Standards. An Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) consisting of
key internal and external programme stakeholders will be formed to facilitate the participation of relevant stake-
holders in the design and scope of the evaluation, raising awareness of the different information needs, providing
quality assurance throughout the process, and in supporting the dissemination of evaluation results. Its inputs
78
are expected to strengthen the quality and credibility of the evaluation. The evaluation team will be accountable
to Evaluation Management as to how ERG comments are addressed during reporting.
8. Deliverables and timelines
