EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The consolidated equity strategy for the School Education Sector in Nepal, titled as “Equity Strategy” (ES),
was launched in December 2014. The main objectives of this strategy are to reduce the current disparities
in access, participation and learning outcomes for children in basic and secondary public education in
Nepal. The strategy envisions to achieve this by (i) developing an Equity in Education Index (Equity Index),
at national and sub-national level, and (ii), supporting the development of Equity Strategy Implementation
Plans (ESIPs) to allow for a systematic use of the equity index to inform need-based planning at local
government level thus reducing identified disparities.
With the current School Sector Development Plan (SSDP) coming to an end in July 2021, the government
initiated the development of a new long term-education sector plan. The present evaluation of the Equity
Strategy is expected to inform the implementation of the strategy during, and as part of the new education
sector plan in the new federal context and guide the application of the equity index and equity strategy
implementation plans.
The evaluation aims at illustrating the direct and indirect effects that the introduction of the Strategy has
had on applying an equity-based approach within the previous two education sector plans through a
comprehensive analysis.
The audience of this evaluation are the Government of Nepal, education sector development partners,
UNICEF, UN Agencies, implementing partners and other stakeholders who will make use of the
evaluation results.
The Thematic evaluation scope will focus on equity dimensions (gender, geographical location, wealth
quintile, disability, ethnicity and caste) based on available data provided by UNICEF and the two main pillars
of the ES: Equity Index and equity-based interventions. The geographical scope of the evaluation is national
with specific focus on the 15 districts which were prioritized for interventions under the Equity Strategy. The
chronological scope included all documented activities under the Equity Strategy implemented since 2014.
A set of Evaluative Questions was defined and agreed during the inception phase and 5 OECD1/DAC2
criteria have been used for this evaluation: Relevance, Coherence, Effectiveness, Efficiency and
Sustainability.
The evaluation is formative and process-based with a strong focus on learning lessons. It adopted a mix
method approach (qualitative and quantitative) and the following steps: Reconstruction of the Theory of
Change of the ES, secondary quantitative3 and qualitative data review and analysis, primary qualitative
data collection through Key Informants Interviews at National and Sub National level with a range of
stakeholders (i.e Government education staff, UNICEF staff, Non-State Actors, donors agencies...) being
also the anticipated users of the outcomes of the evaluation.
The evaluation took place between mid-January 2021 to end of April 2021 and was organized under three
main phases: inception, data collection/analysis and reporting.
The main findings and conclusions of the evaluation are described for each evaluation criterion.

RELEVANCE
The 2014 equity strategy responded to an identified need to test an innovative approach of using education
data for equitable resource allocation and targeted programming. It was pioneer in addressing equity issues
in accordance with an analysis of equity dimensions and explaining factors. Moreover, it succeeded in
moving equity consideration fairly high on the Nepalese education policy agenda. However, the definition
of equity underpinning the Strategy and calculated by the index has 3 major interrelated weaknesses:
• The strategy addressed equity issues adopting a cross-cutting definition where individual
characteristics and social barriers prevail (poverty, caste, gender, disability). It is not focused on
educational needs. Data for SLC exam was not available for all Local Governments – hence not
used initially for analysis.4 Once the data will be available for all LGs for grade 8, the learning
dimension will be added in the index. Moreover, only few local equity plan analyzed by the
evaluation team addressed learning needs or promoted equalization of learning opportunities within
the school environment.
• The design of the index and proposed measurement of deprivation across districts underlies a
linear complementarity (and equal weight) between access-participation-learning outcomes. At
international level, the analysis of schooling trends usually considers learning perspectives above
participation (and sometimes even above access), bearing in mind that weak learning outcomes
are a major cause of dropout. The index therefore failed to capture the learning explanations to
drop-out. The evaluation team also questions the idea that there would be a “main driver” of inequity
because of their cumulative and hierarchical nature, where poverty always ranks first.
• The strategy focusses on education demand, understood mainly under the access and participation
dimensions. ESIPs activities mainly focussed on enrolment campaigns (access) and participation
measures (meals, hygiene products for girls), but not enough on learning. The quality of education
supply in the most vulnerable areas was not addressed nor analysed. This is an important
shortcoming as school provision is generally differentiated in terms of quality (community versus
institutional schools, concentration of "good" teachers in several privileged localities, existence of
huge differences in learning environments, etc.). Thus, access to differentiated education service
provision can lead to different participation and learning.
COHERENCE
The Equity strategy was coherent with Nepalese international commitments and paved the way to further
effort implied by the 2030 Agenda in terms of nationwide quality and equitable educational provision. It was
adopted within a context of major governance change (shift to federalism) and progressive ownership of
the new governance mechanisms by national and local decision makers. As such, the Equity strategy
proved coherent with the evolving context and fully adaptive. With the transition to federalism and new
division of competences, the ES targets additional financing to local government levels / municipalities, thus
making pillar 2 of the ES (the ESIPs) dependent upon local planning capacity and prerogatives.
This focus reduces the scope of possible measures when they do not depend upon local governments, in
particular major policy levers revolving around human resource (among them teacher affectation and
capacity development, for instance to identify student’s needs, management of the diversity in classrooms
and building trust with parents). As teacher-related measures still refer to national competence, more
coherence could have been expected at local level to align local efforts with education policy decisions
taken at national level. In this context, the evaluation team noted a limited internal coherence of the Equity
strategy and inconsistency between the highly comprehensive dimension of the index and the limited scope
of implemented measures in the field.

SLC examination is a public examination for the purpose of certification at the central level, not similar to grade 8 and grade 5
examination and not developed as the as the NASA test.
ix
EFFECTIVENESS
Our analysis of effectiveness is partly nurtured by Nepalese school enrolment performance. Undoubtably,
the implementation period of the equity strategy was a strong momentum for effective reduction in the
aggregate number of OoSC at national level. A good performance of most of the 15 targeted districts is
confirmed in terms of access, and the gender gap was effectively addressed. Parity in basic education,
already acquired nationwide at Lower basic level, is now achieved at Upper basic level, with girls even
over-represented in lower basic both at national level and in the targeted districts.
The evaluation team confirms the number of 256 000 OoSC reintegrated into schools with little grade-
related variation, suggesting that the campaigns were effective for all age groups. However, caste and
ethnicity-related barriers still remain poorly addressed, with some trends to be confirmed by further
demographic data, for instance the decrease in Janajatis enrolments over the past 10 years.
Our analysis also shows a decrease in survival rates in districts that have experienced recent rapid
increases in enrolment, more visible at Lower basic level than at upper basic level. These results confirm
the demand-orientation of the ES that succeeded in bringing many children back to schools but did not
foster increased school capacity to help them remain in schools and learn. To summarize, the index proved
effective for ranking purposes, and succeeded in triggering new and effective measures targeting mostly
school enrolment and participation. It was rather misused or poorly understood by education planers and
policy makers to inform needs-based programming and equity-focused measures.
In quantitative terms, only 13% of LGs have endorsed their ESIP plan by January 2021, although in many
cases, ESIP development successfully triggered the development of a general LG education plan where
they were still missing. Broadly, the initial rationale according to which understanding equity dimensions
would lead to more tailored and diversified actions did not really materialize in the field. Interventions
analyzed by the evaluation team were quite similar from one ESIP to another and focused mainly on
“mainstream” OoSC (back to school campaigns representing the bulk of funding) and general participation
measures (meals and girls hygiene products). In other words, and despite the strong increase in analytical
data available, equity interventions designed and implemented failed to address the needs of the highest
number of excluded children, namely those in school but not learning (disability, poverty, language…).
The evaluation also underlines the role played by the members of the Equity and inclusion Technical
Working, as well as UNICEF, CERHD and World Education who have been instrumental in supporting the
dissemination and support for the implementation of the Strategy.
EFFICIENCY
Considering the limited scope of the index and effects of ESIP development support, its current use and its
reduction in scope compared to what was initially planned, one can ask if the development of the index was
a cost-effective targeting system compared to other (potentially less sophisticated) strategies.
Efficiency consideration refers here to the capacity of local planners to use the ES effectively (or even use
possible alternative in terms of equity analysis through the use of the schooling profiles)
Important effort was made to train LG education staff to prepare the plans in regional workshops. These
workshops were valuable for building large commitment from Central, Provincial and Local Governments
but were made less effective because of strong staff turnover following the workshops. Alternative solutions
were identified, among them the WE-sponsored blended training strategy, proving relevant and more
efficient solutions in the COVID-19 context.
However, ESIP did not always address the root causes of inequity. The funding allocated for each
municipality was quite limited and it was not clear how and to what extent the budget was used for the
implementation of the ESIPs in the absence of accountability, dedicated budget line to track the allocation
of funds and lack of M&E mechanisms at LG level.
x
Overall, the evaluation team found evidence of capacity building support provided mainly in relation to data
analysis and planning but less in term of institutional setup (i.e coordination, collaboration, reporting,
implementation mechanisms...)
SUSTAINABILITY
The COVID-19 context is a strong challenge for the equity strategy’s sustainability, both in terms of
development results and in terms of equity acquis. There are concerns that those existing technological
discrepancies, the digital and socio-economic divides, and a divide in terms of parents’ literacy rate could
contribute to widen the gaps in access and quality of education for the most marginalized groups. In some
schools, the pandemic context hampers mid-day meal grant distribution and delayed pro-poor targeted
scholarships. As part of its CoVID-19 School Sector Response (GPE) supplementary program to mitigate
the effects of COVID-19, the World Bank included a Sub-component 2.3: Schools grants to schools from
selected local governments. The sub-component will support most disadvantaged local governments (100-
125 LGs) in regions that have been impacted by COVID-19 through school grants to ensure safe re-opening
of schools and continued learning.
The transition to federalism is also a major challenge for the sustainability of the strategy, with limited
capacity to deal with education supply at LG level and thus potential risk for LGs to focus on infrastructures
rather than on quality. Still, the design and implementation of the ES has contributed to strengthen the
capacity of education staff in the 15 focused districts on 1) understanding of Equity Issues, 2) integration of
equity into the planning cycle and 3) on data analysis.
Nevertheless, because of the important capacity gaps and the lack of sufficient human resources at LGs
and provincial levels, this should rather be seen as a work in progress during a first pilot phase that would
need to be strengthened in the future. A major bottleneck for the retention of children at schools (including
most probably the recently reintegrated OoSC) and improvement of learning outcomes, remains the
shortage of teachers in the low performing LGs and issue with teachers’ deployment across the schools.
Improved consideration of educational needs and learning outcomes for the most vulnerable children will
therefore be key for a sustainable consideration of the Equity Strategy acquis.
It seems that the use of EI can be considered as an excellent instrument for communication, funds
mobilization and advocacy but less as a tool for action. To implement effective equity-based activities, there
is a need for a more classical analysis of the education demand in these marginalized localities. A clear
understanding of the ways education demand interacts with supply side characteristics is also necessary
as supply peculiarities are not immediately apparent in the EI computation and ranking.
Some school mapping considerations and reduction of differences in quality will be important to promote
education in specific location where, the education system is of poor quality. In this sense promoting equal
access and retention in lagging locations is necessary but not sufficient as an equity objective.
An analysis of education demand of marginalized groups should also include a labor market analysis
allowing to assess whether it is discriminating or not for marginalized groups. If the labor market is
segmented and does not offer a comparable status and earning, for a given level of education, to every
member of the society, those with specific low expectations could have a rational weak demand for
education. Improving access, participation and learning would be important but not sufficient to strengthen
education demand for many of the marginalized groups whose social and economic positions are weakly
linked to educational performances.
To summarize, the evaluation confirms that the ES succeeded in anchoring equity considerations in the
Nepalese education system, nurturing all Nepalese education planning documents after 2014 and raising
wide awareness among education stakeholders. Its undeniable acquis needs now to evolve towards a more
education-focused scope, investing more on the educational needs and targeting vulnerable children at the
right scale, namely their school environment.
The following recommendations are formulated:
xi
Recommendations related to the acquis of the equity strategy
1. Shift to an explicit focus on learning
2. Clarify responsibilities and consider the entire education supply chain (federal/district/LG/School)
3. Clarify measures and their remedial potential for each equity dimension
4. Consider evolving the index into a revised targeting mechanism.
Recommendations for the future National Education Plan
5. Strengthen generation and use of evidence for programming and learning
6. Strengthen planning, monitoring and reporting as well as coordination and cross sectoral collaboration
functions related to social inclusion:
7. Ensure Equity in Financing and not only in programming
8. Ensure that equity-based interventions address both education-related demand and supply needs as
well as cover well the three main equity area on access, retention and learning outcomes
9. Mainstream Equity in education planning processes to improve accountability
10. Institutionalize support mechanisms for need based support to LGs for developing the overall ESPs.
11. Revise or update of the equity in the new context, SDG4:Education 2030 and the new federal context
and the new funding modality of the country

CONTEXT AND OBJECT OF THE EVALUATION
1. Brief socio economic and political context
1. Nepal has experienced major political, social and constitutional change since emerging from 11 years
of civil war in 2006. Despite steady growth of real GDP per capita of 4 percent in the decade following
the war, the country remains vulnerable and is the poorest in the south Asian region.5 In 2015 there
was a major earthquake, killing nearly 9,000, with hundreds of thousands made homeless, and over
17,000 classrooms of 8,000 schools damaged and in need of reconstruction.6 The southern, low-land,
Terai region experienced serious flooding in 2017, affecting one million people with major crop
damage.7 From 2020, as with the rest of the world, Nepal is facing the Covid-19 pandemic.
2. The country of 30 million people is very diverse; geographically, with its mountainous north, hilly center
and southern Terai (low-land) zones; and in terms of ethnicity, language and caste. According to the
Government of Nepal’s own work on a multidimensional poverty index (MDI) in 2018 - the incidence
of poverty was estimated at 29 percent, with the poverty headcount ratio much higher for rural than
for urban areas – 33 percent vs. 7 percent. The 2011 Population Census recorded 26.5 million people
of 126 different caste/ethnic groups who speak 123 different languages. Nepal has come a long way
in exposing and addressing inequalities within its society, by developing legislations to address
discrimination based on caste and religion and to help ensure equality and universal access. However,
Nepal’s historical and structural past continues to influence the hierarchical structure of the society
which has resulted in continued differential access to economic, political and socio-cultural resources
and the marginalization of some groups and the continuing inequity in the society.
3. As almost 80 percent of the population live in rural areas, rural poverty predominates. Whilst poverty
rates are highest in the mountainous northwest, the absolute number of poor people is highest in the
southern Terai region. Alongside low incomes, drivers of poverty include child mortality, inadequate
cooking fuel, flooring and roofing, challenges with nutrition, as well as low school attendance rates.8
4. In November 2006, a Comprehensive Peace Accord was signed, declaring a formal end to a ten-year
civil war. An Interim Constitution was adopted in January 2007, with a complex eight-year process,
leading to the 2015 Constitution of Nepal. The new Constitution marked the end of Nepal’s monarchy
and the beginning of a new era as a federal republic.
2. Nepal education sector
5. Nepal’s constitution stipulates the right of all children to a free and compulsory basic education and
access to free secondary education. Nepal is aiming to reach SDG 4 of ensuring equitable access to
quality education and life-long learning by 2030, which is also an overarching objective of the 2030
Agenda and SDGs. Nepal is committed to the principle of ‘leaving no one behind’, recognizing that
inequality is not only an impediment to growth and human development, but also a violation of shared
norms, values and people's intrinsic sense of fairness.
6. The SSRP focuses on educational disparities related to caste, ethnicity, religion and geographic
factors, and there was progress towards universal primary education as well as in ECED enrolment.
A major changes in the SSRP period was the shift from primary (Grades 1-5, aimed at ages five to

7 Flooding was caused in part by tensions with India, exacerbated by India’s decision to close 18 dams and embankments along the
border during monsoon season to protect its own farmers. Nepal recently ranked the 11th most affected by climate change over the
past 20 years. Germanwatch, Global Climate Risk Index 2019

ten) to Basic Education (Grades 1-8) with the aim to achieve universal access under the free and
compulsory basic education policy for public ‘Community’ schools. ‘Institutional’ schools, which are
private, also play a large role in enrolment in Nepal and for richer and more urban families remain the
preferred choice.
7. Nepal’s education sector has seen progress in recent years particularly in increases in the net
enrolment ratio (NER) for all levels of education, and in gender parity of enrolment. The sector has
been managed through a succession of sector strategic plans, including the School Sector Reform
Plan (SSRP) (2009-2015/16) and the current School Sector Development Plan (SSDP) (2016-
2020/219.). A new plan is now being developed.
8. The current plan was approved in 2016 and aims to increase participation of all children in quality
school education by focusing on strategic interventions and new reform initiatives to improve equitable
access to, and the quality, efficiency, governance, management and resilience of the education
system.
9. According to a presentation on EMIS and Equity Index made for the Global DCP meeting May 30,
2019 and based on the analysis made in the context of development of the Equity Strategy, large
regional disparities remain with inequalities across different groups in Nepal. Some of these are shown
in the figure below, with those most marginalized in the Terai region receiving comparatively very little
schooling, and significant distinctions by privilege and caste. Important geographical variation is also
noted as regards pupil teacher ratios (PTRs).

10. SSDP implementation is led by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST). The
SSDP is implemented through a Steering Committee that also oversees a DACS/TWG secretariat.
11. The SSDP is implemented through a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp), supported by nine Joint
Financing Partners (JFPs)10, providing support through a Joint Financing Arrangement (JFA).
Implementation of the SSDP is also supported through other Development Partners, including Non-
JFPs, I/NGOs, some of them being members of the Local Education Development Partner Group
(LEDPG). As outlined in the JFA, the Ministry of Education Science and Technology (MOEST) and
the JFPs jointly conduct two review meetings annually: a Budget Review Meeting (BRM) and a Joint
Review Meeting (JRM). TWGs are organized though different policy areas, and the equity strategy
9 The original time scale of the SSDP was from FY 2016/17 – 2022/23. However, in the mid-term review it was decided that the
SSDP would complete two years early (2020/21). This decision was taken due to the changing context (i.e. federalisation and the
government’s updated education policy).

and the World Bank.

and issues of acess and participation is the subject of a follow-up performed by the Equity Technical
Working Group acting as permanent advisory group and meeting monthly.
12. The current five-year costed program (2016-2020/21) represented a major experiment in the financing
modality, in which six out of nine joint financing partners (JFPs) to the education sector linked all or
part of their disbursements to Result Based Financing (RBF) indicators.11 These were split between
ten disbursement linked indicator (DLI) areas, with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank the
largest two JFPs, linking their concessional loans to seven DLI areas each; and the European Union,
the largest donor via grant funding, focusing on three DLI areas. The fund flows from each of the JFPs
to respective DLIs is shown in the figure below.
13. There is one DLI in SSDP implementation that relates to the equity particularly DLI 6 focuses on Equity
and OOSC enrolment and benefits from a total amount of 30 M$ USD12 accounting for less than 1%
(0,075%) of the total of USD 400 million across the nine DLI areas planned for the 2016-21 period.

3. The transition to federalism
14. The adoption of the 2015 constitution led to major change in the governance model in Nepal with the
ambition to provide local governments with more responsibilities, power and accountability. Each level
has their own executive and 3 levels administrative divisions have been defined as per below:
▪ 1 Federal government at central level
▪ 7 Provinces, replacing the former 14 administrative zones grouped into 5 development regions
▪ 753 local governments (6 metropolises, 11 sub-metropolises, 276 municipalities and 460 palikas,
i.e. rural municipalities). The governing bodies of the rural municipalities and municipalities are
referred to as village executive and municipal executive.
15. Federalism in Nepal is still recent, with the first elections taking place by the end of 2017. All legislative
and regulatory acts necessary to inform local governance are not yet in place in some cases or fully
owned, and in many cases, former governance habits remain, leading to some understandable
confusion.
16. The local governments are now thus the main unit to take care of the school education system. Local
Governments do not manage the Education Management Information System (EMIS).They report in
it, validate the data for their LG. The challenge is to ensure sufficient capacity in local governments to
address their new responsibilities.
17. A comprehensive legislative framework is envisioned under the forthcoming Federal Education Act,
to clarify the roles of the three tiers of government on delivering school education services. Meanwhile,
the National Education Policy 2076 (2019) provides further direction in terms of legislative and
institutional provisions and responsibilities for implementing them.
18. The governance structure thus consists of three tiers, with federal budget decentralized to local
government tiers. Many of the funds, functions and functionaries that had previously been managed
by central, district and village (VDC) authorities have now been transferred to provincial and local
governments. New legislation, institutions, and administrative procedures are being formalized to
administer this new setup. To mitigate likely disruptions, in 2019 the government developed a
transitional roadmap for the education sector.
19. The Local Government Operations Act (October 2017) places 23 functions of the planning, monitoring
and management of basic and secondary schools under the jurisdiction of local governments including
formulating education policies, strategies and plans and conducting basic level examinations.
20. The Federal Education Act has been submitted to the federal parliament for approval and is envisioned
to provide a legal framework regarding the roles of local, provincial and federal governments in school
education service delivery mechanism. In the meantime, the following acts have been adopted after
the initiation of the SSDP in 2016 to facilitate the transition to the federal context in the education
sector, most notably the Local Government Operation Act (MoFAGA, 2017), the Civil Servants’
Adjustment Act and Regulation (MoFAGA, 2019), The Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer
Management Act (MoF, 2017), the Natural Resource and Fiscal Commission Act (MoF, 2017), and
the Appropriation Act (MoF,2018); the Fiduciary Risk Management Action Plan (FMAP) prepared as
a tool to strengthen financial management, including procurement; the Compulsory and Free
Education Act which was enacted in 2018. The Federal Education Act is awaiting parliament approval.
18
4. Education Context
21. The latest Joint Review Meeting report 202013 provides a snap shot view of the main indicators in the
education sector in Nepal for the Fiscal Year 2019/20 as described thereafter:
22. In early childhood education and development and pre-primary education (ECED/PPE), the Gross
enrolment rate has reduced (86.4 percent vs the target of 87.7) and the net enrolment rate (67.2
percent vs the target of 64.1) exceeded its target indicating that the quality and efficiency continues
to increase. In Grades 1 to 5, there was good progress on reducing gross enrolment and accelerating
net enrolment, compensating for the underachievement in the previous year. The limited progress on
the basic education survival rate (79.3% vs the targeted 88.2%) and completion rate (72.7% vs the
targeted 81.7%) indicates a need for substantial acceleration towards achieving these targets.14
23. In terms of equity, gender parity at the basic level was maintained and the reduction of the percentage
of out of school children (6.2% vs the targeted 6.6%) would have enabled the achievement of the Year
5 target of 5%. However, this is now at risk due to the extensive disruptions to school education in
academic year (AY) 2020/21 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
24. Despite the noted efforts made in past years to ensure equity in access to education, the share of
enrolment of students from vulnerable groups declined – in particular students with disabilities. This
decline appeals further consideration of the effectiveness of interventions to reduce disparities in
access, participation and learning for these groups.
25. The 2019/20 Flash data reports that 63.6% of all public schools providing basic level education met
only three out of five of the PMECs, although only 13.4% of schools met all five priority minimum
enabling conditions (PMECs). This greatly exceeds the Year 4 target of 6.1% . Despite this
achievement, further investment is required in upgrading school conditions, especially water,
sanitation and hygiene facilities, to allow the safe return of students to schools as directed by the
approved school reopening school framework.
26. There has been reasonable progress on secondary education (Grades 9–12) in FY 2019/20 in relation
to the 2015/16 SSDP baseline indicators. The net enrolment rate (NER) in Grades 9–12 was 47.2%
against the targeted 49.3%. The cohort survival rate to Grade 10 increased to 60.3% against the
targeted 59%. The percentage of students enrolled in technical schools increased to 5.5% against the
targeted 4%. And 12,725 secondary level students received pro-poor scholarships in FY 2018/19. The
main Secondary Education Examination (SEE) could not be held in FY 2019/20 due to COVID-19 and
internal evaluations were instead used to assess students’ performance.
27. The effects of the pandemic risk reversing the achievements made to date as many schools have
been closed due to the COVID-19 health crisis. Contingency plans have been developed to ensure
that children continue to learn during the school closures through remote learning platforms offered
by the government.

5. Rationale for an Equity Strategy
28. The Education For All (EFA) agenda brought about a global movement to ensure the opportunities
that are provided through good education could become accessible for all and that schools become
inclusive learning environments, providing quality education.
29. Equity in education has been a key concept both globally and in Nepal. Nepal’s Education for All
National Plan of Action (2001-2015) stated that social equity is one of the key strategic objectives for
the country. Many of socio-cultural and political traditions in Nepal are largely discriminatory and
exclusionary and are expressed in different dimensions including gender; socio economic status;
location; health and nutrition status; disabilities; caste and ethnicity; language; and certain vulnerable
groups such as working children.
30. The Education for All (EFA) National Plan of Action (2001-2015) stipulates the need for an integrated
school system with grades 1 to 12. The Three-Year Interim Plan (2007/08 to 2009/10) further
underlined the need for an integrated approach to school education. The Interim Constitution (2007)
has recognized basic education as a fundamental right and made provisions for free and compulsory
basic education, leading to free education up to the secondary level. These policy manifestations have
provided a basis for initiating and implementing the reform in the school sector.
31. The School Sector Reform Program (SSRP) further builds on the inclusion within education. The
Program covers the period from July 2009 to July 2016. The purpose of the SSR Plan was to improve
efficiency in education, aiming at EFA and MDG goals to reach parity in gender and inclusion, and
ensure equitable access to quality education through a holistic school sector approach.
32. Nepal has reached significant achievements within the education sector over the last decade, however
these achievements have not been enjoyed by all equally. Disparities remain, leaving certain groups
of children behind in terms of access, participation and learning outcomes.
33. As such, the SSRP Mid Term Review (MTR) in 2012 recommended the development of a consolidated
equity strategy.
20
6. Object of the evaluation
34. In response to the further need for strengthening equity in education in the Nepal school education
sector, the Government of Nepal has developed the Consolidated Equity Strategy for the School
Education Sector, which was launched in December 2014. The main objectives of this strategy are to
reduce the current disparities in (i) access, (ii) participation and (iii) learning outcomes for children in
basic and secondary public education in Nepal. The strategy presents a two-folded approach in
meeting these objectives:
1. The Development of (an) Equity in Education Index(es), which shows the prevalence and severity
of disparities in access, participation and learning outcomes in education, using both school sector
data and population data from different levels.
2. A consolidation and further targeting of current strategies deployed by the Government and
Development Partners (including I/NGOs and CSOs) to strengthen an equity/need based
approach.
6.1 The Equity Index (EI)
35. The Equity Index was envisioned to be fully embedded within the Education Management Information
System (EMIS), in the Department of Education and to support the Government in targeting and
equity-based allocations within the Annual Strategic Implementation Plan/ Annual Work Plan and
Budget (ASIP/AWPB) from Financial Year (FY) 2015/16 onwards.
36. In February 2015, Nepal joined the multi-country GPE Global and Regional Activities (GRA) project
on District/School Profile Cards (also known as “Data Must Speak” project) implemented by UNICEF.
The action plan of the project for Nepal included technical support for the development of the equity
index(es), aligned with the support to be provided for the development of district profiles within the
same project.
37. The Equity Index is a composite index aggregating three components of the education sector: access
to education, internal efficiency, and learning.
38. Access to education uses Census data, which is updated only every 10 years, but gives more
opportunities to explore different types of disparities between population groups.
39. The other two components of the equity index use EMIS data. Comparing rankings of districts with
regards to out-of-school children numbers obtained using Census data on one hand, or estimated
using EMIS enrolment data on the other. 9 of the 10 lowest performing districts were found to be in
common. This further validates the use of EMIS data as a credible data source.
40. The roll-out of the school based EMIS allows for the use of EMIS as unique and yearly-updated data
source. As such, the computing and monitoring of the index remains fully owned by the Government
and is in the process of being embedded within the EMIS section and reporting.
41. The Equity Index captures disparities in access, participation and learning outcomes in basic and
secondary school education level in Nepal (grade 1 to 12). To this end, data were selected for the 3
dimensions of access (enrolment), participation (survival rate) and learning outcomes (initially grade
10 certificate exams but currently in the process of replacing this with grade 8 exams)
21
42. A summary of the outcome indicators, circumstances and data sources is presented in the following
table.
Figure 3. Variables of the Equity Index
43. The development and
implementation of the Equity Index was
prioritized as one of the Global
Partnership for Education (GPE) Stretch
Indicators. The GPE grant is supervised
by the World Bank who is therefore a key
partner in the work on the Equity Index.
In addition, the global monitoring
framework of the Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 4 on Quality
Education includes an indicator on Extent
to which formula-based policies
reallocate education resources based on
disparities in education outcomes.

Science and Technology in Nepal. May 30, 2019, Kathmandu, Nepal.
44. The purpose of the Equity Index is to account for children’s opportunity for school education by
factoring in their pre-existing vulnerabilities that are caused by their circumstances/contexts. To this
end, the Equity Index was developed in 2016 at national level and 2017 at district level to allow
computation of the severity of disparities leading to objective comparison, ranking and unpacking to
illustrate the contribution of the different drivers.
45. The equity index was developed by the Ministry of Education with support from UNICEF Headquarters,
South Asia Regional Office and Nepal Country Office (through the Data Must Speak" Initiative), the
World Bank and GPE. It uses the disparity-based formula known as the Human Opportunity Index
(HOI) and draws on both household and school-based census capturing data on gender, geography,
socio-economic status, ethnicity and caste, and disability.
46. The data were initially analyzed and converted into an equity score by district. This creates a picture
of the intensity of inequity by district across the country. The concept behind the ES is that data can
be used by education planners and policy makers to rank districts according to their composite index
score and inform resource allocation and equity-focused sector analysis and strategy formulation.
47. After the Equity Index was initially developed and adopted (based on Nepal’s former 75 districts), the
Index had to be adapted to the emerged 7 provinces and 753 local governments in the context of the
transition to federalism. The computation of data for the equity index is covering all Local Governments
units but is not yet developed up to the school level.
48. Adaptative work is still ongoing to advise and support the government on the potential of development
and linkage of a resource index to the Equity Index. The Resource Index will be based on the Priority
Minimum Enabling Conditions (PMCEs).
6.2 The Equity Strategy Implementation Plans (ESIPs)
49. Equity Strategy Implementation Plans (ESIPs) were developed in 2018 to allow for a systematic use
of the equity index to inform need-based planning at local government level to reduce identified
disparities. The aim is to ensure the formulation of ESIP includes active engagement of local and
school levels. Finally, the Equity Strategy has identified a number of key activities that are to be
undertaken at the central and local government level to strengthen the institutional capacity of the
22
sector for undertaking equity-based programming and planning, including a menu of potential targeted
interventions sorted against the different drivers of disparity.
50. The development of ESIPs involved several stakeholders such as CEHRD, MOSD, EDD, UNICEF
and technical support from World Education. Starting from 2016 onwards, CEHRD allocated
conditional grants to districts (in 2016 and 2017) and then to local governments (in 2018) to bring out-
of-school children into school, while local governments were provided with the flexibility to demand
plans and programs to meet identified needs.
51. The rationale of ESIP is to help local governments in systematically undertaking steps to translate
their equity index score in need-based planning and monitoring as described in the graphic below.
ESIPs development stages

Technology in Nepal. May 30, 2019, Kathmandu, Nepal
6.3 Timeline of the Equity Strategy
52. In 2017, the Ministry of Education15 (MoE) and the CEHRD ranked Nepal’s 75 districts16based on their
Equity Index scores to identify the districts with the highest level of disparities in education outcomes.
The 15 districts with the lowest score were selected for targeted interventions to reduce the disparities
for more equitable access, participation and learning outcomes. Districts as an education
administrative unit were abolished in 2018 with new tier of government set-up at local level. As a
result, 189 local governments were to be supported instead of the previously selected 15 districts.
53. The Equity Index was used to identify and target the districts and later local governments with the
highest disparities in education outcomes for specific interventions (the latter in a way to undertake
the unpacking, analysis and planning to strengthen needs- based interventions and programs to
achieve reduction of disparity in access, participation and learning outcomes through targeted
interventions).
54. In 2016/17, the five districts identified by the Equity Index as having the highest disparities in access,
participation and learning outcomes received extra funding to run targeted interventions to reduce the
number of out-of-school children. 17These districts were Rautahat, Sarlahi, Mahottari, Parsa and Bara.
15This was reformed to become the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST) in 2018.
16 Note: Nepal now has 77 districts as two of the previous districts were split into two in 2017/18 and have been dissolved in 2018 to
make place for 753 (municipal) local government.
17 Provision of budget was allocated of NPR 1.5 million per District (USD 13,200) in 2016/17 to implement the targeted interventions
according to a recent World Bank study: Results-Based Financing in the Education Sector: Country-Level Analysis, Nepal,
submitted to the REACH Program at the World Bank , draft Final Report, 5 October 2020
23
55. In 2017/18, the five districts that ranked from sixth to tenth were provided with such funding to run
targeted interventions (Dolpa, Rolpa, Doti, Humla and Siraha).18
56. In 2018/19, the additional funding mechanism was revised to include an equity-based formula19 and
to allow additional funds to be provided to local governments instead of provinces and the local
governments located within the previous district boundaries of district eleventh to fifteenth (Bhajang,
Achham, Jajarkot, Banke and Dhanusha). The number of newly established local governments within
the previous fifteen districts amounts to 189 municipalities.

these municipalities using a formula that includes a fixed tranche (base amount) which is the same for all municipalities to ensure a
volume that allows municipalities to utilize this and a variable tranche that determines their share of the overall funds based on their
prevalence (number of out of school children), severity (equity index score), and performance (reduction against their baseline in the

EVALUATION PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND
SCOPE
1. Purpose and Objectives of the evaluation
57. The purpose of the evaluation is to contribute to evidence-based adaptation of the Equity Strategy to
increase its use and effectiveness as part of Nepal’s new federal education sector plan. Mainly, the
evaluation aims at illustrating the direct and indirect effects that the introduction of the Strategy has
had on applying an equity-based approach within the previous two education sector plans through
comprehensive analysis.
58. As per the ToR, the evaluation’s objectives are:
▪ Evaluate the Equity Strategy’s intended and unintended effects, in terms of its relevance,
coherence, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability
▪ Gather lessons learned on the observed opportunities, achievements and challenges linked with
the use of the Equity Strategy
▪ Assess the perception of stakeholders on efficiency of various targeted equity interventions
▪ Develop recommendations which will guide policy makers in the use of the Equity Strategy under
the new education sector plan and contribute to evidence based equity focused programming
and policymaking.
2. Scope of the evaluation
59. The Thematic evaluation scope focuses on equity dimensions (gender, geographical location,
wealth quintile, disability, ethnicity and caste) and the thematic areas of the ES: learning, access and
survival rates based on available data provided by UNICEF (EMIS data). The evaluation covers the
two main pillars of the ES namely: the Equity Index and the major equity-based interventions
60. Geographical scope: The evaluation has a national focus on ranking disparities, based on which 15
districts were identified as having the highest prevalence of disparities and therefore prioritized for
interventions. 186 local governments formerly included into those districts have been categorized by
the equity index (levels of participation and access) including gender and some equity dimensions.
61. Chronological scope: While the evaluation covers the districts initially prioritized in 2016, it includes
all documented activities under the Equity Strategy which have already been implemented since 2014
and are still ongoing in 2021.
25
3. Evaluation Criteria and Questions
62. As it is a Formative process-based evaluation, the evaluation focused on the extent to which the two
pillars of the Equity Strategy, namely the Equity Index and the Equity based interventions, have been
implemented, how they have been implemented, what can be learnt from their implementation and if
there were any constraints related to their implementation in various contexts (transition to federalism
and COVID-19 situation).
63. The following 5 OECD/DAC20 criteria have been used for this evaluation: Relevance, Coherence,
Effectiveness, Efficiency and Sustainability. Criteria and Questions are further described in the
Evaluation Matrix presented in Annex 3.

METHODOLOGY
1. Evaluation Approach
64. This evaluation is formative and process-based with a focus on learning lessons and informing
policy making.
65. For this evaluation, we used a mixed method (qualitative data collection and secondary data analysis)
and theory-based approach21 to triangulate existing secondary quantitative data, reviewing existing
documentation and collecting additional primary data through a series of KIIs at National and Sub
National level conducted all remotely.
66. Based on the Equity Strategy document, the evaluation team reconstructed the T.o.C (See annex 12).
Several findings are related to the relevance of the design of the Equity Strategy and bring useful
perspectives in relation to the pathways of change and assumptions of the T.o.C that were initially
designed. See for example section 1.2 related to the analysis of the design and framework of the
Equity Strategy.
67. An important task under this evaluation was also to undertake an in-depth analysis of the datasets
from the EMIS (mainly flash reports derived periodically). The team also considered available MICS
data for analytical purposes22 but it was not used at the end. See Evaluation Matrix in Annex 3
2. Data Collection Method and Sampling
68. The following data collection methods were used during the evaluation: Desk review of relevant
information (See annex 1), analysis of secondary quantitative and qualitative information, key
Informants interviews (KIIs) at National and Sub National level. (See annex 2 for more details about
the respondents met during the evaluation).
69. Selection of municipality: The initial list of selection criteria for municipalities had to be revisited to 1)
better fit with the challenges related to interviews’ organization and municipalities’ selection, 2) to
consider both municipalities having implemented their ESIPs and municipalities having not. To meet
these challenges, the initial purposive sampling method was changed to a convenient sampling. We
also used a snowball technique to identify the respondents.
70. Key Informants for Interviews (KIIs) were selected purposively based on a list provided by UNICEF
and CEHRD.
71. The table summarizes the number of interviewees at various levels disaggregated by gender.
Table 3. Number of respondents interviewed through KIIs or FGDs (National level only for the latter)

National Level (FGDs) 13 16 29
Sub National Level (KIIs only) (Province, LGs and schools) 35 9 44

Theory based evaluation is an approach to evaluation (i.e., a conceptual analytical model) and not a specific method or technique.
It is a way of structuring and undertaking analysis in an evaluation.
22 A wider use of MICS data was not relevant nor possible for methodological reasons, linked mainly with issues with comparability
of data.
27
72. Interviews were carried out with Respondents from the Ministry of Education (At federal, provincial
and Local Governments level), UNICEF, Donor agencies, NGOs, and with members of the Equity and
Inclusion Technical Working Group (TWG)23.
73. It was initially expected to select 7 municipalities (including one school in each municipality) using a
purposive sampling method. We finally interviewed (remotely) respondents from 6 municipalities using
a convenient sampling method. The main purpose of these interviews was to get an in-depth
understanding of Equity based Interventions implemented at local level. The list of municipalities and
schools covered is presented below.

3. Analysis of Collected Data
76. For the qualitative component of the evaluation, Evaluation Questions were coded and represented
in the various Questionnaires for the KIIs. Information collected during the interviews was regularly
added into a word document organized per Evaluation Question that was used as a backbone for the
final report.
77. Transcripts from KIIs were compiled daily in a word document. In doing this iterative work, we were
able to check and ensure that data was triangulated before the information was then analyzed and
consolidated into the final report. Any divergence of opinions (between sources or between
respondents for example) is highlighted in the present final report.

4. Ethical and evaluation principles
79. The evaluation was conducted according to the evaluation norms and standards of the United Nations
Evaluation Group (UNEG)26 and the UNEG Code of Conduct27 .Transversal analysis of human rights,
gender and equity aspects was undertaken in line with the Guidelines on the Integration of Human
Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluations28..Close attention was paid to the compliance with the
GEROS standards29.
80. During the whole data collection process, the evaluation team respected the following ethical
safeguards for interviewees: respect for dignity and diversity, right to self-determination, equitable
representation, respect for vulnerable groups, confidentiality and the "do no harm" principle.
81. The following key evaluation principles were also respected:
1. Independence and conflict of interest: Members of the evaluation team are independent and have not been involved in
Project activities, nor have they been responsible in the past for the design, execution or supervision of the Project;
2. Impartiality: The evaluation team provided a comprehensive and balanced presentation of the project's strengths and
weaknesses. The evaluation process took into account all views received from stakeholders;
3.Transparency: The evaluation team communicate as openly as possible the purpose of the evaluation, the criteria applied
and the expected use of the results. The evaluation report provides transparent information on its sources, methods and
approaches;
4.Disclosure: It is expected that the Evaluation report will serve as a mechanism by which the findings and lessons identified in
the evaluation will be disseminated to policy makers, operational staff, beneficiaries, the general public and other stakeholders;
5.Ethics: The evaluation team respected the right of institutions and individuals to provide information in confidence, and the
sources of specific information and opinions contained in the evaluation report have not been disclosed.
6.Credibility: The Evaluation is based on data and observations that are considered reliable and trustworthy with respect to the
quality of the instruments, procedures and analyses that have been used to collect and interpret the information;
7.Usefulness: The report present facts, findings and issues, conclusions and recommendations in a comprehensive and
balanced manner.
82. All sub national interviews were virtual and recorded. All participants were asked for authorization to
record their interview. Any issues or information that the interviewees wanted off the record were not
transcribed. All the recordings are securely stored in a computer used only by one team member.
Information will be deleted permanently after the final submission and approval of the report. Informed
consent was collected before starting the recording.
83. The evaluation design and approach brought in the evaluation principles: UN and UNICEF's
commitment to a human rights-based approach to programming, to gender equality, and to equity in
the following manners:
84. Whenever possible and relevant, the team requested to interview a balanced number of men and
women. At the end 35% of the number of respondents interviewed were female. One member of the
evaluation team was a gender expert and was responsible for collecting information at sub national
level.
85. The Object of this evaluation: Consolidated Equity Strategy for the School Education Sector in Nepal
(Equity Strategy), is to reduce the current disparities in (i) access and participation and (ii) learning
outcomes for children in basic and secondary public education in Nepal. This is done through
incorporating equity-based interventions and strategies in the education sector plans and alignment
of non-state resources to these, as well as the use of an Equity Index that includes gender as one of

the potential drivers of inequity but recognizes its intersectionality with other drivers and that it
therefore cannot be taken as a stand-alone dimension. For this reason, there was no standalone
criterion on gender and/or human rights included in the Term of Reference and in the evaluation
framework as this was mainstreamed into other evaluation criteria and Evaluative Questions.
86. The Object of the evaluation is very much contributing to the fulfilment of children rights to education
and more particularly marginalized children. For this reason, findings and analysis of this report are
directly related to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (commonly abbreviated
as the CRC.) The Consolidated Equity Strategy is implemented in the context of the previous and
current national education sector plans that aims for basic education to ensure equitable access to
quality education through a rights-based approach and promotion of a child-friendly environment in
schools.
87. As can be seen in this report, the evaluation team conducted a quantitative analysis of existing data
in using a gender lens. Data for enrolled OoSC was conducted per grade and per gender.
Recommendations related to the improvement of girls’ education are included in the report. Among
them, the importance of secondary education in relation to access to sciences studies for girls for
example is highlighted.
88. In short, the following actions were taken to ensure gender equality and social inclusion
▪ Ensure that evaluations include GESI-related questions that are linked to the project/program ToC and situational
analysis.
▪ Include a GESI expert in the evaluation team and seek to ensure that all evaluation team members have some
understanding of GESI within the context of the project/program being evaluated.
▪ Collect feedback from women and poor and excluded groups using appropriate tools.
▪ Design and use instruments that clearly capture disaggregation and issues impacting women, the poor, vulnerable
and excluded people.
▪ Use both quantitative and qualitative methods whenever possible.
▪ Prepare disaggregated data and an evaluation report that captures benefits to women, poor, vulnerable and
excluded people and also documents remaining issues.
▪ Include explicit documentation of the implications and impact on women, the poor, vulnerable and excluded people.
▪ Develop a management response plan that includes actions to address GESI-related findings and
recommendations.

FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
1. Relevance of the Equity Strategy to context and needs
1.1 Added value of the Strategy
R 1. To what extent has the Equity Strategy been based on the equity-based issues and challenges observed in
the education sector, and the needs of children in marginalized ethnic groups, castes and low-income families?
R1.1 Sub question: To what extent has the Equity Strategy added value in the context of ‘’natural’’ observed
systemic downward trend towards universalisation of access, participation and learning outcomes? How sound
was the rationale to select the three capacities (access, participation and learning outcomes) as a justification for a
dedicated Strategy on Equity?
Added values of the Equity Strategy
1. A key rationale behind the development of the Equity Strategy was that even though there had
been a well-functioning Education Management Information System (EMIS) for decades, the data
obtained from the education system were not fully analyzed and more importantly, the
government wasn’t fully using the data it received to track progress or monitor which
geographic areas or population groups were in need of additional resources to address
structural inequities. Through the “Data Must Speak” initiative, the ambition was to test an
innovative approach of using education data for equitable resource allocation and targeted
programming. For this purpose, UNICEF worked with the Government of Nepal, its partner
organization World Education, and received technical support from UNICEF Regional Office for
South Asia (ROSA) and the Education team at UNICEF Headquarters.
2. It naturally led to the 2-pillars structure with, on the one hand a comprehensive index to target the
most relevant populations, and on the other hand, a set of policy measures addressing the needs
of these populations. The idea behind the Equity Index was also to move away from current
blanket approaches to scholarships and other equity policies, which have been largely
unmonitored; to provide an opportunity for evidenced-based planning and budgeting and a
methodology to track progress and measure effectiveness of more tailored approaches. The ES,
as it was adopted in 2014, does not have its own action plan31 at national level, leading pillar 2 to
be dependent upon local planning capacities.
3. To support the buy in of the Equity Index, an incremental approach was used by first
advocating for the need of an objective way of measurement of Equity based on government
data. The 1st computation of the index took time to convince the government to actually use the
data. The index was conceptualized in 2014 and approved in 2016 by MoEST. Noting that the first
list of districts computed through the Equity Index was not surprising compared to previously known
figures, the Government felt that the index could be used to further ‘’ unpack’’ the inequity issues
at local level. It then provided an evidence-based information for MoEST to advocate for the
Ministry of Finance to allocate additional funding. UNICEF indicated that ‘’once we are
understanding where the disparities are and what are the drivers, it makes disparities workable to
be used for planning and resource allocation.’’
4. Similarly, the equity index was also seen by respondents interviewed as a good
communication avenue that helps to prompt discussion at local level about disparity.
31 Even though there have been some attempts at the beginning to develop some action plans at national level but it did not work.
34
5. The ES contributed to give more emphasis on equity issues in Nepal and nurtured all
Nepalese education planning documents after 2014. For example, the SSDP document (2016-
2021) updated in March 2020, includes 157 occurrences of the word Equity. Our rapid review of
the occurrences of the word equity in the various versions of the SSDP indicates an increase
interest for equity issues as per the table below.

6. The SSDP even provides a key result area on equity with a definition aligned with the initial ES,
stating that the purpose of educational reform is to “ensure that the education system is inclusive
and equitable in terms of access, participation and learning outcomes, with a special focus on
reducing disparities among and between groups having the lowest levels of access, participation
and learning outcomes.” Equitable and inclusive access and participation is one of the 9 expected
key results area32 of the SSDP:
7.Equitable and inclusive access and participation — Nepal’s achievements in access to education have not ensured access for all, with certain
groups experiencing less access to and participation in quality education, including low participation of children with disabilities in mainstream
classrooms. The aim is to reduce the disparities experienced by groups with low access, participation and learning outcomes. The Consolidated
Equity Strategy (2014) needs to be implemented for the consolidation and the needs-based targeting of related strategies through the use of
disparity-based formulas and the provision of inclusive education for children with disabilities.
7. Out of 153 indicators included in the SSDP result framework, 26 (around 17%) are related to Equity
while other indicators also contribute to advance the Equity Agenda indirectly as per the table
below.

8. ES is integrated in several documents such as SSDP progress reports, the flash reports, the
status reports and out of school reports. The EI is integrated within the ESP and in the
monitoring and progress reports for the ESP that are regularly produced by the government through
the flash reports

Equitable and inclusive access and participation, 8. Enabling environment, 9.Infrastructure development and school safety.
35
9. The adoption of the ES led to an increased focus on equity by the Government and non-state actors
that has been evidenced by:
▪ A better collaboration around equity between Organisations working in the education sector
and with the government through the discussions taking place in the Equity technical Working
Group.
▪ The setting up of a dedicated group on equity has allowed that relevant and articulated
suggestions on equity be made at the plenary discussions during the JRM and BRM times. 33
This has permitted to raise equity higher in the education agenda at the level of the Ministry of
Education.
▪ A stronger avenue for advocacy on equity whereby members of the equity TWG are jointly
participating to the regular JRM and BRM missions to ensure that equity remain high in the
agenda.
▪ A renew interest of the Government for equity issues materialised by additional funding from
the federal budget provided to the 15 focused districts that were ranked by the Equity Index.
▪ A stronger awareness of LGs on equity issues and inequity dimensions taking place in their
municipalities
▪ A dedicated Disbursement Link Indicator such as the DLI 6, indicates also the importance of
equity for some donor agencies
▪ An increase dialogue between donor agencies and the Government to strengthen the Equity
Agenda in the Education sector
10. We found that the strategy also contributed to consensus building in ‘’operational terms’’ with the
understanding that:
▪ There is a consensus on the objective set by the strategy to target the most vulnerable areas
(districts then local government) and concentrate resources in these most needed locations.
▪ The strategy leads to specific fieldwork to identify and prioritize targets (in a context of a lack
of local skills, which we can hope is temporary) with basic data extracted from EMIS (Although,
whose presentation of education indicators is more descriptive than analytical and pedagogical
for the stakeholders) who will then finally trigger actions through the implementation of the
ESIPs.
▪ There is an ambition to mobilize donors for additional resources allocations.
▪ The tool has been developed in order to make it evolves according to the future capacities of
EMIS.
11. Nevertheless, other sources indicate that Quality and equity in education remain challenging
and, although they are mentioned in the SSDP, they will continue to go unchallenged: “The SSDP
identifies altogether 11 policy directions and 20 implementation strategies under equity, quality,
efficiency and relevance to achieve the objectives and 31 key results. For most of these, there are
no specific targets or indicators”34.
12. A recent meeting (April 2019) of the TWG on equity and inclusion highlighted the need for more
gender disaggregation of targets to yet be applied for the many PRF indicators. The same meeting
also noted that relevant SSDP Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) need to be further
disaggregated by caste/ethnicity.
13. On the other hand, this consensus-based strategy may give the impression that it does not take
sufficiently into account the scale of the problem identified (as drivers are not weighted as
discussed later in this report in the section related to the effectiveness of the index) or that it takes
precedence over other more comprehensive policies that contribute to the same objectives.

R 1.2 Sub Question: What has been the added value of computing data from EMIS and population data using the
Equity index formulas compared to more traditional aggregation of data for the education sector as an information
and advocacy tool to reduce disparities in education outcomes?
14. In order to test the relevance of the EI we looked at the ranking of districts that derived from their
performance in basic schooling (NER for upper basic) in 2009, 2015 and in 2019 (see annex 4 for
methodological considerations and detailed results). The result shows that the 15 ES selected
districts since 2015 are effectively within the 30 districts performing less than the national average
in 2009 (with 2 exceptions) but with a different ranking than the one measured by the EI.
Unsurprisingly, the 5 least-performing districts in both selections are the already well-known Teraï
districts, lagging behind others for a long time. However, differences exist when considering the
other selected districts. More precisely, when we refer to schooling performance through NER in
upper basic, some districts appear to perform less than the selected ES districts. In reference to
the EI built in, these districts have low C (average performance) and also low D (average inequities
performance linked to the equity drivers). The fact that these districts are excluded through the EI
ranking is questionable as it is clearly inequitable for someone to live in a district that performs
badly (even if in these districts the low performances concern equally all the groups considered in
the equity drivers).
1.2 Analysis of the design and framework of the Equity Strategy
R 1.3 Sub Question: To what extent are the design, theoretical framework including the ToC and rationale of the
strategy appropriate, relevant and effective for the envisioned purpose?
15. As part of this assignment, the evaluation team reconstructed the Theory of Change (ToC) of the
Equity Strategy (See inception report). Though this process, several issues were identified as
described thereafter.
Issues with the design of the Equity Strategy:
16. The 2014 ES document was highly ambitious and included a long and rather confusing list of
possible equity-based interventions proposed as examples or “menu of options”. The list provides
a good basis for brainstorming and identifying relevant actions but may be perceived as
overwhelming for the LGs for their operationalisation. Some of the interventions suggested as
possible measures tackle long-term societal changes and /or long-term systemic education
changes35 in the overall education sector that may not be able to be addressed under this strategy,
and are definitely out of the possible scope of ESIPs.
17. In addition, the initial design has some loopholes in the sense that it does not encompass
information related to assumptions and risks and also lack relevant pathways of change between
the various elements that compose the Strategy. (see paragraph 21 below)
18. Even though the Equity Index is a major component of the strategy, there is a limited description
in the Section III: ‘’Framework of the consolidated equity strategy for the school education
sector’’ about activities and outputs related to the index and explanation on how they will
contribute to reach the objectives. Nevertheless, we note that the equity index was yet to be
developed when section III was written.
35
For example: Interventions related to societal changes through awareness raising or strengthening education services such as
holistic development within ECED services..
37
19. It is not clear from the Strategy document which entity in the Ministry of Education will be
in charge of operationalizing the strategy and ensuring effective planning, monitoring and
consolidation of information about results and outcomes. Similarly, the level of responsibilities for
the effective implementation of each of the described interventions is not mentioned in the ES
(federal, provincial, district and local).
20. Overall, we found that the Strategy is built partly as a logical framework, partly as an outcome
model or a ToC and does not provide an overall and visual perspective of what should be
expected.
The pathway of change may not be so linear

21. The EI design described above seems to imply a linear complementarity (and equal weight)
between access-participation-learning outcomes. At international level, the analysis of
schooling usually put the learning perspective before the participation (and sometimes even before
the access). Dropouts often follow weak learning outcomes and repetitions.
22. In reality, access should not only be considered in quantitative terms. It should also take
account of the fact that school provision is differentiated in terms of quality (community versus
institutional, concentration of "good" teachers in several privileged localities, huge differences in
learning environments, etc.). Thus, access to differentiated education service provision can
lead to different participation and learning.
23. This is further highlighted by the fact that the deployment of teachers to the schools is not
equitable. Owing to the budget constraint, the number of positions of permanent, temporary, and
Rahat teachers has been kept unchanged in the central budget for many years and MoEST is
expecting Local Governments or schools to compensate for shortcomings from their own
resources. The deployment of permanent positions is unequal over the territory36, and not all Local
Governments have the capacity to compensate and recruit more personnel, meaning that
economically poor schools have a higher ratio of teacher/students. A resource index that
should have taken these points into consideration was expected to be part of the consolidated EI.
A resource index has been effectively developed but is not yet included in the analysis of the
ranking.37
24. Similarly, participation is often dependent on learning (repetition produces dropouts,
participation depends on families' perception of the interest for their child to attend a low quality
school or to keep children in difficulty at school if the service provided does not sufficiently support
these children). For example, drivers of successes for retention will not only be access but also the
quality and efficiency of the school system itself. Studies have shown that children will tend to
remain at school provided that the school itself is of quality.

A resource index was expected to be part of the consolidated index and only has been developed once but not included in the

38
Issue with the method of calculation of the index
25. The method of calculation of the Equity Index takes some dimensions of inequity equally into
account38. It therefore does not take into account evidence on school participation (From CSOs in
particular) underlining the considerable weight of family resources in real inequalities and the
weak (net) effect of the various other dimensions.
26. The ES described clearly the importance of meaningful equity dimensions: (i) equity in meaningful
access, (ii) equity in meaningful/functional participation and (iii) equity in meaningful learning
outcomes39. Nevertheless, it felt short in identifying the various issues pertaining to the
drivers of these dimensions that could potentially be tackled through targeted supply and/or
demand equity-based interventions. 40
27. The idea that there would be a "main driver" of inequity is undoubtedly debatable because
of their cumulative and hierarchical nature (poverty is a factor that dominates all the other drivers)
and does not dispense from a detailed analysis of the various factors inherent to local context in
terms of supply and demand, to be able later on to put in place appropriate policies.
28. Finally, the index shows severity of the disparity (ie, the value of ‘D’) but not prevalence or is not
able to weigh drivers that are otherwise not significant (such as disability for example).
The design of the index and the OoSC as a main policy induce a focus of the interventions on the
demand side of the education system and fails to take education needs of targeted children into
consideration
29. The way the Equity index is designed induces a focus on the demand side of the education sector
as the main drivers of inequities are related to various typologies of children and as such the index
does not include aspects related for example to a lack of education services and quality in specific
geographical areas.
30. See annex 6 for a summary of issues that could be tackled through supply or demand oriented
interventions that have not been envisaged in the initial design of the Strategy.
38 The EI does not weight the various inequity drivers (gender, caste, geographical background, family income, specific vulnerability)
but uses instead an arithmetic mean which assumes that their weight is the same in term of contribution to inequity.
39 Meaningful has been added to avoid confusion that the strategy’s focus areas are seen in a superficial and physical sense. Access
within the strategic framework does not mean merely enrolment, which specified an administrative action, but a child entering
education (both basic and secondary level) and being welcomed in doing so. Participation goes beyond for example retention or
attendance, it means a child physically being within the school, being engaged in the social and educational processes within the
education system and feeling safe and accepted while doing so. Finally, learning outcomes, not just in the sense of being sufficient to
pass tests, but aligned with the potential and the needs and context of the child’s livelihood and life skills. Source: Equity Strategy

1.3 Adequation of the Strategy to respond to barriers and needs
Sub question R 1.4: To what extent do equity-based interventions (both undertaken and proposed) respond to the
Context and structural causes of disparities in education outcomes? And how do they respond to reducing barriers in
access, participation and learning outcomes based on identified needs?
Sub question R 1.5: To what extent does the operationalization of the equity strategy through targeted interventions
allow a response to these barriers being intersectional and including several drivers of disparities that
disproportionally increase disparities as assumed in the theoretical framework?
The Equity Index
31. At its design stage, the index was to take into consideration the following dimensions of inequity
Gender, location, Ethnicity (Dalit/non-Dalit), disability, wealth, parent's education. In the end,
because of issues related to data availability, the index computed data mainly related to the
following three categories: gender, location and ethnicity. Also, the dimension “disability” was not
included as the number of children with disabilities was statistically not significant enough.
32. As detailed in other sections of this report, these challenges impacted the relevance and use of the
index for data analysis compared to regular Education indicators.
Equity based interventions
33. The additional funding provided to LGs to address disparities in education were sometimes
perceived by the LG as additional opportunities to support the education sector as a whole as
shared by this LG met during the evaluation.
‘’Earlier too there had been works on equity whether they were seen or unseen. Now a name is given for those works. Like giving scholarship is
also equity. So, supporting stationery, bags, clothes had been done earlier also. Now too we are doing the same thing. We are not doing it
differently whether we make plan or not. But now we need to bring 100% students back to school within certain time period which is stressed by
making a plan. Ensure their access and quality.’’ LG Education officer
’My children study in grade 9, 6 and 4. For grade 4 child, there is provision of lunch, scholarship, uniform and textbooks. For bigger girls, the
municipality provides uniform and cycle. My daughter has also received cycle and uniform. Scholarship comes from school, uniform and cycle
come from municipality. I encourage other parents to send their children to school. There is good education, the provincial government has
provided for lunch and the municipality has been providing uniform and lunch. Enrolment drive (Welcome to school program) had immense
impact on the kids and it was effective.’’ KII with a mother of enrolled children
34. According to UNICEF and WE, the majority of the LGs from the 1st batch of 40 LGs supported are
at the final stage of endorsement of their plans by the municipality councils. Nevertheless, based
on our discussion with the key informants interviews only few of them have actually
implemented their plans.41
35. As the supported LGs were recently sensitized about equity, some ESIP interventions look like
more as a wish list for the education sector as a whole but do not focus enough on how to
address the root causes of inequity. The first round of 5 ESIPs is to be taken as a baseline and
every round should improve the ESIPs. Mainly, LGs have not yet been able to look at the
dimensions on why children are lagging behind and could not yet identify the activities that
would help break the barriers to access. This could also be explained by the current capacity
gaps (and lack of analytical skills) at local level that is currently prevailing in the context of the
transition to federalism.
41
Unfortunately because of lack of information and monitoring reports, it was not possible to identify how many of the LGs had
started to implement their plans.
40
36. Among the 14 reasons for being OoS highlighted by the household survey conducted by CEHRD42
in 2019, poverty accounted for 60.5% of the responses. CEHRD suggested that these children
either had to work or were unable to afford to go to school. This reason has direct and indirect
relations with other dropout factors. The next most common response was the distance to school
(11.0%), lack of interest to go to school (4.1%) and engagement in some sorts of labour (5.0%).

‘’She was teased in her class regarding her age which embarrassed her to attend the class and she dropped out’’; ‘’I admitted them when they
were 5 years old but due to irregularities they were unable to pass the grades regularly so they dropped out’’; ‘’Those students who fail grade exam
or are absent for a long time due to seasonal migration for work, see their friends moving in higher grades and are demotivated to repeat the
grade’’. KII with parents of Out of Schools Children.
‘’There are various reasons for drop out and irregular attendance of students for example: families travelling to India for work taking their children
with them, lack of awareness among parents, students involved in works to earn, natural disaster affecting the school etc.’’ KII with a LG education
officer
37. As UNICEF experienced in other countries, “back to school” campaigns are generally quite effective
to bring back children to schools. The issue that remains is how to make sure they remain at school.
38. As described in some of the ESIPs, and through the KIIs, there is a belief that the main reason
for dropping out is children engagement in domestic chores. Poverty, internal migration,
illiteracy and lack of awareness among parents were also perceived as being the root
causes of dropping out. Nevertheless, studies have shown that even if the child’ family is
poor, parents will tend to leave the child at school provided that he/she is performing well,
implying that the focus should be on improving the quality of the school system43 (the
supply side of the education system) to ensure better retention rates. Accordingly, most ESIP
were focussed on access with only few targeted activities to address issues related to participation
and learning outcomes.
39. A baseline data was started in 2015 with a nominative list of out of school children gathered through
household survey. The baseline findings is not yet used as an opportunity to better
understand the effects of school reintegration programs and more importantly if the out of
schools children reintegrated actually remained or not in the school system and if not why
they dropped out.
42 The 15 districts with the highest level of disparity as per the access plus participation ranking for academic years 2016/17, 2017/18
and 2018/19 (Table 3) were selected as the subjects of the baseline assessment of out-of-school children conducted in 2019
43 Access indicators such as NERs and NARs reflect the results of the interaction between the supply of educational services and
household demand for education. The availability of schools and teachers, proximity of schools to households, state expenditure on
education are some key indicators of supply. Similarly, demand side indicators, which are functions of household preferences and
constraints that affect the use of the services supplied, include inter alia, family and cultural background of students, direct private
costs of education, and scholarships or financial assistance received by household.
41
40. In some instances, (based on KIIs), there was anecdotal cases of schools also working on retention
of reintegrated children but there has been uneven successes in doing it because of various factors
(poverty, context, family situations..) as described with the quotes below.
‘’I would give any help that is needed but SMC has not been formed now. All the activities the school has been doing is helping to sustain the
students in the school. Earlier, students would come to school and leave at 12, 12:30 pm but now, we see that the students are staying up to 3,
3:30. The teachers are also supporting. Our house is near the school and we keep the school under supervision on how it is doing. I think now, if
the teachers could spare some time, and organize some programs on raising awareness in the locality that would be good.’’ KII with a parent of
school going children
’I have 3 children. Two are married and one son is 10 years old. He dropped after studying grade 5. Due to poverty, he has to do a lot of work but
I didn't ask him to leave school. He left on his own. I know that the school has been providing many things. If I try again and hard then maybe he
will come back to school. My husband had gone abroad earlier but now he is here. I admitted him twice to a private school but he ran away from
there too. I couldn’t do anything. He used to come to school but during COVID lockdown there was a gap and since then he didn’t want to come
back to school.’’ KII with a parent of out of school going children
41. The SSDP Mid Term Review recognized important results obtained in terms of reducing the number
of OoSC44. The same source reported that this was due to the important work conducted by local
stakeholders (schools, LGs, SMCs, etc.) and Non-State Actors that have been highly involved in
awareness campaigns and made home visits to identify and enrol OoSC in formal and non-formal
schemes.
42. Nevertheless, access and more importantly retention in the education system for the most
disadvantaged children remain a challenge. Late entry and specific difficulties faced by these
children increase the risk of dropout before completing basic education45. It seems that incentives
and efforts are focused on children’s enrolment whereas resources to give proper attention and
follow-up for these students may not be in place to support their participation in the long run. The
report further notes that drop out factors are complex, often intricate and require a holistic approach
where the school environment can only play a limited role.
43. The Flash report (2018/2019) report highlights also an early risk of drop-out between grade 1 and
grade 2 in community schools, at 19% compared to 4% risk in institutional schools.
44. This issue partially explains the setbacks observed in terms of survival rates and cycle completion
rate. The flash report (2075, 2018-2019) confirms this negative trend in survival rate at grade 8 for
2018/2019 but also indicates an increase in repetition rate. These trends confirm that stakeholders
at school level have not yet been able to adjust their pedagogical practices and support
children with special needs (such as Children with disabilities). There is a need to improve
the minimum enabling environment for the children to participate and learn.
45. To track the evolution of school performance, a resource index has been developed but the input
in data is limited. So far it is based on the 5 Priority Minimum Enabling Conditions (PMEC)46.
UNICEF mentioned ongoing work to increase the relevance of this resource index, in particular an
option paper, still under discussion. Currently, the Government tracks how many of these conditions
are met (through the flash reports). What is still missing is to set a target on how many enabling
conditions need to be there to be considered as good score.
46. The following table shows the three components of the equity index (access, participation and
learning) by province and compares the values of the equity index and those of the resources index.
The table is integrating data on learning, as it is an old form of EI which today is limited to the
access and retention components only. The relationship between the two indexes (EI and resource
index) suggests that there is a positive correlation between them. This positive relationship can
44 The MoEST reports a total 258 000 OoSC enrolled in formal and non-formal streams in the MTR document
45 For the year 2017/2018, nearly 40% of 5-year old boys from the Dalit and most disadvantaged communities do not attend school.
The correlation between late entry and the risk of early drop-out has been largely documented worldwide. (Source: TWG on Equity
and Inclusive Education – April 2019 cited in the SSDP MTR 2019)
46 Priority Minimum Enabling Conditions (PMEC) of: 1) student- teacher ratio; 2) classroom space; 3) set of textbooks per child per
year; 4) separate girls and boys toilets plus water; and 5) book/learning corner in all classrooms
42
be interpreted as a sign that poor performance is linked to low resources. We can also
consider, as in many countries where the relation between resources and outcomes is
relatively weak, that this positive correlation is explained by the fact that the best performing
schools benefit from additional resources (due to their location and attractiveness) without
establishing a causality between these two dimensions.

47. The 2019/20 Flash data reports that 63.6% of all public schools providing basic level education met
only three out of five of the PMECs, although 13.4% of schools met all five PMECs, which greatly
exceeds the Year 4 target of 6.1%. Despite this achievement, the report also calls for further
investment in upgrading school conditions, especially water, sanitation and hygiene
facilities, to allow the safe return of students to schools as directed by the approved school
reopening school framework.
48. The evaluation team also found that little was planned and done through equity-based interventions
to address the barriers to the inclusion of Children with Special Needs in the education system.
Addressing Disability barriers are likely to require greater financial investment and expertise
linked with inclusive teaching practices than barriers relating to school uniform or
stationary costs for example.
49. Please see also for more information in this report the section that answers sub Question R4.2: To
what extent have cross-sectoral issues related to geographical location, mother tongue and
disability been reflected and accommodated in the implementation of the ES?
43
CONCLUSION R 1. To what extent has the Equity Strategy been based on the equity-based issues and
challenges observed in the education sector, and the needs of children in marginalized ethnic groups, castes
and low-income families?
Evaluative Judgement: The ES is a good avenue in term of awareness raising and advocacy, leading to great equity-
based mobilization but activities implemented in the field focussed mainly on out-of-school children, notably access
and participation, and partly failed to address the learning needs of vulnerable children in schools.
ES is relevant with the 2030 global agenda and provides a specific strategy to reach the most vulnerable children
alongside the overall education policy planning cycle (SSRP and SSDP). It responds to the challenge of equity through
the provision of data related to several identified key drivers of disparities (gender, ethnicity, location, ability, etc.).
The rationale is to target children lagging further and further behind in terms of access, participation and learning that
could lead them to benefit less from the National Education Policy. The strategy is seeking to make the institutional
structure and mechanisms increasingly capable for undertaking need-based programming and budgeting.
The Equity Index is the vehicle to support the targeting of ultra-disadvantaged children and allows to inform
subsequent remedial interventions. It "scientifically" legitimizes the choice to work on a relatively limited number of
beneficiaries.
The evaluation team found that the Equity Strategy is also a good avenue in term of awareness raising and advocacy
leading to great equity-based mobilization and making Nepal a pioneer country in specifically addressing equity issues
in education. The strategy addressed with relative success the access and participation challenges, although the most
marginalized still remain hard-to-reach. The ES described clearly the importance of meaningful equity dimensions: (i)
equity in meaningful access, (ii) equity in meaningful/functional participation and (iii) equity in meaningful learning
outcomes47. Nevertheless, it felt short in identifying the various issues pertaining to the drivers of these dimensions
that could potentially be tackled through targeted supply and/or demand equity-based interventions.
However, equity interventions effectively reflected in ESIP and implemented in the field focussed mainly on out-of-
school children, notably access and participation, and partly failed to address the learning needs of vulnerable children
in schools. It leads the equity strategy to neglect part of the equity challenge and failing to recognize that, in many
cases, the learning dimension prevails on access and participation when dropout results from the poor quality of
school supply in the most vulnerable areas. In that case, the learning needs of vulnerable children are not directly
addressed.
LGs have not yet been able to look at the dimensions on why children are lagging behind and could not yet identify
the activities that would help break the barriers to access, participation and learning. This could also be explained by
the current capacity gaps and still unclear legal framework in the context of the transition to federalism.
47 Meaningful has been added to avoid confusion that the strategy’s focus areas are seen in a superficial and physical sense. Access
within the strategic framework does not mean merely enrolment, which specified an administrative action, but a child entering
education (both basic and secondary level) and being welcomed in doing so. Participation goes beyond for example retention or
attendance, it indicates a child physically being within the school, being engaged in the social and educational processes within the
education system and feeling safe and accepted while doing so. Finally, learning outcomes, not just in the sense of being sufficient to
pass tests, but aligned with the potential and the needs and context of the child’s livelihood and life skills. Source: Equity Strategy

1.4 Rationale of the Strategy with regards to national Education context
R.2. Does the Equity Strategy adequately respond to the overall context of the Education Sector in Nepal?
R 2.1 Sub Question: What has been the rationale for the design of an Equity Strategy to reinforce the overall
dynamic of the system compared to a lighter capacity building intervention of the system?
Rapid overview of the context
50. In order to look at the enrolment pattern in Nepal, we referred to the evolution of NER in the four
level of education. If NER underestimates the real schooling performance of the country in a period
of multi-cohort schooling, it remains the best indicator for temporal comparisons in the perspective
of progressive stabilization of the entry age into the education system. As can be seen in table 1,
the NER at the basic level comes close to 100% at the end of the period 2009-2019 indicating that
universalization has been quite reached. This performance leads to few disparities between
districts (district standard deviation for this indicator is only 0,4 in 2019)48. The schooling indicator
at Lower secondary (Upper basic) is also progressing significantly as it already reaches 89,7 % in
2019 with a growth of 42 % over the period. The standard deviation computed at the district level
of Lower secondary in 2019 is 8,9 (against 13,9 in 2009). Clearly the universalization of the NER
at basic level depends mainly now on the progress made at Upper Basic level. This objective seems
attainable before 2030 as can be seen in figure 9. Lower secondary and secondary are growing in
parallel indicating that progress made at lower levels translate rapidly at the higher levels. The
parallelism is less strong for secondary and higher secondary indicating that this last level (that
concerns fewer children), is less dependent of the secondary level growth.

This statistic measures the dispersion of the indicator (NER lower primary) between the districts considered in the analysis, which
means that the differences are very small (and therefore that the possibilities of a differentiation of results between districts that could
testify to a possible inequity are low, which justifies focusing more particularly on what happens at the upper basic level in order to
analyze situations of inequity in basic education.
45
51. Several strategic documents and studies have shown that overarching issues in the
education sector in Nepal are quality and efficiency. The recent Education sector analysis,
(Nepal, MoEST 2020, supported by USAID) indicates that Nepal should focus on learning equity
and teacher quality and make them the overarching issues that need to guide the education system.
It also points disparities and lack of targeted programming as major issues in addition to quality
and efficiency.
52. Already in 2013, the World Bank report on Nepal Human Development, access, equity, and quality
in the education, health and social protection sectors noted that Nepal’s progress in improving
access to and efficiency of educational services had been impressive but that more needed to be
done on quality as evidenced by the persistently low pass rates in the national board exams at
secondary level. The report called for more focused educational interventions on the Terai as this
will have a significant impact not only on enhancing access and reducing the overall number of out-
of-school children, but also raising the educational status of the most disadvantaged ethnic groups.
53. At the time of development of the Equity Strategy in 2014, the SSRP 2009-2013/1549 recognized
already that social inclusion and equity issues continued to prevail as a major concern
across all levels of education delivery, together with low levels of learning achievements and
persistently high drop-out and repetition rates.
Rationale for the design of an Equity Strategy
54. A major purpose of the ES, as shared by Government personnel interviewed at Federal level,
was also to improve coordination and cross sectorial coordination on Equity at all levels
(within the Ministry of Education, between Ministries and with development partners). The extent
to which this coordination effectively improved is discussed later in this report.
55. The MoEST presented this overall dynamic and its comprehensive set of activities as summarized
in the table below:
Global Partnership For Education GPE-GRA (Data Must Speak); Initiative implemented across five countries to strengthen quality
and use of data through establishment of feedback mechanisms;
▪ Support to development of Equity Index
▪ Support to development of school and district/ municipality profiles
▪ Support to conceptualize an equity resource index
▪ Support to establish web-based EMIS
GPE-ESPDG; Support for adaptation and decentralization of the Nepal education sector plan in the federal context;
▪ Development of Local level Equity Strategy Implementation Plans (ESIPs)
▪ Development of toolkits for using data for strengthening local level accountability and planning
GPE-ESPIG; Equity Index selected as the Equity-based stretch indicator and included as an indicator in the joint Disbursement
Linked Indicator framework;
SSDP technical assistance facility; will support the further strengthening of the web-based EMIS to include additional components
and features needed to establish cross sectoral linkages and as per need of the three tiers of government.

49 The emphasis of the component basic and secondary education of the School Sector Reform Program, SSRP (FY 2009-2013/15)
was to increase access to and participation and to promote equity and social inclusion and improve quality and relevance of basic and
secondary education.
46
CONCLUSION R.2. Does the Equity Strategy adequately respond to the overall context of the Education
Sector in Nepal?
Evaluative Judgement: We found that the Equity Strategy partly responded to the overall context of the
Education Sector for the following reasons:
Rationale for the development of the ES shared by Government personnel interviewed at Federal level was to
improve communication, coordination and cross sectorial coordination on Equity at all levels (within the Ministry of
Education, between Ministries and with development partners). The choice of a dedicated strategy strongly
contributed to this objective, and the inclusion of equity efforts into the global sector plan was successful, with
numerous references to equity.
Geographically wise, beside the 15 focused districts of interventions supported by government with technical
support by UNICEF through WE, orientation and dissemination of Equity Strategy was also organized at Provincial
level in Province 2, 5, 6 and 7 indicating, some level of reach beyond the 15 focus districts.
In the context of the transition to federalism, the ES showed excellent adaptability. ESIP planning effectively
contributed to the global education planning effort at local government effort, and the index was recalculated to fit
to the revised structures of education planning.
The Equity Index and Grants/ESIP system adopts a multidimensional approach to exclusion, but there remain few
explicit interventions to address and monitor progress, beyond efforts to reduce the number of out of school children.
Indicators in the results framework of the SSDP do not always include the level of disaggregation required to monitor
the impact of those efforts meant to reduce exclusion, and some indicators tracking progress among the most
disadvantaged populations have not been updated.
Respondents interviewed indicated that the ES strategy fell short in addressing key factors like language, child
marriage and disability issues.
1.5 Reach and timeliness of the Strategy
R.3. Have the equity interventions generated by the Equity Strategy reached those children that need them most
and at the right time in terms of facilitating access, participation and learning?
Timeliness of the Equity Strategy
56. The implementation plan for the Consolidated Equity Strategy for 2015/16 envisioned initially to roll
out the District Equity Strategies (including targeted interventions) for 25 districts, through a phase-
wise approach:
- 5 districts rollout in 2016/17,
- 10 districts in 2017/18
- all 25 districts in the third year of rollout 2018/19.
As of 2021, the strategy is being rolled out in 15 districts as described in this report.
57. The index was developed in 2014, however it was only approved in 2016. As described later in this
report the development and validation of the ESIPs took more time than anticipated because of the
complex governance and sanitary context.
58. Internal factors that contributed to delay the implementation are: staff turnover, capacity gaps in
planning and overstretched staff slowing down the process. In some cases, the LGs had to send
47
back part of the funds to the central level as they did not have sufficient capacity to implement the
planning process itself. The transition to federalism required a complete and time-consuming
recalculation of the Equity Index as well as rethinking of the implementation plans. COVID led to
closing schools for 9 months with massive impact on the ES implementation.
Geographical Reach
59. The roll out of the strategy is at the initial stage with 40 LGs in the final stages of developing
their plans out of 753. According to the KIIs, only few LGs started the implementation of
their plans, although LGs authorities interviewed during the evaluation shared that they are
confident that they can conduct the planned activities in the coming months.
60. Respondents interviewed during the evaluation indicated that beside the 15 focused districts of
supported interventions (government, UNICEF through WE), orientation and dissemination
of Equity Strategy was also organized in Province 2, 5, 6 and 7 indicating some level of reach
beyond 15 focus districts.
Thematic Reach
61. Without going into impact assessment that is not formally included in this evaluation, our analysis
shows that the ES was concomitant with an increase in schooling (average annual growth of NER
in upper basic, reduction in the number of OoSC), notably more marked in the 5 districts initially
selected trough the EI. However, it is highly likely that children on the margins of marginalization,
such as children with disabilities, have not benefited to the same extent from this new enrolment
drive. (See annex 4 of this evaluation report for more information)
A decrease in survival rates is observed in districts that have experienced recent rapid
increases in enrolment. These considerations linked to the demand for education of discriminated
groups deserve specific studies which could explain the rationality of their decision to leave the
school system prematurely. On the national labor market, field interviews suggest that opportunities
for unskilled jobs abroad directly compete with the highly uncertain benefits expected from a longer
stay in school .
62. Early years and improved access to ECEC are widely considered as key to promote equity in
education. UNICEF and our findings indicate that only limited activities took place in the context of
the rolling out of the ESIPs in relation to ECD interventions even though several ESIPs mentioned
ECD activities as their priorities. According to our KIIs, UNICEF is advocating for a mapping of ECD
facilities to have a better understanding of the coverage.
63. More information on the extent that the ES has reached its target group can be found in the
following section and in the section related to the effectiveness of the ES.
CONCLUSION R.3. Have the equity interventions generated by the Equity Strategy reached those children
that need them most and at the right time in terms of facilitating access, participation and learning?
Evaluative Judgement: The development of the index and the implementation of the ESIPs have been delayed due
to internal and external factors. Only few LGs have started to implement their ESIPs. Mother tongue curricula and
language of instruction need to be further stressed and prioritized when planning to support OOSC. The ES is
therefore a work in progress.
Time wise, the implementation of the ESIPs was delayed due to combined issues such as staff turnover, capacity
gaps in planning and overstretched staff. In some cases, and despite the relevant support provided by UNICEF, the
LGs had to send back part of the funds to the central level as they did not have sufficient capacity to implement the
planning process itself. External factors falling clearly outside the scope of the ES, such as the transition to federalism
and the COVID-19 situation, largely contributed to the delays. COVID closed schools for 9 months so had a massive
impact on the ES implementation as far as school-based measures are concerned.
48
The roll out of the strategy is therefore at its initial stage, with 40 LGs in the final stages of developing their plans out
of 753. Only few LGs started the implementation of their plans, although LGs authorities interviewed during the
evaluation shared that they are confident that they can conduct the planned activities in the coming months.
The rationale for the development of the ES was also to strengthen the overall dynamic of the system through a
comprehensive set of activities addressing equity issues for specific marginalised groups of children. This report
shows that this aim is very much a work in progress as there are many rooms for improvements. Coordination with
NSA contributing the strategy was not systematic, and in many cases, measures planned were rather general and
focused on access (enrolment campaigns, infrastructure) and participation (meals, hygiene products), thus failing to
capture the diversity of drivers of inequity. The evaluation team did not identify measures actually addressing learning
needs.
Overall, a review of the work conducted by NGOs in the 15 focused districts of the ES found that the impact of
language is inconsistently considered as an important component in project or program design. Mother tongue
curricula and language of instruction need to be further stressed and prioritized when planning to support OOSC
1.6 Linkage of the Strategy with multi-sectoral responses
R.4 To what extend the strategy has Sub Question R 4.1: Has the implementation of the ES, through the
leveraged multi-sectoral responses (so introduction of the equity index or equity strategy implementation plans
including linkage to sanitation, prompted cross sectoral communication, coordination, or collaboration
nutrition, health, protection, etc.) at federal, provincial and/or local governments
64. At local level, main contributions for the design of the LG plans seem to have come from the
education staff, municipal and wards level staff. In some cases, school principals were also part of
a three-member committee to develop the plan.
65. At municipality and Provincial levels, Social Development Section and Ministry of Social
Development are responsible for overall social development (health, education, women and
children, protection) issues. These units/departments at Municipality and MoSD were
involved in the ESIPs preparation. Some education officers interviewed mentioned cross-
sectoral consultations, for example with the health department, although not always
reported in the written ESIPs documents.
‘’While making the plan, all departments should have been involved. People from education, health sector, livelihood, protection are related
with children. There was a talk on keeping these people while making the plan but the entire role was given to the focal education person in all
the municipalities.‘’ KII with World Education staff.
‘’There is agriculture division, employment division, health division which should have been connected with education. Now, in municipality
there is household income programs. They should have focused on education and launched program but there has been no active collaboration
between these different divisions till now. ‘’ KII with one LG education officer.
66. The LGs did not involve non-state actors in the design of the ESIPs to a wide extent, with some
remarkable exceptions (some local NGOs mentioned few times). ESIPs often failed to capture the
diversity of actors and interventions contributing to equity at local level in a context where reporting
mechanisms are still weak and inadequate to the new federal structure.
‘’We have been working with our existing partners UNICEF, VSO, etc. For the past twenty two years, JJYC has been working with 30 partners
like government, INGOs, UNDP, USAID and have completed 45 projects. ‘’ ‘Nobody has talked to us about the equity strategy or the ESIPs.
However, our focus is on equity and inclusive related programs.’’ KII with a Non state actor
‘’We have allocated 37 lakh 88 thousand rupees for electricity, drinking water, building toilets, conducting extra-curricular activities and teaching
learning materials. This money is provided to spend for 47 community schools. So this has helped to address equity and we have also invested
in classroom strengthening. For fixing fan or other appliances, painting, girl-friendly classroom, the municipality has supported. We also conduct
awareness programs. Day lunch covered under the conditional grants. ‘’ KII with LG education officer.
49
67. Outside of the ESIPs, the evaluation team observed many evidences of joint programming at school
level involving the government and non-state actors. Below and example of such collaboration.
‘’Scholarship, free lunch and free books distribution programs are provided by government of Nepal. NGO provides some support to build
toilets, taps. EGR (Early Grade Reading) program collaborate with local authorities as well as our school and WFP. INGO is also helping to
provide access to free lunch to students. The lunch expenses till now are supported only by WFP not by the government of Nepal.‘’ KII with LG
education officer
68. At federal level, the Equity and Inclusive Education sub-Technical Working Group offered
opportunities for cross-sectoral dialogue. Attendees were generally from the following
Organisations: CEHRD, MoEST/VSO, UNICEF, embassy of Finland, Norway, WFP, Kathmandu
University, Humanity and Inclusion, DFID, save the Children, Plan International and the World
Bank. But despite some initiatives to address issues such as WASH or gender-based violence at
school, the ES did not lead to intensified cross-sectoral coordination.
Sub Question R4.2: To what extent have cross-sectoral issues related to geographical location, mother tongue
and disability been reflected and accommodated in the implementation of the ES?
Overview of the activities effectively implemented through the ESIPs
69. According to the CEHRD report 202050, in 2016/17, the five districts51 identified by the Equity Index
received extra funding to run targeted interventions to reduce the number of out-of-school children.
The interventions promoted participation in school and non-formal learning. According to the Out
Of Schools reports, these plans include guidelines and non-formal education (NFE) packages for
5–12 year-old out-of-school children, special packages for children with disabilities and working
youth, and bridge courses for re-entry into formal education (Door-to-door visits, media
campaigns...)
70. As shared previously, only few LGs have started to implement their ESIPs. As implemented
activities have not been reported by the LGs, we can only mention here the ESIPs’ activities
implemented in Sayal municipality and Rajpur (2 out of the 6 municipalities covered by this
evaluation who reported some activities). Interventions included: ECD expansion and capacity
development of ECD facilitators and learning materials for ECD programs in Sayal and in Rajpur
Municipality: household data collection to identify OoSC.(Rajpur)
71. As reported to the evaluation team by LGs, alongside the budget and programme under SSDP,
additional funds were also made available through CEHRD to enabling local governments to design
and implement the equity strategy including:
▪ Household surveys to collect statistics on out-of-school children
▪ Organisation of workshops to understand the Equity Index score of the local government and
linked to this the drivers of disparities and composition of the out of school children in the
municipality.
▪ Monitoring of the enrolment and retention of out-of-school children and report this in EMIS.
72. Some LGs and schools reported some equity focused interventions but were not clear if it was
funded under the ESIPs or as part of the regular education support program. They mentioned the
distribution of free textbooks, scholarships and provision of mid-day meals in the targeted districts,
as well as local advocacy and awareness campaigns, with household visits being understood as
an effective strategy to increase participation as well as enrolment. Similarly, incentives to students

51 These districts were Rautahat, Sarlahi, Mahottari, Parsa and Bara
50
were provided based on the number of students captured from Flash Reports to encourage and
retain them in schools with uneven success as described below.
‘’The support from local authorities as well as from government does have some positive impact in regular attendance as well as enrolment of
students. The sanitary pads are supported from primary health center and municipality education section. The problem is that the allocated
budget for the ongoing program is insufficient; i.e. The books provided by the government are scarce and there is a problem of transportation
with the books (using mules or donkeys to carry them) which results in delay of distribution of the books to students. The expense for the load to
carry is supported by schools and isn’t supported by the government.’’ KII with SMC chair of an High school.
‘’Nearby there are Dalit settlement. Parents come to enrol without children. Later the students do not appear in the classes; students from class
4 & 5 go to India to earn money which is totally supported by parents. For such we have decided to provide allocated free curriculum books and
scholarship directly to students when they come to school, not to their parents. We have problems as students do enrol but never attend classes
but are present only to pass the exams. As per the girl student they hesitate to attend classes during their menstruation. We have some problems
regarding management of toilets and drinking water but we do provide sanitary pads. Our school provides scholarships for Dalits which is
supported by the government of Nepal.’’
‘’ Initially there was a program when 4 girls are enrolled they would get 4 packets of oils. But now parents normally start to enrol their child from
age of 3-4yrs. But they do not encourage them to continue to higher grades (e.g. Class 6) they rather choose to earn money in India and do not
attend the final exams. Those students who fail grade exam or are absent for a long time due to seasonal migration for work, see their friends in
higher grades and are demotivated to repeat the grade’’ KII with a teacher of lower secondary level
Extent to which geographical location, mother tongue and disability been reflected and
accommodated in the implementation of the ES.
73. Following the development and implementation of the ESIPs, there has not been any monitoring
and progress reports to appreciate the status and quality of these interventions. It was therefore
difficult for the evaluation team to assess fully and quantitatively if cross-sectoral issues related to
geographical location, mother tongue and disability have been effectively reflected and
accommodated in the implementation of the ES. To bridge this gap, we identified information in the
desk review and the KIIs, pertaining to some more salient dimensions of inequity, but this
information may not always be specific to the 15 focused districts, as per below:
Multilingual education
74. The inclusion of multilingual considerations into ESIPs has been affected by an unclear status of
the multilingual education strategy52 and uneven support for mother tongue-based education
among teachers and parents.
A report prepared for VSO Nepal and the Language Commission of Nepal found that there is a “reasonable degree of support
for mother tongue-based education among teachers and parents” (Fillmore, 2019). In the study, teachers and parents were
positive about mother tongue instruction and believed mother tongue instruction helped students learn more quickly
(Fillmore, 2019). An exception to this were Temal parents, with only half preferring their children learn in the mother tongue
first (Fillmore, 2019). Despite feeling positive about mother tongue instruction, many felt they did not have the resources or
skills to fully teach in the variety of mother tongue languages, and would not be able to create their own materials (Fillmore,
2019; Ranabhat et al, 2018, World Education, 2016).
The Curriculum Development Centre has developed primary school textbooks and supplementary reading materials in 22
languages (UNESCO 2020). Given that Nepali is spoken as a first language by at least 45% of households, and a further
33% of the population speak one of the other ten most common languages as their first language,53 it should be possible, in
theory, to provide mother tongue medium education for most of the population using the materials developed so far. Data
from the 2019 MICS (GoN 2019) indicate that the language used at school is the same as the language used at home for
most (60%) children, but this is not the case for a large minority nationwide and for most children in Province 2, where the
language used at school is the home language for only 39% of 7-14 year olds.
There are constraints on the supply side in terms of a shortage of qualified teachers fluent in some minority languages, and
resourcing challenges to providing mother tongue education in school communities where there are multiple languages
spoken. A further barrier to the implementation of mother tongue education is the popular demand for English medium
education. This may be driven by a prevailing misconception that learning in English medium from an early grade is the most

51
effective way to learn English, and a false association of English medium education with quality education, an association
that is difficult to shift given that the Institutional (private) schools are predominantly English medium and generally perform
better on learning assessments.
Multilingual education is mostly an issue to be tackled at national level, and fully considered within JRM meetings. The 2018
JRM Annual meeting minutes recommend a policy position paper be commissioned on how English as a subject versus as
a language of instruction would be best oriented to provinces, including recommendations for local governments on how to
integrate English as a subject as part of education services (JRM AM, 2018, Annex 5).

2020
75. A closer look at the sample of ESIPs made available for this evaluation, indicates that some
activities were indeed included for teaching mother tongue and encourage children with special
abilities to access the schools with provision of ‘’unspecified materials’’ for children with special
abilities. For example, Lungri and Madhav Narayan Municipality Plans include activity to carry out
instructional Learning achievement activities in local languages by identifying children’s individual
potential but fall short in explaining how this will be done.: ‘’ Carrying out instructional activities in
local languages by identifying children’s individual potentials’’
76. Overall, a review of the work conducted by Non State actors in the 15 focused districts of the ES
found that the impact of language is inconsistently considered as an important component in project
or program design by Non State Actors, and more globally by LEGs. Mother tongue curricula and
language of instruction need to be further stressed and prioritized when planning to support OOSC
(World Education, 2016, p.15).
‘’We have not made any plans for linguistically diverse students because the budget was low and we couldn’t include a lot of things under our
low budget.’’ Source: KIIs with a LG education officer.
77. The question of multilingual education would undoubtedly deserve a more detailed analysis and
benchmark from other countries’ experiences to identify the most adapted leverages for action. The
existence of textbooks in national languages is not enough to build a multilingual education policy.
It supposes a relatively fine knowledge of existing linguistic areas, a minimum training of the
teachers responsible for it, a fine management of the teachers' allowances according to their
linguistic knowledge and finally an adaptation of curricula. Recommendations made by some
respondents (interviewed during this evaluation) to address language barriers is to raise awareness
of teachers on the importance of the issue and encourage them to use local resources from parent
and communities who are generally very supportive to promote their own cultures.54 Another
suggestion is to develop textbooks locally and promote good example on the importance of
teaching small children in their mother tongue language.
Disability inclusion
78. The global context of Nepalese education is not fully inclusive so far, and many children with
disabilities remain unattended. Important leverages have however been identified:
▪ Local authorities awareness: a study conducted with children, parents, teachers, head
teachers and local and district level authorities of 21 schools, observed that although 90.5%
(19) of the headteachers were aware that children with disabilities have rights to free education,
54 The USAID Early Grade Reading Program (EGRP) supports teachers with coaching and professional development, and provides
early grade reading instructional and supplementary reading material to schools. The program also builds the capacity of the
Government of Nepal to effectively deliver early grade reading services. EGRP engages local NGOs to work with school management
committees and parent-teacher associations to conduct reading awareness and advocacy campaigns and trainings. The program was
evaluated at midline, in 2018, and shows a large positive effect on reading outcomes among students for whom Nepali is their first
language and those who have a non-Nepali mother tongue.
52
87.5% (21) of the local level authorities were not aware of the rights of children with disabilities
related to education.55.
▪ Supply shortages: according to HI56, the Nepalese education system lacks teacher training on
disability, disability friendly infrastructures and Learning materials, even in special schools and
resource classrooms.
▪ Demand shortages: Research findings on barriers to education of CWDs released in 2014
showed that stigma and discrimination are common across caregiver and child interviews.
Many families believe that children with disabilities learn better in boarding schools or in
specialized institutions than in their care or in regular schools due to their limited capacity to
provide proper support.57
▪ Existing tested leverages: A 2018 study concluded that scholarships provided by the
Government for children with disabilities was one of the few to be considered, by teachers,
students and families, as relatively impactful 58. Some of the ESIP reviewed included such
provisions.
79. Nepal lacks accurate data about children with disability. For example, the UNICEF OSC-O study,
undertaken in 2016, found that about 30% of out of school children presented one or several
disabilities, while the 2018/2019 OoSC survey found that among the out of school children
(188,623) from the age group 3-18 years in the 15 targeted districts, a total 889 (0.5%) children
were reported as having some sort of disability. The HI study also found that available data largely
underestimate the prevalence of disability underlining also the problem of inadequate and inefficient
screening at school.
80. According to key respondent working in the inclusive education sector, none of the LGs have
implemented the full set of basic inclusive interventions such as disability-friendly educational
infrastructure and facilities, improved teacher training, flexible curriculum and organization of
awareness raising activities with parents for equal access to all. Respondents interviewed at field
level found that the Government provides resource class for children with disabilities as well as
hostel facilities. Teachers received a training on disability but this was done many years ago
sometimes back in 2010. ESIPs were not an occasion to update and/or further elaborate such
minimum standards.
81. Despite notable efforts to start finding children with disabilities, NSA and LGs work in the 15 focused
districts of the ES59 is insufficiently focused on projects to support children with disabilities to enrol
into mainstream, formal schooling and address disability-related barriers. (STC, 2016). Our review
of a sample of ESIPs show that the plans include mainly activities to address the physical
barriers of CWDs (Disability-friendly physical structures60, provision of assistive devices)
and to some extent communication barriers (provision of specific educational materials,
and encouragement to parents to bring differently able children to child development
centres). Other barriers for the inclusion of CWDs are not mentioned (Attitudinal, Policy,
Programmatic, Social, transportation).
82. Sometimes activities from the ESIPs are vaguely described and therefore poorly operational:
‘’Making special plans for children with different abilities and disabilities.’’ ;’’Always trying to make
schools disabled-friendly and child-friend/girl-child-friendly.’’

83. The MTR report briefing for the Equity and Inclusive Education mentioned that NASA 2017 results
raise concerns when it comes to equity in terms of learning outcomes. There are significant
differences based on ethnicity when it comes to results in Nepali, Math and Science:
Brahman/Chetri students perform significantly better in Math, Science and Nepali while Dalit
perform significantly worse than all others (page 57).
84. In Khajura municipality, we found that religious school (madarsa education) is provided maximum
up to the grade 5 which is an issue for the continuity of the education cycle.
’Even though children might be 15 years, they still study in grade 3. This is a problem. The challenge may be because we have not opened
such religious schools for grade 6,7,8 or 8,9,10.’’ KII with LG education officer
Geographical Location
85. Our review of NGOs interventions in the 15 focused districts of the ES61 showed that many NGOs
did not significantly increased their focus towards districts identified by the Equity Index analysis.
For instance, no reports were identified for either Rasuwa or Taplejung districts in 2019. As such,
the study recommended that further orientation on the EI and the need to target specific areas
where disparity is exceptionally high need to be communicated with the I/NGO community.
CONCLUSION R.4 To what extend the strategy has leveraged multi-sectoral responses (so including
linkage to sanitation, nutrition, health, protection, etc.)
Evaluative Judgement: Following the development and implementation of the ESIPs, there has not been any
monitoring and progress reports to appreciate the status and quality of these interventions. It was therefore difficult
for the evaluation team to capture fully and quantitatively the number of cross-sectoral issues effectively addressed.
Based on our discussions with the LGs we found that there has been limited multi sectoral responses and cross
collaboration between government departments. Nevertheless, the Equity and Inclusive Education sub-Technical
Working Group offered opportunities for cross-sectoral dialogue at federal level.
At municipality level and Provincial level, Social Development Section and Ministry of Social Development are
responsible for overall social development (health, education, women and children, protection) issues. These
units/departments at Municipality and MoSD were involved in ESIP preparation. Some education officers interviewed
mentioned cross-sectoral consultations, for example with the health department, although not always reported in the
written ESIPs documents. The potential for cross-sectoral collaboration during the analysis of the index result was
also underexploited in a context of unstable education planning capacity at LG level.
At federal level, the Equity and Inclusive Education sub-Technical Working Group offered opportunities for cross-
sectoral dialogue. Attendees were generally from the following Organizations: CEHRD, MoEST/VSO, UNICEF,
embassy of Finland, Norway, WFP, Kathmandu University, Humanity and Inclusion, DFID, save the Children, Plan
International and the World Bank. But despite some initiatives to address issues such as WASH or gender-based
violence at school, the ES did not lead to intensified cross-sectoral coordination.
A closer look at the sample of ESIPs made available for this evaluation, indicates that some activities were indeed
included for teaching mother tongue and encourage children with special abilities to access the schools. The plans
include activities to address the physical barriers of CWDs (Disability-friendly physical structures, provision of assistive
devices) and to some extent communication barriers (provision of specific educational materials, and encouragement
for parents to bring children to child development centres). Other barriers for the inclusion of CWDs are not mentioned
(Attitudinal, Policy, Programmatic, Social, transportation). But overall, we noted that interventions tended to focus on
“mainstream” leverages, and often failed to capture the ambitious and multisectoral information provided by the index
to formulate a multisectoral response.

1.7 Relevance of the ES to the context of COVID-19
R.5. To what extent is the Equity Strategy relevant in Sub question R5.1: Have there been attempts to align the
allowing the government to address the increase in implementation of the strategy to newly emerged needs in
disparities caused by the current COVID-19 context? the COVID-19 context?
86. In Nepal, from 3 January 2020 to 9 May 2021, there have been 385 890 confirmed cases of COVID-
19 with 3 632 deaths, reported to WHO. As of 28 April 2021, a total of 2 453 512 vaccine doses
have been administered. 62
87. The current set up of the Equity Index does not include learning outcomes (at least for now) and
as such has limited use to track the effects of the COVID-19. Future studies on the various pass
rates before and after COVID-19 will probably provide more useful information when examination
results are made available.
88. The desk review and KIIs did not yield much information in relation to the use of the ES (mainly the
EI and the ESIPs) in relation to the COVID situation. One of the reasons is that the federal
government disseminated an alternative learning strategy for the COVID context and this strategy
did not require the LGs to go through a planning process for its implementation.
89. Some informants interviewed mentioned attempts to strengthen WASH interventions in schools
during COVID time.
‘’In some schools, there is no water. In ESIP, we have made a plan to give budget to the schools to fit taps. These things are actually the work
of municipality. The municipality has allocated 1 crore for the education sector which is basically for salary. The municipality does not want to
spend on other things.’’ Source: KII with an Education Officer.
90. The impacts of the COVID-19 on children education are very much related to potential digital and
socio-economic divides and level of parents’ literacy to accompany their children while children are
studying at home. This means that marginalised children who have less access to ICT equipment
will most probably see a drop in their learning outcomes. This means that the ES needs to reflect
adequate focus on addressing the digital divide and equity-based appropriate use of technology in
education.
91. Some stakeholders met during the evaluation suggested that it was time to revisit the list of districts
produced by the Equity Index as the list may not reflect anymore the current level of disparities,
particularly in the COVID context.
CONCLUSION R.5. To what extent is the Equity Strategy relevant in allowing the government to address the
increase in disparities caused by the current COVID-19 context?
Evaluative Judgement: The Equity Strategy was not used much to address the increase in disparities caused by the
current COVID-19 context.
The current set up of the Equity Index does not include learning outcomes (at least for now) and as such has limited
use to track the effects of the COVID-19. Future studies on the various pass rates before and after COVID-19 will

C.1. The extent to which the C 1.2 Sub Question: What actors are involved in equity-based planning,
Equity Strategy contributed to programming, budgeting, implementation in the education sector?
increased coherent interventions C 1.3 Sub Question: How are/can these different actors engage, align, use the
with an equity focus in the equity strategy in their work?
education sector implemented C 1.4 Sub Question: Has this led to greater alignment among actors or with the
by non-governmental government planning process, increased need-based support, increased results,
organizations and development increased coverage, more efficient use of resources, increased coordination,
partners? etc?
92. In 2015, MoEST circulated a Consultation Guideline For Strengthening Equity in Access,
Participation and Learning Outcomes through Stakeholder Participation in the Education Sector in
Nepal. This was part of a campaign to disseminate the Equity Strategy and advocate CSOs to
mainstream the key elements of the strategy in their regular programming. Out-of-school children
reintegration led to improved coordination with 9 CSOs. Although the SSDP Mid Term Review 2019
found that the EI was not sufficiently used by I/NGOs when planning their interventions (i.e. most
disadvantaged districts not necessarily covered), the evaluation team identified some effects as
identified below.
93. A 2019 desk-based review63 of Non-State actors interventions targeting out of school children
(OOSC) in the 15 focus Districts of the ES seems to prove a relative prioritization of districts
selected through the Equity Index. In particular, not a single project was identified for engaging out
of school children in either Rasuwa or Taplejung, despite their poor performance. See annex 11 for
more details.
94. Our review of a sample list of ESIPs indicates that office-bearers of Equity Strategy Planning
Committees generally involved the following entities: Mayor, Deputy Mayor, Chief Administrative
Officer, Accountant, Learning Motivator, Education Asst Coordinator, technical Assistants,
computer Operator, Education Development and Coordination Unit, chairpersons of the wards. As
can be seen, other government departments or non-state actors do not seem to have been invited
to sit in the committee raising questions on the level of cross collaboration and coordination that
effectively took place to develop the plans. Lack of close collaboration with NGOs was also
exemplified by the limited information sharing between the Governments and NGOs as reported in
the 2020 DMS report.
95. During our field work, we found one rare case of collaboration and joint planning involving the
municipality and non-state actors during the design of the ESIP, unfortunately it seems that this
was an exception, based on the will of individual decision-makers. No evidence allows to confirm
that ESIPs had a structural effect on further CSO-LGs coordination and joint programming.
‘’There is a local NGO called Deaf Nepal who has mentoring program called Big Sister which takes all the muslim and madhesi children
who have been dropped out from school for any reasons. They taught them for 9 months non-formally. After attending the non-formal
education, the children have been given 3-4000 NPR on a monthly basis to attend the formal school. So while making ESIP plan, we
invited Deaf Nepal and we exchanged our ideas and incorporated those ideas in the plan, linked up all ideas.’’ KII with one LG officer

Government of Nepal, and supporting Development Partners. March 2019.

‘’ When human resource and management center provided us with guidelines, models and formats to design the ESIP plan, I had shared
with them that other NGOs were working on similar projects and if we collaborate with them then there would be more human resource
also and therefore we should work with them. If we look at schools of Khajura rural municipality, we see that on the same school CVIC
has also worked, CR Nepal has also worked on protection and reduction of early child marriage. Similarly Janajagaran Samudaya has
been working with 17 madarsha schools for equity. Plus, Deaf Nepal has been working on out of school children and how to bring them
to school, sustain them and bring good learning outcomes.’’ KII LG education officer
96. Below an example of joint collaboration on equity between a municipality and Non state Actors
addressing specific educational needs:
‘’Classroom management, teaching management, teaching through materials are equity related strategies. We have included equity
inclusive plan in our municipality. Under the RDC's (Rural Development Plan, a local NGO) plan, it is being implemented under UNICEF
and World Education's support in all twelve schools in this municipality. This is a grade one to three program where improving reading
level, creating educational environment, use of mother tongue, teaching in mother tongue are emphasized. For this, funding comes from
world education and UNICEF till now and on top of that municipality has also added money.’’ KII with a Learning Motivator.
97. Such integration could lead to updated lists of possible measures and nurture the relevance of
ESIPs as well as most efficient interventions related to identified barriers. A list is available in annex
7.64 The list is derived from the report: ‘’Review of non-state actors interventions on access and
retention for out of school children (Perry 2019)’’
C1.1 Sub Question: To what extent multi-sectoral equity interventions and social safety net programs that respond
to needs of children enabling them to access, participate and learn, have been driven by or established under the
Equity Strategy?
98. As described later in this report, the school meal program supported by WFP is also implemented
in the focus districts and the forthcoming GPE additional grant for COVID is also considering the
ranking of the EI for programming.
99. The GESI Analysis. Education Nepal-2020 shared that commitments at national level have, in many
cases translated into progressive implementation at local level, especially where the government
has been directly supported by international donors, UN agencies and INGO/NGOs as described
below:
’We have been working on early grade learning for grade 1-3 children which has been running in 4 municipalities for the past one/one and a half
years. We have also started this in other 4 municipalities just recently. Under this program, we give training to teachers of grade 1-3 on how to
manage classroom, how to deal with children with disability and manage classroom for betterment of education. We gave a basic training of 5
days to teachers on how to manage the seating arrangement for slow learners, Children with hearing impairment , how to teach them. Similarly,
we made plan in municipality and we have asked principals to make a plan. We have also been lobbying by going to the households and raising
awareness of parents to bring them to schools’’ KII with staff from WE
CONCLUSION C.1. The extent to which the Equity Strategy contributed to increased coherent interventions
with an equity focus in the education sector implemented by non-governmental organizations and
development partners?
Evaluative Judgement: Non-governmental organizations and development partners were more engaged in the Equity
Strategy agenda at National level and less at sub national level. Non State Actors did implement some equity focused
interventions but were not involved much in the development and implementation of the ESIPs driven by the LGs.
In 2015, MoEST (NCE) circulated a Consultation Guideline For Strengthening Equity in Access, Participation and
Learning Outcomes through Stakeholder Participation in the Education Sector in Nepal. The evaluation found that if
many cases Non-State Actors contributed to the OoSC survey, supported the back to school campaign and
implemented equity focused interventions. However, their involvement in the design and planning phases of the ESIPs
was minimal and they did not systematically participate in the discussion around the ESIPs at LG level.
64 Source: Review of non-state actors interventions on access and retention for out of school children (Perry 2019)
57
In term of synergies with other programs, as described later in this report, the school meal program supported by
WFP is implemented partly in the focused districts and the forthcoming GPE additional grant for COVID is also
considering the ranking of the EI for programming.
In addition, the Equity Index has been used as one of many other criteria by several development partners: UNICEF,
EU, Finland, WB, GPE, DFID, USAID65 to target support or subscribe to results related to the implementation of the
ES. EU has included the use of the equity strategy in its CSO grant application window for example.
In terms of internal coherence, it was agreed in the SSDP MTR to embed the EI in EMIS in 2019 but this is yet to be
completed (currently the codes are being written into EMIS) due to the delay in mobilizing required technical
assistance (from EU/ADB).
One noticeable and positive example of integration is that within the context of the Global Partnership for Education
(GPE)66 to Nepal, the World Bank is also targeting part of its interventions in the 15 focused districts identified by the
EI.
The shift to federalism with competences at national and local levels still to be clarified also made it complicated to
ensure full coherence between ESIP and national funding allocation policy. Schools tend to receive the same amount
of funding but have disparities in term of capacities, and this important equity issue was not addressed as it does not
depend upon LGs.
2.2 Synergies of the Strategy with Education Policies & Programs
C.2. To what extent has the Equity Strategy been reflected in education sector programs and policies?
100. The Equity Strategy built on several existing frameworks related to both enrolment of OoSC and
improvement of learning environment and/or education quality:
▪ Basic Education Plan: for enrolment of Out of School children
▪ Welcome to School: School Enrolment Campaign Guidelines
▪ Child Friendly Schools National Framework: to enhance (P)MEC and CFS indicators
▪ School as a Zone of Peace Initiative
▪ Curriculum: Soft Skills and TVET
▪ Improvement programs following EGRA and EGMA
▪ Provision of Midday meals and Health Supplements
▪ Scholarship and Opportunities Guidelines (under revision)
101. The ES is reflected in the SSDP framework, notably DLI 6.
102. The Equity Index has been used as one of many other criteria by several development partners:
UNICEF, EU, Finland, WB, GPE, DFID, USAID67 to target support or subscribe to results related
to the implementation of the ES. EU has included the use of the equity strategy in its CSO grant
application window for example.
65 One of the reasons shared by USAID of not using the Equity Index to prioritize its programming was that the index did not include
learning outcomes and data related to disabilities. Nevertheless, USAID did use the ranking of LGs computed through the EI to select
its programming geographical areas for its COVID-19 response program.
66 The World Bank Group’s Nepal Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2019–2023 include a Focus Area 3 of enhancing inclusion
and resilience and an Objective 3.1 (improving equity in access to quality education).
67 One of the reasons shared by USAID of not using the Equity Index to prioritize its programming was that the index did not include
learning outcomes and data related to disabilities. Nevertheless, USAID did use the ranking of LGs computed through the EI to select
its programming geographical areas for its COVID-19 response program.
58
103. We could not find strong evidence of overlap between additional equity focused
interventions (ESIPs) and other equity-based interventions taken place in the same
locations to identify the possible synergies. Nevertheless, we were able to see some level of
synergies for 4 out of the 7 districts targeted for the Mid-Day meal Program68 supported by WFP
and 3 out of the 16 districts of the USAID Reading for All program as per the table provided in
annex 8.
104. The ES did not sufficiently take into considerations lessons learned from the Education Safe
School Safety framework. The proposed package of equity focused activities such as Gender and
social inclusion teacher, protection, disability, safe learning facilities, DRR, risk education have not
been integrated sufficiently in the ESIPs while programming multi-level interventions.
105. The Equity Strategy itself, which looks like more as a policy document, is struggling to be
implemented (in the LGs that implement ESIPs) because of the lack of capacity at LGs level in the
context of the transition to the new Federalism structure. Also, the unspecific nature of measures
proposed in the ESIPs are not clearly aligned with the annex of the ES that has a menu of
specific actions/ targeted interventions. Also, the ES lacks a roadmap and a costed
implementation plan.
106. More information can be found later in this report in relation to the use of the ES for the selection
of programs. See section related to Sub question EFFE 5.1: What was the rationale/justification for
selecting the interventions?
Sub question C 2.1: To what extent has the ES guided the strategies in the SSDP and to what extent was its
operationalization facilitated through its program implementation guidelines and in the annual strategic
implementation plans and annual work plans and budgets?
107. As part of the support provided to the LGs, CEHRD prepared a LG-ESIP guidelines and tools to
support them with the planning stages.
‘’The guideline provided by CEHRD helped us because that guideline provided an outline for what to include, what title to keep which helped us
in writing. World Education had given us a budget of 30 thousand rupees while writing.’’ KIIs with one Education Officer
108. We found that if the guideline is clear about the various steps needed to prepare the ESIPs and
on how to identify the data for the analysis of the education issues in the municipality, it felt short
of providing clear and detailed instructions on how to develop the plan. (beside a list of potential
activities that could be developed to address equity disparities). Also, the section 2.5 related to
monitoring was not properly translated into monitoring plans and framework in the sample of ESIPs
that we reviewed.
109. One issue reported is that the funding allocated to the LGs came as a lumpsum with budget
heading not always identified for equity-based interventions. Therefore, the LGs could use this
budget for other education needs than the activities implemented in the ESIPs. This has caused
problem for the LGs to clearly link the funding with their ESIPs. This means that it is difficult to
standardize the implementation of a national policy across LGs since LGs don’t seem to be held
accountable for the ESIPs and can repurpose funds received for equity interventions. This is an
important issue which in itself drives inequity. The inequity in capacity across LGs, unequal use of
ESIPs, leads to inequitable focus on equity.
‘’The budget come under the same basket and the chief administrator doesn't know the headings, like in one heading, there are 8/9 subtitles and
we do not know under which one is ESIP. So, if the education section tells what money to be used in which title, the spending would be accordingly
otherwise by mistake one money might be used for another purpose.’’ KII with a LG education officer
68 7 districts for the WFP Mid-Day meal program in Darchula, Bajhan, Bajura, Achham, Doti, Jajarkot and Dailekh.
59
110. With the transition to federalism, and new funding and budgeting responsibilities given to the LGs,
some respondents suggested that to be effective, equity should be mainstreamed not only in the
education plan but also in the overall Palikas annual plans. The advantage of this would be that
equity will then be more likely included also in other sectors such as WASH and health69 for
examples.
Sub Question C 2.2: To what extent is the implementation of the ES monitored in terms of the inclusion of indicators
in the SSDP program result framework (including DLIs), integration of the Equity Index in the EMIS and in sector
progress and status reports
111. The Equity Index and Grants/ESIP system adopts a multidimensional approach to exclusion, but
there remain few explicit interventions to address and monitor progress, beyond efforts to reduce
the number of out of school children. Indicators in the results framework of the SSDP do not always
include the level of disaggregation required to monitor the impact of those efforts meant to reduce
exclusion, and some indicators tracking progress among the most disadvantaged populations had
not been updated at the midterm review stage.
112. As shared earlier in this report the TWG on equity and inclusion highlighted the need for more
gender disaggregation of SSDP targets and that SSDP Programme and Results Framework (PRF)
indicators need to be further disaggregated by caste/ethnicity. See below, Gender disaggregated
targets yet to be applied for the following Programme and Results Framework (PRF) indicators.
(As per the proposal from the TWG in April 2019)
DLIS and equity
113. Lessons learned from the ES were translated into the SSDP framework: DLI 6 on OOSC explicitly
linked to equity, and DLI 7 focus on pro-poor scholarship scheme for secondary level.70 However,
other DLIs within the SSDP also have implications for its equity, and DLI 6 and 7 only refer to a
limited approach of equity in terms of access. They do not refer to equity through the learning
dimension, and therefore fail to capture equity as the capacity for the education system to provide
equal learning opportunities to all students.
69 Both sectors should contribute strongly to advance the education and equity agenda through provision of health and wash
facilities and services in schools.
70 Pro-poor targeted scholarship (PPTS) and pro-science scholarship (PSS) schemes that includes targeted interventions for
increasing girls’ participation in science subjects in G11 and 12.
60
114. As these DLI make up a significant proportion of the overall funds particularly for investment in
the sector, the allocation for these indicators could make a difference to the overall equity of sector
expenditure and directly address educational needs of vulnerable children in their school
environment.
115. One noticeable and positive example of integration is that within the context of the Global
Partnership for Education (GPE)71 to Nepal, the World Bank is also targeting part of its interventions
in the 15 focused districts identified by the EI. The World Bank considers five key performance
indicators (KPIs) including Indicator 4: NER in basic and secondary education in 15 most
disadvantaged districts as ranked in the equity index (disaggregated by gender)72.
Integration of the Equity Index in EMIS
116. It was agreed in the SSDP MTR to embed the EI in EMIS in 2019 but this is yet to be completed
(currently the codes are being written into EMIS) due to the delay in mobilizing required technical
assistance (from EU/ADB). Although this is still a work in progress, because of the importance of
EMIS for the EI, the evaluation team looked for information related to the functioning of the EMIS
as described below.
117. Integration of EI into EMIS is also made complex by the shortcomings of the EMIS identified in
early 2016, currently under consideration73:
Main issues found with the EMIS data
▪ Quality (Some inconsistency& incompleteness)
▪ Timeliness (some delay on reporting)
▪ Availability (well managed DBs)
▪ Coverage (NFE, HSEB and other DBs)
▪ Verification and Validation
▪ Linking EMIS with planning and monitoring at all levels
▪ Duplication in collection
▪ Difficult to address the expectations of all stakeholders (disaggregated information)
▪ Limitation of Resource, Skill Manpower, Physical facilities
‘’EMIS is filled by an appointed computer teacher by the municipality. EMIS is useful for schools and even parents are aware about it. And if it isn’t
updated then they come to remind us that their child should be listed in EMIS in a fear that they would be devoid of scholarships provided by
schools. So parents enquire about their child's name being included in the EMIS list regularly but they do not relate it to the regularity in attendance
of their child.’’
KII with a school teacher
118. The issues identified above were echoed by the USAID education sector analysis 2020 report
that shared the following points pertaining to the EMIS.
IEMIS data are routinely used for decision making at the school, local, and central levels, particularly on issues related
to equity. School data play a major role in monitoring SSDP activities, and local governments and SMCs use the data for making
a range of decisions, such as allocating scholarships (Bessières et al. 2019; Magrath and Torrano 2020). More than 90 percent of
schools in the country reported data in the 2018/2019 Flash I report, with the remaining schools expected to report in the Flash II
report (Bessières et al. 2019). To ease dissemination, the platform allows users at all three levels of government to access the
71 The World Bank Group’s Nepal Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2019–2023 include a Focus Area 3 of enhancing inclusion
and resilience and an Objective 3.1 (improving equity in access to quality education).
72 Progress of this indicator was assessed as ‘’mixed’’ end of 2020. NER in basic education is below year 3 target whereas NER in
secondary surpassed the year 3 target.

data.74 When developing the SSDP Annual SIP and the Annual Work Plan, CEHRD uses the index to develop need-based
interventions, such as providing school meals.
Local governments provide essential assistance with IEMIS to schools, but capacity issues can hinder this effort. Many schools,
even those with an Internet connection, struggle to use IEMIS—about 80 percent of basic and lower secondary schools and 20
percent of secondary schools lack the capacity to use the platform (Bessières et al. 2019). The government has provided guidance
to help schools, but the extent to which schools use this guidance is unknown (British Council 2020). To address the issue, CEHRD
has developed cluster systems, where a high-capacity school can help other schools use the platform. However, this can divert
staff in the high-capacity school from other activities. Schools often send data directly to local governments and EDCUs, either
electronically or in hard copy. Yet these stakeholders themselves may lack the resources to subsequently report the data to the
central level, which results in delays in publishing the Flash reports (Flash Report 1 2019-2020; Bessières et al. 2019). To aid both
local governments and schools, MoEST has recommended to first train IEMIS officers at the provincial level, who can then train
officers at the local level. Local officers can subsequently work with schools to submit data using the web-based platform.
Concerns about data quality. (…)
The midterm review of the SSDP and Nepal’s development partners have called for strengthening quality of IEMIS data,
as well as clarifying responsibilities of different levels of government in the absence of District Education Offices (JRM
2018; Magrath and Torrano 2020).
119. The SSDP review report shared that while the Program Result Framework (PRF) includes targets
regarding the number of students or schools benefitting from dedicated grants, the indicators to
monitor whether these inputs have been effectively transformed into results (i.e. the number of
schools reaching the minimum enabling conditions or percentage of targeted students
enrolled/retained) are not calculated.
CONCLUSION C.2 To what extent has the Equity Strategy been reflected in education sector programs and
policies?
Evaluative Judgement: The Equity Strategy has partly been reflected in education sector programs and policies.
The Equity Strategy built on several existing frameworks relating to both enrolment of OoSC and improvement of
learning environment and/or education quality. The Equity Index has been used as one of many other criteria by
several development partners: UNICEF, EU, Finland, WB, GPE, DFID, USAID to target support or subscribe to results
related to the implementation of the ES. Nevertheless, we could not find strong evidence of overlap between additional
equity focused interventions (ESIPs) and other equity-based interventions taken place in the same locations to identify
the possible synergies.
We found that if the implementation guideline is clear about the various steps needed to prepare the ESIPs, it felt
short of providing clear and detailed instructions on how to develop the plan. Also, the ESIPs were not accompanied
with monitoring plans and framework.
It is difficult to standardize the implementation of a national policy across LGs since LGs don’t seem to be held
accountable for the ESIPs and can repurpose funds received for equity interventions. This is an important issue which
in itself drives inequity. The inequity in capacity across LGs, unequal use of ESIPs, leads to inequitable focus on
equity.
Indicators in the results framework of the SSDP do not always include the level of disaggregation required to monitor
the impact of those efforts meant to reduce exclusion, and some indicators tracking progress among the most
disadvantaged populations had not been updated at the midterm review stage.
One missing area for ES reflection is – SDG4: Education 2030 Nepal National Framework for action.
74 National-level users can view data from schools within all 753 local governments, provincial-level users can view data from
schools within their province, and local-level users can view data from schools within their municipality.

3. Effectiveness of the Equity Strategy
3.1 Capacity of the Strategy to leverage additional funds
EFFE.1. Has the Equity Strategy EFFE 1.1 Sub Question: To what extent has the Equity Strategy
contributed to increased needs-based been able to leverage additional funds (earmarked, non-earmarked,
government and non-state actors funding on/off budget, to government, to stakeholders, etc.) for equity-based
in the Nepal school education sector? interventions that were not initially planned by other interventions?
120. The decentralization process, started with budget year 2017-18 and became effective in 2018-
19, has changed funding mechanisms, with consequences on reporting processes and the
availability of financial data. The majority of SSDP funding is now channelled to local governments
under a set of conditional grants provided from the federal budget. In addition, provincial and local
governments get non-earmarked resources from revenue-sharing mechanisms and equalization
grants and could spend part of this on education activities. CEHRD estimates that expenditure for
school education from PGs’ and LGs’ own resources represents 12% of provincial equalization
grants and 6% of local equalization grants75. Only conditional grants are identified as education
within the GoN budget.
121. Across Nepal, at local level a school’s budget is calculated using a per capita formula. This
allocation is the same for all students across the country, so each school receives its budget based
on the number of children enrolled, without taking any equity factors into account. Such a flat
allocation mechanism is not compatible with the ambitions of the Equity Strategy, and international
knowledge base in equity in education, considering that “schools with larger shares of
disadvantaged students require additional investments in human and material resources” (OECD,
2019). For example, a very remote school may need to provide food for the students at lunchtime.
In an area in which incomes are low or unpredictable, the local community may not be able to
provide additional supplies or resources required for teaching and learning..76
122. Based on the equity index, 15 of the 75 previous districts were identified in 201677, converged to
186 out of the total 753 local governments. These districts, and later local governments, were
selected for receiving additional budget and technical assistance for identification and execution of
targeted interventions based on the analysis of dominant drivers of composite equity index at
district level. The ongoing integration of the EI in the Government’s Education Monitoring
Information System (EMIS) has begun to support the Government in targeting equity-based
allocations within the Annual Strategic Implementation Plans/Annual Work Plans and Budgets
(ASIPs/AWPBs). The government mobilizes human resources and additional funds, UNICEF
provides technical assistance through World Education (i.e. experts, facilitation of meetings, etc.)
and through earmarked budget support.
123. In 2016/17, the five districts identified by the Equity Index received extra funding to run targeted
interventions to reduce the number of out-of-school children. 78 Similarly, in 2017/18, the five
districts that ranked from sixth to tenth79 were provided with such funding to run targeted
interventions. 33

124. In 2017/18, the CEHRD allocated NPR 34,700 million (around 300,000 USD) 80 to the 10 targeted
districts to spend on returning out-of-school children to education. According to the 2017-2018
status report, each district was finally allocated an amount of NPR 1.5 million (13,200 USD). 81.
This budget was provided as conditional grant linked to the requirement of LGs to ensure
identification and sustainable enrolment of out of school children. LGs were instructed through the
EDCUs using the Government’s SSDP Program Implementation Manual82 (PIM) on how to utilize
this grant in support of their efforts towards enrolment of out of school children.
125. In 2018/19, additional funds were provided to local governments instead of provinces and the
local governments that are within the previous district boundaries of district eleventh to fifteenth. 83.
The number of newly established local governments within the previous fifteen districts amounts to
189 municipalities from which 80 LGs are being supported with equity-based interventions.
126. For the Year 2019/2020, the additional funding formula was revised to include for the first time an
equity-based formula84 and to provide a Grant for enrolment and retention of OOSC to selected
LGs for a total amount of NPR 29,984 million (around 257,000 USD).85 This represents an
insignificant amount if we compared this figure with the NPR 98,458,535 million (around 844
Millions of USD) of the total School Sector Development Plan Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer to
LGs for Conditional Grants during the same year.86 As indicated in the RBF report, DLI 6 received
just USD 0.3 million allocated in 2019/20, compared to the average value of the DLIs over the five-
year period of the SSDP of USD 24 Million.
127. The year 2019/20 included the first equity-based allocations, (rolled over into 2020/21 due to the
delays in service implementation caused by the pandemic) of selected municipalities to develop
their local level equity strategy implementation plans (ESIPs) with the support of the GPE Education
Sector Program Development Grant (ESPDG) managed by UNICEF. UNICEF aligned the use of
some the ESPDG funds available to strengthen local level planning capacity to mobilize the
Technical Adviser that supported the federal government in the induction and follow up of the
targeted local governments for the development of their ESIP.
‘’The budget for this year for Barekot district is Rs. 5 lakhs (4,300 USD) under ESIP. This amount is provided to local levels by the
government. The technical support was provided by CEHRD. WE also provided Rs 60000.(500 USD)’’ KII with LG education officer
128. Additional amounts have been provided for the targeted districts and a funding formula has been
used recently, nevertheless, it has not yet resulted into a shift in equity based financing as
mentioned by some respondents. Majority of the funding (mainly from the Government) available
for the local Governments (grants) and children (Scholarship) remain not tied to an equity agenda.
129. At first, the LGs did not know how best to use the additional funds they received, they also did not
have earmarked funds to be able to conduct the participatory planning process and also the timing
of the planning for the ESIPs was not aligned with the planning cycle of the Government. For the
80 Equivalent to 297,874 USD (exchange rate as of 29012021). Source: CEHRD, Out of school report, Jan 2020
81 Other sources of information indicated that at the end, the government allocated some funds to the districts but the amount was
unevenly spread across districts with some districts receiving 16,000 USD while other only 2,000 USD for the implementation of their
equity based interventions.
82 Due to the transition period, there was no mechanism in place for the federal government to support the Municipal WASIP/AWPBs
for the year 2017/18. As the Equity Strategy Implementation Plans (ESIPs) were envisioned to be developed as a chapter of these
local plans and budgets, the section in the SSDP PIM served as the ESIP outline for the year 2017/18.

these municipalities using a formula that includes a fixed tranche (base amount) which is the same for all municipalities to ensure a
volume that allows municipalities to utilize this and a variable tranche that determines their share of the overall funds based on their
prevalence (number of out of school children), severity (equity index score), and performance (reduction against their baseline in the
previous year(s)

Some sources indicated that this amount is around 1 million USD. Unfortunately we did not receive confirmation of the amount

first years, through its partnership with UNICEF, WE provided a lumpsum of 900 USD for each LGs
for planning purposes.
130. There are several types of education grants in Nepal. Local Governments are receiving funds
from the federal government, both conditional grants earmarked for specific purposes, and non-
earmarked funding through revenue sharing, equalization grants, special grants, and matching
grants. The Conditional Grants are the only ones managed by the Ministry of Education while the
equalization grants are managed by the Ministry of Finance and are not tied. Some stakeholders
met during the evaluation suggested to include the formula of the Equity Index into existing formulas
of the equalization grants. The idea would be to use the grants to incentivize the LGs to achieve
better equity results in the education sector. Knowing that the equalization grant is a multisector
grant, it may be difficult to implement as several Ministries would need to be consulted to revise
the formula of the equalisation grant .
CONCLUSION EFFE.1. Has the Equity Strategy contributed to increased needs-based government and non-
state actors funding in the Nepal school education sector?
Evaluative Judgement:
Based on the ranking of the Equity index, districts and later local governments received additional budget and
technical assistance for identification and execution of targeted interventions. Starting from 2016/2017, additional
funding was transferred to the local Governments to implement their ESIPs. It is only in 2019/2020 that the additional
funding formula was revised to include for the first time an equity-based formula87. The evaluation team found that if
this was a good step in the right direction to ensure better equity-based allocation, nevertheless, it has not yet
resulted into a shift in equity-based financing. Available funding (mainly from the Government) for local
Government (grants) and children (Scholarship) remains mainly untied to an equity agenda. Funds transferred to the
LGs were limited and remained targeted to the 15 selected districts.
Some issues were reported at LG level where the amount transferred from the central level was not clearly identified,
thus forcing the education officers at LG level to negotiate their access to equity-based funding with the chief
administrators with some difficulties.
3.2 Effects of increased funding on disparities
EFFE 2. In the case of increased needs-based funding Sub question EFFE 2.1: Have these additional resources
and/or resource mobilized by non-state actors, has this led to improving the education outcomes for children?
led to a reduction of disparities in education outcomes
between children that are/were based on their gender, Sub Question EFFE 2.2: Has increased funding led to

status, vulnerability or a combination of these?
131. Due to unavailability of precise government level financial information on the budget that LGs
have received as an equalization grant for each of the 15 focused districts and because of the
design itself of the evaluation (that is mainly a process-based evaluation and not an impact
evaluation), we do not intend to relate reduction of disparities in education outcomes with increased
needs-based funding in the present report. The following section has attempted rather to describe
the main status of DLI 6 and DLI 7 (that are important proxy indicators of the ES) without linking
their results to specific funding streams. We also attempted to provide an overall perspective of the
effects of two Equity-focus schemes, namely the scholarship and the mid-day meals programs.
87 The lump sum that is allocated for supporting municipalities that have been identified through the equity index is allocated across
these municipalities using a formula that includes a fixed tranche (base amount) which is the same for all municipalities to ensure a
volume that allows municipalities to utilize this and a variable tranche that determines their share of the overall funds based on their
prevalence (number of out of school children), severity (equity index score), and performance (reduction against their baseline in the
previous year(s)
65
Results related to DLI 6 and 7:
132. The most significant indicator that can be used to access the effects of the ES is DLI 6. Indicator
DLI 6: Reduction of disparities in access and participation under Objective 1 of the SSDP (Objective
1: Improved Access to Quality Basic Education) was included in the School Sector Development
Plan (SSDP) program result framework as one of the ten Disbursement Linked Indicators for the
five-year SSDP implementation period by GPE, World Bank, EU and Finland with a total result-
based financing of US$ 24 million.
133. The Equity strategy document (2014) envisaged initially that costed implementation plans will be
reflected in the Annual Strategic Implementation Plans (ASIP) and Annual Work Plans and Budgets
(AWPB) for the academic year 2014-15 and 2015-16. As part of the GPE stretch indicator timeline
and under DLI 3 (Development of an equity index and its utilisation for providing targeted supports
to districts), it was then foreseen that in 2016/17, there would be targeted interventions
implemented in 5 highest ranking districts and 10 more districts in 2017/2018 and 15 in 2018/2019.
134. The SSDP review conducted in 2019 acknowledges that the targets in terms of district covered
was achieved as per the table below.

135. In 2016 (Year 1), the Department of Education (DoE) undertook a baseline household survey in
the five selected districts, with just under 100,000 OOSC aged 3-16 and 59,000 OOSC in the 5-12
year olds category across the five first focus districts. Every subsequent year, the baseline was
updated in the next batch of 5 focus districts.
136. To summarize the out-of-school children numbers presented in the baseline surveys88:
▪ 108,000 children were out-of-school in the five districts surveyed in 2016/17 amounting to
9.6 percent of the 1,120,000 aged 3–18 year old in these districts;
▪ 28,700 children were out-of-school in the five districts surveyed in 2017/18 amounting to
6.6 percent of the 435,000 aged 3–18 year old in these districts;
▪ 52,300 children were out-of-school in the five districts surveyed in 2018/19 amounting to
6.5 percent of the 801,000 aged 3–18 year old in these districts;
▪ An almost equal proportion of boys and girls were found among the out-of-school children.
‘’For the Out of School survey, teachers and grade twelve students were used to conduct the survey. Teachers alone were unable to take the
survey in such large area like ours. Some grade 12 students were asked to participate to the survey, not a lot, just a few. We had made a
format. That format had to be filled up by going to people's houses. For 14/15 days, three of us from the committee used to go to places where
there were surveys so that there would not be false data.’’ KII with one LG education officer

evolution since the baseline (2015/2016) at National level. The number of OOSC is decreasing
from 10,6% in 2015/2016 to 6,2% in 2019/2020 and could reach the SSDP target of 5% in
2020/2021. The table below shows good results at National level (All districts together) in term of

to the 2018/19 academic year were considered as out of school, enrolled in school in 2018/19 across the 186 municipalities in the 15
districts representing 57.8% (60.0% for girls, 55.7% for boys) of all the 58,254 out-of-school children in that age group against a target
of 30% for the DLI 6 year 3. Independent verification of this achievement, as required by the protocol, could not proceed due to the
lockdown that was imposed to prevent the transmission of the COVID-19 virus in the country.

139. As described previously in the DLI results table, a cumulative figure of less 256,000 Out of Schools
children was found nationally for the year 2019/2020 compared to the baseline of 2015/2016. As
this figure still needs to be independently verified, the Evaluation Team attempted to triangulate the
figure of 256,000 OOSC reintegrated in the school system at national level during the period 2014-
2020. This work is proposed in the table below that aims to assess the reduction of OOSC at
National Level using extrapolated School Age Population and GER rates

140. From 2015/2016 to 2019/2020 the total number of OoSC 5-12 has been reduced by 242,174
which seems coherent with the number of 250,000 children back to school noticed in many official
documents including children enrolled in CLC. The cumulative reduction of 5-12 OoSC over the 5
years period is 44,7%. The two data sets are consistent, provided that the demographic data we
have used is valid (School age population data). It should be noted nevertheless that our data does
not include children who have joined technical/non-formal centres which could explain the
differences between the two findings.
141. A reduction of OoSC for the age group 3-18 can also be observed at the level of the 15 bottom
districts identified through the ranking of the Equity index according to disparities in access and
participation. For the first group of five districts, the reduction of 3-18 OoSC number have been
55,1% in 3 years. For the second group of 5 districts the reduction of 3-18 OoSC number have
been 49,1 % in 2 years.

142. Due to the difference in the school age population considered in the previous two tables (5-12
years and 3-18 years), it is difficult to compare directly the reduction of the number of OoSC over
the period in the selected 15 districts with the reduction that took place at national level. What we
can reasonably say at this stage is that a large reduction of OoSC can be observed in the selected
districts but also that this reduction was not limited to these selected districts as it has also
concerned many other districts in the country as can be seen in the table 18 below.
143. To have a better appreciation of the extend of the reduction in the focused districts ( where specific
interventions have been put in place) in comparison with nation-wide results, one can consider the
data concerning the 5-12 OoSC evolution which are nevertheless limited to the first 5 districts
selected, as per our analysis below.

144. For the five districts at the very bottom of the EI ranking in terms of access and participation, the
number of OoSC back to school is 30,507 between 2017 and 2019 corresponding to 52,16 % of
the initial OoSC number. These figures compare to a score of 17,8 % at the national level for the
same period shows a significantly higher reduction than the national reductions over the period
2016-2020 indicating that the targeting has had a positive effect.
145. The evaluation team found that the share of 5-12 OoSC in the first five focused districts of the ES
that represents 13,28% of all 5-12 OoSC at the national level in 2015, decreased to 7,73% in
2018/2019, suggesting a real effort was made in these districts to bring the OoSC back to school.

146. We conducted another data analysis based on the latest Out of School report 2019/2020 for the
15 districts of the ES. The chart in annex 9 provides a picture of the percentage of enrolled children
94
The number of OoSC go from 107594 in 2016 to 48288 in 2019, a decrease of 55.12%.
95
Here we look at the share of OoSCs in the top 5 districts selected under the policy being evaluated. It was 13.28% in 2016, it drops
to 7.7% in 2019 which means that these five districts have reduced the number of their OoSC faster than all the other districts.
69
but this time for the age group 7-12 years (while our previous analysis concerned the age group 5-
12 years).
147. In all 15 districts but for the age group 7-12, we can observe that a majority of districts, with few
exceptions, have performed quite well in their efforts to bring back children to the school system
with percentage of enrolment varying from 89% to 33% depending on the districts. 8 districts score
above 70% enrolment, 4 reaching almost 70% and 4 districts lagging behind with enrolment rates
around 30% only.
148. The Mid Term Review (MTR) of the SSDP (2019) found that in basic education, the number of
disadvantaged children receiving scholarships and targeted interventions had increased
significantly, from 117,953 in 2016/17 to 214,712 in 2017/18 (JRM, Nov. 2018) and similarly to our
findings, that targeted interventions based on the EI (grants for midday meals, scholarships,
enrolment campaign for out-of-school children, etc.) may have contributed to reduce disparities in
terms of access to basic education.
149. Finally, we also undertook an analysis of data for enrolled OoSC per grade and per sex as per
the table below.
Table 16. Enrolled OoSC per grade and sex

% of Enrolled children 59.2% 57.1% 58% 56.9% 58.2% 56.7% 57.7%
150. As suggested by the figures above, if the girls represented on average 49% of the OoSC, for all
age groups, more girls than boys were enrolled in the 15 districts with an average of almost
60% girls enrolled compared to 40% boys.
151. Grade wise, interestingly, we did not find much variation in terms of enrolment per grade
suggesting that the communication campaign was able to enrol children from all age
groups.
152. Surprisingly the age group used for data analysis of OoSC is not consistent across reporting
documents, with some reports using the age group 5-12 years old while the DLI reports use the
age group 7-12 years. There is therefore a lack of a consistent communication96 on the issue of
OoSC. OOSC are considered children aged 5-12 not in school. However 5-6 year olds are still
considered easier to enroll as they could be late enrollments and therefore were not allowed to be
claimed by the government when presenting the achievement reports to trigger DLI funding.
153. The success of enrolment policies and related enrolment measures should however not hide
related difficulties for schools having to adjust to the specific needs of these new types of students
(Although, this finding is not specific to the 15 focused districts of the ES). Additional efforts will be
necessary to ensure that newly enrolled children can further progress in the cycle; The quality of
the teaching learning process has not sufficiently progressed to enable students, firstly to
reach grade 8 then, for those reaching grade 8, to pass their exams.
96
The published official data relate to different age groups and that different aspects are analysed in relation to different age groups
which is confusing.
70
154. Another way to document these different points is to refer to the enrolment (NER) in the worst
performing districts before and after the launch of the ES (see methodology in annex I “a tentative
empirical analysis of the implementation of ES”). When we look at the upper basic NER evolution
during the period 2009-2019, we can compute the annual growth rates of NER by districts over two
sub-periods (2009-2015 and 2015-2019) as shown by the data presented in table below. While the
average annual rates of UB NER were globally constant around 3,5% per year at national level,
they evolve very differently at the district level, i.e in the 15 ES districts but also in the unselected
ES districts who were with the previous ones among the 30 less performant districts in terms of
schooling in 2009. More precisely we observed globally a rapid increase in the first period followed
by a slower increase in the second period.

155. The first 5 districts selected by the ES are a notable exception to this national trend by presenting
in 2015-2019 average annual growth rates much higher than those of the other districts and
especially higher in the second period (the period of intervention of the ES). The trend is less clear
for the other districts selected by ES with a shorter intervention period. These elements give clear
credit to a positive effect of ES activities over the period. We can see in the appendix that this
effect is also observed for secondary education.

156. This empirical analysis of the ES confirms (partially in the 5 districts studied) the effects observed
following the OoSC campaigns and shows that this rise of enrolment in the very marginalized
districts is associated with a decrease in the survival rates for these districts that is more visible at
the Lower basic level than at the upper basic level. At the same time, analyzing the situation of the
different districts engaged through the ES and especially the first group selected, we observed that
they implemented less ECD classrooms and that they continue to suffer a weak supervision
associated with higher students/teachers ratio. These results confirm the demand side orientation
of the ES that succeed to bring back to schools many students but with only few changes in the
schools capacities to help them remain in schools and learn. ( for more details see annex 4 : ‘’a
tentative empirical analysis of the ES’’)

Here we look at the annual growth rate of the NER in the different district groups and at national level. It can be seen that :
- The average growth was higher in the selected districts (1 to 3) than in all other districts (the Average Annual Rate is significantly
lower at the national level than in each of the 3 groups of districts and in the group of districts where enrolment was initially low but
which were not selected (other districts) than at the national level
- Growth rates are lower between 2015 and 2019 for all districts and at the national level, except for the first group of districts where
support measures have been implemented

157. The pro-poor scholarship scheme seems to have been successful in term of reach and is now
covering the whole Nation, nevertheless, an assessment is needed to monitor the effectiveness
of the scheme at the level of the students according to ADB.
158. As reported by the latest gender study98, a considerable portion of the SSDP budget is used to
provide a wide range of others scholarships99, administered both locally and centrally. The 2017
BRM highlighted the need for reviewing and revising pro-poor, pro-girl scholarships and their
implementation in target districts, including addressing EMIS to report on data by individuals and
by districts.
159. The Social Protection sector assessment and public expenditure review drafted by the World
Bank Social Protection team100 noted considerable space to improve the equity and targeting of
scholarships (residential vs day student, and wider support for poorer students to access and stay
in secondary education). The report also calls for an increase of financial amount provided to the
children in early years by adjusting the child grant and midday meals.
160. The same review shared that beyond enrolment, the impact of scholarships on attendance
and retention in school has been minimal, likely due to the small size of the benefit for the cases
on basic education scholarships.
161. Without strictly referring to effects of scholarships, we noticed that the annual growth rates of NER
in secondary education has been, as in lower basic level, rising at a very high level during the
period 2015-2019 for the first five districts selected into the equity strategy. For these 5 districts the
annual secondary NER growth rates was 10,3, more than twice time higher than all others districts
(selected and unselected) and then of Nepal. (see table below and annex I).

162. While some schemes provide benefits from grade 1 to 10 (e.g. scheme for Dalit students and
those with disability), few specifically target students at secondary level (grades 9-12). They include
the only poverty-targeted scheme for secondary students and the scheme for poor Dalit, Chepang
and Raute students. The former only covered 34,000 students in FY19. Given the low net enrolment
rate at secondary level, expanding the coverage of secondary level scholarships could be critical
to enhance this outcome.101
98 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion analysis of the Education Sector in Nepal, Ruth Naylor, Amy West, 17th July 2020
99 According to the Ministry’s Scholarships Guidelines 2074, there are 15 types of scholarships including five residential scholarships
100 Social Protection Assessment & Public Expenditure Review FY 2011 - FY 2020, Draft for review, February 2020
101 The net enrolment rate declines from 92.7 percent in basic education to 46.4 percent in secondary. At higher secondary (grades
11-12) the net enrolment rate is even lower at 24.7 percent (Flash Report 2018-19).
73
163. The review notes that coverage rates are particularly low for the disability grant and the
child grant. The report indicates that the child grant, which is distinctly pro-poor, currently only
covers all Dalit children nationwide and all children in 14 selected districts (153 LLs) thereby
excluding non-Dalit poor children in other parts of the country.
164. An independent report102 indicates that scholarship programs offered to Dalits were problematic.
Dalit students were bullied for receiving scholarships. In addition, money allocated for scholarships
was found to be insufficient and sometimes, in some cases, funds diverted to pay teachers’ salaries
and (re-) construct physical infrastructure.
165. As described in the latest version of the Social Protection sector assessment and public
expenditure review drafted by the World Bank Social Protection team, Scholarships and midday
meal programs under the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology spent NPR 5.8 billion in
FY19. The scholarships covered about 3.2 million beneficiaries in FY19. Of these, about 2.9 million
were students at basic level and about 0.2 million at secondary level. A few thousand students
benefitted from scholarships at the tertiary level. According to the Ministry’s Scholarships
Guidelines 2074, there are 15 types of scholarships including five residential scholarships. The
value of scholarships ranges from NPR 400 to NPR 40,000 per year.103
166. The scholarships are aimed at enhancing gender equity and inclusion in access to basic
education and are mainly targeted to girls, Dalits, those with disabilities and the marginalized.104
New categories were introduced post-conflict to cover newly recognized vulnerable groups and the
conflict-affected population.
‘’The local government gave this year Rs.400 scholarships to all the girls from grade 1 to 8 and sometimes up to grade 10. This year we distributed
scholarship up to grade 9 also. We send names of the students. They look at our EMIS and see our data. They send the money to us and we
distribute the money in presence of them or in presence of some authoritative persons. Regarding day lunch, Just now, they sent the money for
40 days. They count public holidays and Saturdays and they deduct these days and send the money. They send 15 rupees per person for lunch
and we try to give local foods to the children like greens, rice puffs, beaten rice, rice-lentil porridge. Though they indicate to grade 1 onward, they
give money for pre-primary kids also. ‘’ KII with a head teacher
167. The same review of the World Bank105 found that the correlation between net enrolment rates (for
girls and overall) and per capita scholarship was positive and statistically significant. This suggests
that on average local levels with higher enrolment rates were allocated higher per capita
scholarship budget.
168. According to one head teacher interviewed, Scholarship was not transferred on time this year
because of the COVID-19 situation.
‘’The 100% girls scholarship is for all girls studying up to grade 8, there is Dalit scholarship provided to students till class 8 and also there
is poverty based scholarship provided by CEHRD (last year: 2 students studying science in class 11, 5 students studying different subjects
in class 11 and students studying in class 9 got it) but we have not received it yet this year even I tried.’’ Source: KII with head teacher
Mid-Day meal program.
169. The World Bank study106 indicates that per capita allocation for the midday meal did not have a
statistically significant correlation with net enrolment rates. Anecdotal evidence gathered from our
discussion with respondents at field level indicate nevertheless some positive effect of mid-day
meals on the enrolment of children.
‘’Day lunch has helped to minimize out of school children to a great extent. When lunch is not given then the parents don't send their kids. Otherwise,
even toddlers are also brought to schools’’

‘’Providing lunch has increased participation of girls. Boys have begun to go to madarsha and girls from Muslim community too have begun to go
to madarsha. After ten o'clock, they come here but in the morning, they go to madarsha. Muslim girls have begun to go to madarsha in the morning
to get religious education and come to school in the afternoon and stay until the school closes. There are sixteen madarsha running and in this
area. there are a large number of children, especially girls.’’ Source: KII with one teacher.
170. An evaluation107 of the school meal program conducted in 2019, found that the program has been
effective in improving the learning outcomes108 of school aged children during the program period.
Nevertheless, the same World Bank study found limited evidence of correlation between
scholarship and midday meals program budget and the performance of students and schools. The
impact of scholarships on attendance and retention, and by extension on graduation, has been
limited by the small size of the benefits for basic level schools.
171. The midday meal program aimed at improving nutritional status, class attendance and learning
capacity, covers over 1.3 million children in 44 districts (435 local levels), including 11 districts
under the Food for Education program supported by the World Food Program. The midday meals
are costed at an average of Rs. 15 per meal per day provided each day throughout the school year.
Reported by the social economic impact analysis (p 13)109, a cost-benefit analysis of the schools’
meal programme in Nepal demonstrates an increase of 3 percentage points in school attendance
and a decrease in 2.65 percentage points in drop-out rates as well as 0.9 year increase in school-
life expectancy in addition to other health and nutrition benefits (GoN, 2018).
172. As can be seen from the available evidence provided previously, there has been mix findings on
the effects of the scholarship and mid-day meal programmes on the education outcomes as
summarized below:

The equity agenda is a work in progress and more needs to be done
173. Overall, the equity agenda is still work in progress with several rooms for improvements as per
our desk review. The table in Annex 10 : ‘’Pending issues per equity dimension’’; provides a
summary of pending issues in relation to each equity dimension of the ES.
CONCLUSION EFFE 2. In the case of increased needs-based funding and/or resource mobilized by non-state
actors, has this led to a reduction of disparities in education outcomes between children that are/were based
on their gender, caste, ethnicity, ability, location, socio-economic status, vulnerability or a combination of
these?
Evaluative Judgement : It was not possible through this evaluation to relate reduction of disparities in education
outcomes with increased needs-based funding. In terms of development results, our analysis shows that the ES was
concomitant with an increase in schooling (average annual growth of NER in upper basic, reduction in the number of

component composition. Of which, students in the schools with SMP, WASH and EGR scored higher than the rest. Comparison of
endline results with baseline 2015, show substantial change in the literacy outcome with more than 20 percentage point difference.

OoSC), notably more marked in the 5 districts initially selected trough the EI. The reduction in OOSC in the targeted
districts exceeding the national reduction of OOSC, which could indicate that the targeting of interventions has been
effective.
Grade wise, interestingly, we did not find much variation in term of enrolment per grade suggesting that the
communication campaign was able to enrol children from all age groups.
A decrease in survival rates is observed in districts that have experienced recent rapid increases in enrolment, more
visible at Lower basic level than at upper basic level. These considerations linked to the demand for education of
discriminated groups deserve specific studies which could explain the rationality of their decision to leave the school
system prematurely. On the national labor market, field interviews suggest that opportunities for unskilled jobs abroad
directly compete with the highly uncertain benefits expected from a longer stay in school.
Parity in basic education, already reached nationwide at Lower basic level, is now achieved at Upper basic level. Girls
are now overrepresented compared to boys in Lower Basic in the three groups of districts selected for ES (particularly
for the first of the three groups). This over-representation of girls is established in 2019 in the Upper Basic for all the
groups of districts considered. (ES districts and others)
However, it is highly likely that children on the margins of marginalization, such as children with disabilities, have not
benefited to the same extent from this new enrolment drive.
In addition, no clear effect is noted on vulnerable ethnic groups. Concerning the Dalits, the share of enrolment is
stable during the period 2009-2019. At national level, Dalits represent around 20% of children in lower basic and
growing from 12,6 to 15,6 % in upper basic over the period. In contrast, the share of Janajatis decreases among the
total enrolments in the two cycles of basic education during the same period.110
In the first 5 districts, the evaluation team also observed that less ECD classrooms were implemented and that they
did not succeed in improving their student/teacher ratio, significantly higher than in other areas. These results confirm
the demand side orientation of the ES that succeeded to bring back to schools many students but with only few
changes in the schools capacities to help them to remain in schools and learn.
We found mixed findings on the effects of the scholarship and mid-day meal programmes on education outcomes.

an effective mechanism to support the educational planning/prioritization, management, resource allocation

Current use of the EI
174. As developed in other sections of this report, the EI has been used to rank districts (and later on
LGs) in Nepal in relation to their disparities related to access and retention mainly. The EI is also
used at Federal level to allocate funds to the most needed LGs starting with 80 LGs in the 15
focused districts.
175. A list of LGs has also been computed and was used to select 186 LGs in the 15 focused districts
to support them with the development of their ESIPs. More than 50% of these 80 Palikas have
already developed the ESIPs but only few LGs have implemented them. The index was used
mainly at LGs level as ‘’an entry point’’ for needs-based planning.
176. The government supported by UNICEF through WE provided the selected LGs with a
summary sheet displaying key education data categorized under access, participation and
learning outcomes. The summary sheet compared the main education indicators of a specific
LGs with federal and provincial level figures based on Flash 1 and Flash 2 data.
177. As per our review, the Equity Index was mainly mentioned in the ESIPs to explain why the
municipality ranked low. Therefore, reference to the EI was used mainly as the main rationale
for the development of the ESIPs but as explained previously not really for planning purpose
where Flash 1 and 2 data were found more relevant.
178. Index scores do not seem to have been sufficiently used to produce a variety of data analysis and
thus measure the progress made (if the content of the index evolves over the years). For example,
the index is not (yet) calculated on a regular basis to show whether LGs efforts result in
increase of scores/ reduction of disparities (leading to efforts being made to embed the EI in
EMIS).
Difficulty to compute data
179. Stakeholders interviewed reported that in many cases, it was difficult for the LGs to use the
EMIS data to compute key education indicators by themselves because of lack of capacity.
Technical assistance was provided by WE to bridge this gap.
180. A recent study111 also confirms that the reduction in OoSC for DLI 6 is complex to achieve as
local governments do not know which combination of learning materials, teacher practices,
inputs and accountability processes are best able to improve learning in the classroom.

Evolution of the index over times and reduction in scope
181. The relatively underuse of the index can also be explained by its reduction in scope compared to
what was initially envisaged in the ES. The SSDP (revision 2016) foresaw that the outcome equity
index would include the following indicators:

182. Following the recommendation in the Status Report 2018/19, the equity index was adapted to the
federal context, with a ranking calculated for all 753 LGs, replacing the previous formulation by
former districts.
183. Reduction in the scope of the Index compared to the initial design of the Strategy.
The evaluation team found that the way the computing of data is calculated now only covers 3
drivers of disparities compared to the 8 stated in the ES in 2014. The extent to which dimensions
can be covered depends on available data and data needs to meet certain requirements (for
example be available for all LGs). It is interesting to note that many respondents interviewed during
the evaluation did not realize that the scope had been reduced.
a. Learning outcomes are not included in the current index: the learning dimension (the
SLC pass rate) was found to have issues as the exam was not standardized enough to
offer comparability at LG level. The SLC was cancelled in 2017 and was replaced by the
Secondary Education Exam (SEE) at grade 12. The previous grade 10 SLC was changed
from pass/fail to a single subject certificate (therefore, there is no pass/fail rate after 2017).
This issue is being tackled by UNICEF and the Government. As part of the Equity Index
computation, the grade 8 Examination System was introduced in the Web Based IEMIS in
2018/2019 so that LGs could use this system to generate the desired results. In 2019,
78
around 250 LGs had used this system to conduct the annual grade eight examinations.
They were 400 in 2020. Based on the demand from the LGs, World Education not only
provided technical support on data management but also provided trainings associated
with the system. It is expected that the result obtained from this system would be used to
compute the Equity Index and to find out the learning outcomes of grade 8 students.
b. The Index now only covers 3 drivers of disparities (Gender, castes/ethnicity and
location) compared to the 8 stated in the ES in 2014112. Initially the index was computed
per district based on the data from the Central Bureau Of Statistic (CBS), offering a variety
of data based on the 2011 census. Later it was observed that there was no significant
difference between the CBS data and EMIS, therefore it was decided to use the EMIS only,
and take advantage of its annual updates113.
c. Lack of available data to track students performance in sub-categories of the eight
dimensions of equity. The eight dimensions of equity identified in the Consolidated Equity
Strategy (DoE 2014) recognize that students’ access to education, their participation, and
their learning outcomes are influenced by gender, caste/ethnicity, socioeconomic status,
health and nutrition status, geographical location, disabilities, language, and vulnerability
status. However the data is not available to track how students in sub-categories of the
eight dimensions of equity perform. Therefore, the report suggests that one foundational
step towards closing equity gaps is to ensure that data is available to identify excluded
students.
d. Existing disability data are not statistically significant at local government level as they
were at district level. For this reason, disability had to be removed from the list of drivers.
Disability data can be included but would need to be weighted (likesome other drivers) and
that requires an adaption in the EI formula that has not received endorsement yet.
e. The EI is not intended to be computed at school level. Need based analysis could be
strengthened at school level planning but that would be a different tool to be developed
under the EI.
f. The index fails to capture the various categories of family income, which should be
considered as an important driver of disparity. For instance, a rich Dalit family should
not be considered in the same position as a poor family as far as access to education is
concerned.
Limited consideration to differentiation and access to education services
184. The drivers of inequality are related with the situations of inequity but may not be direct causes.
Some situations of school inequity in participation and learning could be due to differentiated
education services in terms of quality and cost thus confining children from the most disadvantaged
families to a ‘’second-class school structure’’. Efforts are made to ensure that all schools offer
Minimum Enabling Conditions (PMEC) but there is little analysis of the role of differentiation
between community and institutional schools which the Index fails to capture.
185. There is an uneven geographical repartition of primary schools in Nepal with some districts having
mainly access to grade 1-5 schools, limiting therefore children’s opportunities. Nevertheless,
112 The National Equity Strategy framework encompasses eight dimensions or drivers of inequity: i) gender ii) socio economic status
(SES), iii) geographic location, iv) health and nutrition status, v) disabilities, vi) caste and ethnicity, vii) language, and viii) children
from vulnerable groups.
113 The Equity index was computed using CBS 2011 projections for the access (as that allowed taking wealth and other dimensions
into account), EMIS data for participation and National Examination Board data for SLC pass rate to do the initial ranking of districts.
After that, the independent verification of the EMIS and the confirmation that the EMIS and CBS data produced similar rankings was
used as a justification for MoEST to decide to use EMIS data for both the access and participation computation of the provincial and
local level equity indexes
79
looking at the high transition rates observed, these school map considerations could be of low
impact on effective schooling (see annexe 4). Furthermore, these national results can hide local
situations where school map could be a barrier to schooling in very specific cases nad/or isolated
areas.
Untapped opportunity to further use the baseline data on Out Of School Children
186. A baseline data was started in 2015 with a nominative list of out of school children gathered
through household survey. Based on our KIIs, it seems that no specific additional studies or
analysis were undertaken from this dataset than those in the annual Status Reports, DLI
achievement reports and OOSC status reports. In particular, this baseline data were not used to
understand the effects of school reintegration programs, and better know if a significant proportion
of reintegrated children actually remained at school.
CONCLUSION. EFFE 3. Has the development and operationalization of the Equity Index been an effective
mechanism to support the implementation of the Equity Strategy?
Evaluative Judgement: The Equity Index was used mainly as a communication and advocacy tool rather than a
support to the implementation of the Equity Strategy, mainly because of its reduction in scope .
In relation to the effectiveness of the index, the evaluation found that:
▪ The EI was used to select the districts and the municipalities with higher disparities. The index was used as
the main rationale for the development of the ESIPs but not really for planning purpose where Flash 1
and 2 data were found more relevant.
▪ It was difficult for the LGs to use the EI because of complex formulas compared to existing capacity in
data analysis and planning.
▪ The index is not meeting its planned objectives in term of scope114 to produce a variety of data analysis
and thus measure the progress made overtime. Many respondents interviewed during the evaluation
however did not realize that the scope had been reduced.
▪ Some stakeholders met during the evaluation suggested that it was time to reconsider the list of districts
produced by the Equity Index as the list may not reflect anymore the current level of disparities in the
COVID context.
▪ There is little analysis of differentiation between community and institutional schools and there is no
consideration of this element in the handling of the Index.
▪ The OoSC baseline data set has been unused to better understand the effects of the school reintegration
program and more importantly if the out of school children reintegrated (as they represent a significant share
of the Out of Schools115) actually remained or not in the school system and if not, why they dropped out.

115 The Out of school report 2019 indicates that of the 115,230 out-of-school children with age group 3–18 year olds in the 15 targeted
districts in 2018/19, in total 89,233 of them (77.4%) reported that they were attended school in the past but left out the school education
system and the remaining 22.6% had never attended in the school education. The highest proportion of out of school in the category
of Ever school/dropped out children is in Grade 1 with 18.8% (compared to 23.2% in 2017/18), whereas, for other grades it is between
6.6% and 11.5%.

187. The Equity strategy includes support to local governments in adopting systematic need-based
planning, which is expected to spill over from a 5-year Equity Strategy Implementation Plans (ESIP)
development into general education planning and programming. Prior to the development of the
plan, the LGs units must conduct an extensive analysis of their situations on access and
participation (including specific planned and targeted interventions).
188. The rationale of ESIP is to help local governments in systematically undertaking steps to translate
their equity index score into need-based planning and monitoring as described in the graphic below.

Technology in Nepal. May 30, 2019, Kathmandu, Nepal
189. It was agreed during the provincial workshops held at the end of 2019 that CEHRD, MOSD, EDD,
UNICEF and World Education would provide technical supports during the ESIP process. A
lumpsum of 100,000 NRS was paid for the LGs during the ESIP preparation, through World
Education and local NGOs116 in order to support LGs with the payment, bills and other necessary
documents.
190. In 2017 and 2018, the EDCUs coordinated with local government education officers to design
OoSC plans and programs. They were encouraged to include representatives of disadvantaged
groups in the local planning process. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, CEHRD allocated conditional grants
to districts (in 2016 and 2017) and local governments (in 2018) to bring out-of-school children back
to school, while local governments were provided with the flexibility to demand plans and programs
to meet identified needs. It was agreed that the EDCUs would guide local governments to enrol
20% of the out-of-school children into school by the end of corresponding academic years.
191. The Equity Strategy initially set targets for the implementation of equity-based interventions on a
short-term (FY 2014/15 & FY 2015/16), and medium-term perspective (3-5 years post July 2016).
In the end, the full Equity Index was computed and used to guide the updating of LG-ESIPs from
year three (2018/19) onward.
192. 80 out of the 186 Local Government units located in the 15 target districts were selected based
on their composite scores established from the Equity Index for intensive implementation of the
Equity Strategy. The strategy was rolled out at Local Level through 40 Local Government units in
2019/2020 and 40 more in 2020/2021. As of January 2021, 66 LG had provided information
regarding their status in term of planning and inclusion in their local education plan.

193. The status table below indicates that in March 2020, only 23% of the first batch of 40 envisioned
ESIP in 9 districts (out of 80 planned in 15 districts) had been endorsed and none of them (0%)
had yet been integrated into the local strategic plan.

The situation of the 40 LGs as of 18 December 2020117 indicates that the process is moving slowly.
9 months after (from April to December 2020), only 6118 out of 40 LGs had moved for at least one
additional sub step in the planning process.
194. The same table but with inclusion of the 80 LGs in 15 districts as of 27th January 2021 shows
that 50% of the LGs conducted an analysis of their situation, whereas only 13% of the LG-ESIP
have been endorsed by the Local Government. 10 months after, none of the 80 LGs had yet

195. The ESIP was initially expected to complement the LG Education Plan. However most fragile LG's
had no education plan at all. As a result, several ESIP became the foundation for LG's broader
Education Plans. The LGs already had funds and needed to identify specifically where the greatest
needs were and then the resource gaps. Some LGs focused on ECD, some on parents’
engagement for school enrolment, others on madrassa mainstreaming, some included school
meals etc. We found that what was implemented at LG level seems to have been mainly driven by
the familiarity of the interventions by the LGs and what can be put in place, but was less based on
actual needs and the result of a prioritization process.
196. In year two (2020/2021), the government pushed for the ESIPs to be integrated into the broader
education planning and budgeting system. This is why, an additional step: ‘’the integration of the
ESIP with the Local Level Strategic Plan’’ was added in Year 2. Since none of the LGs had prepared
local level education plan or local strategic plan, this step could not be completed for any of the
LGs.
197. Even though the LGs, for most of them, did not complete the full design and validation process of
their ESIP, the Government decided to still allocate some funding (although a limited amount) to
kick start the equity-based interventions. UNICEF indicated that only few LGs could not spend the
funds allocated. According to UNICEF, in 2019/2020, 80 LGs were running late with full
disbursement also because of the COVID-19 situation. Some respondents indicated that some LGs
had to return the funds as they could not spend it on time. Other respondents indicated that
providing the funds for the interventions before the completion of the planning process may not
have been the best decision to promote learning related to development of planning processes.
Strong Points and Challenges of the ESIPs
198. We identified several challenges linked with the design and implementation of the ESIPs as per
the consolidated list (from various sources) described below119. One of them is the over
prioritization of financial resources on the development of “visible” infrastructures with little space
for quality-focused, teaching-learning process related activities as described in this quote from a
school principal met during the evaluation.
‘’Last year, I made a proposal and sent it to the municipality. The proposal was to seek Montessori training to teachers who were teaching early grades.
The municipality supported 2/2.5 lakhs. We trained 36 teachers for 7 days and a local NGO provided some materials to us that could be used in primary
level classes. The ones that got training were very happy because they were hopeful about the change that would come to the school by getting that
training but community wise, that investment of 2/2.5 lakhs was useless because the outcome was not seen. They were of the opinion that, 2/2.5 lakhs
could have been used to construct roads.’’
119
The list of Strong points and area to improve is a compilation of findings from the /KIIs as well as derived from the list of issues
raised during the TWG meeting dated on 05/08/2020 referred as Annex 2; Analysis of year 1 local level ESIP Planning Process
83
Strong points
Strong interest in engaging in education planning - Overall there was a strong interest from the Palikas to engage in education planning. Many were
very proactive in engaging teachers, parents and other stakeholders.
Engaged teams – Despite the lack of staff in the Palikas in most Palikas they were able to identify a team to work on the plan that were very engaged
and committed.
Analysis and Rational Choice of Priorities – In general smart choices for use of ESIP funding and prioritization was observed. However many Palikas
while able to articulate this in discussions did not reflect this in the written plan. Several Palikas created tables within the plans that showed this better.
Good Plans that can Contribute to Model Building – Several of the plans provide good models and these have been reviewed to include in a revised
recommended outline. Many were simple clear and easy to follow.
ESIP Becomes Basis of Education Plan – None of the 40 Palikas supported being new had any education plans in place. Many expressed interest in
using this as the basis of the main Education Plan.
Municipality Approval – This was a brand new process but many Palikas were successful in getting the ESIP discussed and approved by their Education
Council.
Challenges
Re-insuring LGs about the roles of each planning level. The Local Government Operation Act, 2074 BS mandates local government to prepare their own
mid-term, long-term and strategic plans of all sectors including education. For this reason, when the discussion started about the use of the EI as a
planning tool, some LGs thought that there was interference from the Central Level. Staff from federal government had to re-ensured them that they were
only providing technical support to help prepare the plan and to help secure the federal funds.
Lack of planning experience with the Education Focal Persons: It was difficult to initiate the ESIP activities because many LGs did not have persons with
planning experience.
Multiplicity of Overlapping Education Plans and Lack of Links to Budgeting and Accounting System: With many plans for education – 5 Year Education
Plan - Annual Plan – ECD Plan – Comprehensive School Safety Plan, Covid Pandemic Contingency Plan etc the Palikas feel over stretched and burden
by so many plans that overlap.
Trained staff replaced: A lot of effort went into training staff to prepare the plans in expensive regional workshops. These were valuable for building the
commitment of the Central, Provincial and Local Government to the process. Unfortunately on the return to the Palikas the team members were replaced
by others creating a challenge to prepare the plan.
Least prioritization by LGs: It has been felt that LGs have their own priorities but also that the development of Local Education Plan has not been into
their main agenda. In fact, none of the first 40 LGs has produced their own local education plan. In such context, it was very difficult to convince LGs to
prepare ESIP. Priorities of LGs is also more on hard ware components. LGs tend to prioritise their budget allocations on salaries and infrastructures and
less on software components such as improving quality and retention in the education system.
Demarcation of roles and responsibilities: It is evident that the LGs need technical support not only in ESIP formulation but also in many other areas.
While federal and provincial government along with UNICEF and World Education provided technical support during the preparation of ESIP, a clear
demarcation of roles and responsibilities need to be made, at least for federal and provincial government, so that each line agencies can technically
guide LGs when and where needed. Similarly, the role of Education Development and Coordination Unit (EDCU) also needs to be demarcated so that
this line agency can also support LGs in multiple ways.
‘’Since government structure is in transition nobody really knows what and where things are happening and who is in charge. i.e. at the district level
there are still two structures- one EDUC, which used to be the District Education Office and also the Social Development unit (SD) of the provincial
government. SD unit is also responsible for education along with other social sectors. ‘’ KII with a provincial director
Inadequate funds: The LGs were provided with NRS 100,000/ (around 900 USD)- in a lumpsum basis to support cost related to the preparation of ESIP.
It was hoped that the LGs would also find additional money so that they can further strengthen the ESIP process and eventually prepare the local level
education plan or local strategic plan. This has not been the case and besides the allocated money, none of the LGs allocated extra budgets for planning
purposes. The allocated money was not adequate in order to comply with the 10 steps that was envisioned during the ESIP formulation process.
ESIP as a criterion for release of ESIP implementation funds: During the ESIP formulation process, it was assumed that ESIP will be a major criterion
for release of the implementation funds and without this plan, the LGs would not be able to spend the fund. However, this was not the case as LGs were
provided with the funds even when the ESIP plan was not submitted. This act sent out the wrong message to the LGs that ESIP is not a criterion for
release of ESIP implementation funds which then proved to be an obstacle during the technical support.
Cut and Paste behaviour – Concerns were raised that Palikas cut and pasted information. When these staff are stretched effort needs to focused on the
analysis and planning aspects. To make it simpler core background information on what Equity dimensions are or legal requirements could be provided
as text in boxes that can be inserted if required to make it easier.
Multi responsibilities under one person: At LG level, education officers are often fulfilling many various other responsibilities part of a broader social
development agenda, such as education, health, women development…Education is therefore diluted among others functions and priorities.
Limited implementation because of the COVID situation: Some LGs could not implement their plans because of the restrictions imposed by the COVID
situation.
Gaps expressed by the schools are related to the needs to conduct additional awareness raising program for the parents, providing economic support
for poor families, teachers' capacity development trainings, proper allocation of scholarships in sufficient quantity to reach more children, school meal
for secondary school going children.

EFFE 4.1 Sub Question: Has the scope of the equity strategy resulted in an adequate volume of interventions and
reach?
EFFE 4.3 Sub question: To what extend produced ESIPs have shown genuine efforts to identify appropriate types
and varieties of interventions?
199. As shared previously, only few LGs have started to implement their ESIPs. As per the information
provided in the Out Of School Reports, in the AWPBs/ASIPs and based on the Key Informants
Interviews, below a summary of the typical interventions that were implemented following the
additional budget provided to address Inequity issues in the focused districts and LGs. As such,
Local Governments can be seen to be predominantly working on improving the demand side of
education, with some elements of supply but that do not address systemic gaps in the education
system (i.e. mainly lack of teachers and issues related to quality and efficiency of education
provision.)

Limited geographical scope of the interventions
201. Some respondents interviewed during the evaluation shared that the geographical scope of the
ESIPs was limited as their implementation effectively took place only in few LGs that are included
in the 15 focused Districts and there is not yet a scale up plan and available funding to increase
the geographical scope of the interventions at National Level. Some stakeholders also had the
impression that the support brought to the 80 LGs looks like a ‘’ supported pilot project’’ that is not
yet ready for a full replication.
Limited thematic scope of the Equity Based Interventions
202. As reported by the latest ESA gender study120, the focus on reducing rates of out of school children
in the targeted support and the monitoring of progress does not allow to take into consideration all
vulnerable children. Whilst the equity strategy is contributing to the inclusion of the most excluded
children of primary school age (those not in school), it does not necessarily address the needs of
most of the excluded (those in school but not learning). Neither is it clear whether those newly
enrolled will be provided with quality education eager to to keep them in school and learning. The
midterm review of SSDP noted that limited resources and attention had been given to the follow up
of students once enrolled.
203. As reported by the latest ESA gender study121, the Equity Index and Grants/ESIP may adopt an
approach where “social inclusion” is not clearly defined, and there are few explicit interventions to
address it and monitor progress, beyond efforts to reduce the number of out of school children.
204. The same report indicates that data show persistent inequalities in education, for example:122
▪ Dalit and Janajati are underrepresented at higher secondary and representation decreased
over the period 2014-2018123
▪ Secondary access is limited for the poorest quintile
▪ Literacy outcomes of non-Nepali mother tongue speakers are far below those of Nepali
mother tongue speakers.
205. Below a compilation of suggestions brought by the respondents during the evaluation: The ES
strategy should better address, language, child marriage and disability issues, take also in
consideration the issue of equity in financing (schools tend to receive the same amount of funding
but have disparities in term of capacities), the importance of secondary education should be
highlighted further in the strategy in relation to access to sciences studies for girls for example.124
Overall the scope of the strategy should be holistic from ECD to upper secondary as stakeholders
met perceive that the current focus seems to have been more on basic education and on access
for Out Of School Children.
Relationship between the ESIP and the Schools:
206. Our discussions with some schools indicate little ownership of the ESIP by the schools as the
ESIPs is mainly perceived as a LGs’ plan. Schools were not systematically involved in its design.
Schools implement activities related to Equity and inclusion, they may include such components in
SIP but not under the banner of ES or ESIP, meaning that the schools may not know what ESIP is.

207. LGs get money from the federal level for ESIP. LGs then allocate budgets to schools on the basis
of the requirements (e.g. top up for scholarship, school bags, etc.). Nevertheless, LGs may not
distribute the total ESIP budget to schools. They can also spend it for their own programs. E.g.
parental education.
208. On what basis LGs allocate additional budget for equity and inclusion related activities to schools
is not clear. LGs do not collect SIP. They may organize discussions from which they will know
which school needs what. According to our discussions with the KIIs at sub national level, budget
allocation for schools are based on various sources as follows: household survey to identify the
OoSC, supervision visits made by LG education officers, Village profile, EMIS, health center's data
about children under 5. LGs also collect information from teachers and parents about out of school
children.
CONCLUSION EFFE 4. Has the development and operationalization of the Equity Strategy Implementation
Plans been an effective mechanism to support the implementation of the Equity Strategy?
Evaluative Judgement: The Equity Strategy Implementation Plans were partly an effective mechanism to support the
implementation of the Equity Strategy also because the trend is now that LGs should develop an education plan taking
into consideration equity issues. (rather than a standalone ESIPs). Only few LGs implemented their ESIPs, it is
therefore a work in progress that would need to be strengthened with clear monitoring tools.
80 out of the 186 Local Government units located in the 15 target districts were selected based on their composite
scores established from the Equity Index for intensive implementation of the Equity Strategy. The strategy was rolled
out at Local Level through 40 Local Government units in 2019/2020 and 40 more in 2020/2021.
The evaluation team found that although many of the first batch of 40 LGs had developed their plans, as of 27th
January 2021 only 13% of the 80 LG-ESIP had been endorsed, indicating a slow process. (even if most of the 40 LGs
have now an ESIP). The ESIP was initially expected to complement the LG Education Plan. However most fragile
LG's had no education plan at all. As a result, several ESIP became the foundation for LG's broader Education Plans
that they are now developing. In addition, it should be noted that development of the ESIPs was during the height of
the initial COVID-19 period in Nepal, when schools were closed and LGs were fully engaged in providing essential
emergency responses.
Education staff were found motivated and engaged to develop the plans but they experienced issues with staff
turnover and competing priorities at LGs level with a centralization of decision taken by the chief administrator. In the
new context of transition to a federal structure, education officers are often fulfilling many responsibilities part of a
broader social development agenda, such as education, health, women development…Education is therefore diluted
among others functions and priorities often goes to hardware type of activities (infrastructures) and less to other
components such as capacity building or awareness raising.
The central level provided support to the process. The implementation guideline for the ES was found clear about the
various steps needed to prepare the ESIPs and on how to identify the data for the analysis of the education issues in
the municipality, but it felt short in providing clear and detailed instructions on how to develop the plan. Concretely,
the sample of ESIP analyzed revealed different contexts and initial analysis, but very similar and convergent activities.
Through the implementation of their ESIPs, Local Governments have predominantly worked to improve the demand
side of education, with some elements of supply but that do not address systemic gaps in education provision (i.e.
mainly lack of teachers and issues related to quality and efficiency.) The bulk of the funding went for the enrolment of
OoSC through the CLCs, the Alternative Learning Centers and for capacity development interventions. This focus on
OoSC leads to change the focus of the ES. In most cases, ESIP contributed to the inclusion of the most excluded
children of primary school age (those not in school) but did not address the needs of most of the excluded (those in
school but not learning).
Also, section 2.5 of the ESIPs related to monitoring was not properly translated into monitoring plans and framework
in the sample of ESIPs that we reviewed. It is therefore unclear whether those newly enrolled children will be provided
with education of sufficient quality to keep them in school and learning.

3.5 Modalities of selection of the interventions
EFFE 5. To what extent has the Equity Sub question EFFE 5.1: What was the rationale/justification for selecting
Strategy facilitated the Government of the interventions?
Nepal to achieve the equity-based
targets and objectives within the Sub question EFFE 5.2: What was the added value of reviewing the
previous and current education sector analysis and appraisal to inform the selection of the target and objectives
plans? of the LG ESIPs?
1. To enhance access and improve equity, the government has 16 different types of scholarships in
place that target specific population groups such as conflict-affected, disabled, girls, Dalits, and
poor and talented students. According to the latest USAID education sector analysis 2020, many
of these scholarships are not as such targeted to students who are weak financially. Thus, many
of these benefits are skewed in favour of females who are in the richest consumption quintile (World
Bank 2014). The Terai ethnic groups also do not benefit much from these initiatives.
2. The evaluation found that the Equity Index is not always used by development Organizations for
targeting interventions but is rather sometimes used as one of the selection criteria. Many
organizations have their own project planning cycle and criteria for selecting their target area.
Targeting is often made based on thematic criteria of relevance for a particular type of project. For
example, food security projects will tend to focus on food deficit areas even if they also have a role
n providing school meals. Therefore the ranking of the Equity index is only partly used for
prioritization of education interventions. In addition, some projects started before the list of
municipalities was available and cannot yet change their tageted geographical areas. Below the
example of UNICEF on how the Equity criteria is selected for Education interventions.
UNICEF integration of equity.
In the context of the development of the UNICEF/Government Country programme action plan 2018-2022, UNICEF selected a
number of priority rural and urban municipalities (palikas). These priority palikas include convergence palikas and program specific
priority palikas. The Convergence palikas were identified as most deprived according to the Child Deprivation Index (2015) and
are receiving multi-sectoral assistance provided in a coordinated way through cross sector interventions involving health, wash,
nutrition, child protection, C4D and education programming. Cross sector collaboration take place at UNICEF field offices level.
In other program locations where UNICEF is implementing education projects (outside of the convergence palikas), the Equity
Index was used as one of many indicators to select the geographical areas for interventions.
Equity is mainstreamed in education programming areas of UNICEF. For example, UNICEF supports Community-based early
childhood education (ECE) and parenting education. Supply-side bottlenecks are being addressed by improving teaching skills
and developing quality teaching and learning materials. UNICEF also supports improvement of classroom teaching and learning,
the promotion of early grade literacy and numeracy and the use of appropriate mediums of instruction. Finally, UNICEF is
strengthening the technical and institutional capacity of the education sector for DRR and CCA, education in emergencies and the
Schools as Zones of Peace initiative. As part of the implementation of the school safety comprehensive framework, one component
is related to improved social protection environment that aims to address child protection issues through enhanced social security
of parents and their children (especially girls, children from underprivileged families and children with different abilities), thus
promoting more equal access to education.
In its CPD for the period 2018-2022, UNICEF is targeting 200 LGs with the developments of their ESIPs. As of March 2020, 80
LGs have been supported in this process.
3. Some donors such as the EU for example, are mainly supporting the education sector through
budget support. In this case, they cannot select the municipalities as the responsibility to allocate
funding to the most needed areas remains with the Government. For the other projects supported
by the EU (outside budget support), the list of districts and municipalities produced by the index is
used as one of the selection indicators. Equity in Education is a major pillar of EU intervention in
the Education sector. Funding from the EU to non-state actor projects in education provides an
88
important complement to the sector wide support, promoting greater access, equity and inclusion
of marginalized children in education.
4. According to the 2020 DMS activity report, our discussion with WE and some of the LGs, not every
education focal person was familiar with data analysis and EMIS, therefore World Education
supported LGs125 by providing them with a useful summary sheet of the LGs with data categorized
under access, participation and learning outcomes. The summary sheet includes LGs with
comparison of education indicators with the national and provincial levels. See thereafter as an
example, the data for the Lungri Municipality. The LGs were also encouraged to use other sources
of their own information to generate such type of analysis.

5. The relationship between the analysis of data and the proposed activities was not always clear and
coherent for many LGs. Many LGs proposed similar activities even though their context may be
different. LGs will need more support in the future to customize further their plans to address the
causes and factors of inequity.
6. If the support provided by the government with technical support by UNICEF through WE to the
LGs during the appraisal phase was useful, our analysis of a sample of the ESIPs indicates that
the plans were very ambitious in regard to the limited budget that was allocated for their
implementation. In the meantime, in some cases, the total amount of the overall budget was
missing and sometimes activities were not costed which rendered the financial analysis impossible.
Some plan (i.e. Chhartasong Rural Municipality) displayed a budget of 5,948,320 NPR (51,000

89
USD) or higher which is far above the funding that was made available by the federal level to them,
raising questions on how the plan will be implemented in the future.
7. The LGs developed a 5 year-plan (2016-2023) to be aligned to the National level SSDP plan but
as they started the development of the plan very recently, it did not seem to us coherent knowing
that there remains only 3 years before the end of the SSDP period.
CONCLUSION EFFE 5. To what extent has the Equity Strategy facilitated the Government of Nepal to achieve
the equity-based targets and objectives within the previous and current education sector plans?
Evaluative Judgement: As previously mentioned, ESIP preparation process triggered education planning efforts in
many LGs. Development results and equity-related DLI also seem to have been improved thanks to the ES. The
support provided by UNICEF and its partner World Education to the analytical process was welcome and allowed
comparison of educational indicators between LGs.
Nevertheless, the relationship between data analysis and the proposed activities was not always evident and
coherent. Many LGs proposed similar activities even though their context may be different. LGs will need more support
in the future to customize further their plans to address the causes and factors of inequity.
Some respondent mentioned the need to further highlight the importance of secondary education in relation to access
to sciences studies for girls for example.126 They also insisted on the need to have a more holistic and systemic scope
of the strategy from ECD to upper secondary as stakeholders met perceived that the focus was more on basic
education and on access for Out Of School Children.

Strategy
8. The recent Country Level Analysis127, (ESA) reported that many indicators related to the DLIs were
originally designed with a view to the District Education Office (DEO) having a major role in
implementation. As structures were radically changed with federalism, the indicators had to be
revised, with the delivery mechanism replaced with LGs. Following federalism, the main means of
delegation or attempt for the center to delegate to the local level is via budget lines clearly labelled
within the Conditional Grant to LGs, with implementation detail set out in the Program
Implementation Manual (PIM). As set out in a meeting in April 2019 on the EGRP: “the government
shared that collecting all the data for the achievement report was extremely difficult and either the
reporting requirements or the reporting system needs to change. It was noted that this was a
serious challenge across all DLIs due to the federal transition.”

9. This issue of financial reporting was exacerbated by a period in which the LGs had no obligation to
report to MoE or CEHRD, and instead only had to directly report to the Ministry of Federal Affairs
and General Administration. The Government is now seeking to make the LGs report to Education
Development and Coordination Unit (EDCU) & Subnational Treasury Regulatory Application
(SuTRA).
10. As shared later in this report, the directive from the Government is now for the LGs to first develop
their education plans (as many LGs do not have yet their own education plans) in which they are
invited to mainstream equity in the education plan instead of developing stand-alone ESIPs that
will then be merged into the education plans. The Government with technical support from UNICEF
and WE had to adjust the implementation guidelines to reflect this new direction. Starting from July
2021 onwards, USAID and the British Council will support several LGs in the previous 75 districts
to develop their local education sector plans in which it is expected that equity be integrated.
11. The ES seems to have played a positive role for LGs to address the challenge of overall federal
transition. Nevertheless, it is not clear in the future what role the federal and provincial level could
play to strengthen the capacities of LGs now that the district level disappears. The start-up phase
of the rolling out of the ESIPs have demonstrated that LGs required crucial technical support and
guidance on planning, data management and analysis as well as on monitoring/evaluation that are
all key needed functions for the implementation of the Equity Strategy.
12. Overall, the following challenges related to the transition to the new federal structure have been
identified during the 2019 SSDP MTR and through our data collection phase and contribute to
impact negatively on the implementation of the ES:
o Uneven redeployment of essential staff between institutions at provincial and local government can potentially
cause disruption in education service delivery.
o Uneven capacity of staff already deployed, potentially causing increased disparities between provinces,
localities and schools.
o Delay and uncertainty regarding the pace of redeployment, leading to lack of clarity of the support needed
and inability to strengthen institutional capacity accordingly
o Institutional memory loss/lack of ownership of SSDP at provincial and local level government that could
potentially disrupt the timely implementation of the SSDP program and activities.
o Lack of clear definition of role, responsibilities and reporting mechanisms between the three levels of the
education federal structure increasing the risk of duplication of investment in the school sector, and decreased
alignment between needs and support provided.
o Legal framework pending regarding teacher management and professional development and dissolution of
RCs and reduction of ETCs, bringing new challenges for completion of implementation of activities to reach
the expected outcomes of the SSDP.
o Possible significant increase in additional recruitment and resignation of government staff instead of their
redeployment, causing systemic shortage of expertise within the provincial and especially municipal
governments.
CONCLUSION EFFE 6. Has the emerged federal structure in the education sector had an effect on the
effectiveness of the implementation of the equity Strategy?
Evaluative Judgement: The emerged federal structure in the education sector had a major effect on the effectiveness
of the implementation of the ES. The restructuring of state functioning changed from the previous 75 districts as the
main unit of sub-national administration to the local governments. As noted also by other recent studies, Provincial
and local governments lack capacity to deliver education services, and substantial capacity building will be needed to
support the transition.
More particularly, the evaluation team identified gaps in data analysis, planning, reporting and monitoring. Areas to
strengthen also include intersectoral and cross collaboration and coordination with non-education related departments
as well as with non-state actors as the latter were not much engaged in the design of the ESIPs plans.

4. Efficiency of the Equity Strategy
4.1 Financial and human resources utilization and alternative strategy
EFFI 1. Has the equity EFFI 1.1 Sub Question: In what way it contributed to utilizing financial and human
strategy contributed to the resources efficiently?
government utilizing financial EFFI 1.2 Sub question: Are financial and human resources sufficient to achieve
and human resources for intended results of the strategy?
equity-based interventions in EFFI 1.3 Sub Question: Is there an alternative strategy that could have been used
an efficient way? to address inequity issues in the education sector?
13. In view of the limitations related to the potential use of the index, its current use and its reduction
in scope, (see previous section on the effectiveness of the Equity Index for the Strategy
implementation), one can ask if the development of the index was a cost-effective system to use
as part of the Equity Strategy or if a more cost-effective strategy would have been better. (see
thereafter a proposed alternative strategy). More precisely, the amount of funds committed to the
EI are not considerable. The question of its efficiency refers more to the capacity of local planners
to use it effectively.
14. For the first batch of 40 LGs, a lot of effort went into training education staff from the LGs to prepare
the plans in regional workshops. These were valuable for building the commitment of the Central,
Provincial and Local Government to the process but unfortunately some team members were later
on replaced by others creating a challenge to bring the actual plan preparation team up to speed.
Following this experience, support provided by the government with technical support by UNICEF
through WE, organized blended program of trainings activities with some of the exercises being
conducted remotely and some others in person. This was found also relevant and a more cost-
effective strategy in the context of COVID-19.
15. As described in other sections of this report, the funding allocated for each district was quite limited
and at the time of writing this report, it was not clear on how and to what extent the budget was
used for the implementation of the ESIPs as there was no proper monitoring of activities being
done (following the use of a monitoring plan) or a narrative and detailed progress and financial
report. We were told that this was not accomplished mainly because of the COVID-19 situation.
16. Many LGs interviewed were doubtful that the Government will continue funding the development
of the ESIPs in the future because the new directive is now to first develop the municipality
education plan and mainstream equity issues in this plan. As seen later in this report, the effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic are putting a lot of strain on the overall government budget that may also
impact the education budget. Government staff interviewed at central level indicated that they will
see the results of this evaluation before engaging in a scale up plan to roll out the ESIPs in other
districts.
EFFI 1.3 Sub Question: Is there an alternative strategy that could have been used to address inequity issues
in the education sector?
17. In comparison to a more ‘’ traditional DMS strategy ‘’, we found that the Equity Strategy does not
take sufficiently into account the 'school' level’ (in term of computing relevant data for planning and
programming) and could therefore appear out of step with a conventional DMS strategy.128
18. According to our analysis, the DMS involves the calculation (and comparison between schools or
LGs which is not yet the case in Nepal) of more ‘’ regular type of data’’ concerning (access/retention
128 T
he key components of the model we are referring are: ie feedback mechanisms to improve access to data). The IE was added
on to the other components DS was requested to support, such as school report cards web based EMIS
92
and learning outcomes) through the use of "school profiles" (dashboard) and the mobilisation of
communities around the school's progresses in the different outcomes. The DMS approach has
also the advantage of recognizing the importance of the LGs for the role they could play in data
analysis for the implementation of the equity strategy at school level (Through their analysis and
comparison of the various school profiles in their municipalities).
19. What would be key in the next education plan is to ensure that schools and LGs are accountable
to their local constituencies. This does not seem yet to be the case now also because of the vacuum
left by the new federal system where the functions of monitoring and reporting are very weak at
Local level. This is also due to the lack of capacities and the lack of sufficient teachers in the
schools. To this end, the DMS activities (that are supporting school-based tools facilitating a
transparent and more objective picture of the school situation-the school profile) should be further
supported but with revised school maps offering comparison between schools resources and
performances rather than simply describing the schools resources as is actually the case in Nepal.
20. Therefore, the International DMS concept129 seems to us more relevant than the Equity Index, in a
context that combines strong decentralization with limited data analysis capacity at field level. The
advantage of what we call ‘’ classic DMS’’ is that it aims to capacitate the schools to use EMIS data
and display the results in a user- friendly document: the school profile. The other advantage of the
DMS model is that, unlike the Equity index, it also allows to visualise data that are related not only
to the demand side of equity issue but also to the supply side of the education sector (through a
view on the level of achievement for the 5 Priority Minimum Enabling Conditions priorities but also
through the comparison of school equipment and staff in respect to other schools at the municipality
and LG levels.)
21. To run a DMS activity, it will be necessary to revisit the actual school profiles who offer only few
comparisons according to the different indicators that could help the school community to
understand the specific situation of their school. The present school profile is very weak and poorly
informative. The introduction of equity indicators in the school profile could be a good strategy to
put the equity dimension at the heart of discussion inside the school community and to envisage
some activities that could address directly these issues. The LG schooling profiles should be
adapted accordingly and could be a great help for the design of an adequate education plan that
will have direct results through activities run into individual schools.
22. As shared during the debriefing meeting for this evaluation, there is currently no planning tool
embedded in EMIS to facilitate the planning process of the LG.
23. Other alternatives strategies proposed by some respondents are: i) mainstreaming equity in LGs
planning and budgeting process not only in the local education plan but also in the overall LGs
development plan to ensure that equity is taken in considerations also in WASH and health sectors;
ii) Strengthen further capacity buildings efforts of LGs130; iii) provide support to the inclusion of
equity also at the level of the schools through their SIPs.
129
At this stage, DMS in the case of Nepal responds to needs flagged by the sector and offers relevant TA to address these in a
specific area, there is no DMS concept or component within the ESP as such.
130 Particularly for newly appointed education officers at LG level.
93
CONCLUSION EFFI 1. Has the equity strategy contributed to the government utilizing financial and human
resources for equity-based interventions in an efficient way?
Evaluative Judgement: In view of the limitations related to the potential use of the index, its current use and its
reduction in scope, one can ask if the development of the index was a cost-effective system to use as part of the
Equity Strategy or if a more cost-effective strategy would have been better for geographical targeting. The amount
of funds committed to the EI are not considerable. The question of its efficiency refers more to the capacity of local
planners to use it effectively (or even use possible alternative in terms of equity analysis through the use of the
estimation of enrolment profiles)’’
However, the Equity Index still keeps its relevance as a tool that can be used in the future to follow up trend over
time in access and retention for OoSC in various geographical localities and ultimately learning outcomes once the
index would have integrated the relevant data for that.
A lot of effort went into training education staff from the LGs to prepare the plans in regional workshops. These were
valuable for building the commitment of the Central, Provincial and Local Government to the process although
affected by turnover of staff.
The funding allocated for each district was quite limited and it was not clear on how and to what extent the budget
was used for the implementation of the ESIPs as there was no proper monitoring of activities being done (there was
no monitoring framework or plans) or a narrative and detailed progress and financial reports.

25. For the rolling out of the ESIP development into local education planning and programming,
orientation workshops have been organised at the end of 2019 with the LGs to introduce the
following detailed planning steps below:
Expected steps for ESIP planning (and inclusion in the Local Education Sector Plan) and implementation process
Step 1: Evidence and analysis. Look at available data from the perspective of:
▪ Access, to different groups (for example boys, girls, children with disabilities, different minority/religious groups) have the same level of
access. If not, who have the least access?
▪ Participation, to different groups (for example boys, girls, children with disabilities, different minority/religious groups) have the same
level of attendance, retention and completion. If not, who have the lowest participation?
▪ Learning; are children learning equally. If not, which groups have lower learning outcomes
Step 2: Strategic planning
▪ Validate analysis with relevant stakeholders
▪ Map planned activities that respond to the outcomes of the analysis
▪ Cost activities and develop budget
▪ Map available resources that can be used for additional activities
▪ Prioritize based on available resources
▪ Identify resource gap
▪ Map support of other line agencies non-government partners that can be mobilized
Step 3: Implementation & monitoring
▪ Describe implementation arrangements for targeted activities
▪ Develop/select indicators and targets to measure results
▪ Define implementation timeline and monitor arrangements
(Source: Template for ESIP induction workshop.)
26. Below a quote from one LG officer met during the evaluation that indicates also that some LGs did
liaise with the schools for the development of their ESIPs.
‘’The process of making ESIP was such that first of all it was discussed in an education committee. The committee told us (Education section) to
go and observe the schools and make plan accordingly. We met with principals of all schools and asked them to find out how many children were
out of school through surveys. After that, we made the plan. After making the plan, we first asked the education committee to approve it and then
after we asked the local executive board to endorse the plan.’’
27. The Government and UNICEF have invested a lot of efforts in designing communication and
planning packages to disseminate the Strategy and more particularly, tools to be able to use the
Equity Index for planning and fund allocations at local level.
28. Lack of integration of the ES in programming of Non State Actors. It seems also that the EI is
not sufficiently communicated to and therefore not used by I/NGOs when planning their
interventions (i.e. most disadvantaged districts not necessarily covered) (Perry 2019). Further
cooperation between the MoEST and NGOs coordination in that regard could be useful to ensure
appropriate targeting of their interventions and synergies between different kinds of support.
29. World Education (WE) shared with the evaluation team that they had difficulty sometimes to monitor
the work in progress of the ESIPs due to the limited number of staff they had (Only 1,5 staff to cover
80 LGs spread across 15 districts) and also that the new context of COVID-19 with the subsequent
travel restrictions had constrained their monitoring work.
30. Lack of key indicators of results and monitoring plans at LG level. Our review indicates that
the plans are very much activity based and do not include a set of indicators or a monitoring plan.
Plans including monitoring component use the following sources of information to monitor the
activities: Annual examination result details/student learning achievement, Student enrolment
details, details of students that will increase following entry of out-of-school child developments
[CDCs] in school, records of provision of educational materials/child play things corners, social
95
audit report. Some plans included provision for the organization of monitoring activities and
mentioned supervision checklist as a monitoring tool. Nevertheless, we did not find evidence of
strong monitoring activities being implemented as part of the ESIPs at this early
implementation stage. Now in the context of COvid, real time monitoring needs have
emerged and it has become even more important to be able to monitor implementation of
response and recovery plans in education.
31. So strengthening the monitoring function at LG level and the importance of it, should really
be highlighted
‘’We have not made a separate format for monitoring of ESIP. We have monitored the ESIP through analysis of data such as how many students
came, who got the scholarships, observation of schools under our general monitoring plan. We will be monitoring ESIP in the coming months’’
KII with Education officer.
32. Lack of sufficient social inclusion indicator at SSDP level: For the key performance indicators
to track progress for the most excluded, the GESI study 2020 notes that the main indicator of focus
appears to be the out of school rate for primary school aged (5 to 12 year old) children. Whilst
secondary enrolment ratios are tracked, the SSDP results framework does not track out of school
rates for children of secondary school age, the stage at which disparities in access education widen,
and more children are excluded. Literacy rates for different age groups have been included as key
performance indicators to track progress for the most excluded, but no new data has been recorded
for these indicators since the baseline.
33. With sufficient levels of data disaggregation, it would be possible to monitor social inclusion through
many of the indicators provided in the results framework. However, the SSDP MTR 2020 noted
that indicator sets do not always include the level of disaggregation required to monitor the
impact of targeted interventions for gender equality and social inclusion, and of intersection
vulnerabilities, at the level of the learner or the teacher. As an example, the analysis concerning
the ethic/caste discriminations are questionable and relatively weak as they used often
enrolment numbers without referring to the respective shares of these groups in the school
age population.
34. Limitations to conduct monitoring missions because of the COVID-19 situation: As part of
the BRM and JRM mission, equity stakeholders (from the TWG) used to conduct twice a year, a 5
days monitoring mission along with the Government. Since a year now, it has not been possible to
monitor the activities on the ground because of the travel restrictions imposed by the COVID
situation.
35. Lack of reporting about activities implemented: Various stakeholders interviewed during the
evaluation shared that it was difficult to have a clear picture of what was effectively implemented
through the equity based interventions (the ESIPs more particularly as there are some information
available for activities implemented by Non State Actors) because there was no readily available
progress and consolidated completion reports to assess what was done and what have been the
strengths and areas to improve in relation to these equity based interventions. One respondent
mentioned that there was no requirement from the central government to the LGs to encourage
them to report about their ESIPs activities which can also partly explain why there was no such
reports. In addition, as autonomous entities, LGs are not entitled to report to the Ministry of
education and their main reporting lines are under the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General
Administration (MoFAGA). Other respondents also indicated that many equity-focused
interventions are being implemented by the Government and non-state actors but that these
activities may not be linked to the ESIPs and were therefore under reported.
96
36. Unclarity on roles and responsibilities in relation to the monitoring function. Our interviews
with Education Officersreveal a lack of clear Roles and Responsibilities at local level in relation to
the monitoring of activities in the education sector as expressed by the quote below:
‘’We all hope that monitoring and planning would be done by a single education division. Who else would do it? We would monitor when the plan
is implemented. We have not decided who would monitor when till now. We have thought of involving rural municipality chairperson and ward
chairpersons as well in monitoring’’. KIIs with an Education Officer
37. As illustrated by the quote below from a school principal, the previous monitoring system is not
working anymore in the new federal system in transition. In some areas, the concept of learning
motivator is being piloted but there may be some issues with its sustainability in the future.
’Learning motivators roam around schools. They go to classes, meet with teachers and continuously encourage them. If the teachers face any
problems while using any materials, they immediately go to classrooms or meet the teachers in the office and help to solve the problems. I am very
happy because there was a time when Primary school supervisor and lower secondary school supervisors used to come to schools and give
feedback to the teachers. After that, school supervisors used to come. With federalization they stopped coming. So, only principal were the ones
to give feedback to the teachers. Learning motivators are here until EGRP (Early Grade Reading Program) and after that they would no longer
work. They would stop coming and there would be a gap.’’
38. As such Monitoring, evaluation and reporting remain weak areas that need to be strengthened in
the future to ensure better accountability. Some LGs are already preparing monitoring team as per
the quote below:
‘’For monitoring, principals and education and sports branch's authorities who work under the municipality are supposed to form a group/team. We
have publicized a notice to recruit some experts to help us with monitoring activities. We had a discussion last time to form a team with supervisors
so that they could observe teaching learning activities in the classroom and they could also provide help to the teachers when they face any
problems. The committee has not been formed. After we have the experts, the committee will be formed and then I think there would be monitoring
activities.’’ KII with a LG officer
39. Data on retention and learning outcomes are not available. Similarly, if the number of children
back to schools is known, data on retention and learning outcomes following the implementation of
the interventions are not available.
EFFI 2.2 Sub Question: What external and internal factors caused delays in the implementation of interventions?
40. Delay in the design phase: From the validation of the ES to the implementation of the ESIPs,
some delays have been observed as it took time for the various stakeholders (i.e. the TWG
members have been supporting this with FCDO being one of the members) to design the
implementation phase, including the design of the implementation guideline.
41. The external context also contributed to delay the rolling out of the ES such as the change of
context because of elections, the new federal structure132 and the COVID-19 situation133.
42. Redeployment of staff: The midterm review of the SSDP plan (Feb to June 2019) found that in
the context of implementing the new devolved mandate to the local government134, the
redeployment of staff and the probable necessity to proceed with a massive recruitment of civil
servants135 will affect the education system in terms of existing expertise at different levels in the
coming years. This is also compounded by the fact that the redeployment process shows some
level of reluctance from different categories of civil servants (including teachers) to be redeployed
at the provincial and local levels, especially in remote areas. Since the ES is fully integrated in the
education system, the evaluation team believes that there is a strong likelihood that this new
context will also negatively impact (hopefully temporarily) the future path of implementation of the
Equity Strategy and more particularly at local level.
132 See previous section 3.6 Effectiveness of the Strategy in the emerged Federal structure
133 See section 5.1 sustainability of the strategy in the context of COVID-19; Risks related to the new context of the COVID-19 situation.
134 All funds for basic school operations and developmental activities are now transferred to LGs.
135 Localities where essential staff are absent cannot proceed to fund transfers in time, hindering the possibility for schools to
function adequately.
97
43. Lack of clear reporting and joint planning mechanisms. The SSDP Mid Term Review (MTR)
2019 noted that several stakeholders interviewed at provincial level by the MTR team also pointed
out the lack of clear reporting and joint planning mechanisms between the various tiers of
Government (Federal, Provincial and Local) and the risk of duplicated support from the Provincial
Government and Federal Government at local level.
44. Issues with planning processes at school level. As described in this report, in some
municipalities, some schools were involved in the design of the ESIPs. Nevertheless, it was not
clear to us on what would be the link between the ESIPs and the School Improvement Plans (SIP)
knowing that many schools are reluctant to design their SIP as they get frustrated because in many
cases their plan has not been followed up by the municipality with enough funding allocation for its
effective implementation. As caught in a vicious cycle, because the schools are not producing SIP,
then the municipalities allocate the money for the design of the SIP to other purposes as per the
quote below:
‘’In the schools, there might not be enough teachers according to the number of students, there might not be enough building or toilets, the school
should ask for these things through SIP but the head teachers say that the municipality is not working on it, so the school won't develop the SIP’’ KII
with WE staff
‘’ Nobody makes SIP and there was a need to make calendar. So I made calendars instead." KII with a LG Education Officer.
‘’ We submit the SIP to the responsible authority not for planning purpose but because they give us our salary without any trouble.’’ KII with a teacher
45. Lessons from the few LGs who did implement activities from the ESIPs indicate that the first budget
allocated was used mainly to set up the ECD but more funding and time would be needed to
address the root causes of inequity issues. The COVID-19 situation also impeded the
distribution of some scholarships as expressed in the quote below:
‘’We had obtained a budget of around 8 Lakhs (7,000 USD) from the government last year and that was spent under the titles: opening of new ECDs,
trainings to newly appointed ECD facilitators and distribution of educational materials, parental education and student scholarship programs.
Scholarships to genuine talented students, which was planned last year couldn’t be distributed due to the pandemic ‘’KII with Head teacher
’While implementing the ESIPs, we faced some challenges. When we approached out of school children there were many socio-economic
factors, which couldn’t be covered by ESIP. Even we supported ECD level/classes, they are still inadequate and some have small spaces
which make it difficult to store and appropriately use the teaching learning materials. We were unable to focus on specific topics such as
Parental awareness. The budget provided by the central government is also low.’’ KII with one LG officer
46. Inadequate allocation for human resources. In ESIP the budget is allocated only for activities
that directly benefits students. Teachers are hesitant to work. they are afraid that there will be no
facilities to them. For instance, we have to call teachers from far away and we can't use the ESIP
budget to pay for their travel cost or any other expenses (e.g. tea/snacks).
‘’We have appointed one teacher for parental education and one to provide trainings to ECD facilitators under ESIP. But the guideline does not allow
us to provide allowance to them. This has affected implementation of ESIP.’’ KII with a respondent
EFFI 2.3 Sub Question: What external and internal factors, including elements of the ES, contributed to accelerating
the progress?
47. The relevance of an ‘’ advisory body ‘’. One of the contributing factors for the implementation of
the Strategy has been the role played by the members of the Equity and inclusion Technical
Working Group, and the technical assistance provided by UNICEF, (through World Education) and
WB. As described in this report, this may not have yielded fully the expected results for different
internal and external factors, but genuine efforts were made to make it happen.
48. The importance of reactivity and adaptation to a new context: The transition to federalism has
been identified as the main cause of delay for the implementation of the strategy. This was due to
the fact that channels of coordination and collaboration are yet to be established between the
central, provincial and local level in the context of the three tiers decentralisation mechanism (in
98
which the previous district level disappears). To go around this issue, the Government and UNICEF
moved from district level scoring to local level scoring with the Equity Index. This demonstrates a
good reactivity and adaptation to the new context.
49. The importance of partnerships for Equity: One of the strong contributing factors to advance
the Equity agenda has been the partnerships between the Government and Non-State Actors as
many of the projects supported by Non-State Actors aim to address equity issues more directly
even though as said before, these projects are not reflected in the ESIPs and Non-State Actors
were rarely invited during the design of the ESIPs. This collaboration allows to leverage funding for
Equity and deliver effective equity focus programs in particular geographical areas, drivers or
dimensions of Equity even though there are still some gaps to address among others, language
and disability disparities.
50. The importance of the Global Commitments on Equity: The global education focus on equity
and the fact that Nepal has an Equity Strategy also contribute positively as this allows a consistency
of support from Global to National level commitments in relation to the equity agenda. (Nepal is
aiming to reach SDG 4 of ensuring equitable access to quality education and life-long learning by
2030, which is also an overarching objective of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs) Global commitment
encourages donors and Countries to tend for more inclusion of equity in the Education sector plans.
For example, Equity is a central element in the Global Partnership in Education in which the World
Bank is the grant agent for the GPE grant implementation.
51. The importance of local decentralization and local leadership as positive contributors to
education outcomes. In some cases, too much centralization of work at the level of the chief
administrative officer (municipality level) was contributing to slow down the process. In other cases,
this time at school level, the leadership of the headmaster is seen as essential for the success of
the education system as per the quote below from a Non-State Actor interviewed.
‘’The headmaster has a great responsibility. He stays here 24 hours. He observes all the classes. He observes subject-wise classes from time to
time. All things are going ahead well in this school because of him. When the head writes a letter/application to the municipality, the municipality
provides the needed materials from time to time. He puts locks on the school and lets student go out only on time. He doesn't let students run from
school. If the children could, they would run away after lunch but he doesn't let them run away. If our school environment is good, if teacher staff
do their duty honestly, if they teach in a good way, if all the children are satisfied, everything goes well.’’ KII with a non-State actor
‘’Students don’t drop out here. Learning is good in comparison to past learning outcomes. When head sir came, since then there has been
improvements. Earlier, former head sir would come four-five days in a month. This present head sir stays here, in the school.’’ KII with a teacher
CONCLUSION EFFI.2. Have interventions that were initiated due to the Equity Strategy been implemented
within its planned timeframe? And Why?
Evaluative Judgement: Interventions were not implemented fully within its initial timeframe as several internal and
external factors have constrained the effective implementation of the strategy as per below. The main delay has
concerned the ESIPs that could not be implemented (for most of them) because of the limitation of movement due to
the COVID-19 situation.
▪ The index relies on limited data that have reduced its scope.
▪ Lack of key indicators of results and monitoring plans at LG level.
▪ Lack of sufficient social inclusion indicator at SSDP level
▪ The external context also contributed to delay the rolling out of the ES such as elections, transition to
federalism and COVID-19.
▪ Lessons from the few LGs who did implement activities from the ESIPs indicate that the first budget allocated
was used mainly to set up the ECD but more funding and time would be needed to address the root causes
of inequity issues.
▪ Lack of capacity and turnover of staff at LG level.
Some factors have contributed to accelerating the progress of implementation of the ES
99
▪ The role played by the members of the Equity and inclusion Technical Working, have been
instrumental in supporting the dissemination and support for the implementation of the Strategy. The
positive role played by WE, CEHRD and UNICEF to support the rolling out of the strategy in the pilot
municipalities have proven instrumental to kick start the process and accompanying the development of the
ESIPs.
▪ A good resilience and adaptability of both ES pillars to the new governance context.
▪ One of the strong contributing factors to advance the Equity-agenda has been the partnerships
(whether formalized or not) between the Government and Non State Actors as many of the projects
supported by Non-State Actors address equity issues more directly (even though these projects were not
reported in the ESIPs).
4.3 Opportunities for strengthening institutions and capacities
EFFI.3. Has the Equity Strategy EFFI 3.1 Sub question: Has the ES strengthened the institutional
strengthened the institutional set up within setup (coordination, collaboration, funding, reporting,
the education sector with regards to equity- implementation mechanisms..)?
based activities and how has the evolving EFFI 3.2 Sub question: Has the ES strengthened the capacity of the
federalization context of Nepal affected that? education staff to undertake data analysis and planning functions?
52. The design and formulation of the ESIPs offered an opportunity for LGs to learn from this planning
process and also attempted to design their plan based on real equity issues.
53. The planning related to the ES had more ownership in the sense that even though it took more
times to deliver, the whole process was conducted by the local authorities themselves with back
up support from WE.
54. Similarly, thanks to this initiative, the LGs have learnt to engage more with Disabled People
Organisations (DPO) and/or women groups which is important for an improved participatory
approach of planning. Nevertheless, as shared in this report, it is not clear if this consultation
process with non-state actors took place in all LGs. When this took place, the organizations
consulted were not always mentioned in the ESIPs plan or rarely mentioned.
55. The evaluation found evidence of capacity building support provided mainly in relation to data
analysis and planning but less in term of institutional setup (i.e coordination, collaboration,
reporting, implementation mechanisms..) which are also areas to strengthen as shared by one LG
met during the evaluation.
‘’Local level are given rights to conduct programs related to non-formal education but they don't do. That doesn't lie in their priority. I don't think
they should just provide guidelines, directions, coordination, facilitation and leave us. Only providing budget is not enough. We should also look at
the implementation aspect. We should also pay attention to knowledge, skill and attitude. So, there are different local problems. All 753
municipalities have their own problems.’’ KII with a LG education officer.
56. Overall, we found that the following activities and opportunities contributed to strengthen the staff
capacities through workshops and or mentoring and coaching interventions:
▪ Development of the equity resource index
▪ Further use of equity-based formulas to inform grants provided in the education sector
▪ Linkage with overall need based and evidence-based education sector planning at LG and school
level
▪ Linkage between school level and LG level planning
▪ Highlighting that provinces have the potential to be used as resource hubs for supporting LGs on
a need base for planning
▪ Revision on indicators in the new Education Sector Plan
100
CONCLUSION EFFI.3. Has the Equity Strategy strengthened the institutional set up within the education
sector with regards to equity-based activities and how has the evolving federalization context of Nepal
affected that?
Evaluative Judgment: Overall, the evaluation team found evidence of capacity building support provided mainly in
relation to data analysis and planning but less in term of institutional setup (i.e coordination, collaboration, reporting,
implementation mechanisms..)
The design and formulation of the ESIPs offered an opportunity for LGs to learn from the proposed planning process
and also assisted them to design their plan based on real equity issues. This was not always the case in the past
where some districts (who were then in charge of the education planning functions) were not familiar with equity-
based interventions.
The development of the ESIPs has been an opportunity to sensitize the LGs on data analysis, it shows also that more
trainings need to be conducted in this area for the LGs to be able to produce by themselves evidence-based plans.
5. Sustainability of the Equity Strategy
5.1 Level of sustainability of the Strategy in the context of COVID-19
S.1. To what extent the financial, operational and institutional capacities of the Government can sustain the results
of the Equity Strategy in the long-term? How has COVID-19 affected the sustainability of financial, operational and
institutional capacity of the Education Sector?
57. GON imposed a nationwide lockdown from March 24, 2020 to reduce the spread of COVID-19 with
new measures to ease the lockdown in June 2020.
58. In Nepal, millions of children have experienced a significant loss of learning during the 7-month
school closure, with large numbers of these children being at risk of not returning to appropriate
levels, or returning at all, without targeted support. Pro-active planning for the remaining 4 months
of this school year 2020/2021 and transition to the next is perceived by the education sector as
essential to address these critical issues to avoid reversing the impressive gains made in the past
decade.
59. Since May 2020, UNICEF has been tracking social and economic impacts of Covid-19.136 The data
show that in May 2020, more than 90% of children stopped going to school. Most children, including
those living in low-income households and belonging to marginalized groups lost access to
education at that point. However, children living in 29% of households studied at schools that
offered Distance Learning (DL). But only half of children with access to DL took advantage of it.
Even as the situation in terms of remote learning improved later, children from low-income
households and marginalized groups were most likely to struggle in comparison to their peers from
economically better off families.
60. The 2020 JRM Aide memoire reported that in terms of equity, gender parity at the basic level was
maintained and the reduction of the percentage of out of school children (6.2% vs the targeted
6.6%) would have enabled the achievement of the Year 5 target of 5%. However, this is now at risk
due to the extensive disruptions in school education in academic year (AY) 2020/21 because of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the decline of the share of enrolment of students from
vulnerable groups, in particular students with disabilities, despite the noted efforts made in past
136 UNICEF’s presentations can be accessed here: https://www.unicef.org/nepal/reports/covid-19-child-and-family-tracker-findings .
101
years to ensure equity in access to education, signals the importance of looking at the effectiveness
of interventions to reduce disparities in access, participation and learning for these groups.
61. The 2019-2020 Nepal Education annual status report found that the Food for Education (Mid – day
meal) Programme which is supported by World Food Program (WFP) distributed standard nutritious
meal to the home of each student of 7 districts (Darchula, Bajhan, Bajura, Achham, Doti, Jajarkot
and Dailekh). However, in the other districts, due to the remaining lockdown and services closed,
the Local Governments of 70 districts, were unable to distribute the grant to the community schools.
Distribution of Pro- Poor Targeted Scholarship were also delayed for the same reasons. All these
events may jeopardize the early achievements of the ES.
62. The conditional grants received by local governments included the new budget line ‘Continuation
of student learning during COVID 19’; but only 56.82% of this budget line was spent by the end of
the Fiscal Year, according to the 2020 JRM Aide Memoire dated on 08012020. The low expenditure
on some budget lines was a consequence of the disruption of activities due to the COVID-19
pandemic. Local governments were still able to spend 86.54% of their SSDP allocations.
S 1.1 To what extent is the Equity Strategy possible to be continued in terms of its implementation in the current
COVID-19 context?
63. The Equity Strategy is tied to the SSDP and to the overall context in which it interacts.
Below, the main measures and plans put in place by the government to mitigate the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic:
a. According to the ASIP 2020-2021 document, to address the COVID-19 crisis, the
government of Nepal rechannelled the education budget and Activities to address the
effects of COVID-19
b. Funding was transferred to all LGs to develop, transmit/broadcast and produce/print the
learning materials to students. NPR 100 million was allocated to each province at the
beginning of FY 2019/20 and they were authorized to utilize that budget in addressing also
the effect of COVID-19. NPR 11.20 million was reallocated for developing, producing and
broadcasting lessons through radio and television. Online teacher training provision has
been made to address the prevalent situation. Budget allocation to provinces has been
doubled for FY 2020/21 considering COVID-19 and other possible unforeseen disasters.
c. The following policies documents were drafted and circulated to guide the various level of
the education system during the COVID-19 time: Education cluster Contingency plan 2020;
Alternative Learning Facilitation Guidelines 2020;Emergency Action Plan for School
Education 2020; School Health Safety and Sanitation Guidelines 2020; School Reopening
Framework 2020 approved; Closed User Group (CUG) Service Implementation guidelines
developed so as to facilitate communication among teachers and students.
64. The Emergency Action Plan for School Education 2020137 includes the following 3 components.
Component 1: Remote learning methods for continued learning for all children, including children
with disabilities ( CwD ) and marginalized. Component 2: Support to Provinces and Selected Local
Governments to support safe re opening and continued learning. Component 3: Management,
Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation.
65. The development of the Alternative Learning Facilitation Guidelines and the Closed User Group
Service Implementation Guidelines is expected to mitigate the disruption to children’s learning from
the closure of schools since the start of AY 2020/21. According to the MTR team138, the recent
approval of the school reopening framework was hailed as a milestone to facilitate local

102
governments to start the process of reopening schools, although there is an urgent need to confirm
the mechanism to monitor the adherence of disinfection and safety protocols.
66. Nepal's applied for US$11 million COVID-19 funding from GPE (through the World bank) to support
the Government in undertaking the activities in its Education Cluster COVID-19 Contingency Plan
(ECCCP) and fund activities to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 to enable learning to continue
during short-term, periodic, and long-term school closures, enable schools to safely resume and
mitigate the impacts on students and teachers including loss of learning time and psychosocial
impacts.
67. As part of its COVID 19 School Sector Response (GPE) supplementary program to mitigate the
effects of COVID-19, the World Bank included a Sub-component 2.3: Schools grants to schools
from selected local governments. The sub-component will support most disadvantaged local
governments (100-125 LGs) in regions that have been impacted by COVID-19 through school
grants to ensure safe re-opening of schools and continued learning but also139 LGs considered as
low equity status and access to alternatives facilities i.e. internet/TV/Radio etc
68. Equity-related strategies and activities have been integrated in the education COVID-19
contingency plan. During the 9th of April 2020 Equity TWG, it was shared that the contingency plan
adopted a need-based approach in dividing the school-aged population into (i) children able to
access digital/ online learning resources, (ii) children able to access media for distance/home-
based learning resources and (iii) children not able to access any of the two above options (off-
grid). Within that last group, a sub-group of children most at risk140 was identified.
69. Teaching and learning had continued through the alternative modalities of online, local community,
home-based, face to face and contact classes and through radio, sibling support, project work and
home-based tasks. Digital learning, printed packs, tole (community) education and partial school
opening were reported to be more successful than radio and TV-based classes. The main focus
was said to have been on reaching out to students while assessments of the quality and learning
achievement had yet to be carried out. Below an example of activity implemented:
‘’During COVID UNICEF/world education has given thermal gun to measure temperature and water tank for hand wash. I also arranged some
facilities from other organizations too. During COVID lockdown, I did meeting through online and we arranged for home learning also in at the level
of the village, ward and settlements. Home learning was done under this same program. It was effective in the sense that the children were
continuously busy in learning. The children were taught by school teachers, parents and upper graders like eleven/twelve grade students that also
helped at their own homes the smaller children.’’ KII with a learning motivator from an NGO
S 1.2 How resilient is the Equity Strategy to changes and what are possible risks that can prevent its results from
being sustained?
The Risks Inherent to the lack of capacity to deliver in the Transition to Federalism.
70. A 2020 study141 found that sector ministries are under-capacitated with respect to their federal
mandate (policy-setting and monitoring and evaluation) and over-capacitated with respect to
implementation functions for which they are no longer responsible (WB-UNDP, 2019).
71. The same report highlighted that the transition to federalism has also increased the need for
systematic capacity-building for elected officials and civil servants at all levels, at great cost, and
for which a comprehensive strategy is still lacking.

disabilities, children from poor or marginalized communities, etc.)

72. Another issue is also the ‘’new chain of command’’ and possible centralization of decision- making
power at local level (at the level of the chief administrator of the Municipality) with potential impact
on the effective organisation and speed of the work in the education sector as well as in other
sectors of development. It seems of utmost importance to clarify respective responsibilities of duty
bearers occupying decision-making positions at all levels of the education system in the context of
transitioning to the new federal structure.
‘’Earlier, there was a district education office and other offices that used to work, now that has been decentralized the power lies mainly with the
Chief Administrator. If the chief administrator and accountant are absent or have other priorities then the whole work of the rural village municipality
gets stuck.’’ Source: KII with Education officer.
‘’Even though we might have an education focal person (at LG level), the administrative officer has a great role to convince mayor,
associate/assistant mayor, to decide how to move ahead.’’ KII with a non-state actor.
73. Lack of priority given to the education sector. Many LG reported that in the context of the
decentralization, because of competing priorities, education was not given enough interest by the
municipality council. Also, the focus was often on improving infrastructures rather than supporting
teacher capacity development activities. In some cases, priority is given to secondary education
which also creates some tensions between the various education levels as per the quote below.
‘’Primary level is blamed for poor performance. The secondary level blames primary level in this respect. But, when we tell them to support primary
level for the same reason, they want to get the support for themselves (secondary level). This is an irony.’’ KII with an NGO worker
Risks related to the new context of the COVID-19 situation.
74. The Equity Strategy is very much dependant on its implementation context and more
importantly COVID-19 impacts on children and on the education sector as a whole. Various recent
documents highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic had and is having a devastating impact on
children’s lives and wellbeing, including a significant loss of learning, disproportionately affecting
students from the most vulnerable groups.
75. Substantial investments will need to be made to ensure that schools used as quarantine
centres are properly disinfected to meet standards on safe class-sizes, water, sanitation and
hygiene facilities to ensure the safe return of students to school and to enable the staggered
resumption of education across regions and among different social groups.
76. The COVID-19 context may impact the education sector for a longer time, with schools
reopening and later re-closing, as has happened in some countries. This shows the need to
establish strong links between formal and alternative education that allows learning to continue as
students return to schools or have to resume learning from home. This also emphasizes the need
for a monitoring system that tracks children’s status to help prevent the most vulnerable ones from
dropping out during these transitions and to track their learning.
77. Financing and reporting risks for the education sector: As reported in the latest Education
Economic and Public Finance Analysis142, because of the COVID-19 situation, the federal
government is facing challenges in revenue mobilization and public expenditures management
which introduces risks on public financing, private funding, and education financing provision in
general. The level of Households’ spending shows a strong demand for education, but also raises
a question of equity in access to quality education as wealthier families tend to enrol their children
more in private schools.143 Family education spending is dependent on financial transfers received
from workers abroad and could be constrained by the uncertain development of these transfers
due to the economic and health crisis.

Economic and Public Finance Analysis and Projection of the Nepal Education Sector Final report. Oct 2020
143 The level of Household spending shows a strong demand for education, but also a certain disaffection with community schools:
despite a significant additional cost, a large number of families choose feepaying education, no doubt because of the perception of
better supervision of children and better results, but also for the mastery of English or for the sake of social distinction
104
78. Transition to Federalism accentuates the difficulties in reporting information (because of lack
of capacity or access to electronic transmission of data in some cases), between the various tiers
of the federal system. This was highlighted in the study as several Development Partners are linking
their disbursements to the attainment of indicators. Difficulties in a proper flow of information
increase the burden of progress reports, timely assessment of DLIs and could add to the difficulties
in the release of foreign resources on time in the future.
79. Risks of increased dropouts: The desk review and discussions with various stakeholders indicate
that the COVID-19 pandemic has further intensified the issues of family poverty, disadvantaged
and marginalized family members, and family unemployment services. As highlighted by the
Education Economic and Public Finance Analysis144, a large number of education beneficiaries
from the school and technical education and higher education levels are deprived of education,
information, understanding, skills, and abilities by the lockdown measures and school closure. The
socio- economic impacts are likely to be reflected through increases in school dropouts, child
labour, and early marriages.
80. The following challenges and risks have been identified in the Education Contingency plan:
▪ Ensuring an aligned approach and intergovernmental coordination between Federal, Provincial
and Local level cluster mechanisms to align response plans and budgets at all levels
▪ Schools being used as quarantine centers, risking schools to have to remain closed beyond
the official reopening date to complete quarantine periods and allow disinfection
▪ Ensuring schools are able to comply with requirements such as adequate WASH and sanitation
facilities and social distancing (especially in the more densely populated Terai and the remote
mid and far west)
▪ Funding gap to ensure adequate response in current scenario and scenario 2 of the plan.
81. There have also been concerns145 that existing technological discrepancies, the digital and socio-
economic divides, and a divide in terms of parents’ literacy rate could contribute to widen the gaps
in access and quality of education for the most marginalized groups. Some believe that the COVID-
19 response may cause further educational inequity and socio-economic exclusion: ‘’The current
ICT infrastructure and the distribution of access in the urban and rural areas have created two tiers
of inequalities among Nepalese citizens, i.e. between students who live in an urban area and those
from a rural area, and between the rich and poor who can barely afford to access the internet’’.
82. In Nepal, a majority of schools do not have computer facilities and therefore use internet cafe to
upload EMIS related information. Furthermore, only 12,4 % of community schools use computer in
teaching learning activities. This figure could be used as a proxy indicator of the limited potential
computer knowledge of students (as we may assume that most of the knowledge of poor children
come from the schools since they may not have access to a computer at school) as described in
the table below.

83. Lack of ICT equipment is an important issue in the schools as evidenced in the quote below:
‘’ Computer course is a compulsory subject from class 6 to 10. Last year only we obtained 9 computers and total number of students in
grade 6 is 72, in grade 7 there are 63 and in class 8 there are 78; in practical class each student doesn’t even get time to touch the
computer.’’ Source: KII with head teacher
84. According to a recent study done by Humanity and Inclusion (HI) in 21 districts all over 7 provinces
in Nepal, 83% parents/caregivers of children with disabilities feared that their children would fall
behind in learning due to COVID-19 (HI, 2020). Seventy percent (70%) of them also reported lack
of suitable learning materials as the top barriers. The study suggests that fundamental principles
of inclusive education have to be expanded to digital learning platforms as well.
85. The stakeholders of the December 2020 meeting146 recognized the varying contexts of different
schools and for different students in the same schools, and hence suggested that a highly
contextualized approach be adopted to support local governments and schools, rather than a
blanket approach. The plans for provision of free internet connections via sim cards by telecom
companies was welcomed as a positive initiative to reduce the digital divide; although many
students do not have devices to use this provision.
86. The government with technical support by UNICEF through WE and the schools, organized a
network of communication with schools and parents that has contributed to reach the students
during the COVID-19 health crisis.
‘’We made teachers' group. After that teachers made a group of parents who they knew. Whenever we got good materials, we used to share to the
group, the group used to share to the teachers and the teachers used to share to the parents. So we also conducted home education in each
settlement. Later when things began to be normal, we conducted settlement education. After everything was back to a normal situation we asked
them to come to school. We did not leave municipalities on their own during the pandemic.’’ KII with a field staff from WE
87. Implication of the COVID on the development of the ESIPs. During the 9th April 2020 Equity
TWG, the participants to the meeting indicated that all selected local governments will most likely
need to start again on their ESIP development given that their baseline and needs will have
significantly changed once the schools reopen.
Risks related to an unfinished agenda on Quality, Efficiency and Equity in the education sector
88. Lack of expertise in data analysis at local level: The resource centers (RCs) and resource
persons (RPs) had mandates to support educational development in the satellite (cluster) schools,
to ensure the smooth implementation of the pedagogical reforms and follow up on teachers’
professional development at school level. They also served as data collection centers, supporting
information flows from and to the DEO, including data collection for the EMIS. A qualitative study147
indicated in 2011 that the Resource Center used to spend most of their time on data Collection and
Record Management. Their dissolution, accompanied by the reduction in the number of education
training centers, had significant impacts both on regular data collection and the system’s capacity
to follow-up and provide support on the quality improvement process at school level.148
89. Factors that affect progress of the SSDP and by extension will affect the expected outcomes
of the ES: The MTR of the SSDP noted important progress that has been made during the first
half of the program in terms of developmental activities but also that several factors are likely to
affect progress in the coming years as per below:
▪ the high number of core reforms implemented at the same time.
▪ the high level of technical expertise necessary to implement them.

▪ the time needed to implement systemic reform in order to solve long pending issues before
moving forward.
▪ the time needed to develop a common understanding of the different reforms and activities
implemented at all levels of the education system, including the different levels of education
management, but also communities, pedagogical teams and parents.
▪ the time needed to disseminate new tools and practices through the education management
system at all levels.
▪ limited human and financial resources.
90. Pending and systemic issues in the education sector raised during the December 2020
meeting between the Government and the MTR team, included the motivation of teachers to teach,
the implementation of policies and programs, coordination between the levels of government and
between different stakeholders, building the capacity of teachers, the continuity of learning, the use
of technology, equitable access, reporting and monitoring and school safety.
91. The main remaining challenges were said to be related to communication during the crisis,
monitoring and evaluation from the center and at the local level, overcoming learning losses,
achievement and opportunity gaps and capacity gaps.
92. The shortage of teachers and issue with staff redeployment: The main preoccupation of
education stakeholders and teachers is that in many poor LGs, there are not enough teachers in
place or there are teachers volunteers who often resign because of their limited salary. As
described before, lack of clear instructions on teacher redeployment is a core issue to address. In
the current context, it is therefore difficult to ensure that enrolled children will remain at schools.
‘’I am chairperson of the School Management Committee. In our school we have 1620 students and we only have 17 teachers. We run the classes
in two shifts. For grade 6-12, we have morning classes from 6am to 10:30am, and from 10:30am to 4pm for nursery to grade 5. We have done this
because there is a scarcity of room and teachers.’’ KII with chairperson of SMC

have been enhanced through various trainings on Equity Index and its use in program
implementation. Nevertheless, the ES is at a pilot stage and government staff shared with WE that
it is not clear to them how funding will be secured to scale up the initiative in other LGs in the
future. More particularly, respondents at field level have concerns that funds allocated may
not be used solely for equity based interventions but also for other education needs.
’Sometimes the budget solely made for ESIP program might be allocated to other areas, which is a trend seen previously in other sectors. I am
still not 100% sure that all budget would go to the designated planned program.’’ KII with LG education officer
Risks of future dropouts related to the family context.
94. There are still some chances that Children recently brought back to school drop out again because
of the attraction to find jobs in India.
‘’The trend of enrolling but dropping out of school is still ongoing, although it has decreased compared to past years. They leave to go to India to
earn. Mostly drop out students increase after the completion of class 6-7, out of which children of Dalit community are higher in numbers. Most
students are present in class regularly except in emergency cases.’’ KII with a SMC chair
95. Below some reasons for drop out shared by a head teacher interviewed.
‘’In our area, parents lack awareness about education and those who have well family background do get enrolled in our school. Dropout
reasons:
1)Families who can afford do transfer students to private school and when we collect data later they are calculated as dropouts and increase
the dropout rate.
2)Due to marriage, esp. girls (studying in 6-10 grades) and they drop out of school after getting married.
107
3)Another is related with poor economic condition of the family and parents encourage their children to earn money so send them to India.
This results in students appearing just to give final exams. Approx. 20% of students are like that.
4)Some even randomly drops out of school. Even students enrolled don't have required competencies to their grade/level.’’

CONCLUSION S.1. To what extent can the financial, operational and institutional capacities of the
Government sustain the results of the Equity Strategy in the long-term? How has COVID-19 affected the
sustainability of financial, operational and institutional capacity of the Education Sector?
Evaluative Judgement: The federal transition seriously challenges the sustainability of the ES. Sector ministries,
including the education sector are under-capacitated with respect to their federal mandate (policy-setting and
monitoring and evaluation) and over-capacitated with respect to implementation functions for which they are no longer
responsible. The transition to federalism has also increased the need for systematic capacity-building for elected
officials and civil servants at all levels, at great cost, and for which a comprehensive strategy is still lacking, including
in the education sector.
The COVID-19 situation has seriously restricted the access to education services for all children and most likely the
children from poor families who have limited access to ICT materials. Before the health crisis, schools were already
poorly equipped in computer and internet access. There have been about existing technological discrepancies, the
digital and socio-economic divides, and a divide in terms of parents’ literacy rate and how those discrepancies could
contribute to widen the gaps in access and quality of education for the most marginalized groups.
In some schools, because of the pandemic, it was not possible to distribute the mid-day meal grant to the community
schools. Distribution of Pro- Poor Targeted Scholarship was also delayed for the same reasons. All these events may
jeopardise the early achievements of the ES.
Below the possible risks identified during the evaluation that could restrained the sustainability of the ES results:
▪ The Risks inherent to the lack of capacity to deliver in the Transition to Federalism.
▪ Lack of priority given to the education sector at LGs level and a focus on infrastructure rather than on service
delivery and quality.
▪ Risks related to the COVID-19 context that is likely to impact the education sector for a long period and
damaging more the most vulnerable
▪ Family education spending is dependent on financial transfers received from workers abroad and could be
constrained by the uncertain development of these transfers due to the economic and health crisis.
▪ Difficulties in a proper flow of information in the context of the new federal structure increase the burden of
progress reports, timely assessment of DLIs and could add to the difficulties in the release of foreign resources
on time in the future.
▪ A large number of education beneficiaries from the school and technical education and higher education levels
are deprived of education, information, understanding, skills, and abilities by the lockdown measures and
school closure. The socio- economic impacts are likely to be reflected through increases in school dropouts,
child labour, and the proportion of early marriages.
▪ Risks related to an unfinished agenda on Quality, Efficiency and Equity in the education sector
▪ The ES is at a pilot stage and government staff shared that it is not clear to them how funding will be secured
to scale up the initiative in other districts in the future. More particularly, respondents at field level have concerns
that funds allocated may not be used solely for equity-based interventions.

5.2 Contribution of the Strategy in strengthening capacities
S.2. Has the equity strategy facilitated/attributed to strengthening capacity of education sector duty bearers and
stakeholders to address education disparities?
96. Based on our discussions at federal and local level, the design and implementation of the ES has
contributed to strengthen the capacity of education staff mainly in the 15 focused districts supported
by UNICEF on 1) understanding of Equity Issues, 2) on planning and integration of equity into the
planning cycle 3) on data analysis.149 Nevertheless because of the important capacity gaps and the
lack of sufficient human resources at LGs and provincial levels, this should rather be seen as a
work in progress during a first pilot phase that would need to be strengthened in the future.
97. Feedback received from the people who attended the capacity building activities related to planning
shared positive feedback about the trainings they had received as per the quote below:
‘’Our capacity has improved drastically. After returning from the training in Nepalgunj we were confused regarding strategy planning preparation but
after the 3 day facilitation program conducted in Dipayal, we finalized the plan, and we learned how to do it, how to prioritize. Now we can do planning
conveniently. When we were making plan, the chief sirs from the Social Development Directorate (of Province 7) which is located in Dipayal also
facilitated. They provided technical support.’’ KIIs with a head teacher
98. Much more would need to be undertaken in the comings months on ensuring that the education
staff at all levels have received proper trainings on planning, data analysis, coordination and
monitoring, evaluation and reporting. Capacity gaps are found at all levels as mentioned by this
respondent:
‘’Province also lacks sufficient human resources. I can talk about myself as we need 7 people in OCMC but we have just 1 staff that was provided
by the central government. If we have more staff, the Province can support in piloting and helping in capacity development through experience
exchange. Model demonstration is another work needed to be done by the provincial level and inter local government coordination, IT support, health
hygiene, materials for awareness, etc. Facilitating the local levels is the main work for the provincial government.’’ KII with a provincial level education
director
Sub Question S 2.1: To what extent the inclusion of the Equity Index has contributed (or not) to improve the EMIS?
99. The EI team worked with EMIS managers on the inconsistencies that had emerged in the initial EI
calculations, which led to the first changes in the classifications of the worst performing districts.
The Data Quality Assessment Report related to the 15 districts that has been shared with the
Evaluation team indicates that an extensive review of the database was conducted with the team
of DOE. The main goal of this exercise was to address the data quality issues raised on different
forums and discussions, especially for 12 districts with regard to survival rate and SLC rate.
100. Two basic sources of data errors were looked for: 1) Error in the database itself as a result of
wrong information entered at the beginning. 2) Error in the data used to compute the EI because
of data processing error such as wrong formula, error of copying/pasting and syntax error.
Explanation provided for the error in the data was related to the fact that initially, the urban/rural
and Dalit/non-Dalit definition was not well defined in the EMIS. (This has now been fixed). In
addition, there was a transition period where the data collection system was changed from form
based to EMIS. This could have led to confusions and errors while entering the data.
101. SLC data for Mustang district was reviewed and major corrections were made to improve the
accuracy. There were some districts such as Mustang, Dang, Sarlahi and Rautahat whose
enrolment ratio for the year 2014-2015 exceeded values up to 900%. The enrolment data for the
districts were then re-extracted from the database with ‘’massive improvements’’ in the data quality
according to the report.
102. While the index is being embedded in the EMIS, our findings suggest that since the introduction
of the index until very recently, no calculation seems to have been made to examine the evolution
of the index (Between 2016 base year and 2020).
149 The process of designing the ESIPs has involved several government staff organised under a planning committee which offers an
additional opportunity for the processing of education-related information of the rural municipality, analysing the data, identifying the
academic issue and, accordingly, formulating a plan
109
Sub question S 2.2: To what extent, the strategy is effectively answering to supply and demand needs at the national
and sub national levels in the education sector for a more equitable education?
Equity based interventions are mainly oriented towards enhancing demand for services and less
on strengthening the supply side of the education system
103. The MTR of the SSDP reported that key achievements150 at the end of SSRP School Sector
Reform Plan/SSRP (2009–2016) were made thanks to two strategies: i) the progressive
decentralization of education service delivery through the creation of school management
committees (SMCs) as functional, accountable bodies engaging communities in education, and ii)
the introduction of a targeted demand-side program, through scholarship programs for female
students and children from disadvantaged caste/ethnicity groups, income groups, and geographic
regions; the provision of free textbooks, and; the provision of salary and non-salary per capita
financing (PCF) based grants for quality enhancement.
104. As it is the case in other countries, back to school campaign are generally quite effective to bring
children to schools, the issue that remains is how to make sure those children effectively remain at
school. Reason given by children for dropping out is mainly related to poverty. Nevertheless,
studies have shown that even if the child’ family is poor, parents will tend to leave the child at school
provided that he/she has some good school results, implying that the focus should be on improving
the school system (the supply side of the education system) to ensure better retention rate.
105. As we already discussed in this report, the bias toward a demand side activity is linked with the
actual limitation of the EI around access and participation. Taking into account the learning
dimension should question new elements relative to supply side (teacher quality, students/teachers
ratios…) but also lead to analyse new local situations where the schools are performing well without
the required equipment. That is the heart of the new DMS positive deviant school study currently
being designed actually with UNICEF support.
106. As described in this report, the planned interventions mainly address the demand side of the
sector and less the supply side. Equity based interventions did include some aspects related to the
supply component but they are mainly aiming to address the lack of economic income of the
families (school meals, pro poor scholarship and provision of text books) and as explained before,
in the review of the SSRP School Sector Reform Plan/SSRP (2009–2016), had some effects mainly
on access.
107. Findings from many studies have shown that the key remaining concerns in the education sector
in Nepal are not necessarily related to access of marginalized population groups to the education
system (At the notable exception of the children with disabilities) but rather associated to a problem
of quality (which influence retention and learning outcomes). As reported by a recent news article151,
it is difficult to talk about quality when there is not enough teachers.
‘’The kids don't have any problem. They have willpower, they have desire, they are creative, they are doing good. The problems lie within us-
teachers who are appointed by the government. We have not been able to return to the government for what it has been paying to us. We lack
many things.’’ KII with one head teacher of secondary school.
108. As reported by stakeholders working in the field, by LGs and provinces consulted and through
several recent studies, one of the key bottlenecks for school retention (including most probably the
recently admitted Out of Schools) and improvement of learning outcomes, is the lack of teachers
in the school system and more particularly in the low performing LGs and issues with the way
150 Such as the net enrolment rate (NER) for primary education increased from 71.0 percent in 1998 to 96.9 percent in 2016 (the NER
for girls increased from 61.0 to 96.6 percent in the same period). The primary cycle completion rate increased from 58.0 percent in
2004 to 80.0 percent in 2016, and the percentage of out-of-school children (OoSC) among 5-12 year old children decreased from 21.0
to 14.8 percent between 2003/04 and 2010/11. Gender parity in the NER at the primary (grades 1-5), basic (grades 1-8), and
secondary (grades 9-12) levels had already been achieved. Similarly, disparities in education access across income groups and
ethnic/caste groups decreased significantly during this period.
151 https://kathmandupost.com/national/2021/02/07/government-yet-to-fill-teacher-vacancies-even-as-decline-in-education-quality-is-
reported
110
teachers are deployed across the schools which is not always based on needs. Teachers are the
number one priority of the LGs but their hands seem to be tied as the current teacher rationalization
and redeployment plan is not yet operational, as it is being revised as part of the drafting of the new
Federal Education Act.
109. When central government152 doesn't provide the required teachers, the schools and local
government cope in recruiting volunteer teachers but because of the low salary, they tend to resign
after few months. A recent article153 in the national daily newspaper Kathmandu Post reported that
around 10 percent or 13,000 teacher positions154 are vacant as the Teachers Service Commission
has not been able to announce vacancies for the last three years.155
110. Therefore, we believe that the successes of the strategy should not be limited to local actions that
would have been induced by the ranking resulting from the EI and the proposal of solutions to be
implemented only at the local level as the issues at stake are mainly related to gaps in supply that
can not necessarily be addressed locally. (ex: reduce structural heterogeneity between schools,
decide on policies such as multilingualism, addressing the shortage of teachers and high turnover
of staff in some districts...).
111. This view point is not shared by everyone since some LGs did indeed include activities to
strengthen ECD or madrassas in their plans. More study on the availability of resource at school
level (resource index) by district is probably necessary to shed light on this point, as it would
probably highlight the fact that activities to improve the supply of education services must be
considered at the national level and that local mobilization of the demand for services, as is
currently the case with the focus on equity-based interventions, may not be enough to address the
issues of inequity. Governance, leadership, motivation from teachers and teaching quality are the
main issues that should be addressed through supply-focused interventions.
112. This evaluation found that Palikas have a good understanding on how to tackle access and
participation but less on how to address learning outcomes. As a consequence, the ESIPs do not
include sufficient activities to address this dimension.
CONCLUSION S.2. Has the equity strategy facilitated/attributed to strengthening capacity of education sector
duty bearers and stakeholders to address education disparities?
Evaluative Judgement: The design and implementation of the ES has contributed to strengthen the capacity of
education staff mainly in the 15 focused districts supported by the government through UNICEF contribution on 1)
understanding of Equity Issues, 2) on planning and integration of equity into the planning cycle 3) on data analysis.156
Nevertheless, because of the important capacity gaps and the lack of sufficient human resources at LGs and provincial
levels, this should rather be seen as a work in progress that would need to be strengthened in the future.
The inclusion of the Equity Index in EMIS has contributed to improve its quality as the EI team and the EMIS managers
has worked together on resolving the inconsistencies that had emerged in the initial EI calculations, which led to the
first changes in the classifications of the worst performing districts. Progress in access to quality data is however still
an area of progress.
152 The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) is responsible for teacher licensing and recruitment
153 https://kathmandupost.com/national/2021/02/07/government-yet-to-fill-teacher-vacancies-even-as-decline-in-education-quality-is-
reported
154 There are 150,000 permanent positions of teachers in over 29,000 public schools across the country.
155 The government has yet to appoint the chairperson and members to the commission.
156 The process of designing the ESIPs has involved several government staff organised under a planning committee which offers an
additional opportunity for the processing of education-related information of the rural municipality, analysing the data, identifying the
academic issue and, accordingly, formulating a plan
111
LESSONS LEARNT
The following lessons learnt can be drawn from this evaluation.
1. Programming interventions at municipality level should go hand in hand with capacity building and
coaching activities (related mainly to data analysis, planning, coordination, monitoring and
reporting) to accompany the transition to federalism at local level.
2. A well-established information and coordination process at Federal level (Through the Equity and
Inclusion TWG and discussion during JRM and BRM) does not necessarily translate in the same
functioning processes at local levels were less cross sectoral collaboration within departments and
with non-State Actors was observed for the design and implementation of the ESIPs.
3. Presentation of the data in a user friendly format for planning purpose is important for data analysis
at local level while transitioning to the new federal structure. Full integration of the EI into EMIS will
facilitate this process as the system will automatically compute the relevant information.
4. Political awareness and education of local representatives157 makes an important difference in the
understanding of equity and on prioritization of financial and human resources for the education
sector at municipality level. This means that they should be included in any capacity building efforts.
5. Having an equity focused strategy does indeed contribute to raising awareness but also in
delivering equitable outcomes for children. The issue to consider is to develop evidence based,
thoroughly analyzed and well-prepared interventions that hit the right targets. This has also to do
with the enabling environment such as the national capacity, finances and systems.
6. With the Equity Strategy, it is important to invest in capacities and systems which help to ensure
results-based management and sustainability. By RBM, we mean ‘converting interventions into
tangible and evidence-based results’’ that demonstrate narrowing gaps in access to education by
all children in Nepal.
7. Budget management and budget transparency is also key to track dedicated budget allocation for
equity in the education sector.158

CONCLUSIONS
RELEVANCE
The 2014 equity strategy responded to an identified need to test an innovative approach of using
education data for equitable resource allocation and targeted programming. It was pioneer in
addressing equity issues in accordance with an analysis of equity dimensions and explaining factors.
Moreover, it succeeded in moving equity consideration fairly high on the Nepalese education policy agenda.
However, the definition of equity underpinning the Strategy and calculated by the index has 3 major
interrelated weaknesses:
▪ The strategy addressed equity issues adopting a cross-cutting definition where individual
characteristics and social barriers prevail (poverty, caste, gender, disability). It is not focused on
educational needs. Data for SLC exam was not available for all Local Governments – hence not
used initially for analysis. Once the data will be available for all LGs for grade 8, the learning
dimension will be added in the index. Only few local equity plan analyzed by the evaluation team
addressed learning needs or promoted equalization of learning opportunities within the school
environment.
▪ The design of the index and proposed measurement of deprivation across districts underlies a
linear complementarity (and equal weight) between access-participation-learning outcomes. At
international level, the analysis of schooling trends usually considers learning perspectives above
the participation (and sometimes even before the access), bearing in mind that weak learning
outcomes are a major cause of dropout. The index therefore failed to capture the learning
explanations to drop-out. The evaluation team also questions the idea that there would be a “main
driver” of inequity because of their cumulative and hierarchical nature, where poverty always ranks
first.
▪ The strategy focusses on education demand, understood mainly under the access and
participation dimensions. ESIPs activities mainly concerned measures focussing on these two
dimensions, mainly enrolment campaigns and participation measures (meals, hygiene products for
girls). The quality of education supply in the most vulnerable areas was not addressed nor
analysed. In reality, school provision is differentiated in terms of quality (community versus
institutional, concentration of "good" teachers in several privileged localities, huge differences in
learning environments, etc.). Thus, access to differentiated education service provision can
lead to different participation and learning.
COHERENCE
The Equity strategy was coherent with Nepalese international commitments and paved the way to further
effort implied by the 2030 Agenda in terms of nationwide quality and equitable educational provision. It was
adopted within a context of major governance change (the new Federal structure) and progressive
ownership of the new governance mechanisms by national and local decision makers. As such, the Equity
strategy proved coherent with the evolving context and fully adaptive. With the transition to federalism and
new division of competences, the ES targets additional financing to local government levels / municipalities,
thus making pillar 2 (the ESIPs) dependent upon local planning capacity and prerogatives.
This focus reduces the scope of possible measures when they do not depend upon local governments, in
particular major policy levers revolving around human resource (among them teacher affectation and
capacity development, for instance to identify student’s needs, management of the diversity in classrooms
and building trust with parents). As teacher-related measures still refer to national competence, more
coherence could have been expected at local level to align local efforts with education policy decisions
taken at national level. In this context, the evaluation team noted a limited internal coherence of the Equity
strategy and inconsistency between the highly comprehensive dimension of the index and the limited scope
of implemented measures in the field.
113
EFFECTIVENESS
Our analysis of effectiveness is partly nurtured by Nepalese school enrollment performance. Undoubtably,
the implementation period of the equity strategy was a strong momentum for effective reduction in the
aggregate number of OoSC at national level. A good performance of most of the 15 targeted districts
is confirmed in terms of access,159 and the gender gap was effectively addressed. Parity in basic
education, already acquired nationwide at Lower basic level, is now achieved at Upper basic level, with
girls even over-represented in lower basic both at national level and in the targeted districts. As noted by
the Nepalese government, this phenomenon is partly the reflec of boys’ preference for ‘institutional’ or
‘private’ schools as well as frequent seasonal migration due to labour market demand.
The evaluation team confirms the number of 256 000 OoSC reintegrated into schools with little grade-
related variation, suggesting that the campaigns were effective for all age groups. However, caste and
ethnicity-related barriers still remain poorly addressed, with some trends to be confirmed by further
demographic data, for instance the decrease in Janajatis enrolments over the past 10 years.
Our analysis also shows a decrease in survival rates in districts that have experienced recent rapid
increases in enrolment, more visible at Lower basic level than at upper basic level. These results confirm
the demand-orientation of the ES that succeeded in bringing many children back to schools but did not
foster increased school capacity to help them remain in schools and learn. To summarize, the index proved
effective for ranking purposes, and succeeded in triggering new and effective measures targeting mostly
school enrolment and participation. It was rather misused or poorly understood by education planers and
policy makers to inform needs-based programming and equity-focused measures.
In quantitative terms, only 13% of LGs have endorsed their ESIP plan by January 2021, although in many
cases, ESIP development successfully triggered the development of a general LG education plan
where they were still missing. Broadly, the initial rationale according to which understanding equity
dimensions would lead to more tailored and diversified actions did not really materialize in the field.
Interventions analyzed by the evaluation team were quite similar from one ESIP to another and focused
mainly on “mainstream” OoSC (back to school campaigns representing the bulk of funding) and general
participation measures (meals and girls hygiene products). In other words, and despite the strong increase
in analytical data available, equity interventions designed and implemented failed to address the needs of
the highest number of excluded children, namely those in school but not learning (disability, poverty,
language…). The evaluation also underlines the role played by the members of the Equity and inclusion
Technical Working, as well as UNICEF, CERHD and World Education have been instrumental in
supporting the dissemination and support for the implementation of the Strategy.
EFFICIENCY
Considering the limited scope of the index and effects of ESIP development support, its current use and its
reduction in scope compared to what was initially planned, one can ask if the development of the index was
a cost-effective targeting system compared to other (potentially less sophisticated) strategies.
The question of its efficiency refers more to the capacity of local planners to use the ES effectively (or even
use possible alternative in terms of equity analysis through the use of the estimation of enrolment profiles)
Also, a lot of effort went into training LG education staff to prepare the plans in regional workshops. These
were valuable for building large commitment from Central, Provincial and Local Governments but were
159 The OOSC reduction in the targeted district exceeded the national reduction
114
made less effective because of strong staff turnover. Alternative solutions were identified, among them the
WE-sponsored blended training strategy, proving relevant and more efficient in the COVID-19 context.
However, ESIP did not always address the root causes of inequity. The funding allocated for each
municipality was quite limited and it was not clear how and to what extent the budget was used for the
implementation of the ESIPs in the absence of accountability, dedicated budget line to track the allocation
of funds and lack of M&E mechanisms at LG level.
Overall, the evaluation team found evidence of capacity building support provided mainly in relation to data
analysis and planning but less in term of institutional setup (i.e coordination, collaboration, reporting and
implementation mechanisms).
SUSTAINABILITY
The COVID-19 context is a strong challenge for the equity strategy’s sustainability, both in terms of
development results and in terms of equity acquis. There are concerns that existing technological
discrepancies, the digital and socio-economic divides, and a divide in terms of parents’ literacy rate could
contribute to widen the gaps in access and quality of education for the most marginalized groups. In some
schools, the pandemic context hampers mid-day meal grant distribution and delayed pro-poor targeted
scholarships. As part of its CoVID-19 School Sector Response (GPE) supplementary program to mitigate
the effects of COVID-19, the World Bank included a Sub-component 2.3: Schools grants to schools from
selected local governments. The sub-component will support most disadvantaged local governments (100-
125 LGs) in regions that have been impacted by COVID-19 through school grants to ensure safe re-opening
of schools and continued learning160 .
The transition to federalism is also a major challenge for the sustainability of the strategy, with limited
capacity to deal with education supply at LG level and thus potential risk for LGs to focus on infrastructures
rather than on quality. Still, the design and implementation of the ES has contributed to strengthen the
capacity of education staff in the 15 focused districts on 1) understanding of Equity Issues, 2) integration of
equity into the planning cycle and 3) on data analysis.161
Nevertheless, because of the important capacity gaps and the lack of sufficient human resources at LGs
and provincial levels, this should rather be seen as a work in progress during a first pilot phase that would
need to be strengthened in the future. A major bottleneck for the retention of children at schools (including
most probably the recently reintegrated OoSC children) and improvement of learning outcomes, remains
the shortage of teachers in the low performing LGs and issue with the way teachers are deployed across
the schools which is not always based on needs. Improved consideration of educational needs and learning
outcomes for the most vulnerable children will therefore be key for a sustainable consideration of the Equity
Strategy acquis.
It seems that the use of EI can be considered as an excellent instrument for communication, funds
mobilization and advocacy but not as a tool for action. To implement effective equity-based activities, there
is a need for a more classical analysis of the education demand in these marginalized localities and a clear

115
understanding of the ways this education demand interacts with supply side characteristics which are not
immediately apparent in the EI computation and ranking.
Some school mapping considerations and reduction of differences in quality will be important to promote
education in specific location where, the education system is of weak quality. In this sense promoting equal
access and retention in lagging locations is necessary but not a sufficient equity objective. Moreover, an
analysis of education demand of marginalized groups should also include an analysis of the labor market
to assess if it is discriminating or not for marginalized groups. If the labor market is segmented and does
not offer a comparable status and earning, for a given level of education, to every member of the society,
those with specific expectations could have a rational weak demand for education. Improving access,
participation and learning would be important but not sufficient to strengthen education demand for many
of the marginalized groups whose social and economic positions are weakly linked to educational
performances.
-- ---- --
To summarize, the evaluation confirms that the ES succeeded in anchoring equity considerations
in the Nepalese education system, nurturing all Nepalese education planning documents after 2014 and
raising wide awareness among education stakeholders. Its undeniable acquis needs now to evolve towards
a more education-focused scope, investing more on their educational needs and targeting vulnerable
children at the right scale, namely their school environment.
116
RECOMMENDATIONS
A list of recommendations and list of candidate actions have been assembled from the main findings and
conclusions to be considered for inclusion in the next Education Sector Plan
The present report shows undoubtable successes directly linked with the implementation of the equity
strategy but also rooms for improvement. To date, no country in the world can claim to have entirely
eliminated socio-economic inequalities in education, nor is there international consensus on the most
effective measures to support equity. Nepalese authorities can now build on 7 years of equity-related
experience which we turn into a set of recommendation hereafter. Some of these recommendations have
already been formulated in other recent studies and have been consolidated here, others are derived from
this evaluation.
This section on the recommendations includes a more descriptive section that provides the rationale and
contextual information to the recommendations. The main recommendations have been summarised at the
end of this report.
1. Recommendations related to the acquis of the equity strategy
1.1 Broaden the scope and focus more explicitly on learning
The first bulk of ESIP tend to prove that the global understanding of equity in education is still only partial
among local stakeholders, and too often limited to the access and participation dimensions. Our first
recommendation is therefore to clarify more precisely what is referred to with equity in education thus
improving its relevance with regards to the learning dimension. This would mean to further elaborate on
the initial ToC, which tended to assume that the quality of instruction available to children is adequate and
that students learn more if they spend more time in school. The present evaluation confirms that this
condition is not met in the field. As a result, the future education plan should more systematically link
equity considerations with the quality of education supply.
We suggest a more comprehensive definition of Equity in education linked with educational and
learning needs, thus avoiding confusion identified in the field:
• Equity in education does not only refer to OoSC: access and participation in school do not
automatically lead to learning outcomes
• Equity in education is strongly related to the inclusive potential of schools: Learning needs of the
most vulnerable children will be met if teachers can address them in a differentiated manner.
• Equity in education is strongly linked with poverty, bearing in mind that poverty is the first factor
of inequity, both in terms of access and learning. Poverty can be addressed through different
mechanisms, notably education and social programs that improve students’ environments outside
of school. As a reminder, the global evaluation of OoSC confirmed the prevalence of economic
barriers to schooling worldwide
117

OECD (2019) recently suggested a more comprehensive definition: “equity in education means that
schools and education systems provide equal learning opportunities to all students. (…) Equity does
not mean that all students obtain equal education outcomes, but rather that differences in students’
outcomes are unrelated to their background or to economic and social circumstances over which students
have no control.”
A revised understanding of equity should also take into consideration low average performance even if this
low average performance is shared equitably among the various groups identified already as barriers of
equity.
A first step is of course to integrate learning in the index. For ESIP, the approach should more systematically
connect to existing school supply, and several data or factors could be taken into consideration:
• Develop analysis of demand for education taking into account the costs and benefits of education
among various population groups and including their expectations on economic and social
positions.
• Strengthen the M&E dimension of ESIP with a specific component leading to follow-up reintegrated
children and address learning challenges for the most vulnerable children,
• Take into consideration the number of schools meeting minimum enabling conditions in each palika
within the planning process. Although they do not include information on learning, they may provide
an opportunity for education planers to consider supply in their planning process;
• Add to PMEC consideration on teacher/pupil ratio in the schools, to be consolidated at provincial
level and advocate for more additional teacher deployment in the deprived areas.
1.2 Clarify responsibilities and consider the entire education supply chain
The upcoming publication of the education act should allow clearer views about accountability mechanisms
to be implemented in the federal context. The implementation of ESIPs at local level have suffered from a
still unclear picture of ‘who does what”. This identified need to further clarify overall responsibilities as
regards the whole education supply chain (federal/district/LG/School), shall also lead to define how and
through which consultation structures they coordinate. Such a clarification process, including also NSA and
education policy implementing partners, should allow to define further, both at national and local level, what
is the responsibility of education sector decision makers and what should be carried out by social programs
improving students’ environment outside of school.
118
Such a clarification should also allow to further take into consideration the school level in the planning
process. Specific equity-related communication channels should be set-up at local level, with school
principals and systematically associate them in the planning process. This would also provide an
opportunity to take into consideration the level of concentration of vulnerable children in the schools at LG
level.
Depending upon the capacity of local planning processes to take into consideration the different actors and
resources invested at local level, both nationally, locally and by external partners, local plans may then
consider the opportunity to plan resources according to the concentration of vulnerable children in schools
under their responsibility. According to OECD, “In countries where there is a higher concentration of
disadvantaged students in certain schools, targeting resources to disadvantaged schools can be
an effective strategy. In countries where disadvantaged students are less concentrated, targeting
individual students and their families can be more effective. ». In New Zealand, recent research carried
out within the framework of the national equity index concluded that once schools get beyond 30% of
their students from disadvantaged circumstances they struggle to achieve (e.g. secondary schools
are unlikely to achieve high NCEA Level 2 achievement rates at these levels of disadvantage).
Considering the entire supply chain down to the school level in the planning process could therefore bring
more coherence into local education plans and allow the emergence of new levers of collective remedial
measures such as targeted improvements to school infrastructure for disability purposes, teacher training
and support, language-development programs for minority students, tutoring and homework-assistance
services, extracurricular activities, and customized instructional programs to address the learning
challenges particular to disadvantaged and minority students.
Such a strategy suggesting a mix of individual and collective measures would also take into consideration
the fact that high concentration of disadvantaged children in a school, impacts on all students in the school,
not just those from disadvantaged circumstances.
Of course, it also entails improved effort on M&E, ensuring that ESIPs and/or LGs education plan include
a monitoring framework and plan that are aligned to the new National Education Sector Plan. In addition, it
is recommended to:
▪ Invest heavily on capacity building activities related to monitoring, data analysis, coordination and
planning for all tiers of the new Education Federal structure. To this end, use a “learning-by-doing”
and coaching approaches for the strengthening of both technical and institutional capacities.
▪ Clarify the role of the provincial education unit ( Provincial Education Training Centres) to support
the rolling out of capacity building efforts and provision of quality control and quality insurance
services to LGs.
▪ Provide guidance to the LGs to ensure that education officers are trained and empowered and that
education is given due priority as part of the local social development agenda.
What would be key in the next education plan is to ensure that schools and LGs are accountable to their
local constituencies. This does not seem yet to be the case now also because of the vacuum left by the
new federal system where the functions of monitoring and reporting are very weak at Local level. This is
also due to the lack of capacities and lack of sufficient teachers in the schools). To this end, the DMS
activities that are supporting school based tools that facilitate a transparent and more objective picture of
the school situation (the school profile) should be further supported. It will be important to strengthen the
roll out of an improved school profile162 as a tool for accountability and advocacy at school level. This implies
a complete redefinition of the format, content and even access mode (as few schools are computerized) of
the "school" profile.
162
That compare the school achievement with other schools similarly to the work undertaken by WE for the analysis of data at LG
level in the context of development of the ESIPs. (see summary sheet in the evaluation report)
119
1.3 Clarify measures and their remedial potential for each equity dimension
The first round of ESIPs is to be taken as a baseline and every round should improve the upcoming ESIP
planning processes. Although no international consensus exist on the most effective measures, research
shows that equity policies have more success “if they are implemented as early as possible and if they
dismantle the extensive barriers to learning that disadvantaged students face, focus on students’ attitudes,
and social and emotional well-being” 163. The evaluation team considers that the initial list included in the
2014 ES document felt short in providing education planners with effective measures linked with each
identified barrier. Our recommendation therefore is to invest on improved consistency between
analytical work and policy formulation phase.
Such a support could take the form of the organization of province-based Equity Conference eager to
discuss lessons learned and share experiences from the planning processes. The results of the present
evaluation could be the occasion to trigger such discussions.
Another important step would be to further elaborate on the list and levels of measures eager to respond
to identified individual and collective barriers. Suggested measures have three levels of intervention
(classroom, school, education-system level) and are organised as per below:
▪ Support to disadvantaged children, adolescents and young adults in their education: “each
country needs to understand at what age inequity begins to affect individuals and how it deepens
over a lifetime”
▪ Provide quality early-education programs to disadvantaged children
▪ Set ambitious goals and monitor the progress of disadvantaged students (described as
“National resilience”)
▪ Develop teachers’ capacity to detect student needs and manage diverse classrooms
▪ Reduce the concentration of disadvantaged students in particular schools
▪ Foster student well-being / Create a climate that favors learning and well-being
▪ Encourage parent-teacher communication and parental engagement
Such a modelling work, leaving full room for local adaptation, could take the form of equity packages for
each barrier/dimension, supporting planning challenges and suggesting clear links between identified
equity challenges and effective remedial measures. Such packages should be fully adapted to the revised
map of competences resulting from the federal governance framework.
In addition, existing Equity based interventions could better address remaining disparities in education
outcomes particularly around language, disability, castes and geographies, notably:
▪ Support development of equity sensitive local education plans (at LGs and school levels) that are
developed in a participatory way through cross sector as well as through strengthened coordination
and collaboration mechanisms with a larger variety of stakeholders from within the government
system and with Non-State Actors.
▪ better address child marriage, languages, geography and disability inclusion gaps and issues, as
well as focus more on the importance of secondary education in relation to access to sciences
studies for girls for example.
▪ Increase the number of women in educational leadership, increasing both the number of female
headteachers in schools and the number of females in senior positions within all layers of the
education administrative system (local, provincial and national levels)
▪ Address inequalities within the institutional school sector. Some countries such as the Philippines,
for example, have approached this through providing vouchers for girls to attend private secondary

120
schools. An alternative approach might be closer regulation and enforcement of quotas within the
non-state sector for female students and students from disadvantaged groups.164
1.4 What about the index?
The index had a pivotal role to mobilize resources and stakeholders. The SSDP adopted after 2014 now
makes clear reference to equity measures, but rather focuses on the national level: since then, the
Nepalese education system committed to the 2030 agenda and therefore needs to focus on equity
nationwide.
The question shall therefore be embedded in a global reflection on equity-based financing, but in this case
seen at a national scale. Worldwide, averages of 4 to 6% of the total education sector budget are seen as
a good average to expect some effects, bearing in mind that it also implies that “mainstream schools”
receive less.
To be an efficient tool for a shift to wider equity-based financing, the index should then also be able to
consider evolving into a revised targeting mechanism taking into consideration both the school level
and the learning dimension, where schools with larger shares of disadvantaged children may receive
additional investment in human and material resources to address learning challenges.
Rather than using the index for overall affectation, a revised index could allow to consider the share of
equity-financing within the overall education-related expenses
The evaluation team also wishes to underline the great interest of an alternative model also developed
through the Data Must Speak approach but with improved focus on school level. This approach strengthens
accountability of the education sector through the development and use of school profile and increased
parent commitment. The DMS approach has also the advantage of recognizing the importance of the LGs
in terms of the role they could play in data analysis for the implementation of the equity strategy at the
school level (Through their analysis and comparison of the various school profiles of the schools present in
their municipalities).
164 Recommendation from the GESI report
121
2 Recommendations for the future national education plan
2.1 Strengthen generation and use of evidence for programming and learning
▪ Complete the body of knowledge with additional equity focused quantitative and qualitative studies
to generate evidence for advocacy and programming. (i.e conduct a demand analysis study165,
ensure a better use of the Out of schools database to track the level of retention in the focused
districts, conduct additional surveys and information gathering regarding key issues, such as the
activities that improve the retention of OoSC and their learning outcomes, which would also be
beneficial to improve the activities of the program and its efficiency.)
▪ Ensure that data is available and conduct data analysis to track how students, in each LGs, in sub-
categories of the eight dimensions of equity perform to be able to devise differentiated strategies
that eliminate barriers to access and measurement of impact. This should be done through
computing and consolidating key education outcomes indicators while embedding them into the
EMIS with a more user friendly interface. (As this is currently done by WE on behalf of the LGs and
therefore it is not a sustainable approach)
▪ Develop IEMIS to include OoSC mapping and monitoring,
▪ Address long time issues related to the lack of accurate data on children with disabilities in the
education sector.
▪ Continue using education data to inform equity in answering the following research questions
- To what extent the index can provide a disaggregated data analysis per driver of inequity?
- To what extent the index can take in consideration the various drivers of inequity according to
their importance through a weighted system?
- To what extent the flash reports could provide more detailed analysis of the data for the focused
LGs’ interventions disaggregated per drivers of inequity and per dimensions?
- To what extent the equity-based interventions have been effective to reach different categories of
marginalised children?
- To what extent the baseline information on OOSC can be used to inform progresses following the
equity-based interventions?
- To what extent the Education Federal Government can monitor the use of the additional funding
provided for the equity-based interventions in the context of the new federal structure knowing
that the LGs report to MOFA and not to MOE?
2.2 Strengthen planning, monitoring and reporting as well as coordination and cross sectoral
functions related to social inclusion:
▪ Include more SSDP social inclusion indicators in the result framework of the national and LG
Education plans that are SMART and quality oriented as per the recommendations made by the
equity and inclusion Technical Working Groups.
▪ Ensure that some key indicators such as the proportion of schools meeting minimum enabling
conditions, are included in the PRF to monitor progress in terms of quality learning environment,
and consider an update of the MEC to include learning.
▪ Strengthen coordination and cross sectoral collaboration at central and local level within
government system and between Government and NGOs.
165 A demand analysis study is needed to better understand the main reason and roots causes that leave children Out of Schools
children. Ideally, the study should include a qualitative component that will unpack the reasons about why children are not at school
but also a quantitative survey that will identify potential correlation between the education context (quality of learning, presence or not
of teachers) and the family context. (income, perspective future for the children…) in various geographical localities. The aim would
be to better understand if there is a correlation between improved education services, access and retention and the family context
(number of children, wealth of the family..)
122
2.3 Ensure Equity in Financing and not only in programming
▪ Ensure equity in financing through more targeted scholarships and better funding allocations to the
most needed municipalities and schools, based on equity-based formulas.166
▪ More particularly, consider a comprehensive review of the education and wider social protection
financial system, including the distribution and targeting mechanism, and role of respective federal
tiers to improve the equity and targeting of scholarships (residential vs day student, and wider
support for poorer students to access and stay in secondary education).
▪ The ES should explore further social protection and cash transfer mechanisms such as pro poor
scholarship now covering all districts in Nepal.
▪ Ensure that heading of budget lines are clearly mentioning equity focused interventions to ensure
that the funding will not be used for other purposes
2.4 Ensure that equity-based interventions address both education-related demand and
supply needs as well as cover well the three main equity area on access, retention and learning
outcomes in the new context of the Federal structure and COVID-19 health crisis
▪ Community-based interventions which addressed social stigma and challenged stereotypes,
increased awareness of educational rights and thereby education-related demand should be
coupled with school-based interventions that developed teachers’ capacity for inclusive pedagogy
to help keep children in school.
▪ Advocate for the appointment and redeployment of teachers to the most needed localities as this
is the most single important factor that constraint the education sector at this time.
▪ Include strategies to increase the use of transformative and inclusive pedagogies within schools
and classrooms to improve the quality of the teaching167 as a way to retain children at schools.
Reduce heterogeneity in school provision through appropriate measures (e.g. reducing the gap
between community/institutional schools), and at the local level promoting teacher stability or
making schools more accountable for their performance. Greater engagement of SMCs and
parents in school management, teacher recruitment, and the monitoring of school and classroom
processes can help enhance the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom as well as overall
school governance.
▪ Invest on ICT in and outside the schools to ensure access to distant learning for all and more
particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
▪ New vulnerable population have emerged because of the COVID-19, many schools have collapsed
because change in demography, roles and responsibilities of the education administrative system
have changed. It would be important to redefine the rules through case by case interventions to
identify who should do what and at what level.
2.5 Mainstream Equity in education planning processes to improve accountability
▪ If LGs may not be accountable to the central level in the new federalism system, they still need to
be accountable to national objectives. For this reason, it may be more appropriate in the current
context (also in the context of limited capacity at local level) to ensure that equity is rather
mainstreamed in the local education plan. This can be done if clear, concrete and overarching
central level objectives that focus on equity in the context of the forthcoming Nepal Education
Sector Plan Development 2022-2030 (aligned to the global level education agenda 2030) are made
available to the local government entities as a clear guidance note/road map.
▪ Accountability can also be improved if parents are given the opportunities to be more engaged in
the Parents Teachers Associations but also if school profiles are developed (Through the DMS
project) and used to compare schools within the same province for example.
166 The USAID, education sector analysis 2020 noted that there was a need for a clear strategy in the forthcoming education plan to
spell out how recurrent expenditure related to resources based on a disparity based formula will be included and sustained in the
SSDP period.
167 This is also needed in the growing competitive context with private schools
123
▪ Strengthen Programming at LGs and school level with diffusion and use of school profile for social
audit to ensure accountability towards parents as a mean to promote a more qualitative and
functioning education system
▪ Similarly, there may not need to have a separate Equity Strategy for the rolling out of the next Nepal
Education Sector Plan Development if its objectives are well aligned to those of the SDG 4 where
equity is already mainstreamed at every level.168
2.6 Institutionalizing support mechanisms for need based support to LGs for developing
overall ESPs
Lessons learned from the preparation of ESIP with autonomy and ah-hoc technical assistance provided to
selected local governments should also be taken into consideration in this political transition period.
Federalism shall imply planning and decision autonomy at local level, and of course this will be a long-term
and progressive process. During the transition, large capacity gaps shall remain and should be addressed
in order to mitigate severe dysfunction, not only in equity-related issues but also in global education supply
and education services delivery. In a context where shared duties between the central and local levels in
education are still to be further clarified by the law, the evaluation team identified a clear need for users’
friendly education policy planning tools, quality support and monitoring. Under present conditions, it seems
unrealistic to consider that each of the 753 local governments education officials receive training at short
notice, without mentioning staff turnover issues. However, trained resources in education planning exist at
provincial and central levels and should contribute to this global support effort. This support could take the
form of:
▪ The provision of analytical and education planning templates aligned with SSDP, with
corresponding dashboards defining global baselines and targets, including as regards equity
▪ A form of labelling system for local education plans, should central validation be rejected, allowing
to encourage local government to require the support of other officials (from another tier of the
federal structure), including with financial incentives
▪ The set-up of provincial (?) based education planning task forces in charge of labelling local plans
▪ A powerful centrally-based equity policy eager to provide central level support in specific areas and
to compensate clear inequity situations poorly addressed at local level.
Depending on the type of competences remaining under the responsibilities of the central state and those
definitely transferred to local governments as regards policy making, the Federal Ministry could then
organize its support at central and provincial levels and prepare for its new role through the creation of
monitoring tools and equalization schemes eager to monitor “equitable focus on equity”.
168 SDG 4 is composed of 7 outcome targets and 3 means of implementation. 3 of these outcomes are more specific to primary and
secondary education and also include a focus on equity: Universal primary and secondary education: By 2030, ensure that all girls
and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes.
Early childhood development and universal pre-primary education: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early
childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education. Gender equality and inclusion:
By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the
vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations.

Proposed actionable recommendations
Proposed 10 Actionable recommendations with clear activities for their implementation Responsible
entities
1.Recommendations related to the acquis of the equity strategy
1.1 Broaden the scope and focus more explicitly on learning
▪ Integrate learning in the index.
▪ Provide a more comprehensive definition of Equity in education linked with educational and learning needs. This would
mean to further elaborate on the initial ToC.
▪ For ESIP, the approach should more systematically connect to existing school supply, and several data or factors could
be taken into consideration:
o Develop analysis of demand for education taking into account the costs and benefits of education among various
population groups and including their expectations on economic and social positions.
o Strengthen the M&E dimension of ESIP with a specific component leading to follow-up reintegrated children and
address learning challenges for the most vulnerable children,

process.
o Add to PMEC consideration on teacher/pupil ratio in the schools, to be consolidated at provincial level and advocate
for more additional teacher deployment in the deprived areas.
1.2 Clarify responsibilities and consider the entire education supply chain
▪ Clarify overall responsibilities as regards the whole education supply chain (federal/district/LG/School) shall also lead
to define how and through which consultation structures they coordinate.
▪ Specific equity-related communication channels should be set-up at local level, with school principals and systematically
associate them in the planning process.
▪ Improved effort on M&E, ensuring that ESIPs and/or LGs education plan include a monitoring framework and plan that are
aligned to the new National Education Sector Plan.
In addition, it is recommended to

and material resources to address learning challenges. Rather than using the index for overall affectation, a revised index
could allow to consider the share of equity-financing within the overall education-related expenses.
2 Recommendations for the future national education plan

▪ Develop IEMIS to include OoSC mapping and monitoring,
▪ Address long time issues related to the lack of accurate data on children with disabilities in the education sector.
▪ Continue using education data to inform equity in answering more research questions on equity.
2.2 Strengthen planning, monitoring and reporting as well as coordination and cross sectoral collaboration functions
related to social inclusion:
▪ Include more SSDP social inclusion indicators in the result framework of the national and LG Education plans that are SMART
and quality oriented as per the recommendations made by the equity and inclusion Technical Working Groups.
▪ Ensure that some key indicators such as the proportion of schools meeting minimum enabling conditions, are included in the
PRF to monitor progress in terms of quality learning environment, and consider an update of the MEC to include learning;
▪ Strengthen coordination and cross sectoral collaboration at central and local level within government system and between
Government and NGOs.

the rules through case by case interventions to identify who should do what and at what level.
2.5 Mainstream Equity in education planning processes to improve accountability
▪ If LGs may not be accountable to the central level in the new federalism system, they still need to be accountable to national
objectives. For this reason, it may be more appropriate in the current context (also in the context of limited capacity at local
level) to ensure that equity is rather mainstreamed in the local education plan. This can be done if clear, concrete and
overarching central level objectives that focus on equity in the context of the forthcoming Nepal Education Sector Plan
Development 2022-2030 (aligned to the global level education agenda 2030) are made available to the local government
entities as a clear guidance note/road map.
173 This is also needed in the growing competitive context with private schools
157
▪ Accountability can also be improved if parents are given the opportunities to be more engaged in the Parents Teachers
Associations but also if school profiles are developed (Through the DMS project) and used to compare schools within the
same province for example.
▪ Strengthen Programming at LGs and school level with diffusion and use of school profile for social audit to ensure
accountability towards parents as a mean to promote a more qualitative and functioning education system
▪ Similarly, there may not need to have a separate Equity Strategy for the rolling out of the next Nepal Education Sector Plan
Development if its objectives are well aligned to those of the SDG 4 where equity is already mainstreamed at every level.174
2.6 Institutionalizing support mechanisms for need based support to LGs for developing overall ESPs
▪ Use trained resources in education planning from all levels to assist LG to produce their plans and compute school profile up
to the time LGs have gained sufficient capacities to do it by their own.
▪ Support Need-based interventions related to use of data, consultation and coordination including cross-sectoral components
and linkage to SIPs with the schools.
2.7 Revise or update of the equity strategy in the new context: SDG4:Education 2030 and the new federal context and the
new funding modality of the country
174 SDG 4 is composed of 7 outcome targets and 3 means of implementation. 3 of these outcomes are more specific to primary and secondary education and also include a focus on
equity: Universal primary and secondary education: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and
effective learning outcomes. Early childhood development and universal pre-primary education: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood
development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education. Gender equality and inclusion: By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure
equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations.

Introduction for all Key Informant Interviews
Good morning,
I am part of a team of consultant contracted by the Ministry of Education and UNICEF to
evaluate the Equity Strategy for the School Education Sector in Nepal.
The equity strategy was launched in December 2014 with the main objective to reduce
the current disparities in access, participation and learning outcomes for children in basic
and secondary public education in Nepal.
The Strategy aims to help the Government and other development Organizations to
identify, plan, allocate funding, execute and monitor equity based interventions based on
the analysis of dominant drivers of a composite equity index at district level, in order to
achieve a reduction in the number of marginalized group of learners in the selected
municipalities.
We would like to interview you to discuss your knowledge and experience of with the
rolling out of the equity Strategy in your geographical area. The interview will last one
hour. There is no right or wrong answer and you can decide not to respond to some of
the questions if you wish so.
Your participation is voluntary and you can drop out any time you want ;
Please note that our discussion will be confidential and will not be recorded.
Do you agree to take part to this interview.?
Many thanks

Introduction
Have you heard about the Equity Strategy? What has been done in your school in relation to the
implementation of this strategy? (in term of planning (through the use of the Equity Index) or
implementation of the equity based interventions…)
RELEVANCE: the extent to which the Equity Strategy responds to the context of Nepal and the needs of
children, especially the most vulnerable and marginalized groups.
R 1. To what extent has the R1.1 Sub question: To what extent has the Equity Strategy added value in the
Equity Strategy been based on context of ‘’natural’’ observed systemic downward trend towards universalisation
the equity-based issues and of access, participation and learning outcomes? How sound was the rationale to
challenges observed in the select the three capacities (access, participation and learning outcomes) as a
education sector, and the needs justification for a dedicated Strategy on Equity?
of children in marginalized
ethnic groups, castes and low-
income families?
What do you think are the added value of these additional interventions (use of equity index for
planning/budgeting and equity based interventions) for your school catchment area?
add probing questions focusing on equity issues. For example, if head teachers don’t mention
kids with a disability or out of school children….
Sub question R 1.4: To what extent do the equity-based interventions (both undertaken and proposed)
respond to the Context and structural causes of disparities in education outcomes? And how they respond to
reducing barriers in access, participation and learning outcomes based on identified needs?
Sub question R 1.5 :To what extent the operationalization of the equity strategy through targeted interventions
allows a response to these barriers being intersectional and including several drivers of disparities that
disproportionally increase disparities as assumed in the theoretical framework?
What do you think will be the potential equity based interventions to implement in your area to
address the issues of inequity? OR What interventions have you implemented already and why did
you select them ? Was there other more relevant interventions that could have been implemented?
Which ones?
Could you please explain how these interventions have reduced the barriers in access,
participation and learning outcomes based on identified needs?

R.3. Have the equity interventions generated by the Equity Strategy reached those children that
need them most and at the right time in terms of facilitating access, participation and learning?
Have the equity interventions generated by the Equity Strategy reached those children that need
them most and at the right time in terms of facilitating access, participation and learning?
How many and which typology of children have you reached with these interventions? Was the
support delivered on time? If not why?
R.4 To what extend the strategy Sub Question R 4.1 : Has the implementation of the EES, through the

protection, etc.)
Sub Question R4.2: To what extent have cross-sectoral issues related to
geographical location, mother tongue and disability been reflected and
accommodated in the implementation of the EES
How did you link these equity based interventions with other responses (sanitation, nutrition,
health, protection, etc) ? Do you know if the sanitation facilities are disability friendly ? How
about Menstrual Hygiene Management.?
To what extent have cross-sectoral issues related to geographical location, mother tongue and
disability been reflected and accommodated in the implementation of the EES
R.5. To what extent is the Equity Sub question R5.1: Has there been attempts to align the implementation of
Strategy relevant in allowing the the strategy to newly emerged needs and context from the COVID-19
government to address the context?
increase in disparities caused by
the current COVID-19 context?
To what extend have you use the equity based interventions to address the issues faced by the
COVID-19? Will it be possible to use them? If no why?
Do you know if any covid related interventions took into account disability, provision of safety kids….
Provision of internet to children who couldn’t afford it especially when all had to study online ?
Our data on social and economic impacts of covid showed that mostly children living in low income
households were not able to take advantage of remote learning. It would be good to find out from head
teachers, if their schools were involved in any ES guided intervention which helped them resolve lack of
access to school during covid ?
COHERENCE: the extent to which the Equity Strategy has increased or decreased the ability of the
Government of Nepal and external actors to undertake need-based an evidence-based planning,
programming and budgeting under the previous and current education sector plans.

Index been an effective mechanism planning/prioritization, management, resource allocation and monitoring
to support the implementation of the processes for a more equitable education?.
Equity Strategy?
How did you use the equity index to design and monitor the equity based interventions?
Expected steps for ESIP planning (and inclusion in the Local Education Sector Plan) and
implementation process
Step 1: Evidence and analysis. Look at available data from the perspective of:
▪ Access, to different groups (for example boys, girls, children with disabilities, different
minority/religious groups) have the same level of access. If not, who have the least access?
▪ Participation, do different groups (for example boys, girls, children with disabilities, different
minority/religious groups) have the same level of attendance, retention and completion. If
not, who have the lowest participation?
▪ Learning; are children learning equally. If not, which groups have lower learning outcomes
Step 2: Strategic planning
▪ Validate analysis with relevant stakeholders
▪ Map planned activities that respond to the outcomes of the analysis
▪ Cost activities and develop budget
▪ Map available resources that can be used for additional activities
▪ Prioritize based on available resources
▪ Identify resource gap
▪ Map support of other line agencies non-government partners that can be mobilized
Step 3: Implementation & monitoring
▪ Describe implementation arrangements for targeted activities
▪ Develop/select indicators and targets to measure results
▪ Define implementation timeline and monitor arrangements

minority/religious groups) have the same level of access. If not, who have the least access?
▪ Participation, do different groups (for example boys, girls, children with disabilities, different
minority/religious groups) have the same level of attendance, retention and completion. If not, who
have the lowest participation?
▪ Learning; are children learning equally. If not, which groups have lower learning outcomes
185
Step 2: Strategic planning
▪ Validate analysis with relevant stakeholders
▪ Map planned activities that respond to the outcomes of the analysis
▪ Cost activities and develop budget
▪ Map available resources that can be used for additional activities
▪ Prioritize based on available resources
▪ Identify resource gap
▪ Map support of other line agencies non-government partners that can be mobilized
Step 3: Implementation & monitoring
▪ Describe implementation arrangements for targeted activities
▪ Develop/select indicators and targets to measure results
▪ Define implementation timeline and monitor arrangements

What do you think are the added value of the Equity Strategy (use of equity index for
planning/budgeting and equity based interventions) for your geographical area?
Sub question R 1.4: To what extent do the equity-based interventions (both undertaken and proposed)
respond to the Context and structural causes of disparities in education outcomes? And how they respond
to reducing barriers in access, participation and learning outcomes based on identified needs?
Sub question R 1.5 :To what extent the operationalization of the equity strategy through targeted
interventions allows a response to these barriers being intersectional and including several drivers of
disparities that disproportionally increase disparities as assumed in the theoretical framework?
What do you think will be the potential equity based interventions to implement in your area to
address the issues of inequity? OR What interventions have you implemented already and why did
you select them ? Was there other more relevant interventions that could have been implemented?

Annex 5. Quantitative analysis of the Equity Strategy
The Nepalese education system refers to SDG and especially to SDG4 which main objective is to reach
universal basic education for 2030. This specific objective seems to be realistic in quantitative terms and is
part of the SSDP which put emphasis also on the qualitative aspects of schooling regarding the weak results
in learning of Nepalese pupils as measured in early grades but also along basic education. The Equity
strategy (ES) approved in 2014 aims to reduce disparities in schooling and improve quality of learning
according to gender, caste, family resources, geographic location and other vulnerabilities. This strategy is
based on an Equity Index which helps to select places (districts and now LGs) where it exists barriers
according to the elements listed before that prevent many children to enrol and stay at school and get a
learning level comparable to other geographical locations.
The formative evaluation of the Equity strategy which is the objective of this study concerns many
complementary aspects :
▪ The first one concerns the opportunity to roll out such a specific strategy considering that its
objectives are absolutely integrated to the global strategy expressed through the SSDP at the
national level and which consists to reach an universal and good quality basic education and
progress in secondary education.
▪ The second one concerns the relevance of the ES itself and of its main tool (the Equity index) as a
targeting mechanism for the marginalized places lagging behind the national situation in term of
schooling and learning.
▪ The third one concerns the partial efficiency of the ES as it can be analysed on the short period
2014-2020 through the activities already implemented in the places where live the marginalized
children.
Methodological considerations
In order to evaluate the ES and especially the three main points listed above we need to assess the
schooling context of education in Nepal and to analyse specifically the situation of the selected places
(districts, LGs) in terms of schooling and learning outcomes. For this, we will refer to a sufficient period of
time to understand the specific situation of these places but also to allow for changes that can be linked
with the ES implemented activities. This reference period will be 2009-2019 which allows to analyse both
the pre-ES period (2009-2015) and the implementation period (2015-2019).
The second choice that have to be made, concerns the indicators of schooling that could be used taking
into account the available data. As the main indicator of education stock (performance), we considered the
Net enrolment ratio (NER) considering that the Gross enrolment ratio (GER) does not offer a clear view of
schooling performance as it integrates multi-cohorts phenomenon that will be less and less relevant over
time.175 We also added references to ‘’flows type of indicator’’ such as survival rates and transition rates.
Schooling performances of Nepal education sector
175 Many children enrol too early at school because there is no ECD facilities in their area, therefore they are underaged in their
grade.
203
As can be seen in table 1, the NER at the lower basic level comes close to 100% at the end of the period
2009-2019 indicating that universalization has been quite reached, leading to few disparities between
districts as we found that the district standard deviation for this indicator is only 0,4 in 2019. The schooling
indicator at upper basic is also progressing significantly as it reaches 89,7 % in 2019 with a growth of 42 %
over the period. The standard deviation computed at the district level of upper basic in 2019 is 8,9 (against
13,9 in 2009) indicating that it exists more room for differentiation at district or LG level. Clearly the
universalization of the NER at basic level depends mainly now on the progress that will be made at Upper
Basic level. This objective is clearly attainable before 2030 as it can be seen on the graphic 1 that highlights
the evolution of NER in the four level of education.

At the end of 2019, 2 out of 3 children aged 10-11 year old (68,7 %) attend effectively the secondary
level. The NER for the secondary level increased from 40,8% in 2009 to 68,7 % in 2019 (+ 68,7 % over the
period). The access to Higher secondary remains more problematic and exhibits a short fall with the
preceding levels. Nevertheless, the period 2009-2019 for this level shows a very fast increase from
6,8 to 25,8 %.
The pattern of Nepal ’ shooling performance by education levels (graphic 1), shows clearly that lower basic
education is growing smoothly as it is approaching 100% while all the other levels are growing in
parallel indicating that progress made at lower levels translate rapidly at the higher levels. It is
particularly visible between upper basic and secondary that present very closed patterns indicating
that progress in upper basic is a source for progress in secondary. The parallelism is less strong for
secondary and higher secondary while the shapes of the two progressions are close.
This pattern confirms that universal basic education will soon be a reality but also that it could be
a good time to anticipate the eventual regulation of secondary levels according to the need of the
economy and society (i.e. access to technical and professional training, access to tertiary
education).
204
This strong growth in schooling helps to understand that the education system in Nepal has no
major problem in quantitative term but real difficulties in the quality of the education system and
especially the relatively weak level of pass tests of pupils in the main schooling subjects. In this
context, the actual sectorial plan (SSDP), while targeting the 2030 schooling objectives puts the emphasis
on factors and activities aiming to improve quality in education.

The Equity Strategy
The ES has been launched in 2014 with the aim to reduce inequity in schooling and learning in basic and
secondary education. Clearly its objectives seems to be similar to those of the SSDP which cannot be
attained without the universalization of basic education, to eliminate any systematic disparities in schooling
and learning due to geographical location, caste, gender, family wealth and vulnerabilities. The ES in this
context can be considered as a national effort to fight specifically the barriers of inequity that will
take (too much) time to be eliminated and a clear message that no one will be left behind in the
205
education system.176 This mobilization for equity is exemplified through both funding sources: National
and external education partners’ financing mechanisms.
The ES is linked with the design of an Equity Index that helps to target the places (districts, LGs,
municipalities) where disparities are prevalent and where specific activities can be implemented to eliminate
the different barriers that limit the capacity of children to go/stay at school and learn.
The EI derived from the world Bank HOI index and has the following structure:
EI = C (1-D)
with C an average outcome of schooling in a given place and D the disparity observed according to
individual, geographical or cultural characteristic. As such, the EI rectifies the value of C highlighting the
existing disparities. The equity improvement may be attained both in increasing C and/or reducing D.
Theoretically, the final EI is the arithmetic average of three education outcomes (access, participation and
learning) where D is computed and averaged for 7 equity drivers (gender, family wealth, geographical
location, caste, ethnicity, disabilities and vulnerabilities). The partial EIs are computed for each driver and
the final EI is the arithmetic average of all partial EIs. Empirically, taking into account the availability of
data, the EI has been today computed only for two education outcomes (access and participation)
and equity drivers are limited to gender, geographical location and caste/ethnicity. After few
adjustments a final EI list has been produced in 2015 ranking the 75 districts and allowing to select
successively groups of five districts that were to benefit specific funds and activities aiming to
reduce disparities in education outcomes. To follow the current decentralisation structure in Nepal,
organised in three tiers (federal, provincial and local governments), the EI has then been more
recently computed for all the 183 LGs.
The EI acts as a consensual ranking avoiding the difficulties linked with the selection of few districts (LGs)
among others that will be targeted for specific activities and national and international funding. EI is
welcomed by most of the education stakeholders and is to some extent used to select activities and projects
by the education partners and NGOs. It simplifies the choice of places of intervention and, theoretically,
facilitates the ex-post measurement of the results obtained by the actions implemented.
The EI is a smart statistical tool that put a clear emphasis on the disparities in education outcomes among
districts and LGs. Nevertheless it can be discussed theoretically considering its relevance in many aspects :
- The way the EI is built, implies a supposed linear effect of its components (access leads to
participation that leads to learning outcomes) that ultimately influence the type of activities that will
be implemented in the same direction. It implicitly considers the learning outcomes as a result of
schooling (access and participation) while one could alternatively present the learning outcomes as
a main determinant of access and participation as we believe that a « weak » school or « weak »
pupil progression could affect negatively the education demand as it may imply in this case low
education benefits for the family.
- In operational terms, we therefore believe that in order to strengthen access and
participation, priority should rather be given first to improve quality and learning benefits
rather than simply act on the schooling side itself (i.e reduction of education costs, OoSC
campaigns, building new classrooms…). In this perspective, the three education outcomes are
176
In accordance with the national constitution that promote equity among all Nepalese regardless of their personal, cultural and
regional characteristics
206
hierarchised and not really additive. Learning outcome is not only a product of the two first
variables as it could also be a driver of the two others.
- Inequity drivers are correlated with inequity situations but may not be direct causes. These
drivers, unlike the index calculation method which integrates them additively and with the same
weight, are undoubtedly partly correlated with each other, cumulative and very hierarchical. We thus
do not find the preponderant weight of the effects of family income on school participation
and their combination with the characteristics of individuals and families in terms of gender,
disabilities, caste and ethnicity. Some of the situations of educational inequality in terms of
participation and learning could result from the fact that the educational offer is locally
differentiated in quality and cost and thus locks children from the most disadvantaged
families into a second choice type of school structure. .
- EI is a good tool at the theoretical level but its ambition has been drastically reduced due to
unavailability of data. Learning outcome has not finally been integrated and only 3 drivers
are considered today. By limiting themselves to the conditions of participation and retention
at school, activities are geared towards supporting demand, while taking learning into
account would certainly lead to greater reflection on the issues of educational provision.
- Empirically limited, the EI can hardly be used as a time benchmark to measure the effects
of policies put in place to address inequalities in education and educational achievement.
- Beyond the ranking of the various places where the policy must be implemented, EI does not define
precisely the actions that must be taken, except by suggesting the main driver of inequities
associated with the EI value in a given place. The discussion and selection of the activities to be
implemented are based on a classic planning analysis (analysis of demand and supply factors that
can explain the local situation) aimed at defining (in particular by comparison with other places) the
strengths and the weaknesses of a municipality (LG) likely to explain the weaknesses in the results
of education and the activities that can be mobilized to address these weaknesses.
- Clearly the use of EI would have been more effective if true analysis of education demand177
had been conducted nationally and at the districts level before the implementation of the
Index. The strategy of analysing the situation of each LG in terms of schooling and learning
can only be effective in comparing these LGs against each other as WE attempted to do so
while supporting the LGs in their analysis work to develop the ESIPs. The Question is now
to ensure that this is institutionalised through an automatic process embedded into the
EMIS.
- Furthermore, the strategy of « unpacking the EI » appears to be much more difficult in the context
of the current decentralization that leaves some of the 183 LG with very limited human resources in
schooling analysis and planning.
177
The analysis of education demand looks at the effective education behaviour (access, retention) by examining these behaviours
by both comparing the family characteristics and the schools characteristics. More than the preferences expressed by the different
families, the real behaviour tell us what are the trade-off made by the parents among the different school characteristics. In a study of
this type devoted to the demand for schooling in rural areas in Morocco during the 1980s, justified by the very low enrolment of rural
girls, it was found that certain configuration of schools allowed the education of all girls who could be enrolled in school but also that
the preferences expressed by families were not always verified in practice due to arbitration based on higher considerations. Families
said, for example, that they preferred girls to be trained by women, but this preference was ultimately of little weight compared to their
other primary wish to send their children to school near their home. (Jarousse JP and Mingat A. "The determinants of rural schooling
in Morocco").
207
An attempt of an empirical analysis of the equity strategy
In order to assess empirically the relevance of the ES, we focused first our analysis on basic education
performance, and more precisely on upper basic education as the lower basic education can be considered
as almost universal. We considered three periods for this exercise:
- 2009 that features the pre- ES situation
- 2015 that represents the launch of the Equity Strategy
- 2019 a recent period were possible effects of the ES could be observed
Upper basic education level
Considering the initial period (2009) we selected the 30 districts whose NER in Upper Basic stood below
the national average of 63,2 % (table 2). Among these 30 districts, 2 were added (Jajarkot and Bajhang)
while their results were above this national average as they had been selected in the 15 districts of the ES
in 2018. Among the 15 districts selected to benefit from the ES activities and funding, the first 5 are
highlighted in yellow, the next 5 in grey and the last 5 in green. Apart from the 2 districts mentioned above,
we found unsurprisingly all the districts chosen from 2015 on the basis of the EI in the 30 low performing
districts in 2009 (according to their NER).
If the first five districts (in yellow) exhibited in average very low performances in 2015 when the EI was
computed, it appears clearly that others, not highlighted in the table, were low performers in 2009 and even
in 2015. If they were by definition well below the national average in 2009 it was also clearly the case in
2015 for Saptari, Kapilbatsu, Rupandehi and Sunsari, while at the same period Mustang , Sindhulpalchok
and Morang where still very close to the national average. According to the EI calculation, these districts
should exhibit a low C but also a low D and for this reason, they passed through the ES selection while they
clearly stood behind in comparison to the national situation and were lagging in terms of universalization of
basic education. In 2019, 14 of the 30 districts performed better than the national average and among them
4 belonged to the 15 districts selected for the ES.
In order to appreciate the growth of the NER in Upper basic education during the 2009-2019 period we
estimated the average annual growth rates which takes into account the differences between the two sub-
period (2009/2015 and 2015/2019). All districts that were below average in 2009 experienced an average
annual growth in their NER for Upper Basic, higher than the average annual growth calculated at the
national level. The only exception concerns Bajhang, whose NER level greatly exceeded the national
average of NERs in 2009 (72.3% against a national average of 63.2%). Globally the annual growth rates
appears to be higher during the 2009-2015 phase than during the 2015-2019 period.

In order to appreciate more precisely the respective situation of the different districts in terms of NER
growth, we computed the annual average growth for 4 categories (the 3 groups of districts successively
selected through the EI scores and the other districts standing below the national average in 2009). The
results are presented in table 3 below. Even though this evaluation does not aim to measure the impact of
the ES, this simple exercise indicates that higher average annual growth rates of the NER have been
observed for the first five districts selected in 2015 (yellow), representing the only group of districts
where this growth was higher during the second period than the first one (respectively 9,4% against 9,1%),
indicating that they performed better compared to all other districts even though they were initially
considered as the worse performing districts. In the 2 other groups of districts selected, the growth was
higher during the first period than during the second one. In average, apart from the first group, the growth
of NER was higher in the ‘’unselected districts’’ than in the districts having benefited from the ES (but in a
shorter period than the first one because they were included in the strategy in 2017 for the grey ones and
2018 for the green ones. In the first group the situation of Mahottari is to be noticed as the NER in 2019 is
3 times the one observed in 2009.

Secondary education level
The same exercise can be replicated concerning the secondary education level (grades 9-10) with the same
ranking than the one obtained in 2009 for the Upper basic education level. In 2009, almost all of the 30
worst performing districts for the upper basic level, were below the national average for the NER at the
secondary education level (Mugu, Morang and Kathmandu are exceptions to this trend). In 2019, among
these same 30 districts, 10 exceeded the national average of the secondary NER by 68.7%, while 7 came
very close to it.
The schooling performance (NER) for secondary education by district in 2009 appears to be positively
linked to those observed for Upper Basic with, however, significant differences in classification. The R2 178
comparing these two distributions is only 45% indicating that if access to secondary level depends positively
on the development of the lower level, there are significant variations around this trend that should be
further analysed in terms of demand but also in terms of supply.
We assume that secondary schools are undoubtedly more linked to the degree of urbanization of the
different districts than basic schools. A further look at the correlation between the distribution of NER by
district for the two other periods, shows that even still positive, the link becomes weaker, suggesting that
the secondary level development seems less and less dependent of the development of upper basic level
(R2 of 35% for 2015 and of only 12 % for 2019) suggesting that secondary is less and less part of the family
and youth education project as the basic education is growing.
As for upper basic we computed annual growth rates of NER according to the whole period and for the two
sub-periods under study. The pattern appears to be somewhat similar with the one observed for upper
basic. The annual growth rates for the whole period is in average higher for the 30 districts than for Nepal
and higher during the first period (2009-2015) than for the second one (2015-2019) except for the first ES
selected group (yellow) which presents an higher annual average growth for all the periods. Inside this
latest group, and as for upper basic, Parsa is notably under-performing. As for Upper basic, some
‘’unselected districts’’ show a poor performance and a weak progression in terms of secondary schooling
during the period 2009-2019.

Supply environment of the less performing districts
In this section we examine the operating conditions of the education system in the different districts
considered in the first section and specifically the elements that may be linked to the quality of learning
such as the evolution of the offer of pre-primary education level (grade 1 with ECD experience), that of
factors linked to the school map (% complete basic schools and transition rates) / and to the supervision of
students (students / teachers ratios).

At the national level the opportunity to enrol in ECD has grown between 2009 and 2019
corresponding to a national policy included in the SSDP aiming at developing pre-primary
education. This is illustrated by the fact that the proportion of newly enrolled grade 1 students with
ECD experience increased from 49.9% in 2009 to 68.7% in 2019. This overall increase corresponds
to an average annual increase of 3.2% over the whole period. It can be seen in the table presented
below that this increase was higher during the period 2009-2015 than during the period 2015-2019 (the
annual growth rates for the two periods are respectively 3,8% and 2,4% at the national level.
This increase has been notably weaker in the first districts selected in the ES (yellow), with an
overall rate of growth of only 2% over the total period and respectively 1,9 and 2,3 % in the two
successive sub periods.(2015/2009 and 2019/2015). The overall increase of ECD experience among the
various districts groups considered here is in average two times higher than the one observed in the first
group.

Analysis of the effect of availability of continuous education in the same school on enrolment
rates and drop out.
School mapping considerations should generally be considered as a possible cause of low enrolment and
high drop-out rates. Particularly ‘’incomplete schools’’ (who do not offer all 8 grades) may lead to rising
costs in schooling and increase the distance to school for children who want to go to the superior grades.
In a global policy aiming at universalizing the basic school attendance, the supply of schools offering all the
8 grades of basic level could be a good indicator of this situation. The table 9 below, shows the percentage
of complete basic schools among all the schools offering basic education for the selected 30 districts and
during the period 2009-2019. At the national level, the percentage of complete basic schools has grown
notably from 17,7 % in 2009 to 46,1% in 2019. This increase has been very impressive in the latest period
as the percentage of complete basic schools rose from 23,9 in 2015 to 46,1 % in 2019.

The 4 groups of districts considered in this analysis appear very hierarchical and this for each of the 3
years considered with the lowest values observed for the group of the first 5 districts of the ES, then that
of the two other selected groups and finally the group made up of districts not selected by the ES. On
average, in 2019, the first group has about 37 % of complete schools, the second and third groups
respectively 37 % and 41% and the last group 45 %. Even if the first group selected by the ES is still
lagging behind the others, it has experienced the higher growth of the indicator over the total period (12 %
per year) and mostly the higher growth in the recent period (2015/2019) with an annual growth rate of
20,3% per year.

This discussion about school map considerations must be nuanced by the higher level of transition rates
observed from one education level to the next one. As it can be seen from the data presented in table 11
below, in 2019 a very large majority of pupil reaching the end of lower basic level went to upper basic (93%)
and an even higher proportion of pupils achieving upper basic went to secondary (97,5). That result
indicates clearly that the existence of non-complete basic schools does not constitute a problem
for the vast majority of the pupils even if this situation corresponds to an enrolment in a new school.
The differences initially associated to the different groups of districts have been reduced all along the period,
the lowest performer at the beginning of the period (yellow) exhibiting very high levels of transition close to
all other districts.

Survival rates
The relatively poor performance in terms of educational attainment (NER) which can still be
observed today in certain districts, despite relatively strong growth, points to lower survival rates
as evidenced by the data in the following table.

After sustained growth in the first period (2009/2015), survival rates during lower basic level relatively
stagnated or even felt for many districts during the second period. At the national level average survival
rates grown from 68,8 to 80,9 % corresponding to an annual average growth of 2,7% per year, but rose to
only 82 % in 2019 (+0,3% per year). During the first period, the survival rates has grown notably in the 3
selected district groups of the ES with an impressive annual growth rate of nearly 6% for the first group
(yellow).As shown by the data in the table presenting the average survival rates by group of districts, the
decrease is notable for the first group selected within the framework of the ES which shows an even
negative growth of 1,7% per year of their average survival rate during the period 2015/2019.

Effect of Student Teacher Ratio (STR) on disparity.
215
A closer look at the students / teachers ratios in basic education shows that this is clearly a
characteristic which sets the most marginalized districts against the others. If the general trend is
indeed towards an improvement in the conditions of supervision (level of STR) for all the districts in lower
basic, the most marginalized districts are still those which present poor rates of supervision which
could limit the desired improvement in learning. At the national level for lower basic level the STR
decreases from 1 teacher for 37 pupils to 1 teacher for 19 while for Rautahat district the ratio remains close
to 60 all along the period. The other first districts selected by the ES show a decrease of Student Teacher
Ratio (STR) during the period while they remain at high level in 2019.

In upper basic, where many teachers are operating in a same classroom, a comparable situation
can be observed. If the STR is decreasing at the national level, it is growing or stable at a high level in all
the groups of districts selected trough the ES. Again the situation of the first group (yellow) selected for
the ES appears to be the worst
Effect of availability of basic equipment in the schools, on level of disparity.
The following tables presents some schools characteristics concerning basic education level. (for
the year 2015). It can be seen that most schools are equipped with water facilities. It concerns 3
schools out of 4 at the national level while the selected groups of the ES appears quite well equipped
for this type of facility (90 % of the first 5 group, around 85 % for the 2 other selected groups).
The situation is worst in relation to access to electricity which concerns only one school about 3 at
the national level. Again, the selected districts do not appear to be disadvantaged compared to the
other districts, at least for the first five selected districts (yellow) while the 2 other groups count
around 20% of schools equipped with electricity.

Internet connexion appears relatively scarce : only 5 % of schools appears to be connected and
even less in the 3 groups of districts selected for the ES (3 to 4 %). It could be a serious problem, even
if this situation may have changed since 2015 considering the fact that the schools can use internet to get
their school profile on the web-EMIS and have an access to data allowing to situate their schools situation
compared to others.
Finally, although the situation may have changed rapidly as this was one of the important facilities of the
recent policy to provide an attractive school for girls, the ratio between the availability of separate girls
and boys toilets plus water and the number of girls enrolled in the school still seems high.
It reaches 1 gender segregated toilet for 106 girls at the national level but is higher in many districts. In
average the worst situation is observed in the first group of five districts (1 toilet/170 girls).
Gender, caste, ethnicity
Parity in basic education, already acquired at national level at Lower basic level, is now achieved at Upper
basic level. The analysis by groups of districts shows that girls are now overrepresented compared
to boys in Lower Basic in the three groups of districts selected for ES (particularly for the first of
the three groups). This over-representation of girls is established in 2019 in the Upper Basic for all the
groups considered.

The tables 17 and 18 below presents the shares of Dalits and Janajatis in basic education enrolments at
the national level and for the groups of districts considered. Concerning the Dalits, the share of
enrolment appears stable during the period at the national level around 20% in lower basic and
growing from 12,6 to 15,6 % in upper basic. In contrast, the share of Janajatis decreases among
total enrollment in the two cycles of basic education.

The first of the 3 groups selected in ES (yellow), is the only one to experience a decrease in the
representation of Dalits in lower basic as in upper basic during the period. (from 26,1% à 20,7%). This first
group of five districts is also the one which presents the strongest decrease in the share of Janajati almost
10 percentage points, over the period in the two cycles of basic education.
If we put these results into perspective with the fact that this first group of districts is the one that
has benefited the most from the ES, particularly in terms of growth in enrolments, it is clear that
this growth has not totally reached the children of the most marginalized groups in terms of caste
or ethnicity, even if it has, by contrast, notably helped the girls to enrol massively in basic
education.

Main findings
1. Clearly the universalization of the basic level depends mainly now on the progress that will be
made at Upper Basic level. This objective is clearly attainable before 2030. At the end of 2019,
2 out of 3 children aged 10-11 year old (68,7 %) attend effectively the secondary level. The
access to Higher secondary remains more problematic and exhibits a short fall with the preceding
levels.
2. Selecting the low performers districts in 2009 according to upper basic NER, it appears that they
quite well include the districts selected through EI ranking (Jajarkot and Bajhang were out of
range). Nevertheless the ranking is quite different than those of the EI except for the very low
performers and some districts out of the initial 15 appears to be at this date, and in 2015, low
schooling performers. EI excludes of its ranking districts with low C (and surely low D) while it
can be fully considered as inequitable to live in a district performing less than the others
3. In order to appreciate more precisely the respective situation of the different districts in terms of
NER growth, we computed the annual average growth of NER for 4 categories of districts for the
period 2009-2019 (the 3 groups of districts successively selected through the EI scores and the
other districts standing below the national average in 2009).
i. On average, the annual growth of NER was higher in 2009-2015 than in 2015-
2019 in the initially low performers districts while it was globally identical for the 2
periods at the national level.
ii. Highest average annual growth rates of NER have been observed for the first five
districts selected (by the EI) in 2015 representing the only group of districts where
this growth was higher during the second period than the first one (respectively
9,4% against 9,1% per year), indicating that they had performed better compared
to all other districts even though they were initially the worse performing districts.
That could be view as an external (partial) positive result of the activities
implemented through the ES.
iii. As for basic level the annual growth rates in secondary level for the NER for the
first selected group of districts under the ES appears to be the highest and
especially since 2015.
iv. The schooling performance (NER) for secondary education by district in 2009
appears to be positively linked to those observed for Upper Basic with, however,
significant differences in classification. The R2 comparing these two distributions
is only 45% indicating that if access to secondary level depends positively on the
development of the lower level, there are significant variations around this trend
that should be further analysed in terms of demand but also in terms of supply. A
further look at the correlation between the distribution of these NER by district for
the two other periods, shows that even still positive, the link becomes weaker (R2
of 35% for 2015 and of only 12 % for 2019) suggesting that access to secondary
level is less and less part of a family and youth education project as the basic
education is growing
We then look at the situation of the different districts considered and especially at their situation in terms of
their schools characteristics aiming at improving schooling and/or learning
4. The annual average increase in the proportion of new entrants in basic education with ECD
experience has been notably weaker in the first districts selected in the ES (yellow), with an
overall rate of growth of only 2% over the total period and respectively 1,9 and 2,3 % in the two
successive sub periods (2009-2015 and 2015-2019).
219
5. The proportion of « complete » basic schools remains low at the country level and in the less
performing districts. It has improved notably between 2015 and 2019 and especially for the first
ES selected group of districts. Nevertheless, these school map considerations appears to be
weakly linked with low performance of schooling as we can observed a very hight and still
growing transition rates inside basic education and between basic education and secondary.
6. After sustained growth in the period 2009-2015, survival rates during lower basic relatively
stagnated or even fell for many districts during the second period (2015-2019). The decrease
has been particularly visible in the ES districts groups and especially in the first 5 districts. This
result suggests that the massive number of enrolments could have had some limits in the
capacity of schools to retain this new (and coming back) pupils.
7. Our examination of the students / teachers ratios in basic education shows that this is clearly a
characteristic which differentiates the most marginalized districts against the others. If the
general trend is indeed towards an improvement in the conditions of supervision for all the
districts in basic education, the most marginalized districts are still those which present the
highest rates of supervision which could limit the improvement in learning. At the national level
for basic level the STR decreases from 1 teacher for 37 pupils to 1 teacher for 19 while for
Rautahat the ratio remains close to 60 all along the period. This situation is especially problematic
in the CES first group of districts.
8. Access to data concerning schools facilities seems limited. Data for 2015 indicates that the
districts considered in our study lack at this date electricity and especially internet connexion at
a point that questions the schools capacity to use the net in order to send and collect data about
their school situation. Gender segregated toilets are improving but appeared at this time
problematic for the worst marginalized districts.

Strategic Approach Pillar 1: Development of an Equity in Education Index
Main Outputs related to Pillar 1: Development of an Equity in Education Index
1. Policy makers and budget holders have a better understanding and use of the concept of equity in education policy,
planning and budgeting thanks to availability of relevant Equity focused indicators, data-driven analysis and validation
by stakeholders and mechanisms to monitor reduction of disparities in education outcomes.
2. An Equity Index allows to measure and compare disparity within the school education sector, rank provinces and local
governments to understand and justify equity-based resource allocation based on understanding of the drivers of
disparity and their intersectionality.
3. The use of an Equity Index makes it possible to prioritize funding according to equity-based financing formulas and
therefore increase alignment of allocation of public resources and development assistance with identified needs.
4. The Equity Index is embedded in EMIS data which increases demand from the local level planners to use EMIS data for
informing planning and budgeting purposes based on which further improvements can be made such as school and
subnational profiles/report cards that can inform stakeholders in their dialogue with budget holders.
Main activities related to Pillar 1:
➢ Conduct a need analysis as a starting point for the development of a more holistic index showing prevalence and
severity of deprivation. E
G
➢ Develop an Education Deprivation Index (EDI), based on the capability approach and structured according to its N

components, areas and dimensions that affect capabilities. It specifies the different grades of severity within these H

ethnicity, language and children from vulnerable groups. When selecting the indicators and scales relevant indexes A
W
will be used including the Human Development Index (HDI), the Poverty Index (PI) and the Child Deprivation Index H
(CDI). T
A
P
➢ Incorporate, wherever possible, the index with the Education Management Information System (EMIS) in order to
strengthen the alignment and sustainability in data management at all level from National, sub-National and local
levels.
210
MAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS
Relevant line ministries other than the Ministry of Education (MOWCSW, MOFALD, MOHP and MOTL) agree to
explore which strategic actions have relevant sector overlap that can be covered from their respective budgets.
District and local level bodies agree to explore available resourcing at these levels from provisions that have been
made available for the social sector, as provisioned under the Local Self Governance Act (LSGA).
Socio- cultural practices and poverty issues take a long time to be addressed and may not be resolved during the time
of implementation of the Equity Strategy such as for example:
• Entrenched and harmful cultural practices such as isolation of girls and women during menstruation
(chaupadhi) and being married at an early age to avoid high dowry fees continue to cause severe
marginalization for girls and young women which increase their likelihood of exposure to Gender Based
Violence (GBV) and their educational outcomes and school attendance suffer.
• Persistence of various socio-economic status and poverty issues that lead to an overall absence of access to
fulfilment of basic needs (including education) such as health, housing, empowerment, employment, personal
security, etc
E

• Strong attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders full and effective participation in society (and in

• Persistence learning outcomes barriers faced by children with separation, addiction or incurable disease, A
P
abused children or those witnessing abuse at home, school and community.
Institutional support for Children with Disabilities remains inadequate for inclusion of children with disabilities in the
mainstream schools such as
The lack of adequate diagnostic services and referral mechanisms to assess and identify children with different types
of disabilities
Stronger than anticipated and perdurance of equity issues in the education system related to lack of technical
capacity, administrative burdens, or availability of funding limit the implementation of the Equity Strategy
The Government do not have enough funding, human resources, capacity and textbooks to ensure mother tongue
teaching in the lower grades.
Despite policies in place to enforce the fulfillment of the quotas, it remains challenging to ensure need-based
recruitment of women teachers across different regions and grade levels.
212
There are not enough teachers in the early grades (1-3) of basic education that speak local languages.
Lack of incentives to address cultural and societal barriers for girls to access secondary education.
