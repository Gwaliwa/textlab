EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction
Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, with over 206 million people2 living in 36 states and the Federal
Capital Territory. Despite efforts by the government to make basic education free and compulsory within the
framework of the 2014 National Policy on Education, at least 10.2 million children at the primary level and 8.1
million children at the junior secondary school (JSS) level are reported to be out-of-school in Nigeria3. Most of
these children were girls and primary school-aged children from the northern states. In addition, the gender
parity index (GPI) in basic education in the North-Central, North-East and North-West geopolitical zones were
0.89, 0.77 and 0.73, respectively4. Studies have indicated that about 50 per cent of children attending school
were not learning as expected. As such, 63 per cent of children in rural areas and 84 per cent of children in the
lowest economic quintile could not read5.
In response to this situation, UNICEF developed and implemented the Girls' Education Project Phase 3 (GEP3)
from 2012–2022 in partnership with the Government of Nigeria and the Foreign, Commonwealth &
Development Office (FCDO) of the United Kingdom. With an investment of GBP79 million (approximately
US$109.1 million), GEP3 aimed to improve basic education, increase social and economic opportunities for girls
and reduce disparities in learning outcomes between girls and boys in northern Nigeria. The programme
focused on addressing the barriers to girls' education, including sociocultural and gender norms, economic and
socio-political contexts and constraints related to local governance, educational material, staff capacity and low
financing in the education sector.
To fulfil UNICEF’s commitment to generate sound evidence on the results achieved for children, a final
evaluation was conducted to generate lessons learned and ensure the sustainability of these efforts. This final
evaluation presents the findings of the independent evaluation of GEP3 undertaken by the Oversee Advising
Group.
Evaluation purpose and objectives
The main purpose of this evaluation is to provide solid evidence on the achievements of GEP3
impacts, outcomes and outputs as indicated in the programmatic documents and results framework.
It also provides a comprehensive review of the programme's theory of change. This evaluation
focused on two key components of the programme: GEP3 programme which was implemented in
six focal states and the GEP3 Cash Transfer Programme (CTP) which was implemented in Sokoto
and Niger states. The study aimed to:
1. Determine if GEP3 achieved the expected results related to access and retention of girls in basic
education and improved the quality of learning outcomes in basic education in northern Nigeria.
2. Document the resilience of communities and families in support of girls' education.
3. Understand the drivers of educational participation and performance of girls.
4. Analyse the value for money of GEP3.
5. Assess GEP3 preparedness and response to external shocks.
6. Provide strategic recommendations for future investments and initiatives to advance gender equality
in education.

Scope of the evaluation
This evaluation assessed the contributions that GEP3 made to the education sector and explored
the merits and shortfalls in the programmatic areas of access, quality and governance of education
in northern Nigeria. In addition, it provided an objective assessment of the results obtained – what
worked, what didn't and why – and the enabling factors and barriers to success. The evaluation
focused on six programme states: Bauchi, Katsina, Niger, Sokoto, Zamfara and Kano for the
duration of the investment from May 2012 to June 20216.
Evaluation criteria
The design and approach of the evaluation were informed by the Terms of Reference and the
Development Assistance Committee’s criteria for relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency,
impact and sustainability. In addition, the criteria of resilience and gender equality and equity were
used.
Methodology
The evaluation used a mixed methods approach by combining qualitative and quantitative methods.
The methodology included a quasi-experimental longitudinal panel design that tracked a cohort of
targeted schools over the life of the programme. This design was developed to simulate a before
and after approach with and without comparisons.
The evaluation included: (i) a household survey to measure the effectiveness and impact of cash
transfers to girls' parents and caregivers; (ii) a school survey consisting of pupil learning outcome
assessments; (iii) interviews of headteachers; (iv) classroom observations and headcounts; and (v) a
desk review, key informant interviews and focus group discussions with a variety of stakeholders. A
value for money and quantitative analysis of secondary data from national household surveys
complemented the evaluation.
The effectiveness and impact of GEP3 on learning outcomes and socioeconomic indicators related
to girls' education were assessed through the comparison of achievements in three school
treatment groups. The first school treatment group benefited from 10 GEP3 interventions and the
Reading and Numeracy Activity (RANA)7. In the second school treatment group, families of girls
received unconditional cash transfers in addition to the 10 interventions and RANA. The third
comparison group (i.e., control group) did not receive any GEP3 interventions.
Findings and conclusions (by Evaluation Criteria)
RELEVANCE
GEP3 was highly relevant in addressing the needs and barriers related to girls' education in
northern Nigeria. The programme improved girls' access to school and increased their rates of
enrolment and retention by using a comprehensive and systemic approach. This involved partnering
with school and community-based organizations, committees and women’s organizations and aimed
to ensure that girls had safe and nurturing environments in schools and communities, which proved
successful.
Several key complementary strategies such as Girls for Girls8, the High-Level Women Advocates
(HiLWA), and Mothers' Associations, were very influential in supporting and mentoring girls. Local
authorities, teachers, parents and girls reported that these strategies also impacted the larger
community and demonstrated the effectiveness of female-run local initiatives.
6 GEP3 was implemented until 2022 with a slight pivot in the interventions for the costed extension phase (July 2021 to
September 2022) towards adolescent girls in junior secondary schools.
7Reading and Numeracy Activity (RANA) was designed to improve literacy and numeracy instruction in Grades 1-3 in public
schools and Islamic Qur’anic Schools (IQS), with the goal of increasing literacy outcomes for learners, especially girls. To
achieve these goals, RANA has developed Hausa-language teaching and learning materials, built teacher capacity, mobilized
communities and engaged local governments to improve early grade reading policies.
8 Girls for Girls, also known as G4G, are girls' peer mentoring groups established at the school level.

Recommendations
Strategic recommendations
1. Include cash transfer initiatives whenever possible, especially with the Plus element
(e.g., complementing cash transfers with additional inputs and services). Integration or
scale-up of the financial household component as part of a more comprehensive
inclusive education intervention strategy shall be considered in future programmes.
2. Plan for classroom overcrowding with worsening pupil-teacher ratios as the result of
increased student enrolment. Comprehensive efforts are needed to prepare and inject
new contingents of trained teachers.
3. Create a more enabling environment (e.g., working with the Ministry of Women's
Affairs and the gender policy) to achieve gender equality and transform discriminatory
social norms that affect girls. Approaches to changing power relations between men
and women, as well as girls and boys at the community, local, institutional and national
levels, should be supported by government policymaking. The focus should be to
actively reach out and reinforce sectoral programming with adequate methodological
and technical tools.
Operational recommendations
1. Consider integrating a sexual and reproductive health and rights sensitizing module in
the Girls for Girls package of the programme to prevent unintended teenage
pregnancies that could impact girls' education and prolong child marriage.
Contextualizing the training module or toolkit to the local setting could address specific
gender norms and incorporate lessons learned from this evaluation.
2. Maintain and scale up the holistic gender-sensitive approach:
a. Expand improvements in the school environment to allow robust
menstrual hygiene management in schools.
b. Offer a life skills programme in the Girls for Girls component and consider
different barriers and concerns that become obstacles to learning.
c. Advocate for broader integration of Girls for Girls, HiLWA, ‘He for She’ and
similar strategies in the education sector.

1. CONTEXT
Nigeria is the most populous country and the largest economy in Africa with over 20612 million
people living in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT); and 136 trillion Naira of annual
GDP estimated in 2018. However, human capital is still weak. Nigeria’s education system is based
on the 6-3-3-4 system: those numbers represent years in primary (basic), junior secondary (basic),
senior secondary and tertiary (minimum of four years) education respectively. The model was
adopted in 1989. The financing of basic education in Nigeria is the legal responsibility of the 36
states and the 774 Local Government Areas (LGAs). The state governments are expected to fund
basic education through their annual budgetary allocations13. Despite efforts made by the
Government with the support of development partners to make basic education free and compulsory
within the National Policy on Education 2014, at least 10 million children are reported to be “out of
school” in Nigeria at the primary level14 – mostly girls and children from the northern states. With
approximately 20 million out-of-school children globally, Nigeria has the highest number of out-of-
school children in the world. Only 68 per cent of six to 11-year-olds regularly attend primary school
and only 38 percent of children between three and five attend organised early childhood education
programmes (MICS, 2021). Additionally, by 2012 in the North-Central, North-East and North-West
geopolitical zones, the gender parity indices in basic education (primary 6 level) were 0.89, 0.77 and
0.73 respectively15.
Regarding the quality of education, about 75 per cent of children are not learning as expected, and
therefore do not demonstrate foundational reading and numeracy skills (MICS, 2021). Approximately
86 per cent of children who live in rural areas and around 95 per cent of children in the lowest
economic quintile do not demonstrate foundational skills (MICS, 2021).
The Federal Government collaborates with sub-national governments and the private sector in
implementing the Ministerial Strategic Plan (2016–2019) entitled “Education for Change”. With support
from the United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), UNICEF is working
with the Government and other partners to test and build on several approaches to increase access
to quality education for girls and boys, especially those out of school, in rural areas and with
disabilities, and to ensure that children complete education and leave school with relevant skills and
knowledge for lifelong learning and employability.
UNICEF developed and implemented the Girls’ Education Project Phase 3 (GEP3) from 2012–2022
in partnership with FCDO. The programme aimed to improve basic education, as well as social and
economic opportunities for girls. This was done through increased enrolment, completion, and
learning of girls in basic education in northern Nigeria, covering five states (six states from 2018
with the inclusion of Kano). The programme was co-funded by Educate a Child, a part of Education
Above All that covered Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto, and Zamfara in which Kebbi was solely funded by
the East African Community. However, this evaluation was focused on FCDO support. It was
UNICEF’s responsibility to generate sound evidence of the results for children, their sustainability,
and lessons learned from this investment in education.
1.1 Context of the Evaluation
The Federal Republic of Nigeria is in the western part of the African continent covering a total
land area of 923,768 km square. Nigeria (Figure 1) is bordered by Niger in the north, Benin in the
west, Cameroon, and Chad in the east. The country is structured in six geopolitical zones (North-
East, North-West, North-Central, South-West, South-East, and South-South zones). From the
administrative point of view, Nigeria is organised in 36 states and the FCT (Abuja); and 774 LGAs.

In economic terms, the country presents two distinctive realities, with the southern regions of Nigeria
reflecting a better overall situation than the north; the difference is directly explained by the large oil reserves’
exploitation and related economic activities. The geographical location of the southern port of Lagos, in the
Gulf of Guinea, also reinforces the commercial and trade activity of the region. On the other hand, the north,
which boasts a higher population, suffers from poverty and debilitating illiteracy, economic and health
indicators.
Education indicators for northern Nigeria are worse than for the rest of Nigeria, partly driven by demographics
and the number of children who should be in school, partly by social attitudes toward “western” education,
and partly by the difficulties experienced by governments in ensuring provision in predominantly rural LGAs.
Furthermore, according to the Global Education Partners 2020 Review, “The northern states of Nigeria are
characterised by a paucity of reliable data on access, equity and learning outcomes, as well as on financing.”
Overall and as mentioned before, Nigeria has the largest population of primary out-of-school children in the
world (10.2 million in total, from which 3.8 million are girls), many of them in the northern states of the country
(NEMIS, 2018). Among those counted as being out of school, a significant proportion attends unregistered
Islamic and Qur’anic Schools, which in some cases outnumber registered schools.
Where learning outcomes have been measured, it has been demonstrated that “the majority of pupils in these
northern states are failing to meet basic minimum standards in literacy and numeracy”16. Furthermore, factors
such as teachers’ effectiveness based on their competencies vary depending on teaching contexts, language
mastery, subjects, as well as workload and class size should be considered.
In the North-East and North-West states of Nigeria, the female primary net attendance ratio is 57.5 and 61.6
per cent respectively, which means that more than 40 per cent of girls are not currently in school (NEMIS,
2018).
Culturally speaking, Nigeria's major ethnic groups are Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo and Fulani. According to
estimations from 2018, Hausa people make up 30 percent of the country's population (NDHS, 2018). Hausa is
an ethnic group of people speaking the Hausa language. The Hausa are mainly present in West Africa, most
of them living between Nigeria and Niger. Another 30 percent of Nigeria's population is constituted by Yoruba
and Igbo people while about six percent of Nigerians are Fulani17.

Nigeria is viewed as an economic powerhouse in the Sub-Saharan region and is rated as an emerging market18.
Even though the country is projected to be one of the “Next Eleven” biggest economies of the world19, income
and opportunities-related inequalities are also growing rapidly and are undermining poverty reduction efforts
by the Government and donors. Other challenges include high levels of unemployment, regional inequality and
socio-political unrest in the
1.2 Purpose of the programme
GEP3 was a ten-year project, running from 2012 to 2022, that aimed at ensuring more girls complete basic
education and acquire skills for life and livelihoods in five northern Nigerian states. The states considered in
this project were Katsina, Sokoto, Bauchi, Niger and Zamfara; with Kano joining in 2018.
The project aimed at improving access, retention and learning outcomes for girls, and reducing the
disparities between girls’ and boys’ education outcomes. Over the long term (impact), the project sought
to contribute to improved social and economic opportunities for girls in northern Nigeria. The project
aimed at responding to the high burden of out-of-school girls prevalent in the northern Nigeria region20.
In 2014 the project was re-designed and its Theory of Change21 simplified to become more strategic and
systematic, which resulted in a more focused project. By eliminating some components and interventions, the
focus was recentred on early learning outcomes. Moreover, since GEP3 was designed as a pilot and scale-up
initiative, the two main phases were:
2012-2017 => pilot’ and
2018-2020 => scaling-up.
As assessed in 2017, at that point the pilot interventions had already reached 210 public primary schools and
200 Integrated Qur’anic schools (IQSs) in each of the involved states. It is worth mentioning that during this
pilot period, interventions were mainly funded by GEP3. By the end of the pilot period, GEP3 aimed to secure
the state government’s involvement to invest their resources to scale up local piloted interventions that had
demonstrable results from 2018 until the end of the project.
The duration of the whole project was 10 years, initially from May 2012 to 30 April 2020. The total programme
amount received was US$89,367,192.37 of which $81,762,802.98 had been spent by the end of March 2020,
representing a 91 per cent overall expenditure rate. Through a Memorandum of Understanding among
partners the project’s duration was extended to 30th June 202122. Further extensions occurred bringing the
project’s duration to 2022 and the total amount contributed by the FCDO to GBP79,029,241.85 (approximately
$109,109,762.23).
Generally speaking, GEP3 tackled a series of interventions organised in three output areas that, in turn, guided
the evaluation effort:
Output 1: Increased enrolment and retention of girls in basic education; (12.9 per cent of the
budget)
Output 2: Improved capacity of teachers to deliver effective learning for girls; (40.7 per cent
of the budget), and
Output 3: Improved governance to strengthen girls' education (26.6 per cent of the budget).

20The total number of Out of School Children for Basic education estimated by UNICEF at the beginning of the programme
was 3,530,035 children in the five states (UNICEF, ToR Final Evaluation Girls' Education Project Phase 3 (GEP3) in
Northern Nigeria, August 2020).

GEP3 also proposed initiatives that focus on tackling key obstacles identified as hindering full
access to education for girls. UNICEF identified four main types:
Socio-cultural factors, such as beliefs that efforts in girls' education are a poor family
investment choice and presumptions about the projections of female and male social roles23.
Economic factors such as poverty spread practices of child labour, and weak supply chains of
goods.
Constraints related to quality local governance, material and staff capacity, and lack of
financing of the education sector in general, in addition to the prevalence of violence in schools
and communities impacting girls' education.
Socio-political situations such as the prevalence of violence in local communities and schools,
as well as growing overall insecurity24 in the region due to activities of militia groups such as
Boko Haram25.
Based on the original project design, 12 strategic intervention fields were chosen, and they became the
guidelines for the initiatives.
1. Enrolment drives
2. School grant cash transfer for learning and retention of girls in school
3. Girls for Girls groups under School-Based Management Committees and Community-based
Management Committees
4. Capacity development of teachers and headteachers
5. Early literacy and numeracy intervention (i.e., reading and numeracy activity)
6. Capacity development of School-Based Management Committees
7. Support of effective data collection (e.g., Annual School Censuses in GEP3 states and Local Education
Sector Operational Plans)
8. Inclusion of IQSs in the Education Management Information Systems
9. Promote increased representation and participation of women (e.g., High-level Women Advocates)
10. Girls Education Steering Committee as a forum to advocate for girls' education issues at national,
state and LGA levels
11. Advocacy and advice to generate planning and budgeting to sustain interventions at a larger scale
12. Advocacy engagement to support interventions

Context of Impact Areas
The National Strategy to End Child Marriage in Nigeria (2016-2021)26 provides a clear picture of the
gender issues within the context. A summary has been provided, which also draws from relevant
literature27.
The status of women in Nigeria is largely influenced by patriarchal values reinforced by religious
laws in the northern states of Nigeria. For example, social roles reserved for each sex are
characterised by the superiority of men and the subordination of women, resulting in gender-based
discrimination. Men traditionally hold decision-making power and run economic and public affairs,
while women are traditionally in charge of the domestic sphere and caring for children.
In those circumstances, parents often do not see the point of spending money on schooling for
female children. Their focus is to prepare their daughter to be an obedient wife and a mother.
Since it is expected that a girl will eventually leave her parents’ home to live with her husband,
parents prefer to marry off their daughter when they feel that she has reached physical, mental
and emotional maturity. An individual is thought to reach adulthood at puberty, at which point they
can be contracted into marriage. This has been preferred by poor families in rural areas as it
reduces family responsibilities in the short term. Cultural norms in northern Nigeria associate a girl’s
virginity with family honour and suggest early marriages to prevent sexual assault, out-of-wedlock
pregnancies and family dishonour. In North-eastern and North-western Nigeria, where child marriage
is most prevalent, poor educational outcomes, a high rate of out-of-school girls, poverty, and
insecurity (e.g., kidnapping of girls from schools in the region) are also rampant. Many families
resort to child marriage to protect girls from violence associated with these social ills13,14.
Furthermore, child labour exacerbates the situation and prevents its victims from actively participating
in the teaching-learning process, preventing female pupils from attending school regularly, coming to
school early, remaining in school till dismissal, or finishing the programme28. It is recognised that
child labour has a substantial negative impact on children’s school attendance and is, therefore, a
major obstacle to the achievement of gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls15.
Therefore, quantifiable indicators of success were identified and were expected to reflect the
success of GEP3, considering the social, religious and economic barriers that exist in northern
Nigeria for girls to enter and stay in the education system. In terms of social obstacles identified,
there was pressure to marry early and the need to render household girls a source of productive
income.
The focus on targeting Integrated Qur’anic Schools (IQS) aimed at tackling gender-sensitive issues in
that sector of the Nigerian education system, as well as reinforcing improvement of teaching and
learning practices. This was particularly relevant as Islamic/Qur’anic institutions (IQS) are often
socially favoured by parents as the schooling choice to send their daughters to (as compared to
formal schools), because besides the specific curricula they develop, the IQS include the core
national curriculum as well.
Considering UNICEF’s equity agenda; considering the contextual realities; and addressing the needs
of those communities that prioritise Islamic education above other options, it became relevant to
incorporate those cultural factors into the institutions’ plans for girls’ education.

1.4 Geographic spread
The final evaluation of GEP3 focused on the five original states where the programme was carried
out: Bauchi, Katsina, Niger, Sokoto and Zamfara; and Kano (at the expansion stage). Analysis of
data recognised the late entrant to the project – as Kano state was added to the list of
intervention states in the last year of implementation, 2018. An overview of national progress of
education impact indicators is presented to give a bigger picture of national progress toward
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, which is “Quality Education: Ensure inclusive and equitable
quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”.

2.1 Key programme milestones
Throughout its implementation phase (2012–2022), GEP3 was the object of a series of evaluations
and assessments, which allowed effective steering and adjustments to take place. The more regular
assessments were the annual reviews that started in 2013. In the first annual review for GEP3,
conducted in June 2013, it was found that “while GEP3 has improved significantly”, it remained
crucial for UNICEF to address “significant technical weaknesses within the design and
implementation” if the programme was to perform to expectations.
The second annual review (2014) noted that, although GEP3 was meeting output targets in several
areas, significant issues and challenges remained due to the project design. It was noted that at
that point, GEP3 proposed 30 indicators (more than twice the number recommended by FCDO).
Their lack of clarity and accurateness was also underlined.
The unsuccessful attempts to revise GEP3 partially in 2013 culminated in the revision of the overall
logic.
Problems with the original design, among others, were:
The geographical scope was too large.
The technical activities were spread too broadly (lack of focused, in-depth interventions).
There was an absence of planning on management government capacities for scaling up and
evaluating the impact of the new technical approaches generated by the project.
A lack of capacity support identification (including M&E) needed by governmental partners to
sustainably support the scaling up expected from most of the interventions was evident.
Project staffing, management and monitoring approaches did not focus enough on creating
collaborative working opportunities within state governments to promote sustainable scale-up of
project interventions.

..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Because of the above, UNICEF recognised the need to redesign GEP3 in early 2014. This led to a
more concrete, focused, and systemic approach and project design, later reflected in a revised ToC.
This new version aimed at focusing on fewer, more streamlined, and cohesive interventions for the
improvement of girls’ education.
It is worth noticing that the newly identified key outcomes in this redesigning, and for which
UNICEF was accountable, meant an incremental one million additional girls as targets of good basic
education.
The main factors identified and retained after this thorough analysis as playing a role in supporting
girls’ education were evidence-based29. It mainly stated that early school enrolment does play a key
role in girls’ chances of getting through basic education, as is staying within the educational system
(enrolment and retention, output 1). In other words, the degree of success in the early-school years
(P1 to P4) is a factor in the likelihood of school retention. In addition to this, as shown in GEP3’s
redesign, interventions had to tackle widespread recognition that education projects for excluded
groups need to prioritise literacy and numeracy skills as well as regular mentoring of teachers
alongside training (output 2).
Therefore, the set of more specific interventions30 retained at school level was:
1. The local committees such as SBMCs/CBMCs, MAs and girls’ groups (such as Girls for Girls) mobilise
their communities in terms of enrolment and advocating to keep girls in school (aimed at addressing
negative beliefs or perceptions).
2. The SBMCs/CBMCs, MAs and girls’ groups mobilise resources within the local school’s development
plan to create safer, girl-friendly learning environments which will also strengthen teacher attendance.
The aim is to improve school-based management and safety and reduce sexual harassment.
3. The poorest families receive cash to face the direct and opportunity costs of girls’ education (aimed at
reducing economic and child labour barriers).
4. Head teachers train teachers regularly at a local level and mentor them through advice from head
teachers and regularly visiting school supervisors (aimed at improving teaching quality and teacher
motivation; improving school management and safety and reducing sexual harassment).
5. Teachers learn specific strategies to boost children’s foundational skills in literacy and numeracy, using
languages that children understand (aimed at improving teaching quality).
6. Communities gaining support to increase the number of texts available to children in languages they
understand through book banks and book boxes (overcoming poverty barriers to literacy).
7. Girls and women increasingly participate in shaping education; at a community level, in schools, in the
wider education system, and in social and policy activity around education (challenging negative beliefs;
promoting the better implementation of education policy and laws for girls).
8. Girls and boys attending integrated Qur’anic schools are statistically recognised as being in school
through improved data collection.
29GEP3 “…has not yet adopted sufficient interventions to lay the foundations for learning in the early years of schooling. The
logic of GEP3 depends on girls’ learning key skills in the early years of school, for transition through later stages of education to
meaningfully translate into increased life chances and economic opportunities, the intended impact of the project. “ (HEART –

2.2 Programme revised Theory of Change and Evaluation Hypothesis
(core assumptions)31.
As a result of GEP3 redesign and fine-tuning effort carried out in 2014, the final ToC model guiding the

C. Assumptions related to both outputs (1 and 2): improved governance to strengthen girls’ education

That enhanced participation of women in the education sector at all levels did positively impact
girls’ enrolment and retention.
D. Comprehensive technical assumption
Each intervention had an appreciable impact on girls’ access and attainment in basic education, but the
combined interventions supported the most vulnerable girls more effectively.
Moreover, a detailed ToC was designed specifically for GEP3-Cash Transfer Programme (CTP) as illustrated in
Figure 4:

Impact Increase in gender equality in education and in society
in general
It is important to highlight that the choice for unconditional and universal cash transfer for girls' education was
made in relation to assumptions more broadly targeting gender equity.
Those key assumptions were listed as follows:
If female caregivers of girl beneficiaries receive CT,
(1) women would control a greater share of household income;
(2) expenditure on education would increase as well as girls’ enrolment and retention in schools;
(3) child labour and early marriage would reduce, and
(4) gender equity in education and society, in general, would increase.
In terms of the intervention logic followed by GEP3 programme, we synthesised it as follows:

Impact => Improved social and economic opportunity for girls
Outcome => More girls in target states in northern Nigeria complete basic education
and acquire skills for life and livelihoods (enrolment, completion, and
learning).
Results were delivered under three outputs, through the following intervention areas:
Output 1: Increased enrolment and retention of girls in basic education
Community enrolment is driven by SBMCs, MAs with support from the state and LGEA.
Action to build girl-friendly learning environments, creating better retention and demand for new
access – SBMCs, MAs and G4G groups, using gender-sensitive whole school development
plans.
Action to improve attitudes towards girls’ enrolment and completion through community
campaigns, peer support to girls and family negotiation – by SBMCs, MAs and G4G groups.
Cash transfer schemes to support families with the direct and opportunity costs of girls’ basic
education.
Output 2: Improved capacity of teachers to deliver effective learning for girls
Head teacher training results in improved school management and pedagogical leadership.
Frequent, local in-service training and mentoring improve teacher/IQS-facilitator teaching.
Models of teacher training meet different levels of need according to context.
Female teachers are prioritised in selection for training.
Foundational learning is boosted through the early learning (literacy/numeracy) approach, with a
focus on teaching and community support.
Output 3: Improved governance to strengthen girls’ education
Strengthen state mechanisms and capacity for collecting core education data (especially ASC)
with a focus on sustainable inputs to data collection and management at federal and state
levels.
Include IQS into EMIS, consistent with project efforts to improve systematic management and
monitoring of IQS.
Promote women as role models and advocates for girls’ education and women’s participation in
the education sector.
Develop capacity to secure long-term structures and funding for monitoring and support to
SBMCs, teachers and IQS facilitators: including increased FTTSS deployment.
Ensure that evidence from across the project is heard and acted on at State and Federal
levels.
Promote planning and decision-making processes that support evidence-based scale-up of
interventions.
In addition to other criteria, the evaluation framework was organised according to the three output areas in the
ToC, as well as the CTP, to support a quick and simple interpretation of results.
Among the impact areas expectations, UNICEF would have succeeded if:
Approximately one million additional girls went to school (as compared to baseline data);
Improved girls’ survival rate was up to 80 per cent to Grade 5 by the school year 2019/20;
1.6 million girls were reached by improved teaching and girl-friendly learning environments;
42,000 primary and IQS teachers were trained and mentored in child-centred pedagogy;
15,300 head teachers were trained in school effectiveness, efficiency and curriculum
management;
21,400 families had benefitted from cash transfers to encourage them to send their daughters
to school and support their transition to JSS and SSS;
Reliable and validated Annual School Censuses (ASC) existed in each state and were used for
targeting resources for girls’ basic education, and
IQS was included as part of ASC.
Additionally, as an indirect impact, an estimated 1.9 million boys would have also benefitted
from GEP3’s investments through improvements to teacher quality and school governance.

..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
These indicators consistently guided the vast majority of all the interventions within the programme
from 2015 on, as widely evident in yearly reviews and partial evaluations during the period.
Notwithstanding, through the desk review carried out for the elaboration of the previous Inception
report, evidence of early doubts on their full achievement was already pointed out by M&E staff in
2020.
Furthermore, it was already acknowledged in the Year 8 reporting period that, despite an overall
scoring of A in terms of monitored indicators' achievement, the COVID-19 pandemic had already
affected Nigeria as schools were closed in March 2020. It is also worth noting that there was a
reduction in the intensity of the learning interventions in response to COVID-19. This meant that
the planned activities to wrap up the programme in December 2020 could not be fully achieved.
In the monitoring GEP3 version of the Logical Framework (Logframe), indicators such as 1.1
(Percentage of school conducting enrolment drives according to GEP3 guidelines) it was already
mentioned that “the assumption is that all schools, both from the project and the scale-up phase,
follow the same guidelines. The risk was that COVID-19 could lead to the halting of various
enrolment drive activities, particularly those that are school and community-based.
This was so mainly because of a prolonged closure of schools and state lockdowns32. Another
example was Indicator 1.3 (number of girls receiving cash transfer) with the following added
information, “schools efficiency can be accessed by their level of functionality using given criteria”.
With schools closed, so were the governance committees and school plan implementation
committees. Cash transfers to some schools were halted as a risk mitigation measure. Or indicator
2.1 (Number of teachers and IQS facilitators trained) which is quoted as “Planned face to face
training of teachers was stopped to prevent further spread of COVID-19. Alternate strategy of using
ICT platforms is being met with challenges of insufficient connectivity and lack of hardware by the
participants”33.
In this sense, for the completion of key activities and a sustainable exit, the Annual Review 2020
recommended a further six-month extension of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) until the
end of June 2021. This Annual Review did imply the continuation of some activities such as
research and sustainability-related activities34. Further extensions occurred bringing the project's
duration to 2022 and the total amount contributed by the FCDO to GBP 79,029,241.85
(approximately US$ 109,109,762.23).

3. EVALUATION PURPOSE
This section details the evaluation purpose, objectives, evaluation criteria and evaluation questions – “what”
to be evaluated, significance, stakeholders’ interests and uses, and the evaluation scope.
3.1 Evaluation purpose
The independent evaluation has two purposes, namely accountability and learning. It has provided
both the donor (vertical accountability) and the expected beneficiaries (horizontal accountability) with
solid evidence on the extent to which GEP3 Project fulfilled its expected results (impact, outcomes
and outputs), transformations as indicated in the programmatic documents (Business Plan and
Operational Plan) and results frameworks that were agreed upon with the donor before the start of
implementation.
The evaluation considered the 2015 assessment report and recommendations that informed the
redesign of the programme which resulted in changes to the results structure and operational plan.
The evaluation will allow the dissemination of information on the actual results achieved back to
those communities that were expected to benefit from this programme and the stakeholders whose
tax money was used to fund this project (horizontal accountability).
With respect to learning, this evaluation should inform the education sector programme
implementation strategies; provide evidence of best practices and innovations, and shed some light
on potential corrective actions that may need to be explored further in the future. More specifically,
this evaluation should generate evidence-based recommendations that will help UNICEF Nigeria and
its partners to steer future programming in the education sector.
3. 2 Overall utility of the evaluation
1. Opportunity to objectively assess and document GEP3-CTP achievements, successes,
challenges, and lessons:
The evaluation provides an objective assessment of GEP3 and the results that were produced
due to the interventions implemented. The evaluation proposes an external and objective view
of what elements of the sector have not performed as desired and will provide
recommendations for correcting systemic or future programmatic gaps. The FME is among the
primary public-sector stakeholders highly interested in GEP3 impact evaluation.
2. Addresses evidence gaps identified within GEP3 M&E needs:
GEP3 Intervention Database Architecture (2019) noted that “Past annual reviews of GEP3
highlighted the lack of reliable data and evidence for reliably assessing the achievement of the
project due to weaknesses of the State and National EMIS. In addition to the challenges of
delayed and unreliable quality of EMIS data, GEP3 did not invest in enough resources to
develop an effective system for tracking all information and data generated within the
implementation of its key inventions. This situation affects GEP3 reporting mechanisms –
conflicting numbers in various reports while there is no administrative system to allow quality
control and verification of data consistency.”
While the need for a reliable M&E system to address this was indicated, this evaluation also
supports the process by providing concrete evidence based on a reliable and valid assessment
of GEP3.
3. Inform UNICEF and other stakeholders’ e.g. donors, CSOs, and future engagement in Nigeria:
This impact evaluation is significant for UNICEF and other stakeholders. UNICEF is the primary
stakeholder, and the evaluation was commissioned to demonstrate UNICEF’s organisational
commitment to accountability (by presenting results to both internal and external stakeholders)
and learning. Thus, this evaluation has a substantial role to play in guiding and improving future
country programming.
For donors and CSOs, the evaluation will supplement the body of knowledge available on
educational learning outcomes and cash transfer programmes in Nigeria. The findings, and
recommendations, will enable a better understanding of the current situation and any gaps and
challenges and should inform donor and CSOs’ assistance and programmatic priorities.

4. EVALUATION OBJECTIVES
This section details the evaluation objectives.
4.1 Evaluation objectives
The evaluation focused on two components: GEP3 2012–2022 in the six focal states and GEP3-CTP in Sokoto
and Niger states.
1. The evaluation of the overall GEP3 in the six focal states aimed to:
a. Determine the merit of GEP3 in terms of achievement of expected results related to
the impact, outcomes and outputs of access and retention of girls to basic education
and the quality of learning outcomes of basic education in northern Nigeria as
planned within the initial business case and operational plan.
b. Document the resilience of communities and families in support of girls’ education in
northern Nigeria, particularly in support of access and retention.
c. Understand the most significant drivers of educational participation and performance of
girls within the implementation states to enhance the effectiveness and impact of
future interventions.
d. Analyse the value for money (VfM) regarding GEP3 programme implementation and
approaches to community and gender transformation within the target areas.
e. Assess GEP3 preparedness and response to external setbacks such as the COVID-19
pandemic; insecurity including insurgency.
f. Provide strategic recommendations for future investments and initiatives to advance
gender equity and equality in education.
2. The evaluation of GEP3-CTP was in line with the impact evaluation of 2017, which served as a baseline for
this study, and aimed to:
a. Determine the relevance of GEP3-CTP in Niger and Sokoto states.
b. Assess the effectiveness of GEP3-CTP in Niger and Sokoto states.
c. Assess the impact of GEP3-CTP in Niger and Sokoto states.
d. Assess the efficiency of GEP3-CTP in Niger and Sokoto states.
e. Determine the sustainability of GEP3-CTP in Niger and Sokoto states.

5. EVALUATION SCOPE
5.1 Thematic scope
This independent evaluation assessed the contributions that GEP3 made to the education sector and
the merits and shortfalls in the programmatic areas of access, quality and governance of education in the six
focal states across northern Nigeria. In addition, it provided an objective assessment of the results obtained –
what worked, what didn't and why – and the enabling factors and barriers to success. This was especially
important in evaluating the impact, outcomes and outputs and in relation to the Business Plan and Results
Frameworks.
Based on the initial M&E plan and the recommendations from the annual review, this resulted in an overview
of all twelve strategic interventions with a focus on six prioritised programmatic components.
1. Management for school enrolment and retention
2. School grant cash transfers for learning and retention of girls in school
3. Capacity development and teacher training for improved quality and learning outcomes
4. Empowerment of communities and women to advocate for education in schools, communities
and in the wider education system
5. Support for monitoring and evidence generation as part of system strengthening
6. Data generation and usage for decision-making at micro-level classroom, school and community
Selected interventions for this assessment were chosen based on recommendations from the annual report and
previous evaluations.
5.2 Geographical scope
The evaluation of GEP3 focused on the six states of the project: Bauchi, Katsina, Niger, Sokoto, Zamfara and
Kano. Analysis of data took recognisant of late entrants to the project like Kano state, which was added to the
list of intervention states in the last year of implementation.
An overview of national progress of education impact indicators is also presented to provide the context (a big
picture) of national progress toward SDG 4. For GEP3-CTP, the focus was on Sokoto and Niger states.
5.3 Chronological scope
This evaluation covered the duration of the investment from 2012 to June 2021 and not the entire
implementation period for GEP3, which was extended to 202235.
A recapitulation of findings and lessons learned from previous partial evaluations were capitalised in line with the
independent evaluation of GEP3-CTP component completed in 2017 and the mid-term evaluation of GEP3 in
2017.
35The GEP3 costed extension (August 2021 to September 2022) was approved after 19 months of the inception of the GEP3 evaluation. The
programme for the costed extension phase maintained the GEP3 outputs, but new activities have been developed to consolidate the gains and
build-on previous interventions, with some specifically targeting adolescent girls in junior secondary schools instead of s in primary schools. The
programmatic shift was meant to build the foundation for potential future FCDO/UNICEF partnerships and programming on girls’ education
specifically focused on learning and transition for adolescent girls. Key interventions under Output One include: 1) Support Safe Schools Mechanism
through community-school partnerships; 2) Develop a national life skill framework for adolescents and young people; 3) Provide girls with Education
Support Kits and Menstrual Hygiene Management skills; and 4) Support transitions for girls through establishing G4G and He for She, and
community-based adolescent girls transition champions. Interventions under Output Two include: 1) Develop the teacher management and support
mechanism; 2) develop responsive assessment framework; and 3) Conduct RANA impact assessment. Output Three interventions include: 1) Roll
out Education Sector Performance Assessment Tool; and 2) Support demonstration of digitizing EMIS real-time data generation.

6. CRITERIA AND EVALUATION QUESTIONS
6.1 Evaluation criteria
The overall evaluation design and approach have been closely informed by the ToR and by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD), Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria that
have been integrated into the evaluation framework.
The OECD/DAC evaluation criteria of relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability
were used for GEP3 evaluation. In addition, the criteria of equity, gender equality and resilience were used in
the assessment to fit the programming context and UNICEF’s commitment to advance the agenda on the equal
chance of child rights.
At the strategic level in the assessment of relevance, special attention was given to the design of GEP3 and its
correspondence with global and national priorities, national policymaking on education, poverty reduction and
social protection. Particular attention was given to the education needs of the beneficiaries in the community,
including integrating considerations for gender equality.
At the operational level, an assessment of the programme’s effectiveness, impact and sustainability ensured
there was equity for the most vulnerable children to access GEP3. CTP services, gender and other factors
related to the underserved population were also reviewed.
The extent to which the programmes were resilient to internal and external setbacks was also assessed,
especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The governance of education in northern Nigeria was also
explored.
An inventory of good practices and lessons learned has also been compiled to enable evidence-based decisions
for implementation and policymaking.
Furthermore, the additional criteria of independence, objectivity, transparency, validity, reliability, partnership,
and usability were safeguarded in the evaluation by ensuring that:
None of the evaluation members has been closely involved in GEP3 (including CTP) initiative, there are
no conflicts of interest, and the team guarantees its independence;
Verifiable facts were collected towards measurable indicators;
Robust methods of measurement were used over time to ensure the validity of measurements and
reliability of findings;
A clear distinction has been made in the evaluation report between facts and opinions of the evaluation
team;
Results have been shared in a timely and transparent fashion;
The methodology, findings, conclusions, and recommendations have been clearly described;
The results, questions and methodology were clearly described and agreed upon with key stakeholders
before the evaluation activities started;
There was the involvement of key stakeholders in the establishment of the theory of change, contextual
analysis, implementation, and policy-making issues – and they were invited to present their
perspectives and views through participatory workshops at different levels;
There was regular and structured consultation with the Evaluation Reference Group;
There was a close partnership with national field researchers, and
The formulation of conclusions and recommendations were designed to be clear and useful for GEP3.

The evaluation team, which is made up of professionals from different disciplines and different backgrounds
such as Education, Child Protection, Public Health, Evaluation, Social Sciences and Finance, has ensured that
the evaluation was conducted to high professional standards, with open and enquiring minds, and free from
any form of discrimination or prejudice.
6.2 Evaluation questions
The evaluation questions for each criterion of GEP3, are as follows:
Relevance and Coherence
i. To what extent has the Girls’ Education Project Phase Three (GEP3) expected results (impact,
outcomes and outputs) and design responded to beneficiaries’ global, country and partner/institution
needs, policies and priorities considering the evolving circumstances? (Is GEP3 doing the right
thing?)
ii. To what extent did other interventions (particularly policies) support or undermine GEP3 intervention,
including internal and external coherence? (How well does the programme fit?)
iii. To what extent is the CTP coherent with the broader policy environment at state and federal levels
including education, social protection, gender policies and other interventions (e.g., supply-side
improvements in the education sector)?
iv. Is the CTP intervention appropriate in terms of design and delivery approach, given the contextual
realities in Niger and Sokoto states and to what extent were the needs and priorities of targeted
beneficiaries/local partners consistent with the CTP objectives and deliverables?
Effectiveness

7. METHODOLOGY
7.1 Design of the evaluation
The goal of the evaluation was to determine if, how, where, why and for whom the interventions worked.
Understanding these aspects can then inform the sustainability and future of the programme and provide
guidance for national policymakers and decision makers. The best way to respond to this was to use a
mixed-methods approach that combined qualitative and quantitative methods.
A quasi-experimental longitudinal panel design was used that tracked a cohort of schools over the project’s life.
The design was developed to simulate a “before-and-after” approach as well as with/without comparison.
To create the “before” component, we used the available baseline studies relating to the cohort. Baseline
data from previous learning outcomes assessments and HH surveys were used for this evaluation. For
Niger and Sokoto states, we used baseline data from the impact evaluation of the 2014-2016 Cash
Transfer Programme. For Bauchi, Katsina, Zamfara and Niger states, we used the EDOREN Baseline and
Midline Evaluations of GEP3 as the baseline in the assessment of learning outcomes. For Kano, baseline
studies were not available. Secondary analysis of the 2013 National Demographic health survey (NDHS)
and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) of 2011 was analysed to establish “tracer’s indicators”
at state levels.
To create the “after” component, we conducted school-based surveys for the six focal states of GEP3
programme areas and HH surveys in four focal states. Comparison sites at LGA level were identified,
though previous (survivor) beneficiaries at the school level could not be tracked since many had moved
on from the schools. However, beneficiaries and their caregivers at HH level could be tracked. The study
involved the ultimate and indirect beneficiaries (“Was there a change? What were the enabling factors?
What were the disabling factors?”). Besides the secondary analysis of project/programme data, to
determine whether there was an effect on the access and retention of girls to basic education, secondary
analysis of the NDHS (2018) and MICS (2016 and 2021) data were carried out to identify effects on
educational outcomes.
To understand the impact of GEP3, we assessed trends and associations via secondary data analysis of
the MICS (2011; 2016; and 2021) and where necessary, the NDHS (2013 and 2018). The HH survey data
from the Evaluation Primary Data Collection was used to assess the outcomes and impact of CTP on girls’
education – specifically related to access, retention and completion; and household consumption and
expenditure. For quality of learning outcomes and impact, we carried out a pupil school-based
assessment survey to measure the learning outcomes of learners in Hausa and English Literacy. Data
from baseline and midline evaluations of GEP3 were compared.
A “with/without” comparison of intervention areas versus non-intervention areas was carried out.
Intervention LGAs and schools, as well as comparison schools, were sampled. A non-experimental
statistical method – Propensity Score Matching (PSM) – was used to evaluate the effect of the GEP3 on
outcomes. The household and school survey data were used to create reasonable comparison
populations based on the propensity scores and address the issue of observed selection bias. The
robustness and correctness of the matching results were checked by conducting balance diagnostics and
common support analyses as well as through estimation of a weighted least square (WLS) with
propensity score as the weights. Using the PSM enabled us to generate a comparison of household
heads/caregivers and pupils that had similar characteristics to the selected intervention household
heads/caregivers and pupils to allow comparisons to be made between these “matched” populations.
Further, we estimated the causal outcome links by comparing the intervention and counterfactual areas.
The difference-in-differences (DID) method was used to compare changes and trends in the project’s key
results over time between the intervention and comparison groups. This allowed for the correction of any
differences between the intervention and comparison groups that remained constant over time. This
approach assumes that the primary outcomes of interest in the intervention and comparison groups
would move in tandem in the absence of the project. All DID estimates were adjusted for baseline
characteristics illustrated with attribution and magnitudes of the changes observed.

..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A concurrent design was employed for the systematic use of mixed methods. The qualitative
research component provided a rich understanding of relationships, trends, and patterns emerging
from the quantitative component and helped triangulate survey results to confirm, dispute, or provide
answers to contradictory and unexpected results from the quantitative evaluation. Using this mixed-
methods approach, quantitative outcome/impact evidence was complemented by narrative causal
statements collected directly from parents, head teachers, teachers, girl beneficiaries, the Ministry of
Education and relevant government stakeholders, and communities via focus group discussions
(FGDs) and semi-structured and key informant interviews (KII). The respondents were asked about
the main changes during the relevant recall period. They were prompted to share what they
perceived to be the main drivers of these changes and to whom or to what they attributed these
changes. Since these drivers were complex and from multiple sources, these narrative causal
statements were suitable for identifying linkages of intervention with their impacts and their complex
relationships.
The Most Signi cant Change (MSC) tool was used with direct, indirect and ultimate beneficiaries.
The MSC's purpose is to facilitate programme improvement by focusing on the directions and
changes as valued by the various stakeholders. It is also called the “story approach” and
“evolutionary approach to organisational learning”. Stakeholders were involved in selecting the changes
to be followed up, over time, changes may be appreciated. Storytelling was used to evoke
stakeholders' answers of the key question:
“Looking back over this period, in your perception, what do you think the most significant change
was due to GEP3 and the Cash Transfer Programme?”
7.2 Methods and data collection tools
7.2.1. Quantitative methods
7.2.1.1. Household survey for cash transfer and performance on access
Household surveys measured the effectiveness and impact of cash transfers during the
implementation of GEP3-CTP interventions. The aim of the household data questionnaire was to
collect data on household income and expenditure, girls’ contribution to household income, rationales
for schooling and benefits from the cash grant allocation. Retrospective recall was used by asking
before and after questions to assess the impact of the cash transfers. The household survey also
provided an opportunity to measure the indicators related to access to education (e.g., completion
rate, retention, transition, net enrolment ratio, gender parity, equity analysis and the presence of
disabilities) (see Annex 2).
7.2.1.2. School survey for assessing pupils' learning outcomes and
teachers' opinions
To measure pupils’ numeracy, Hausa and English literacy skills, we conducted interviews with head
teachers, classroom observations and head counts and assessments of pupils’ learning outcomes in
the six focal states. Trends in literacy and numeracy outcomes were analysed and baselines were
established for subsequent evaluations in Kano and Sokoto. School-based assessment surveys of
pupils were undertaken to measure the learning outcomes in English and Hausa literacy at baseline
for Zamfara, Katsina, Bauchi and Niger. No learning assessments were conducted in Kano or Sokoto
during the two previous EDOREN learning outcomes evaluations and Bauchi and Niger states had
previous numeracy assessments conducted at baseline but not midline. Unfortunately, the increased
insecurity risks in most of the target states impacted data collection. Out of a total target sample
of 9,898 pupils, 5,450 pupils were evaluated in the school-based pupil learning assessment survey.
Teachers and school characteristics were captured during interviews with head teachers to
understand the effects of teacher and school-related inputs on the learning outcomes of children
(see Annex 3: Head teacher questionnaire).
Various tools used in previous GEP3 evaluations were reviewed to determine the most appropriate
tools to be used for the end-line evaluation. The most appropriate for this evaluation was the
baseline and midline evaluations of GEP3 which used the Pupil English Literacy Assessment for P2
............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Page 36
Final Evaluation of Girls’ Education Project Phase 3 (GEP3) 2012–2022 in Northern Nigeria Evaluation Report
..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
and Pupil Hausa Literacy Assessment for P2 to measure the learning outcomes of pupils.
The Pupil English Literacy Assessment for P2 and Pupil Hausa Literacy Assessment for P2 were
replicated and the Numeracy Assessment tools was used at the baseline and midline GEP3
evaluations. This enabled standardisation, harmonisation, coherence and comparison with previous
measurements. It also enabled a clear trend analysis from baseline to end-line of GEP3. The
learning outcomes assessment tools are presented in Annex 5.
7.2.1.3. Value for money – financial data analysis
To appreciate the efficiency, or Value for Money (VfM) of the programme, financial data collection on inputs and
expenses was carried out at programme level, to indicate the costs at which the eventual results have been
delivered. To analyse the VfM of GEP3, the requirements included:
GEP3 standard operational procedure (SOP) and guidelines for GEP3 management;
Procurement policy for the programme;
Budget follow-up for each programme component/intervention and the consolidated version at
national and state levels;
Guidelines for preparing the budgets for the programme and components at national and
state levels; and
Financial reports for the programme for all the components and the consolidated version at
state and national levels.
7.2.1.4. Secondary quantitative data analysis
Secondary data from population surveys like MICS 2011 and 2016-2017 were used to analyse
trends of relevant outcomes and impact indicators at national and state levels. This included data
to assess changes attributable to the project in terms of expected outcomes, to fulfil the
fundamental requirements of assessing learning, transition and sustainability, as well as to
generate meaningful learning. Results of the estimated indicators from MICS 2021 will be
included in this report when the 2021 MICS report is released.
7.2.2. Qualitative methods
7.2.2.1. Desk review
To develop an appropriate evaluation design, data collection tools and data collection process, we conducted
an extensive review of GEP3 programme and project documents, including but not limited to:
UNICEF project monitoring data, annual reports
GEP3 Theory of Change
GEP3 monitoring evaluation and learning (MEL) framework and operational plan
GEP3 log frame
Baseline and midline reports
Cash transfer impact evaluation reports
Nigeria Poverty Reduction Strategy
Other relevant documents that were made available during the inception phase
The desk research also helped to establish contextual nuances within which GEP3 was
implemented that may have determined programme outcomes.
Other documents reviewed include MICS 2011, MICS 2016, MICS 2021, NDHS 2013, NDHS 2018,
Project Intervention Monitoring Data-Donor Report, State EMIS Report, Learning Assessment 2015
and Evaluation School Survey Learning Assessment 2020 and the Education Census. A
comprehensive list of documents reviewed is included in Annex 4.

7.2.2.2. Key informant interviews
These semi-structured interviews (SSI) of key partnership stakeholders included GEP3 officials, training
facilitators, head teachers, project staff and ministry staff at federal and state levels. UNICEF and
other stakeholders of interest were interviewed to explore relevance, coherence, efficiency,
effectiveness, impact, equity, gender and equality, as well as resilience and sustainability. They also
reflected on how the programme worked in different contexts and with the planned implementation
structures and processes.
7.2.2.3. Focus group discussions (FGDs)
Participatory FGDs with parents and caregivers (men and women), SBMCs and CMBCs, women’s
associations such as HiLWA, adolescents such as participants from Girls 4 Girls, teachers,
community leaders and religious groups reflected on the uptake of GEP3 interventions. These
groups explored emerging trends, tensions, enablers and barriers to the programme’s effectiveness,
process and successes. Qualitative interviews assessed beneficiaries’ satisfaction with GEP3. We
also conducted participatory focus group discussions with school children and out-of-school children
to capture children’s voices and perceptions. Teachers recruited FGD participants (girls and boys)
from GEP3 schools. Out-of-school girls and boys were also recruited to identify the barriers to
access and retention for those groups. For men and women from the communities, community
mobilisers in the data collection team worked with the community leaders (the gatekeepers) to
identify suitable respondents. Informed consent forms and topic guides for FGDs and KIIs can be
found in Annexes 6, 7 and 8.
Classroom observations were carried out in the intervention schools. The classroom observation tool
was used during the baseline and midline evaluations. The observation tool was used to assess the
quality of teaching practices, supportive environment, lesson facilitation and checks for understanding
(see Annex 9).
7.3 Sampling strategy
7.3.1. Identification of treatment and comparison groups
In each of the initial five GEP3 pilot states (Bauchi, Katsina, Niger, Sokoto and Zamfara), the six
LGAs were purposively selected for the evaluation of early learning intervention (treatment) using the
criteria of length of GEP3 intervention. Kano state, as a late entrant into the programme, was
included primarily as an expansion location in this study. (See Table 4 below).

Sa mpled GEP3 schools for the evaluation were drawn from the 210 schools and 200 IQS in each
LGA across the pilot states. In Niger and Sokoto states three study groups were used where the
CTP was implemented, namely GEP3 learning-CTP group; GEP3 learning-only group and the non-
GEP3 group. The first two groups were treatment groups whilst the last one served as a
comparison group. This allowed us to measure the combined impact of both the early learning
intervention and CTP in addition to assessing the impact of the early learning intervention only,
where necessary. In three pilot states of Bauchi, Katsina and Zamfara where there was no CTP
intervention, we had two study groups, namely GEP3 learning-only group and the non-GEP3 group.
In all the comparison groups, a random selection of schools was drawn mainly from the pool of
non-GEP3 schools within the same GEP3 LGAs. In situations where GEP3’s early learning
interventions were expanded to most other schools within the same LGA (e.g., Binji and Wurno
LGAs in Sokoto state; and Anka, Bungudu, Shinkafi, Talata Mafara and Tsafe LGAs in Zamfara
state), non-contaminating school lists from a non-GEP3 LGA was utilised for random selection into
comparison groups. To avoid contamination, any non-GEP3 schools receiving similar learning
programmes from other partners were dropped from the pool before a random selection was
made.

7.4. Quantitative sampling strategies
In estimating the appropriate sample size for this evaluation, we explored two well-known
approaches namely, the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) standardised formula; and Power
Calculations.
7.4.1. Determination of sample size of pupils using MICS sample
Determination Formula
For the pupil school-based assessment survey, we used the literacy proficiency level of pupils as
the primary indicator for the calculation of sample size to measure the learning outcomes of pupils
against the baseline. The pupil literacy proficiency level reported by the 2010 Nigeria Education Data
Survey (NEDS), which is a nationally representative survey, was employed as baseline values in
estimating the sample size using the MICS sample size formula below:
Where:
n = Sample size
r = Predicted value of the indicator (in target/base population), also usually noted as “p”
deff = Design effect, set at 1.5
RME = Relative margin of error at 95 per cent confidence level (CL)36
pb = Proportion of target/base population in total population. This is estimated as 0.18
from the 2018 NEMIS report.
AveSize = In this study, this is the average school size for P2, estimated at 64.2.
RR = Student response (completion) rate set at 95 per cent
The above formula was used to examine the sample sizes for each state using literacy proficiency
rate as the primary indicator (“r” or “p”). Due to their similarities in context, we adapted the
literacy rate in Sokoto state for Katsina, Zamfara and Kano states while we maintained reported
literacy rates for Bauchi and Niger states respectively as obtained from the 2010 NEDS report. The
total estimated sample sizes for the six states are 9,515 pupils, using the above formula. The
distribution of the sample size, as obtained from the formula for each state, is presented in Table 5
as follows:

Kano 6 1447 13 11 1 2 56
Total 36 9.515 13 73 2 14 331
7.4.2. Determination of sample size of the pupils using power calculation
For the pupil school-based assessment survey, we used the proficiency level of the pupil as the
primary indicator for the calculation of sample size to measure the learning outcomes of pupils
against the baseline. Similarly, the pupil proficiency level reported by the 2010 Nigeria Education
Data Survey (NEDS), which is a nationally representative survey, was employed as baseline values in
estimating the sample size using the power calculation method.
Since impact evaluation requires estimating changes in outcomes between two groups (treatment
and comparison), we employed the power calculation programming approach which provides
estimates of how large samples need to be in each of the study groups. In practice, power
calculations are usually performed using statistical packages37, and researchers are particularly
36The confidence level indicates the probability with which the estimation of the location of a statistical parameter in a sample survey is also true
for the population.

advised to use any of the available statistical software for estimating the required samples38. In
most education research including impact evaluation, multi-stage designs are mostly used, which
requires accounting for the clustering effect on the standard errors (SE)39 of programme impact
estimates40. In this end-line evaluation, the schools constituted the clusters from which samples of
pupils were selected. As a result, in running the power calculation programme, we used STATA
“cluster sampsi” based on the following parameters:
α = 5 per cent alpha (acceptable error rate)
β = 80 per cent power
rho = Intra-cluster correlation of 0.1
base correl = Coefficient of variation of 0.5
SD = 2.5 standard deviation per arm
In addition, we also indicated a required average cluster size of 13 pupils (as stated in the ToR).
This produced a sample size of 533 pupils per study group and a minimum of 41 clusters/schools
recommended per group in each of the states.

Since Propensity Scores Matching (PSM) is employed to match treatment and comparison groups at
school-level, experts have recommended that samples for both the treatment group and the
comparison group must be larger than the suggested sample size by power calculations and that
the over-sampling must be greaterfor the comparison than the treatment group.
Consequently, given the available resources for this survey, the final school sample size for the
treatment groups comprised 48 schools while the comparison group comprised 63 schools per
group in each state as shown in Table 4. This gave a total of 762 schools and 9,898 pupils for
the school survey. More specifically, the distributions of sample schools and pupils per group and
state are provided in Table 7.

7.4.3. Justifications for adapting the power calculation sampling approach
over MICS survey sampling formula
Estimating the exact sample size of a survey is an important part of research design and evidence
has shown that different study designs (e.g., cross-sectional, case-control or clinical trials/experimental
design study, etc.) require different methods of sample size calculation and one formula cannot be
used in all designs22. MICS, like DHS, is a cross-sectional survey that involves looking at data from
a population at one specific point in time. Therefore, it is not known to establish causal or
relational effects, as desired in impact evaluations. However, impact evaluation designs generally
involve the evaluation of changes over time or the comparison of two groups to establish a causal
link. Unlike a cross-section survey sample which is designed to have high external validity,
experimental surveys usually have low-moderate external validity.
Given the above reasons, we chose to implement the samples generated by power calculation
which is a most recognised and recommended approach for estimating experimental survey samples
in most studies,22,41including World Bank and UNICEF Office of Research – Innocenti21.
7.4.4. Determination of sample size of households/caregivers using
Power Calculation
GEP3-CTP intervention was implemented in Niger and Sokoto states with 72 and 62 CTP benefitting
schools respectively. The CTP benefitting schools were selected from GEP3 school list based on the
results of the community mapping which identified the communities with a relatively high number
of out-of-school girls (impact evaluation of UNICEF GEP3-CTP, 2017). Since all the CTP benefitting
schools were included in the impact evaluation (which serves as a baseline for this evaluation) and
because the CTP benefitting schools are not so many, all the CTP schools were purposively
selected for this end-line evaluation (Nige 72 schools; Sokoto: 62 schools).
As the sample size estimation for school surveys, we used power calculation to estimate the
required sample size for the household survey. The primary indicator in power calculations was the
household expenditure on girls’ education per term. For Bauchi and Katsina states, the baseline data
on the indicator was obtained from the 2010 NEDS report for those states, while the indicators
values for Niger and Sokoto states were obtained from the UNICEF-CTP impact evaluation report.
The result of the power calculation produced 465 samples of caregivers and a minimum of 31
clusters per study group in each state.

To ensure oversampling as required by PSM for household-level matching, the sample size was
increased to 35 and 41 clusters in treatment and comparison groups respectively, which also led to
an increase in the number of caregivers to be interviewed per cluster as shown in Table 8.

7.4.5. Sampling technique for school and household surveys
7.4.5.1. School survey sampling procedures
At the school (cluster) level, the desired sample size for GEP3 learning-CTP treatment group followed a random
selection of schools from the list of GEP3 pilot schools that benefitted from GEP3-CTP interventions in each
LGA in Niger and Sokoto states. For GEP3 learning-only group, sampled schools were selected randomly from
the list of non-CTP GEP schools in Niger and Sokoto states, all GEP3 pilot schools in Bauchi, Katsina and
Zamfara states, as well as GEP3 expansion schools in Kano state.
At the pupil selection level, school admission and daily attendance registers of Primary 2 pupils were obtained
from schools’ head teachers at the sampled schools in GEP3 learning-only group of schools across the six
states and in GEP3 learning-CTP treatment group in Niger and Sokoto states. This was followed by the random
selection of 13 pupils for pupil surveys in each of the sampled schools in both treatment groups. Where
adequate or updated school records were not in place, headcounts of pupils were taken in P2 class to make a
random sample of the 13 participating pupils (seven females and six males) in the pupil survey. The same
procedures were followed within the selected schools in comparison groups across the states.
7.4.5.2. Sampling technique for household survey
The households/caregivers in GEP3 learning-CTP treatment group (as described above) were sampled from the
list of CTP benefitting pupils/caregivers obtained from UNICEF. For GEP3 learning-only and control groups, a
total of 15 pupils were sampled from the list of randomly selected schools. They were later traced to their
various houses for the household surveys. For both school and community sampling, the sampling procedures
as discussed were executed using Stata software or MS Excel package using RAND function, as appropriate.
Number of sampled and surveyed pupils and households/caregivers
As presented in Tables 9, 10 and 11, the field teams were able to cover and complete surveys in about 55 per
cent of the total number of sampled pupils and households. The coverage rate also varies by evaluation
treatment type. The gap in survey coverage was mainly due to the increased security risks, especially Niger,
Zamfara, Katsina and Sokoto states. Consequently, most of the schools were not accessible, and therefore
data collection could not take place. Alternative means of data collection, such as telephone surveys, could not
be deployed since a list of phone numbers of sampled pupils and households did not exist. Most of the learning
assessments were also designed for face-to-face data collection.

7.5. Qualitative sampling
For the qualitative side of the evaluation, purposive sampling was employed to select appropriate respondents
for in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. For the Semi-Structured Interviews (SSI) a total of 41
interviews were conducted with key stakeholders. The criteria for selection were geographical location;
function in UNICEF, the education sector, LGA and at community level; and levels of involvement or interaction
with GEP3.
For the Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with the different groups of stakeholders, we conducted a total of 48
FGDs. These included 12 community men and women FGDs (six per group) in the intervention areas with six
to eight participants per focus group. The men and women had separate focus groups to ensure that there is
no reticence due to gender socio-cultural dynamics. Beneficiaries of the CTP were recruited for the community
FGDs in the intervention areas. FGDs of the headteachers, CMBC, SBMCs, HiLWA, Girls for Girls, etc. were
carried out in the focal LGAs. Respondents were selected using the criteria of function in the various
committees and types, as well as the level of interaction with GEP3 (including the CTP in Niger and Sokoto
states). Table 12 shows the sample sizes for the qualitative interviews.

7.6. Field staff training, pre-testing, and field data collection
7.6.1. Recruitment of enumerators
For the effective and efficient collection of data for this evaluation, we enlisted the services of field
researchers at state levels. This was done by The Education Partnership (TEP) Centre, the local
research institution that partnered with OAG on this evaluation. The data collectors were selected
based on their demonstrated experience in collecting qualitative data via virtual platforms and
quantitative data using Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) methods (i.e., CommCare),
educational background and language proficiency. A team with an equal gender mix was recruited.
These enumerators were recruited within the evaluation states.

7.6.2. Training of enumerators
A five-day central training (including a one-day pilot) was conducted with key field personnel. This training
involved supervisors and project managers who later served as trainers in the cascade training in the six states.
A training agenda was developed capturing the different skill sets to be acquired during the training. There was
classroom training for the first four days and a pilot exercise and debrief on the fifth day. The training was held
in a central location in Abuja and a combination of classroom training and practical experiences were used. The
training involved a detailed review of the questionnaire, fieldwork protocols, practicing mock interviews, and
using CAPI. The training materials were designed to include participatory methods for learning. Such methods
allowed team members to learn from each other by sharing insights and lessons learned from previous
experiences. In the end, team members had a common understanding of the scope of work, expected
deliverables, data collection tools and deadlines to be adhered to, as well as ethics of research with
consideration to all stakeholders involved. The training was carried out by OAG and TEP. The central training in
Abuja was conducted as both in-person and virtual training.
The training was cascaded to the six focal states and replicated over another five days. A total of 77
enumerators/qualitative research assistants and seven supervisors were trained.
7.6.3. Pre-testing of tools
After the training, the team tested the tools and response procedures for each question, probing, recording,
and storing data following agreed procedures. After testing the tools, the team received feedback from and
discussed difficulties/issues encountered and implemented context-specific and/or country-specific solutions
to the challenges. All feedback was used to refine data collection tools where necessary. Pre-testing of tools
took place at the central level of training and within the six focal states.
7.6.4. Fieldwork Implementation
A total of 77 enumerators/qualitative research assistants and seven supervisors were deployed for the surveys
and qualitative interviews across the six focal states. The seven supervisors supported the data quality
assurance process for the study through the provision of validation for the different interviews during the
survey implementation. The school and household surveys were conducted by enumerators who had been
trained by TEP on the use of the CAPI data entry programme for running complex large-scale surveys.
Administering the questionnaire: Primary data were collected for the quantitative research through
interviewer-administered questionnaires. A scoring technique was applied, especially for producing indicator
scores. Questionnaires were designed in English and then translated into local languages where necessary for
the assessment. Data collection was carried out using CAPI on Android phones. Consultants used the digital
data collection approach applying CommCare as shown in Figure 5 below.

7.6.5. Strategy to deal with COVID-19
The outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) was a serious threat at the time of the data collection. To be
successful, this consultancy assignment integrated COVID-19 protection and preventive-related guidelines into
fieldwork plans. This was important to not only protect participants but also researchers and not to expose them to
risks of coronavirus infection. In building on this reality, we incorporated several precautionary steps, including:

1.Social distancing: During fieldwork, we ensured social distancing for interviews and FGDs by implementing
the following measures:
a) Sitting arrangement: Employing a circular type of sitting arrangement where participants of
focus group discussions were asked to sit one meter (3 feet) apart from each other as
illustrated in Figure 6. A maximum of seven participants per focus group was allowed.

b) Avoiding handshakes: Participants were asked to avoid common greetings such as
handshakes; and instead encouraged them to greet with a wave, nod or bow among other
locally acceptable gestures.
2.Hand washing: A portable hand washing kit was provided and included clean water, soap or
alcohol-based hand sanitisers at all meeting venues to permit the participants to frequently wash
their hands for at least 20 seconds each time.
3.Provision of face masks: Participants were provided with re-usable face masks to wear during
meetings and interviews. Participants were encouraged to cough or sneeze into their elbow,
tissue or a handkerchief.
4.Managing time during FGDs: As per the guidelines provided by the government and public
health experts, all meetings involving small groups of people (e.g., FGDs) were conducted within
an hour as per public health guidance.
The outlined measures were observed together to ensure maximum protection of the participants,
consultants and the project staff that were part of this study. Throughout the data collection
process, the meetings started and ended with some information sharing around COVID-19 and why
it was important to adhere to the public health advice on preventive and protective measures
against the spread of the coronavirus.
Regarding other key issues such as insecurity and logistical difficulties during data collection, several
protocols were put in place by TEP. Table 13 details the overall risks kept in view by the field
researchers and the protocols to mitigate them.
7.7. Data analysis and quality assurance
7.7.1. Data storage and cleaning
To capture data, the enumerators used a tablet using CommCare which made it easy to design
forms and collect data. As we used the CAPI (in-field data entry), data collected were transferred
electronically by the field supervisors to the data processing staff at the TEP Lagos office daily.
Therefore, the supervisor in each state retrieved all the tablets and reviewed each tablet for
completeness daily. The data were synchronised to an online server and into a shared Google
Drive. From there, the data manager at TEP Centre downloaded the data and undertook additional
consistency checks and saved the data locally and in a backup folder.

In data cleaning, we dealt with data problems as they occurred. Error-prevention strategies reduced many
problems but cannot eliminate them. Data cleaning in this evaluation involved repeated cycles of screening,
diagnosing, and editing of suspected data abnormalities executed first by TEP and OAG. Four basic types of
data issues were reviewed: lack or excess of data; outliers, including inconsistencies; strange patterns in (joint)
distributions; and unexpected analysis results and other types of inferences and abstractions. Many outliers
were detected by perceiving nonconformity with prior expectations, based on the evaluation team's
experience, pilot studies, evidence in the literature, or common sense. Variable coding and labelling of the
end-line database were aligned with those used at the baseline and end-line databases.
7.7.2. Quantitative data analysis
Quantitative data were analysed using both Stata and IBM SPSS software exported as Comma Separated
Values (CSV) in Excel from the mobile devices. The most critical analysis techniques included frequency
distributions with percentages; Online analytical processing (OLAP) cubes reports for measures of central
tendency, cross-tabulations with Chi Square (χ2) for nominal and ordinal-scaled variables, regressions, as well
as Independent T-test and one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)42 for interval-scaled variables and bivariate
analyses.
7.7.2.1. Measurement of pupils’ proficiency in literacy and numeracy
The percentage of pupils who were proficient in numeracy and literacy (separately and both) were calculated
and disaggregated by sex for each of the six states.
Learning outcomes data collected from the sampled schools and pupils were analysed using SPSS. First, we
completed a descriptive analysis using univariate and bivariate statistical tools. This enabled us to provide a
snapshot of the learning outcomes and pupils’ composition across intervention and comparison groups. For this
level of analysis, we reported literacy and numeracy assessment scores. Then we completed a multivariate
regression analysis to estimate the relative mean differences between the intervention and comparison groups
while accounting for differences in the composition of the pupil populations served. However, though
multivariate regression provided estimates that control for pupil and school-level differences in observed
characteristics, it did not account for the non-random nature of the intervention assignment mechanism.
For the next level of analysis, we considered the baseline learning outcomes of the sampled schools before the
interventions’ implementation – in Bauchi, Niger, Zamfara and Katsina where these were available. This
enabled inferences about the relative performance of the interventions relative to the comparison groups which
could be construed as causal.
In essence, the analysis began with a descriptive analysis of how schools in the treatment group have changed
between baseline, midline and end-line. This was followed by the results of the impact analysis, which
exploited the random assignment of schools into intervention and comparison groups to examine whether
descriptive trends observed in the intervention group over time likely occurred because of GEP3 interventions.
Similar to the baseline, the literacy, and numeracy assessments were constructed following six steps, namely
clarifying constructs, test targeting, administration, psychometric analysis, drawing benchmarks and secondary
data analysis.
The constructs that were measured through the learning achievement tests in GEP3 evaluation were English
literacy/language and Hausa literacy/language and numeracy. GEP3 evaluation used the broader constructs of
literacy and numeracy, rather than reading and Mathematics, as discussions with stakeholders held at baseline
highlighted that the programme expected children to improve learning in areas that fit into these broader areas
of competencies covered by literacy and numeracy. They include understanding texts, using reading to
understand the world, drawing inferences and communicating in writing, using money in everyday life
problem-solving situations, adding, subtracting, multiplying simple numbers and reading a clock.
The primary analysis produced two variables for each learning construct per pupil. The first was a scale score.
The scale score is a precise measure of where, along the achievement scale, the pupil sits. The scale score is
useful for fine-grained analysis like multi-level modelling, regressions and correlations. The second variable
proficiency band is useful for describing what learning the pupils have achieved, how and what the children
know and can do and what has changed with time.
42The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the
means of two or more independent (unrelated) groups.

As in the baseline and midline, we analysed pupil achievement based on Rasch modelling (IRT).
This psychometric analysis was carried out using fit-for-purpose software. This approach allowed for
valid comparisons to be drawn across learning assessments administered over different years. As
such, a scaled score is the mathematical transformation of a pupil’s raw scores to report her/his
score on a continuum consistently over the years, and across different versions of the
assessment43,44. Rasch analysis also allowed for test difficulty and pupil ability to be reported
independently on the same scale.
7.7.2.2. Attribution analysis of measurement of DID or PSM
Counterfactual analysis was used, involving a comparison between what occurred and what would
have happened in the absence of GEP3 intervention. This is the logic for including households
(caregivers) with no CTP benefits and non-targeted schools as comparison groups. The assessment
of GEP3, including CTP outcomes, involved addressing the basic impact questions and disentangling
CTP effects from intervening factors. To show attribution (cause-effect), in Niger and Sokoto states,
we focused on the impact of CTP in primary schools located in CTP-targeted communities
represented by the LGAs in Niger State and the LGAs in Sokoto State that have benefitted from
the programme.
PSM was employed during the empirical analysis stage to match treatment groups and comparison
groups at both the school-level data and household-level data. Propensity score methods attempt to
simulate the conditions of an experiment in which recipients and non-recipients are randomly
assigned, allowing for the identification of a causal link between treatment and outcome variables.
The PSM identified groups with the same observable socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., age,
sex, years of education, income, marital status, location and household size) as those participating
in the programme. This was done by estimating a statistical model of the probability of participating
(propensity to participate) using a regression model with participation as the zero-one dependent
variable and a set of observable characteristics, which were unaffected by the intervention, as the
explanatory variables. The coefficients were used to calculate a propensity score, and participants
were matched with non-participants based on having similar propensity scores. To address any
confounding issues such as unobservable characteristics, PSM was completed by DID regression
analysis.
7.7.2.3. Analysis of HH income from cash transfer HH survey
Analysis of household data, including cash transfer survey data, was conducted using Stata version
14.0. First, descriptive analysis of household data by state across CTP and non-CTP intervention
areas was conducted using univariate and bivariate statistical tools.
7.7.2.4. Cost benefit analysis of GEP3 programme
The VfM assessment compared “without GEP3 scenario” against “GEP3 scenario” to determine the
cost-benefit ratio of implementing the project. The assessment covered six states which participated
in GEP3 programme. An economic perspective of the cost-benefit of implementing the project was
taken by considering the opportunity costs of implementation and not just the financial costs. This
perspective considers private (costs and benefits impacting the pupil) and social costs and benefits
(those relating to the society at large). In terms of the policy time horizon, the analysis estimated
costs and benefits over a time horizon of 45 years, considering the age of a primary school-age girl
from six to nine years and the life expectancy of an average woman in Nigeria (World Bank, 2021).
Regarding the time effects, as costs and benefits were distributed over different periods from
2013–2020, the benefits and cost streams were discounted into the 2015 present value to aggregate
the cost and benefits throughout the analysis. Costs inputs for 2013 and 2014 were not available. A
nominal discount rate of 10 per cent was applied based on the opportunity cost of capital in
developing countries (Levin; Levin, 1983). To account for inflation, the nominal discount rate was
adjusted to a real discount rate of 5 per cent using 2015 as the base year.
Costs and benefits
There are consequences or impacts both positive and negative associated with implementing GEP3. These
either accrue directly or indirectly to the individual and their immediate family, also known as private costs or
benefits. Those accruing to the society at large, either directly or indirectly, are also known as public or social.
These can be further categorised as either market (monetary) or non-market-based returns or impacts. To arrive

at estimates of the unit costs or benefits, project documents such as financial reports, log frame reports,
annual GEP 3 review reports, and GEP 3 business case reports among others were reviewed. Also, relevant
literature documents were reviewed.
For girls not attending school, the consequences are more negative than positive. The direct benefit will be
immediate earnings from the labour market while the direct cost will be the lost opportunity of attending
school. There are also indirect costs to non-schooling for girls. Some of these include early marriage; ill health
due to poor physical and emotional maturity in marriage, such as vesicovaginal fistula; intimate partner abuse;
lack of decision-making within the household; higher rates of poverty for the household due to lower earnings
in adulthood; and higher rates of infertility. For the society at large, there are also costs related to directly and
indirectly weakened solidarity in communities and reduced women’s participation in society.
Private impacts
The costs to a girl and her family for participating in this project are mainly market-based and include costs of
transportation to school, uniforms, meals at school, and books, which are direct while indirect costs include
earnings forgone from the labour market to attend school. Private benefits include the direct benefit of
increased earnings from the labour market due to being educated. Indirect benefits include the satisfaction of
being educated, improved decision-making ability, improved health-seeking behaviour, reduced family size,
better productivity within the community, better financial literacy45. These benefits are difficult to monetize and
are not included in this analysis46. Estimated indirect benefits account for about 80 per cent of the direct
market returns to education47.
Social impacts
These social consequences are also known as externalities. They include market (monetary) and non-market
returns to the society and public benefits derived by other individuals both in the current and future generations
from the education of another individual. They are often positive. Direct non-market returns on the economy
include higher investment rates in physical capital and education due to increased income growth, education’s
contribution to innovation, research and development. While indirect non-market effects include better public
health; lower net population growth rates; strengthening of civic institutions, rule of law, democratisation and
human rights; lower crime rates; poverty reduction due to smaller families; and less deforestation and water
pollution. Some negative externalities include more air pollution, noise pollution and more emigration of
workers. However, all these externalities are difficult to monetise. In Africa, it is estimated that these
externalities account for between 45 per cent and 58 per cent of the total social returns to education38. There
are however debates on their extent and their rates of returns are not included in the analysis.
Analysis of market-based returns
To determine the cost-benefit ratio of implementing GEP3, the economic returns of each additional girl enrolled
in school in relation to the total cost of enrolling and retaining each girl in school, were considered. The relevant
market costs and benefits of an individual girl enrolled, from both the girl’s and government’s perspectives are
summarised below:
Over the six-year period of her primary education a girl and her family can incur an opportunity cost,
which is forgone earning, due to her absence from the labour market. This was set at 50 per cent of the
salary of a Grade Level 1 staff of the Nigerian public service. There is no educational requirement for this
Grade Level. An individual only needs to be able-bodied.
A girl and her family incur the direct cost of school uniform, textbooks, transportation to school and
meals at school for six years. It is estimated that this would cost a Nigerian family, US$7.7 per girl (World
Bank, 2008). This was adjusted for inflation using the US GDP deflator as of 2015. This resulted in an
estimate of $8.5 in 2015 US constant prices.
The Nigerian Government also incurs direct costs for the education of this girl for six years. This includes
personnel salaries, training, infrastructure – building and maintenance and overhead costs. However,
there is a dearth of the actual unit cost of educating a female children by the Nigerian government. A
background paper for the 2010 EFA Global Monitoring estimates an average unit cost of US$190 for

combined recurrent and capital resources a primary school pupil incurs in accordance with the EFA-FTI
guidelines48. These estimates are higher than international unit costs for education in developing countries
as they incorporate capital costs in addition to recurrent costs used by international standards. The World
Bank benchmarks US$76 for primary education49. This estimate is also adjusted for inflation and comes to
US$209 in 2015 US constant prices.
Based on the survival rate to Grade 5, it was assumed that only 79 per cent of the pupils who enrolled
graduated. It was assumed that those who did not graduate entered the labour market and earned the
wage of a Grade Level 1 civil servant.
It is assumed that a girl will enter the labour market immediately after completing primary education, and
she will be entering the child labour market which is informal.The girl and her family for the period of her
primary education, six years, incur an opportunity cost from her not working. This was set at 50 per cent of
the salary of a Grade Level 3 staff of the Nigerian public service. The educational requirement is the first
school leaving certificate which is the primary school certificate.
For the next 45 years, she will earn a higher salary than had she not attended primary school.
There will be private and social non-market returns for the rest of her life because of her primary educa-tion.
However, these were included in this monetary analysis.
The cost of the project of getting a girl into primary school and retaining her there is the total annual cost
spent by the project.
7.7.3. Qualitative data analysis
Qualitative transcripts were analysed using the qualitative data analysis software, NVivo 12 Pro. An inductive
approach and open thematic coding were then used. Transcripts were read and coded using and exploring
common themes, sub-themes, patterns and contradictions, according to the evaluation framework. Analysis
was conducted iteratively using a three-pronged approach: “noticing, collecting, and thinking”. During
analysis, cross-thematization was done to compare the emerging information with quantitative data to
ensure that any outliers are captured. The qualitative and quantitative data regarding all criteria identified was
analysed and triangulated.
Data was also triangulated to compare data sources for reliability and to identify areas of agreement and
disagreement across data sources and interview respondents. Theme identification enabled us to manage
large volumes of data effectively by grouping them into manageable categories50. Data were organised to
develop a detailed understanding of each intervention component, its context, implementation and outcome.
All qualitative data sources were systematically coded. The coding scheme aligned with the research
questions and themes for each domain in the evaluation. Codes for themes and sub-domains were defined
and refined during the initial data analysis workshop. To ensure reliability across coders, all project team
members involved in coding qualitative data compared codes from a similar source to identify and rectify
inconsistencies. In addition, one team member reviewed a sub-sample of coded data for all sources to check
reliability as coding proceeded. A qualitative analysis software package, NVivo 12 Pro, made it easier to
organize and synthesize transcripts and interview write-ups, especially those including narratives. This
enabled a structured coding system and enhanced the organization and categorization of data.

7.8.1. Data quality assurance plans
Data quality control measures included reviewing the study tools, having interview schedules and
data collection movement plans, translating the tools into the local language when necessary, and
standardisation of the training (pre-testing and ensuring that the enumerators are familiar with
terminologies used in the survey tool), regular supervision and cross-checking of the uploaded
data. The tools were pre-tested during the central training in Abuja and during the cascade
training at state levels. The mobile data capture enabled hints, strict sequencing, skip patterns,
repeats, constraints, relevancy, formulas, calculations, grouping and nesting instructions to be
digitised.
The Field Manager was responsible for the quality assurance of the survey protocols and final
outputs. To ensure the data collection was of the highest possible quality, the following
procedures were followed:
The field managers provided regular updates to the evaluation team via the OAG Country
Lead.
The field managers provided close supervision to the field team throughout the fieldwork.
TEP had a full-time supervisor for each fieldwork team dedicated solely to oversight,
mentoring and assistance, and they were in daily contact with the Field Manager.
Daily field reports (e.g., number of interviews conducted, etc.) were sent by field supervisors
to the survey coordinator.
The supervisors checked all data entries at the end of each survey day, aided by the built-in
consistency checks written into the data capture software.
There was a daily electronic transfer of data to the cloud for the data processing team to
check the data entry for inconsistent, impossible, or unlikely data points.
Time was allocated for re-visiting interviewees in the case of queries over the data.
Each team had a daily meeting where the day’s experiences were discussed, and corrections
made.
Ten percent of each interviewer’s responses were checked by the field supervisors using a
“back-check” tool. Back checks are when a sub-sample of interviewed households/individuals
is revisited after their initial interview. During the re-visit, a sub-sample of questions is
asked, and their answers are checked with the answers given in the initial interview. A log
of differences was kept, and any systematic issues were reported to the relevant team. The
benefit of back checking is that it can identify interviewers who may be asking the
questions incorrectly, but mostly its benefit comes from incentivising the interviewers to
correct inaccurate data because they know that a random selection of their work will be
verified.
7.8.2. Supervision omitted
At the time of interviews, enumerators and qualitative research assistants were monitored by
supervisors to ensure that they followed the schedule strictly. After deploying enumerators, the
supervisors randomly travelled around the cluster to track and confirm that all enumerators were
gathering the information from identified stakeholders. The supervisor had a list of all
interviewees for the day and made arrangements and timetables to see them. Most of the key
informant interviews at national and state levels were conducted via virtual platforms, where
agreed but community-level interviews and FGDs were conducted face-to-face. Qualitative
interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and translated when necessary.
At the end of each workday, all interviewers submitted their completed interview schedule forms
to the supervisor. The supervisor confirmed that the coding of all sheets had been done
correctly. Following this cross-check, the enumerators sent the completed questionnaires of the
day to the server. the following day the data manager gave feedback on the quality of data and
the progress of the work towards the planned time of data collection.

7.8.3. Selection bias
The evaluation team committed to:
1. Programme placement or targeting bias, in which the location of the target population of the
programme was not random, (GEP3 intervention sites were purposively targeted by the
programme); and
2. Self-selection bias, in which for the CTP, households chose whether to participate and thus could
have been different in their experiences, endowments and abilities. The least biased way to deal
with this problem is to use an experimental approach to construct a counterfactual situation by
randomly assigning households to treatment (beneficiary) and control (non-beneficiary) groups. This
was not feasible for this evaluation, because the choice of GEP3 intervention sites and CTP
participation decisions were made before the design of the evaluation and were not randomised.
A core aim of the evaluation was to know the difference between the participants’ outcomes with
and without treatment (the relevant GEP3 intervention). However, both outcomes could not be
observed for the same individuals or households at the same time. Taking the mean outcome of
non-participants as an approximation is not advisable, since participants and non-participants usually
differ in other issues besides the absence of treatment. This problem is known as selection bias.
The matching approach was used as a solution to selection bias. It showed a close link to the
experimental context51. Its basic idea was to find a large group of non-participants who were
similar to the participants in all relevant pre-treatment characteristics. That being done, differences in
outcomes of this well-selected and thus adequate control/comparison group and participants could
be attributed to the programme.
Therefore, as mentioned before, the PSM method was used in this evaluation to establish the
counterfactual and attribution to the intervention.
7.9. Ethical considerations and evaluation principles
Ethical clearance for this study was obtained from the Ethics Review Committee (ERC) of the FME
and the Nigerian Health Research Ethics Committee (NHREC). Appropriate government approvals for
the study were also obtained from relevant state, local government, and community authorities.
In compliance with UNICEF’s research policy, we endeavoured to ensure that the evaluation was
designed and conducted in a manner that respected and protected the rights, confidentiality,
impartiality, privacy, accountability, respect and welfare of respondents. In addition, the data were
technically accurate and reliable and was collected transparently and impartially, which contributed to
reliability and validity.
GEP3 evaluation followed UNICEF guidelines on the ethical participation of adults and children. In
addition, all participants in the evaluation were fully informed about the nature and purpose of the
evaluation and their requested involvement. Only participants who have given their written or verbal
consent (documented) were included in the evaluation. Particular attention was paid to the avoidance
of harm and stress to evaluation participants, especially children and other vulnerable populations;
obtaining informed consent/verbal assent from them; absence of benefit or compensation offered to
them; protection of their privacy; confidentiality and anonymity of data collected; security matters
and protection protocols both for enumerators and key informants; training of enumerators in ethical
issues and on enumeration and communication skills.
All the documents, including data collection, entry and analysis tools, and all the data developed or
collected for this evaluation are the intellectual property of the Government of Nigeria, FCDO and
UNICEF. The evaluation team members may not publish or disseminate the Evaluation Report, data
collection tools, collected data, or any other documents produced from this consultancy without the
express permission and acknowledgement of UNICEF. The evaluation has been conducted according
to the ethical principles and standards defined by the United Nations Evaluation Group:
51 Rubin (1974), Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983, 1985a); Lechner (1998).

in these terms of reference will apply.
Two possible sources of bias in this evaluation were:
Supervise data collectors and data collection checking in the field.
Report any safeguarding or child protection concerns as soon as possible and within 24
hours to the UNICEF Safeguarding Focal Points; administrative, technical and physical
safeguards to protect the confidentiality of those participating in research.
Do No Harm safeguards for children participating in research, including child-safe physical
safeguards, as well as emotional/psychosocial safeguards and safeguarding against the risk
of sexual exploitation or abuse during the evaluation.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries were practicing social distancing and placing restrictions on
travel and face-to-face interactions in line with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Hence,
special measures were required when considering participatory methods and research with project
stakeholders to ensure the safety of all stakeholders. This meant staying as close to the principles of
participation and inclusion as possible without harming respondents or requiring them to put
themselves in risky situations. Our approach outlined the best-case scenario in response to the ToR.
Adjustments could be made during the data collection depending on the prevailing situation regarding
COVID-19 in Nigeria. Overall, we complied with United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and
Standards for Evaluation 2017; UNICEF Ethical Standards Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and
Analysis, and UNEG Guidance on Impact Evaluation in UN Agency Evaluation Systems: Guidance on
Selection, Planning and Management.

8. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
This section presents the findings and preliminary conclusions of the evaluation criteria and
questions that guided GEP3 evaluation. Findings rely upon both primary and secondary data and, in
particular, draw from the learning outcomes assessment survey, household survey, head teacher
survey, classroom observation survey, secondary data sources – EMIS; NDHS; MICS, semi-
structured interviews and focus group discussions.
Where appropriate, findings for discussion and questions due to their interrelatedness were
considered. The strength of the evidence that informs the response for the evaluation criteria and
questions was also categorized. Table 14 describes the ratings used to establish the strength of
the evidence.

8.1. Relevance of GEP3 2012–2022 (Is GEP3 doing the right things
for children?)
Overall finding: GEP3 2012–2022 is highly relevant in addressing the needs and barriers of
girls' education in northern Nigeria
Quality of the evidence: Strong
According to the OECD, the DAC criterion of relevance addresses the “extent to which the
intervention objectives and design respond to beneficiaries, global, country, and partner/institution
needs, policies, and priorities, and continue to do so if circumstances change.”
The evaluation questions used for assessing the relevance of GEP3 are summarised below:
QR 1. To what extent has the Girls’ Education Project Phase 3 (GEP3) Expected Results
(Impact, Outcomes and Outputs) and design responded to beneficiaries’ global, country,
and partner/institution needs, policies, and priorities considering the evolving circumstances
(Is GEP3 doing the right things?)
QR 2. Is the CTP intervention appropriate in terms of design and delivery approach, given
the contextual realities in Niger and Sokoto states; and to what extent were the needs
and priorities of targeted beneficiaries/local partners consistent with the CTP objectives
and deliverables?
The questions related to relevance were answered by triangulating the findings from the extensive
document review (which includes convincing and rigorous sources outside of the present study) and
the qualitative interviews (KIIs and FGDs).

The overall conclusions of the independent evaluation team on the relevance of GEP3 are
summarised below:
Preliminary Conclusions on Relevance of GEP3
REL 1: The project tackled relevance by addressing increased enrolment and retention of girls in
northern Nigeria from a comprehensive and systemic approach (considering financial, social and
identity components), which proved to be successful. (Para 7–22)
REL 2: The evidence-based criteria in the design of GEP3-CTP Theory of Change (ToC) proved
relevant and appropriate and most of the assumptions held true. The ToC was robust –
structurally sound and plausible. (Para 1–6)
REL 3: A comprehensive situational analysis of basic education in northern Nigeria was undertaken
to support the programmatic design and proper prioritisation of relevant needs and causal
determinant factors/barriers of girls’ and boys’ education in northern Nigeria. (Para 10)
REL 4: The programme displayed an adequate application of the Results-based Planning and
Management (RBM) approach. The monitoring and evaluation framework contained adequate vertical
logic of results chains and horizontal logic of measurement of results (indicators, base line,
targets, etc.) to successfully track and adjust the project. (Para 10–11)
REL 5: GEP3 initiatives, such as CTP, were perceived as the right incentive-inspired approach as it
responded to tangible needs. The CTP was appropriate in terms of design and delivery approach
addressing the three dimensions of demand bottlenecks, given the contextual realities in Niger
and Sokoto states regarding girls’ education. (Para 23–26)
REL 6: The effort to consider parallel capacity building initiatives in order to reinforce the
pedagogical ones, such as data collection and management-skills at local level, was useful and
appropriate. (Para 13 and 20)
REL 7: The anticipated “imitation strategies” identified such as Girls for Girls or the role of
HiLWA or MAs were influential, even beyond girls. (Para 8)
REL 8: There was evidence of strong and sensible synergies between the community level
stakeholders (SBMCs, MAs, HiLWA, CBMCs) involved in the programme. (Para 12 and 17)
REL 9: Although the CTP targeting approach was able to avoid inclusion errors through monitoring
visits to beneficiaries' homes, this was not the case for exclusion errors. More strategic
community participation in targeting could have reduced exclusion errors and improved equity.
(Para 24)
REL 10: Most of the assumptions in the ToC were proven by evidence, but the assumption
related to effective learning through infrastructure and teachers provided by local and central
authorities was not fully proven. Although materials were available, and infrastructure was globally
provided by authorities (though not always sufficient and with some need for repairs), the lack of
newly recruited teachers to fulfil the pressing staffing needs given the increasing number of
children enrolled, was evidenced early in the project and hindered impact in quality learning
outcomes. (Para 6)

8.1.1. Appropriateness of the programme’s Theory of Change
1. The evidence-based criteria in the redesign of GEP3 ToC in 2015 and in retaining key factors in
supporting girls' education have proved relevant and appropriate. Relevant demand and supply-side
barriers to girls’ education were clearly outlined in GEP3 Business Case. The comprehensive approach in the
three main pillars of the ToC were effectively implemented through the various interventions:
• Early school enrolment, retention and literacy (Output 1)
• Regular mentoring and training of teachers (Output 2)
• Improving governance (Output 3)
2. The interventions considered different stakeholders’ needs and interests as well as long-term results
through the improved capacity-building efforts, therefore creating a potential for sustainability. The
indicators elaborated in the log frame/results framework were appropriate to track the programme’s progress.
The results chain for GEP3 sought to address the barriers that keep children (especially girls) from attending
school and learning. Interventions were selected to address these barriers in an integrated way, using a
pilot-to-scale approach. Following the pilot phase, where project funds were used to test the relevance and
value of the interventions, scale-up of the refined models tested was envisaged, drawing on evidence of what
works and the availability of state funds. interventions:
3. The current trajectory of GEP3 and progress made to the output and outcome indicators, the
involvement in and ownership of GEP3 interventions by state governments and partners and the
scale-up achieved (though more limited than envisaged) highlight the relevance of the ToC52. For the CTP
aspect of the programme theory, a clear understanding of the patriarchal structure of the various contexts was
displayed. The social gender roles characterised by men traditionally holding decision-making power and
running economic and public affairs while the women mainly took charge of the domestic sphere and caring for
children were taken into consideration in the CTP design. In such a scenario, schooling is pro-boy rather than
pro-girl, since the most common socio-cultural pattern is for boys to be in charge of the household economy
while girls are devoted to the home and motherhood. Poverty was another factor in girls' non-enrolment in
school. When parents found it difficult to afford the indirect costs of schooling – such as school materials and
transport costs, and the loss of income from an out-of-school girl selling goods for her mother – they would
prioritise the education of boys over girls. Furthermore, parents believed that marriage provided a financially
stable future for girls.
4. The detailed ToC specially designed for GEP3-CTP took all of these causal factors into account in
formulating the hypotheses underlying the design of the interventions53: “If female caregivers of girl
beneficiaries receive cash transfers and caregivers understand the purpose of the unconditional cash transfer
and the argument for girl education” then (1) women will control a greater share of household income, (2)
expenditure on education will increase as well as girls’ enrolment and retention in school, (3) child labour and
early marriage will be reduced, and (4) gender equity in education and society, in general, will increase. The
cash was provided to female caregivers, thereby addressing the bottlenecks in the demand for education: (1)
the financial access recognising indirect cost, (2) the socio-cultural practices empowering women who would
have a better say in decision making regarding the schooling of their daughters as they are the ones receiving
and therefore managing the use of the unconditional cash transfer, (3) the continuity of use through the
sensitisation promoting a positive impact of girl education and encouraging women to use the one-time cash
transfer to invest in income generating activities that would enable them to continue to support their daughters’
education.
“It really has influence on women, because women value women ... Women were given 20,000
Naira for their daughters to go to school. They always remember, they always have it in mind
that it is for their children, so this motivation will remain in their mind. Some have never got this
kind of assistance before... there are some that instead of them to spend all the money, they will
use it to buy cattle with it and raise the cattle, it is so, even today they are doing it. So, there is
really achievement in these things.” Mothers, Sokoto

5. Overall, the ToC of GEP3 proved to be relevant and consistent with the complexity of the
existing context. It reflected the concrete evidence in the field well. It was a sound and
adequate approach to articulate the global intervention, particularly considering its
multifactorial nature and the long-term perspective of expected changes.
6. The plausibility of GEP3’s ToC was largely supported by the stakeholders’ common understanding
and adherence to its objectives; thanks, partly due to its redesign and simplification in 2015.
This decision proved to have a great added value in terms of the operationalisation of the
intervention. The focus of the ToC on girls’ enrolment and retention is almost unanimously
agreed upon by all levels and types of stakeholders. Moreover, stakeholders confirm a palpable
evolution in these aspects and mention some unexpected effects such as overcrowded
classrooms, which can hinder the expected improvement in learning. The assumptions included in
the ToC in respect of the provision of staff and schools to meet the increasing demand, as well
as sufficient funding for related aspects (materials, infrastructure) are yet to be proven. As
already identified in previous evaluations54, improving the quality of education in IQSs continues
to be particularly undermined by underfunding even though institutional capacities have been
reinforced.
8.1.2. Review of the Assumptions in the Theory of Change
8.1.2.1 General review of the assumptions
A general review of the assumptions proposed in the ToC55 against findings and evidence is briefly described as
follows:
Assumptions related to output 1: Increased enrolment and retention of girls in basic education.
1. That increased demand for and understanding/value of basic education by parents and enhancing
financial access of poor families to basic education for their daughters through CT had a positive
impact on girls’ enrolment and retention.
2. That enhanced professional development of teachers (government schools and IQSs) and head
teachers had a positive impact on girls’ learning and retention.
Both above-mentioned assumptions related to girls’ enrolment and retention were proven correct by evidence
collected and based on the results obtained. As analysed through impact and effectiveness, the CTP and the
improvement of teachers’ skills had a positive impact on output N1.
Assumptions related to output 2: Improved capacity of teachers to deliver effective learning for girls.
3. That government could supply primary schools and teachers to meet increased
community demand for education, with the support of high-level political engagement.
4. That specific teaching and learning strategies did positively impact the acquisition of
literacy, numeracy and life skills, which benefitted girls in the future.
5. That improved effectiveness of SBMCs/CBMCs in communities had a positive impact on
girls’ enrolment, retention and learning.

..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Assumption 3 related to effective learning through infrastructure and teachers provided by local and central
authorities was not fully proven by the evidence. Although materials were available, and infrastructure was
globally provided by authorities (though not always sufficient and with some need for repairs), the lack of
newly recruited teachers to fulfil the pressing staffing needs given the increasing number of children
enrolled was evidenced early in the project and partially hindered impact on quality learning outcomes.
In terms of the impact on learning outcomes of the improved teaching and learning strategies (assumption
4), the evidence points to overall more child-centred and interactive practices in the classroom.
Assumption 5 proved extremely valid as the roles of the local and community school-related instances
were a pivotal element in adhering, informing, communicating, and validating the project for communities
included in the project. The fact that local and community authorities recognised by the social structures
were in favour and actively involved in the interventions greatly legitimised the enrolment, retention and
learning efforts towards girls. It is undeniable that this powerful assumption had a very important impact on
the overall level of outcome.
Assumptions related to both outputs 1 and 2: Improved governance to strengthen girls’ education and
increased retention.
6. That improved educational governance (planning and budgeting, including releases) did
positively impact girls’ enrolment and retention.
7. That enhanced participation of women in the education sector at all levels did positively
impact girls’ enrolment and retention.
These two assumptions also proved valid as the improvement in management capacities at local and state
reflected in a better level of handling of the project protocols, including the CT component. This improved
educational governance level, combined with important institutional ownership of the outputs, is quite
promising in terms of the potential sustainability effects of GEP3 at an institutional level.
Moreover, the visibility and relevance of females within several educational sectors were highly impactful in
the outputs of the project, too. HiLWA, MAs, female teachers and head mistresses, as well as female
members of the SBMCs or CBMCs, were consistently perceived by most of the stakeholders as role
models and positive drivers of changes in perceptions. Their collective role seemed to be the key to
supporting the underlying cultural transformation intended to introduce education in girls’ current social
script and place.
Comprehensive technical assumption
8. Each intervention had an appreciable impact on girls’ access and attainment in basic education,
but those combined interventions supported the most vulnerable girls more effectively.
This last assumption, which encompasses very ambitious expectations in terms of outcomes, proved partially
valid as is thoroughly explained under the effectiveness and impact sections of the current report. In summary,
evidence-based analysis supports that each intervention was impactful at different levels and with different
scopes but tackling the most vulnerable population most effectively was not always achieved.
8.1.2.2 Specific findings on relevance related to the ToC
7. The implementation strategy of the project fits well within the existing government and
community strategies and their logic. Most of the instances mobilised within GEP3
interventions at all levels existed already and have been given an even more relevant role by the
project. At local and regional levels, the government possessed before the project the right and
sufficient number of human resources to carry on and monitor activities aimed at increasing the
inclusion and retention of girls at school. In the same sense, empowerment of locally based
instances such as the School-Based Management Committees (SBMCs) or the many community-

based organisations (HiLWA and churches) proved to be relevant for the organisations involved,
and therefore, highly effective. Nevertheless, the capacity of exploiting these important institutional
and sociological platforms must be reinforced by fluent communication and sustainability in
financial resources, as these very promising existing conditions are not evenly distributed across
all regions or government levels.
8. The focus of GEP3 on contextualised barriers to basic education for girls within its sphere
of influence proved to be relevant. Considering a broader scope of factual aspects hindering
girls’ inclusion and retention allowed tackling and understanding of the problem in its complexity.
Initiatives such as CTP or the teachers’ capacity improvement proved undoubtedly that a
comprehensive approach pays off, including clearly known side barriers such as poverty, teachers’
actual competencies and cultural stereotypes. Teacher capacity development, as well as deeply
entrenched attitudes about the role of girls and women in the northern Nigerian society proved
hard to change at the beginning of the project. Progressively, the expected “imitation strategies”
based on positive female role models at a community level were very influential, even beyond
girls. The project’s emerging gender strategy was an important asset to it, enabling a more
coherent approach by reinforcing each of the already ongoing efforts (G4G, HiLWA, He for She,
MAs and female teachers’ training).
9. The systemic approach given to the capacity-building dimension improved the coherence
and reinforced the consistency of the results. Indeed, the effort to design and implement
parallel, yet articulated supportive capacity-building initiatives (through strategic areas such as
quality education and governance) to reinforce the pedagogical ones, such as data collection
competencies and management-skills reinforcement at a local level, was adequate, effective and
impactful. The effect of improved capacities at a local level to monitor, manage and use
educational information data has had a direct impact on improved decision-making practices, thus
reinforcing the quality and effectiveness of local educational management.
10. In this sense, the comprehensive situational analysis undertaken to support the programmatic
design and proper prioritisation of relevant needs and causal determinant factors and barriers of
pupil’s education in northern Nigeria proved highly adequate. For instance, the analysis highlighted
that 9 out of 10 children with no education were found in the North-West (46 percent) and
North-East geopolitical zones. Hausa girls in northern Nigeria were also noted as facing some of
the world’s most severe education deprivation. Just 12 percent of Hausa girls of primary school
age attended primary school, and 97 percent of 17 to 22-year-olds had fewer than two years of
education56.
11. Furthermore, the programme displayed an adequate application of the Results-based
Planning and Management (RBM) approach. The monitoring and evaluation framework contained
adequate vertical logic of results chains and horizontal logic of measurement of results (indicators,
baseline, targets, etc.) to successfully track and adjust the project.
In a related sense, there is increasing evidence among local level stakeholders of an
emerging new “accountability culture” relating to the project’s results. This is coherent with a
high level of adhesion from the different levels and types of stakeholders already mentioned. As
the effort and results are seen as achieved collectively, the measures and means put in place to
follow up and monitor this progress and the achievement are too. The accepted and shared
perception that GEP3 upholds a noble commonly owned goal renders its accountability also
relevant and strongly relevant. From local authorities through their newly acquired managing skills,
to the civil society organisations, all stakeholders consulted feel strongly involved and accountable
for their part in the process, whether the role is financial, awareness-raising, or capacity-building
oriented. This shared accountability mentality is reflected in the sought-after transparency,
collaborative decision-making processes, and dialogue as the main sensitising tool. All results
achieved are seen as commonly owned and potentially beneficial for everyone, in one way or the
other, reflecting the meaningfulness of the initiative.
12. Synergies emerged stronger and more organically than expected as they were respectful of
existing values, social structures and roles. This made them more relevant since they all
shared a common objective. The empowerment of local instances and the grassroots sensitising
strategies (such as word-of-mouth and door-to-door information) were effectively combined to
create a change perceived as endogenous, from within. In this sense, stakeholders consistently
declare the fruitful evidence-based synergies created around GEP3 (CBOs, HiLWA and CBMCs).

13. From all initiatives analysed, the teachers’ training component seemed to be key in improving the
quality of teaching and learning. Early learning strongly improved with better-trained teachers and girls’
inclusion and participation in the learning process also increased, especially with female teachers.
Better-trained teachers also helped to raise awareness of the relevance of the core problem tackled by GEP3
(girls’ access to education) and became respected advocates of the project between the schools and
communities.
8.1.3 Review - Value of the strategies and activities of GEP3
14. Findings from the document review57 and the perceptions of the key informants and the FGD participants
displayed the appropriateness of the strategies and activities of GEP3. All through the several assessments
led by UNICEF to support the implementation of different stages/components of the programme (midline,
partial learning outcomes and teachers’ training impact, among others), there was consistent evidence that
the programme responded to beneficiaries’ (country, and partner/institution) needs, policies, and priorities
considering the evolving circumstances.
15. The programme demonstrated strong buy-in from the state (SUBEB, SMoE, SAME) and LGA government
partners, as well as community-level entities – community members, key community and political
stakeholders, community-level associations, teachers, radio and television stations, etc. This was
demonstrated by the replication of selected GEP3 interventions such as the SDG Joint Fund Programme in
Sokoto state which continued GEP3-CTP with state funds from 2017, which led to an increase in enrolment
gains; albeit the (limited) funding leveraged from these partnerships.
16. Value of strategies and activities related to output I: How enrolment and retention of girls in basic
education was operationally addressed by the programme. Overall, the key informants and the FGD
participants denoted that the programme had been relevant in addressing the needs of the
populations served. The overall perceptions were that enrolment and retention-related goals were achieved
at both local and state levels. CTP was perceived as the right incentive-inspired approach. There were
effective imitation strategies such as the G4G which displayed positive influences beyond the girls. There
was evidence of synergies between and within the stakeholders (SBMCs, MAs, HiLWA, CBMCs, He for She
and CBOs).
17. It became clear that education was considered the business of all. The involvement of all the
relevant stakeholders was seen as key to undertaking the challenge. Respondents noted that it was not
solely the role of the ministries and agencies of education, it was also the responsibility of the MAs,
SBMC, traditional and religious leaders, and civic society at the grass root community levels to ensure
that the education mandate was accomplished. Respondents indicated that the programme had carried
out extensive advocacy activities to ensure the buy-in of a wide variety of community-level stakeholders.
Activities by specific stakeholder groups were mentioned frequently in the KIIs and FGDs. For instance,
HiLWA’s advocacy and mentorship roles were considered useful for stimulating increased enrolment and
retention of girls in schools. Many of the women were seen as role models; they were well known to
the communities and therefore trusted.
“HiLWA advocate for policy making in favour of girls’ education and they also advocate for
women to be part of decision making in the educational setting. For example, formerly we didn’t
have women as directors, head teachers but with the help of HiLWA we now starting to have
women in decision making positions. They also advocate for stakeholders in the House of
Assembly to see that laws are been passed in favour of girl’s education. HiLWA also serve as
mentors to the girls, they organize programmes for the girls, they motivate the girls. They also
serve as mentors to the Mothers’ Association. The Mothers’ Associations serve in the
community while HiLWA serves at the top.” SUBEB stakeholder, Kano

18. Similarly, the SBMCs were considered an integral part of GEP3 – their sensitisation role and
its value in changing the attitude of the male and female caregivers towards the education
of female children were frequently reported. In the FGDs, participants in different states
frequently indicated that the roles played by the SMBCs were critical and had resulted in a
reduction of early marriages for girls and increased enrolment and retention of girls in schools in
the communities. In addition to sensitisation of the communities about the importance of female
children’s education, the SBMCs played mediatory roles in families – convincing the men to
release their daughters to go back to school when they noticed absenteeism of girls from school
that could signal imminent dropouts. Additionally, an “accountability culture” due to the monitoring
role played by the SBMCs was highlighted in the KIIs and FGDs. This social accountability
element is related to the SBMCs role in ensuring the availability of teachers in schools at the
appropriate times via monitoring activities. Sometimes the SBMCs also led the planning and
implementation of activities funded by micro-grants given to schools in GEP3.
“UNICEF supported four or five times through micro grants sometimes 1.5 million Naira,
sometimes 250, 000 sometimes 700,000 were given to the schools and SBMCs were involved.
The money goes directly to the SBMC's account not even the LGEA, not even the SUBEB. The
community develops their work plan based on their priorities – the problems within a particular
school, to bring success within those particular schools. These funds have tremendously helped
the GEP sustainability in this LGA.” LGEA stakeholder, Bauchi
19. The activities of the MAs were also frequently reported as critical in reducing the number
of out-of-school children. They also made financial commitments during their weekly, or monthly,
meetings – contributing 50 or 100 Naira – for buying school sandals and uniforms for children.
Furthermore, the parents, the community members, and the traditional and religious leaders were
key advocates themselves. They were considered in the programme so that they could ensure
thatgirls would go to school.
20. Then the girls were able to get their peers back to school. Regular mentoring and training of
teachers (output 2) were described by the key informants as useful in improving the
capacity needed to deliver quality learning. The interventions under this output targeted the
improvement of the quality of teaching and learning of school-aged girls in marginalised and
disadvantaged communities. This was pursued in the states through the Female Teachers Trainee
Scholarship Scheme (FTTSS) and the Head Teachers Capacity Training Programme. The key
informants perceived GEP3 as instrumental in ensuring that children could have quality learning
through the improvement of the quality of teaching which occurred as the capacities of teachers
were built. The focus was also on building the capacities of the head teachers around leadership
to ensure more efficient coordination of the teachers. The training was considered useful and vital
in improving the quality of teaching and learning, as well as raising awareness of the core
problem (girls’ access to education). The comprehensive nature of capacity building carried out
was highlighted frequently by the stakeholders. At the state level, respondents agreed that many
stakeholders had been trained so that they were proactive in discharging their duties and working
towards the achievement of the project’s goals. Nevertheless, the teacher training element was
considered a weakness in the system in terms of quality practices (methods, strategies and
pedagogical competencies). The approach to training was considered by stakeholders as not always
fully effective or systematic enough. Several reasons were given for this including a lack of
suitable entry profiles (basic skills) which made assimilation of training difficult and faulty
geographical coverage of the training. Some stakeholders perceived that the sociodemographic
differences between urban and rural in GEP3 states were sometimes underestimated and this
influenced outcome negatively.
“You see a lot of concentration of teachers in urban centres and less in rural areas due to one
reason or the other. The capacity is there but there is a wide gap in terms of staffing ratio – ratio
of teacher to pupil. That really derails and that slows the issues of getting the desired results.”

21. Relating to governance (output 3), GEP3 aimed at strengthening girls' education by influencing key areas
of governance in the state education system to support basic education. An element that was well
considered was the educational data consolidation needs, and the lack of quality quantitative
educational information. GEP3 supported the implementation of the Annual School Census which helped
to identify the changes and gaps in pupils' annual enrolment in schools (boys and girls) for necessary
government or donor actions. The programme also aimed at improving the EMIS, and this was perceived by
many stakeholders as having been achieved thoroughly, as GEP3 had focused on and built on data over the
years.
“Through this programme, I think the impact on data have gone far beyond the six focus states
and has impacted the entire system, in a very positive way – in terms of building capacity,
collecting education management information system data which are typically in the annual
census. Through the evidence generated on enrolment right, we have, the universal basic
education commission, that has worked and taken enrolment right as a major strategy, across
the entire country so GEP3 enrolment right is a reality.” National Local Staff, UNICEF
22. Governance was also improved by strengthening the School-Based Management Committees.
Additionally, the focus on infrastructure improvements rendered learning more feasible and more
accessible. Enrolment drivers were well perceived about the infrastructure and material conditions of
learning. It seemed to have made schools more conducive, more suitable, and modern for activities planned
by the local government. Several improvements such as the renovation of classrooms, water sources and
toilets; the purchase of books, chalks, and an array of learning materials, including uniforms for the pupils
were reported as having contributed considerably towards the improvement of teaching and learning, girls’
attendance, pupil’s attendance, and community participation.
QR 2. Is the CTP intervention appropriate in terms of design and delivery approach, given the
contextual realities in Niger and Sokoto states; and to what extent were the needs and
priorities of targeted beneficiaries/local partners consistent with the CTP objectives and
deliverables?
8.1.4. Appropriateness of the CTP design in Niger and Sokoto states
23. The design of GEP3-CTP used a combined geographical-categorical targeting approach. In this
targeting approach, the catchment areas of schools with the highest proportion of out-of-school
girls are targeted (geographic targeting). Within these catchment areas, the female caregivers of
all girls between the ages of six and 15 were eligible for a transfer with female children as the
intended beneficiary (categorical targeting)58. A quarterly benefit of 5,000 Naira (about US$30) per
girl was paid in cash to the caregiver at a pay point at a cluster school each quarter. Payments
were exclusively channelled through these pay points and administrated by a contracted bank.
Caregivers had to show their programme identity card, which they had received upon enrolment
into GEP3-CTP, to the payment official who would then hand over the transfer.
Respondents from FGD and KII59 in Sokoto and Niger, the only two states where cash transfers
were provided, confirmed that geographical targeting was carried out, mentioning that not all
communities and schools benefitted from the CTP. They explained that categorial targeting for girls
was carried out by assessing the economic situation of the household:
“They look at the condition of the child with his parents, whether the parents can afford his
education or not, so they will know whether he should be assisted or not … they look at the
living conditions … whereas some parents want their children to go to school but because they
don’t have the resources to provide them with a uniform and other thing. So, they look at this
thing.“ Female caregivers, Sokoto

24. However, the impact evaluation of GEP3-CTP60 highlighted that the targeting process did not
select the poorest caregivers as CTP beneficiaries in GEP3 communities. The results indicated
that CTP beneficiaries have an average weekly income of almost four times those of the control
communities in each of the two states. Nevertheless, the beneficiaries were chosen from the
low-income group bracket. Also, it highlighted the inability of local authorities to pay the CT
on time and the irregularity of the CT payment. Furthermore, in Niger state the 2015 general
election campaign impacted the CT payment that was delayed in the first year. While
respondents from Sokoto state mentioned having received the CT in four instalments, some
respondents from Niger state have mentioned a one-time instalment of the total amount of the
one-year CT. However, the findings from the 2017 Impact Evaluation of GEP3-CTP displayed that
the last two tranches of the CT were paid simultaneously due to the cumulative delay. As a
result, the women who received two payments simultaneously decided to use the money for
small businesses to avoid wasting it and to keep the profit to use for the children’s needs.
Fathers and mothers explained during the FGDs that the community had been informed that
parents had to enrol their daughters in school to be considered for a cash transfer to cover
related costs. Visits were then made to the homes based on the registration list. Complaints
from parents who did not receive a CT were mentioned, but it was acknowledged that the
school authorities were indeed using vulnerability criteria in selecting orphans and children
from poor families. On the other hand, it was reported during FGDs with SBMCs that no
specific information on the targeting of CTP was provided to individuals or community
committees, nor to HiLWA, and that the information reported was based on personal
observations.
25. The unconditionality of the CTP was considered appropriate in its design given the
contextual realities in the two states. No condition was given on how to use the transfer.
However, to ensure that caregivers used the money for the purpose for which it was meant, the
transfer was accompanied by sensitisation campaigns during and after payments. This persuaded
caregivers to use the money for the purpose for which it was intended. An advantage regarding
the unconditional nature of the programme, was the relatively low monitoring costs. In the case
of education, for example, it is recognised in the related literature61 that the system of
monitoring the conditionality compliance of a conditional cash transfer implies burdens both for
schools and the institution managing the conditional cash transfer itself. On one side, reporting
on the regular attendance of pupils place an administrative and financial burden on schools. On
the other, the conditional cash transfer programme sustains a high cost for verifying compliance
and defining administrative procedures for warning or suspending non-compliers from the payment
of the transfer.
26. The previous evaluation of the CTP in 2017 revealed that there was some negative perception in
the qualitative study on the misuse of cash transfers – that in some cases, caregivers did not
consider the schooling of girls. However, the quantitative data revealed that this was not true
and that, despite the non-conditionality, the cash had contributed to girls’ schooling. In this
evaluation, there were both qualitative and quantitative evidence to support that cash
transfers contributed considerably to increasing the enrolment and retention of girls in
schools. This finding is also supported by literature on the non-conditionality of cash transfers62.
It is recognised that the misuse of cash in unconditional cash transfers is usually minimal and in
no way justifies the costly expenses of a control system that would need to be put in place to
monitor the provision of conditional cash.
The unconditionality of the cash transfers had its disadvantages. As reported in the
interviews, parents sometimes did not invest the money to generate more income because they
felt that the stipends were free and would keep coming. Because the cash was given
unconditionally and the people benefitting from it knew they would not have to repay the money,
some of them did not protect the money.
“And for me if you are not investing, how do you intend to assist these children? In one of the
programmes I attended on cash transfer, when the parents were asked what will happen when
this money stops coming, they asked a question: will it stop coming? and that is because they
think the money is free, they feel that they will continue to receive that money. If that money is
made conditional cash transfer, they will know that they will have to return the money through
one way or the other, so they will have to invest in money.“ FME stakeholder

8.2. Coherence of GEP3 2012–2022
Overall finding: GEP3 2012–2022 is highly coherent with global and national priorities of the education sector
in Nigeria
Quality of the evidence: Strong
According to the OECD, the DAC criterion of coherence addresses “the compatibility of the intervention with
other interventions in a country, sector or institution.” In other words, how well does the intervention fit?
The evaluation questions used for assessing coherence of GEP3 are recapitulated below:
QC 1. To what extent did other interventions (particularly policies) support or undermine the GEP3
intervention, including internal and external coherence (How well does the programme fit?)?
QC 2. To what extent is the CTP coherent with the broader policy environment at state and federal
levels (including education, social protection and gender policies; other interventions, e.g., supply-side
improvements in the education sector)?
The questions related to coherence were answered by triangulating the findings from the extensive document
review and the qualitative interviews (KIIs and FGDs).
The two questions on coherence were addressed together due to their intertwined nature to avoid redundancy
and ensure a logical flow.
The overall conclusions of the independent evaluation team on the coherence of GEP3 are
summarised below:
Preliminary conclusions on coherence of GEP3
COH 1: GEP3-CTP was intentionally structured to align with global strategies on girls’ education – integrating
elements from evidence used globally in designing interventions for girls’ education. (Para 27)
COH 2: GEP3 as implemented in the six focal states, was coherent with education and the broader policy
environment at federal and state levels. The Programme was aligned with the national strategic policy on
education as well as the national social protection and gender policies, and the adapted policies at state
levels. (Para 28–34)
COH 3: GEP3 considered key contextual elements and causal factors in formulating the hypotheses
underlying the design of GEP3 interventions. Consideration for the contextual issues relating to financial
access, socio-cultural practices and continuity of use was also seen clearly in the CTP design. (Para 35 and
36)
COH 4: As far as alignment of the GEP-CTP with the local and contextual realities is concerned, some
sociocultural elements still must be addressed, especially those aspects which are so deeply entrenched in
societal and cultural norms that they are likely beyond the scope of one programme or one sector. (Para 36)

8.2.1. Coherence alignment with global strategies and priorities on girls’
education
27. The programme was intentionally structured to align with global strategies on girls’
education. The multiplication of benefits to the next generation of girls through mentoring by
programme alumnae (as seen in Girls 4 Girls) was a crucial component. Another programme
element that reflected global evidence included the role of men and boys in reducing barriers
that girls face through their collaboration with SBMCs/CBMCs, He for She, religious and
community leaders and others.
GEP3 redesign and the fine-tuning effort carried out in 2015 resulted in a revised ToC more in
line with global strategies and priorities. The main factors identified and retained as playing a role
in supporting girls' education were evidence-based. Coherence was also demonstrated in the
alignment of GEP3 to the UNFPA-UNICEF Global Programme to End Child Marriage63 which
promotes the rights of adolescent girls to avert marriage and achieve their aspirations through
education.
8.2.2. Alignment with national and state strategies and priorities
28. GEP3 as implemented in the six focal states was coherent with education and the broader
policy environment at federal and state levels. The programme was aligned with the national
strategic policy on education, the national social protection and gender policies and the adapted
policies at state levels. The CTP was viewed by the state government stakeholders in Niger and
Sokoto states as useful for achieving the policy objectives of increasing girls' enrolment in
schools and improving women's participation in social and economic development activities.
29. Alignment of GEP3 with the national and state priorities on education was considered key
to its influence around governance of the education sector. Nigeria has a strategic plan for
education which has received the buy-in of most of the states in the federation. Out of the 36
states and FCT, 30 states have their priorities for the education sector fairly aligned to the
national priorities. This was considered a strength of the programme by the stakeholders.
GEP3 was aligned with the major policy goal of reduction in the number of out-of-school
children, especially for girls in northern Nigeria, which is well articulated in the Strategic Plans for
Development of Education Section in Nigeria (2011–2015 and 2016–2020). GEP3 also had the
target of achieving Universal Primary Education (UPE) and Universal Basic Education (UBE) as
stipulated in the six Education for All (EFA) goals64.
30. GEP3 strategy was focused on the most vulnerable and marginalised groups, including girls. The
inclusion of children that were disabled, in some cases boys, was considered very positive. The
alignment of the programme with the priorities of the Strategic Plan65 to ensure that there is
equity in access, participation, completion, and access to different levels of education was also
an asset.

In terms of integrating Islamic schools with formal education, there was evidence of coherence
with the state priorities on education. Also, the design of GEP3-CTP used a combined
geographical-categorical targeting approach. The catchment areas of schools with the highest
proportion of out-of-school girls were targeted.
31. Furthermore, considering that lack of access to education is a key dimension of child poverty,
GEP3-CTP programme also aligns with the Government’s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan
(ERGP) from 2017 to 2020 which has now been replaced by Nigeria’s Medium-term National
Development Plan (2021–2025) of which poverty reduction and social inclusion remain among
the nine highlighted government priorities. In 2017, the National Social Protection Policy (NSPP)
was approved by the Federal Executive Council, and it was developed within the framework of
the ERGP. The overall goal of the policy mentions gender sensitivity explicitly.
32. Sokoto state’s ranking among Nigerian states is among the lowest human development indices,
particularly for health, nutrition and education. Sokoto’s success with the cash transfer scheme
from the GEP to reduce gender gaps in public primary schooling has resulted in a state-run
programme. In 2020, the Joint SDG Fund selected Sokoto state to implement a two-year joint
programme named “Institutionalizing Social Protection for Accelerated SDG Implementation in
Nigeria”66. The programme aims to accelerate the policy implementation by focusing on
reinforcing legal, institutional and financial sustainability of the system at federal level.
Mainstreaming of social protection interventions in the Sokoto Development Plan should sustain
well-resourced state-led social protection interventions beyond the joint programme duration, which
in return serves as a model for other states.
33. The 2006 gender policy priorities of the Federal Ministry of Women's Affairs were derived from
an analysis of the gender equality situation at the national level and include, in particular, two
issues commonly considered by GEP3, namely (1) gender disparity in enrolment, attrition, and
retention at all levels – primary, secondary, and tertiary; and (2) gender-based cultural/religious
biases and harmful cultural and religious practices that reproduce inequalities in gender role
relations in Nigeria.
“When we look at data in Nigeria, and we are looking at children in school, all the children who
are in Islamic schools are not considered children in school, because they don’t follow
traditional curriculum, they follow the religious, and GEP3 is one of those projects that really
invested heavily in ensuring that Islamic schools became integrated and has really set for what
a real integration means.” UNICEF staff
“I will say that it is very aligned, because if you look at the ministry of education road map by
the Minister, one of the foci that he has really, been embarking on is to ensure that Nigeria
reduces the number of out of school children.” UNICEF National Level Stakeholder
8.2.2.1. Alignment of GEP3 with the National Policy of Education
(Education Act 2014)
34. Furthermore, GEP3 strengthens a series of objectives stated in the National Policy Act to
accomplish the Universal Basic Education goal (UBE). The alignment of GEP3 initiative to the
general vision and improvements expected in basic education lies mainly on three objectives:
Developing a strong citizen-based consciousness for education and a strong commitment to
its vigorous promotion, clearly achieved by the strong community involvement and
empowerment through GEP3 initiatives undertaken (mostly encompassed in output 3 of the
ToC)
Providing compulsory, free and universal basic education for every Nigerian child of school
age
Reducing the incidence of drop-out from the formal school system, through improved
relevance, quality and efficiency, tackled by the enrolment and retention, and teacher’s
training initiatives (outputs 1 and 2)

Additionally, it can be said that GEP3 supports and aligns other objectives and integrates
complementary approaches to promote basic education. For example, GEP3 can cater to the
learning needs of young persons who for some reason have had to interrupt their schooling. It
also aligns with the priority of ensuring the acquisition of the appropriate levels of literacy,
numeracy, communicative and life skills, as well as the ethical, moral, security and civic values
needed to establish a solid foundation for life-long learning67.
8.2.3. Alignment with local and contextual realities
35. The programme considered key contextual elements and causal factors in formulating the
hypotheses underlying the design of GEP3 interventions. It emerged clearly from the KII and
FGDS that a host of players at local and grassroots levels (e.g., SBMC, CBMC, MAs, HiLWA,
male youth advocates (He for She) traditional and religious leaders and NGOs) were meaningfully
involved in achieving the programme goals. Consideration for the contextual issues was also seen
clearly in the CTP design. For instance, the cash was provided to female caregivers, thereby
addressing the bottlenecks in the demand for education such as:
Financial access: recognising the indirect cost of education.
Socio-cultural practices: empowering women to have a better say in decision-making regarding the
schooling of their daughters as they were the ones who received and managed the use of the
unconditional cash transfers.
Continuity of use through sensitisation: promoting a positive impact on girls’ education and
encouraging women to use the cash transfers to invest in income-generating activities would enable
them to continue to support their daughters’ studies.
Poverty plays a vital role in human development and the perception about what boys and girls
should do and become (e.g., girls get married and boys manage economic resources). The
programme considered the need for families to send their daughters to work to increase income.
The cash transfer was considered by the community members as a good incentive to promote
girls’ education.
36. As far as the coherence of the GEP-CTP with the local and contextual realities is concerned,
some sociocultural elements must still be addressed. In Nigeria, as in many African countries,
the social roles associated with each of the two sexes are delimited by hierarchical and
patriarchal values which promote discrimination based on gender. The traditional family is therefore
based on a patriarchal structure, within which women are often seen as being subject to men.
Therefore, social gender roles are mainly characterised by the superiority of men and the
subordination of women. Moreover, a woman is primarily valued in her role as wife and mother
after the birth of a child. She is a visitor to her parent’s home since she will go to live with
her husband’s family – facing inwards while her husband is facing outwards. The high value of
virginity in marriage also favours child marriage which in most cases results in dropping out of
school. For some parents, marrying their daughter soon after her first menstruation is a way to
prevent the dishonour of pregnancy outside wedlock. These issues were taken into consideration
by the programme but are so deeply entrenched in societal and cultural norms that they are
beyond the scope of one programme or one sector.
8.3. Effectiveness of GEP3
Overall finding: GEP3 displayed strong effectiveness in the achievement of the programme’s
expected results.
Quality of the evidence: Strong
The DAC criterion of effectiveness is defined here as “the extent to which the interventions
achieved, or were expected to achieve, their objectives, and results, including any differential
results across groups.” Effectiveness focuses more closely on outputs and attributable results
than impact.

The evaluation questions used for assessing the effectiveness of GEP3 are summarized below:
QE 1. To what extent did GEP3 achieve its expected results (outcomes and outputs) agreed within the
business plan, including any differential results across states in the three main strategic areas of access,
quality and governance of the education sector?
QE 2. What are the factors (internal and external to UNICEF) that contributed to the attainment of the
GEP3 programme and results the most?
QE 3. What are the factors (internal and external to UNICEF) that hindered the attainment of GEP3
(including CTP) programme and results the most?
The questions on effectiveness were answered by triangulating quantitative and qualitative information from
different data sources, including the earning outcomes assessment survey, household survey, head teacher
survey, classroom observation survey, secondary data sources (EMIS, NDHS, MICS), semi-structured
interviews and focus group discussions. The specific data sources used for specific evaluation questions are
detailed in subsequent sections.
This section details the progress made against the output, outcome and impact indicators, key achievements
of GEP3; the drivers of change (DOC) and the factors that hindered change. The evidence rating applied to the
different questions related to effectiveness, impact and efficiency (see Table 14).

The overall conclusions of the independent evaluation team on the effectiveness of GEP3
are summarised below:
Conclusions on the effectiveness of GEP3 vis-a-vis the expected results (outcomes and outputs)
EFFE 1: GEP3 achieved its expected results (outcomes and outputs) agreed within the
Business Plan in the strategic area of access to an exceptional extent and in the two other
strategic areas of quality and governance of education sector to fairly more limited extents
(see Table 15: Detailing performance evaluation of results framework). (Para 37–38)
EFFE 2: The programme was highly effective in achieving enrolment and retention of girls in
schools. It enabled a definite shift in mindset regarding the importance of education for girls
and created a norm in many communities of a raised profile for educated girls. (Para 38–43
and 69)
EFFE 3: The combination of the early learning and the cash transfer interventions significantly
displayed the most effectiveness, with the highest proportion of households with 1-2 or more
girls who had completed nine years of schooling compared to the early learning intervention
only and control groups. (Para 43)
EFFE 4: The CTP specifically was effective in improving household consumption and welfare for
the beneficiary households in Niger and Sokoto states. The cash transfer significantly influenced
increased expenditure on girls’ education and the decisions to send and retain girls in school in
the two states. (Para 44–46)
EFFE 5: Pupils who benefitted from GEP3-RANA programme performed better than the control
groups in English and Hausa literacy as well as numeracy. For instance, pupils who benefitted
from GEP3-RANA programme scored significantly higher in English literacy than their
counterparts in the control group (p<0.01). Girls’ performances were higher on average than
boys’ in both English and Hausa literacy in public primary schools at end-line (Para 48–57)
EFFE 6: Training was key to improving the quality of teaching and learning, as well as raising
awareness on the relevance of the core problem (girls’ access to education). However, despite
the fact that the capacity building and improvement of teacher capacity were noted as a
strength of the programme, evidence from classroom observations and qualitative interviews
indicated gaps in the quality of teaching. This was partly attributed to inadequate teaching aids
or poor comprehension of the teaching material by teachers – and indicated a need to better
train people with the appropriate capabilities. (Para 59–64)
EFFE 7: Capacity building of head teachers in management processes improved school
governance. There was evidence of improved monitoring of school teachers. Governance was
also improved by strengthening the SBMCs. Additionally, the focus on infrastructure
improvements rendered learning more feasible and more accessible. Improvement in data quality

The achievement of outputs and outcomes showed a picture that was consistent across the focal
states: differences in outcomes existed more on a thematic level. The strength of the evidence is
shown in Table 16. The evidence for QE.1 is strong and supported with a variety of data sources
including surveys on learning outcomes, head teachers, classroom observations and interviews, and
focus group discussions. The evidence for QE.2 and Q3.3 is less strong and was provided with
desk review, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions.

8.3.2. Key achievements in girls' enrolment, retention and
completion of basic education
This section reviews the findings related to output and outcome indicators on the enrolment,
retention and completion of girls' education. The programme's effectiveness was assessed by
tracking indicators over time (using mixed methods) as defined within the logical and results
framework of GEP3.
38. Overall, the effectiveness of GEP3 was good vis-à-vis the intended outcomes and outputs
indicated in the logical and results framework.
Using the available EMIS data for 2018 and 2019, increases in girls' gross enrolment in primary
education in both public and private schools was analysed and estimated. The GPI between 2018
and 2019 in each of the programme target states was also analysed.
Secondary data analysis provided evidence of an increase in gross enrolment for girls and
improved GPI across all the states. Niger state was the exception where the GPI remained
approximately the same between the two periods. Figure 7 displays the percentage increase in
school enrolment of girls in public and private schools in each GEP3 state. The results show that
Sokoto and Bauchi states had the highest increase in enrolment (39.3 per cent and 34.3 per
cent respectively) while an increase in girls' enrolment in primary education was marginal in Kano
(3.7 per cent) and Niger (1.3 per cent). The differences in the overall enrolment results can be
attributed to the clear political will and improved governance of the programme components

(especially concerning output 3) in Sokoto and Bauchi as compared to Niger and Kano. Moreover,
Niger and Kano states experienced ongoing security risks during the period of GEP3. Data on
gender parity in primary school enrolment in target states between 2018 and 2019 showed
improved GPI across all the states except for Niger where the GPI remained nearly the same
between the two periods (see Figure 8).

39. Enrolment and retention were also assessed via the head teacher survey. The head teacher questionnaire
was administered in 359 public primary schools and 61 IQSs across six states (Bauchi 65, Kano 105, Katsina
52, Niger 63, Sokoto 77 and Zamfara 58) at the end-line (2021) as shown in Table 17. The questionnaire had also
been administered at baseline (2012) and midline (2018).

Public primary schools had an average of 591 pupils compared to 326 in IQSs. The average ratio
of girls to boys currently enrolled in P1–P3 was recorded as 0.97. The impact of COVID-19 on
school enrolment by boys and girls was found not to be significant. The average ratio of girls to
boys was 0.97. This is similar to the period after COVID-19 which was also 0.97. However, the
enrolment of girls to boys in P1 was higher before COVID-19 at a ratio 1.01 against 0.99 during
the period of evaluation. Comparing the average ratio of girls to boys in P1–P3 across the states
indicate a higher ratio in Kano at 1.08, followed by Katsina 0.96, Bauchi 0.94, Sokoto 0.93, Niger
0.83 and Zamfara 0.77. Analysis by school type indicates a higher enrolment ratio of girls to boys
in IQSs P1–P3 of 1.09 compared to 0.95 in public primary schools.
The ratio of girls to boys currently attending P1–P3 classes was 0.96. This was lower (but not
significantly) compared to a ratio of 0.97 before COVID-19. Analysis by the state on current P1–P3
class attendance indicated a higher ratio in Bauchi and Kano at 1.02 each followed by Sokoto 1.00,
Katsina 0.93, Niger 0.82 and Zamfara 0.81. At end-line, the ratio of P1–P2 class attendance for girls
to boys in IQSs was 1.1 which is high compared to 0.94 in public primary schools. The results
corroborate the enrolment ratio where IQSs were higher than public primary schools.
The results above indicate the insignificant impact of COVID-19 on school enrolment and attendance
of P1-P3 pupils. This could further be attributed to the higher proportion (82 per cent) of schools
that implemented COVID-19 protocols and a further 71 per cent of schools that were involved in
back-to-school campaigns.

The programme experienced an increased enrolment of girls in both IQS and public
schools. The enrolment ratio (girls:boys) for IQS increased from 1.01 at baseline to 1.18 at end-
line: an insignificant difference p=0.519). However, the enrolment ratio for public schools increased
significantly from 0.56 to 1.00 (p=0.000) as shown in Figure 10.

The level of increased enrolment in IQS was not significant while the increase in public school
enrolment was significant.
Enrolment and completion were also assessed via the household survey. The household
survey was carried out in four of the pilot states, Katsina, Bauchi, Niger and Sokoto. About 15
per cent of the 3,037 households were CTP beneficiary households while nearly 47 per cent of
the households had benefitted from the early learning intervention (RANA) only. The control group
consisted of 38.4 per cent of the households covered.
In estimating the influence of CTP on the female children’s school enrolment and completion at
end-line, the proportion of households with two or more female children enrolled in school
was the highest among GEP3-CTP benefitting households (25 per cent) followed by GEP3-
only early learning benefitting households (21.7 per cent) and 17.9 per cent for the control.
Following the result of one-way ANOVA shown in Table 18, the differences in the percentages of
households with two or more female children are statistically significant (p<0.001) between
treatment and control groups.

Similarly, in assessing the proportion of households with female children aged 15 years who had
completed nine years of schooling (basic school/junior secondary), GEP3-CTP treatment group
had the highest proportion of households with one to two girls (33.0 per cent) and
households with three or more girls (5.2 per cent) who had completed nine years of
schooling compared to the other two groups. This difference was statistically significant
(p=0.000). Correspondingly, when reviewed from the angle of households for which none of the
children aged 15 years had completed nine years of schooling (basic school/junior secondary), the
control group had the highest proportion (91.5 per cent) compared to 61.8 per cent of GEP3-CTP
group (see Figure 11).
43. These findings underscore the effectiveness of GEP3 early learning intervention, especially
when combined with CTP in enabling the enrolment and completion of education for girls
in the focal states.
Figure 11: Percentage of households with female children aged 15 years who have
completed nine years of schooling (primary school/junior secondary).
The remarkable increase in enrolment seen when GEP3 is combined with CTP is explained by the
influence of the cash transfers on household decision-making. Caregivers in the survey (and in the
qualitative interviews) indicated that the cash transfers together with the CTP sensitisation efforts
were important motivations for sending their daughters to school and for ensuring that they
complete their schooling. The removal of financial barriers by the cash transfers enabled this.
Figures 12 and 13 display the survey results.

8.3.3. Influence of CTP on expenditure on education and household
consumption and welfare
44. Figure 14 displays the estimates of the influence of CTP on schooling and household
consumption and welfare (in Naira) over time: before CTP, after receiving CTP and the current
estimate in 2021 measured by the average expenditure in each term. The results show that
average expenditure consistently increased before and after CTP was received in the households.
This difference in the household average expenditure on boys’ schooling, girls’ schooling, health
and food increased more significantly when the baseline amount is compared to the current
household expenditure in 2021, about five years after CTP ended.
Examining CTP influence on household consumption and welfare by comparing before and after
receiving CTP in 2016-2017, the findings in Figure 15 show that the increase in household
spending on girls’ education (30.5 per cent) was nearly double that of the spending on
boys’ education (16.4 per cent). Comparing the spending on children’s education between
2015–2016 (after receiving CTP) and currently in 2021 (towards the end of GEP3), both girls’ and
boys’ household education financing had further increased, though spending on boys’ education
had a higher percentage increase than that of girls.

45. There was evidence of a substantial influence of the cash transfers on household consumption
and welfare at the end of the programme. To estimate the influence of CTP on household
consumption and welfare, respondents were asked whether the CTP money they received helped
in improving the quality of nutrition in their households. Nearly all the respondents (98.7 per
cent) claimed that CTP money helped to improve the quality of nutrition in their households.
Figure 16 displays the extent of the influence of the cash transfers to caregivers on household
consumption. More than seven out of 10 reported that the influence was to a very large extent
and one out of four claimed that the cash transfers influenced household consumption to a large
extent. Likewise, 68.8 per cent of households of CTP beneficiaries reported regular consumption
of three cooked meals per day compared to about 47.3 percent recorded for the control group
(Figure 17).

46. GEP3-CTP was an unconditional cash transfer programme, meaning that enrolment into school
was not a condition for transfer receipt. However, a sensitisation campaign aimed at changing the
perception on girls’ education was carried out to increase the willingness of parents to enrol
their girls in school. In addition, a school enrolment campaign was also carried out to promote
and facilitate households to enrol their children..rls in the same way as boys.
Respondents from Niger state reported that the money was disbursed at the school premises and
given to the mother. In some cases, as noted earlier, the amount of 20,000 Naira was given in
one go at the beginning of the school year, which represented a significant amount of cash that
could be used as capital.
Testimonies from the FGDs indicated that, given the relatively high amount of the CT (20,000
Naira), parents utilized it as seed money to invest in a small business. This was especially true
when the CT was only allocated for one school year. Mothers used this money to invest in small
businesses to generate regular profits to continue their daughter's education after primary school or
even beyond secondary school.
47. The SBMC played a crucial role in informing the communities about GEP3-CTP programme,
particularly the importance of enrolling girls in school. The committee members not only facilitated
the mobilisation of parents to participate in information and sensitisation meetings but also went
door to door to take the time to convince reluctant fathers. The fact that the management
of the CT money was entrusted to the mother and not to the father included a potential risk of
conflict within the couple regarding the use of this money or the claim of part of it by the
father. It was during the awareness sessions and home visits that this choice was explained,
emphasising the objective of promoting the schooling of girls in the same way as boys.
“You see they are some that have never seen 5,000 Naira, but you see now they have been
given 20,000 Naira. Getting this money has helped women to support their children to go to
school. Why? Because they see that this money they get, they use it in a business and make
profit from it. They always think how to make this money grow so this girl can go to school…
Also, these parents are happy with the things that have been given to them because that has
really helped them and reduced poverty.” Mother, Sokoto.
“Even before they give the money, they will say that the money is for the child and not for the
father/because most of the time mothers are better at helping than fathers, if it's a mother, she
will know how to look after the girl.” Father, Sokoto.
8.3.4. Pupils’ learning outcomes
Results of the RANA and early learning intervention indicators at outcome levels highlighted the
details and trends of pupil learning outcomes between baseline and end-line in intervention schools.
The instruments used to collect the learning outcomes data were the same instruments used during
the baseline and midline evaluations. The assessed pupils were registered using a pupil
questionnaire that collected information about their age, gender, language spoken at home and their
household assets. They were assessed using the English and Hausa Literacy assessment
instruments. The numeracy instrument had only been administered in two of the states (Bauchi and
Niger) at baseline, no midline assessment was done. A numeracy assessment in this evaluation was
therefore carried out to establish a baseline for the six states. The literacy and numeracy proficiency
level descriptions are displayed in Annex 10.
Pupil literacy assessments were completed for a total of 5,450 pupils across the study locations in
the six states. Public primary schools constituted about 84.6 per cent of the total coverage while
15.4 per cent comprised IQS. This was in line with the sampling plan for the survey.
8.3.4.1 Pupil characteristics
The age distribution of the pupils (see Annex 11) shows that most of the pupils were eight years
old with a percentage of 9.9 per cent for female pupils and 9.1 per cent for male pupils. Also,
pupils aged seven years were the second most populous (8.1 per cent and 5.4 per cent for female
and male pupils respectively). Pupils aged between 14 and 15 years of age were the least
populated in the study. IQS pupils were older on average than public primary school pupils.

In terms of languages spoken at home, the majority (81.3 per cent) of the pupils assessed, speak
Hausa at home, followed by the languages Nupe (14.1 per cent) and Fulfulde (3.6 per cent).
Overall, very few of the pupils (0.5 per cent) reported speaking English at home across the six
states, as compared to none speaking English at home at the baseline. Kano state recorded the
highest number of Hausa speakers, while all the Nupe speakers were concentrated in Niger state.
All states recorded English speakers at home, except Zamfara state. Bauchi state had the highest
number of English speakers. Figure 18 depicts the distribution of languages spoken at home by

The survey coverage of an English literacy assessment by intervention type is displayed in Table 19
and indicates that more than half of the pupils covered during the end-line survey belonged to
GEP3 early learning (RANA) schools compared to about 6.4 per cent assessed in GEP3-CTP schools,
mainly in Niger and Sokoto states. More than one-third of the assessed pupils were from the

This final evaluation adopted a Rasch modelling approach which was also used in both baseline and
midline evaluations to analyse pupils’ learning outcomes. The Rasch modelling approach allows for
independent reporting of pupil ability and academic test difficulty on the same scale, thereby
allowing valid comparisons to be drawn across learning assessments administered to different study
groups at baseline, midline and end-line. The computed scores from the Rasch model for all pupils
were then converted into a scale with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100, also in line
with the baseline and midline analysis plan. The scale scores are precise measures of where pupils
sit along the achievement scale, over time.
The estimated means and standard deviations of scale scores for both English and Hausa literacy
are presented in Table 21. The results show that girls’ performances were higher on average than
boys’ in both English and Hausa literacy in formal primary schools at end-line. However, in IQSs,
boys performed better than girls in both English and Hausa literacy assessments at end-line.
Figure 19 shows trends in English and Hausa literacy scale scores of pupils in GEP3 schools at
baseline, and end-line. The results indicate a significant improvement in both English and
Hausa literacy of pupils in GEP3 schools at the end of GEP3 intervention.

49. Findings from the scaled Rasch scores reveal varied literacy scales across states and by language
tests (English and Hausa). As shown in Figure 20, literacy scales in English and Hausa languages
were highest in Katsina and Zamfara states while Niger and Sokoto states had the lowest rates
in English literacy. Niger state scored the lowest Hausa literacy as well which could be related to
the already mentioned level of non-Hausa school speaker’s population (Nupe with <14 per cent).

50. The assessment of gender differences in English and Hausa literacy scores in Figures 21 and 22
shows the results of gender differentials in the distributions of literacy scores in the two
languages by intervention states. The results in Figure 21 show that while the disaggregation of
English literacy scores by gender show even levels in Bauchi and Zamfara states, English literacy
scores are higher for girls than boys in both Katsina and Niger by about 10 points, and by about
a 5-point difference in Sokoto. On average, boys in Kano state have a higher score than girls
with an approximate 4-point difference.

51. Findings show that learning outcome scores in Hausa literacy are higher for girls than boys in
three (Niger, Katsina and Sokoto) of the six states. This difference is minimal in Sokoto and
Katsina, but much higher in Niger with a difference of roughly 19 points. On average, boys in
Kano and Bauchi states have a higher score on than girls on the Hausa language scale (7 and
10 points difference), while no marked difference in the performance of boys and girls in the
Hausa literacy scores is observed in Zamfara (see Figure 22).
Figure 22: Hausa literacy scores at end-line by state and gender
However, most of the gender differentials in learning outcome scores were not of significance, as
can be seen in Tables 22 and 23.
52. Independent T-test analysis shows that pupils who benefitted from GEP3-RANA programme
scored significantly higher in English literacy than their counterparts in the control group
(p<0.01). Likewise, pupils in IQS were more literate in the English language than in primary
schools, and this is significant at a level of 1 per cent. More females than males are more
literate in English in public primary schools, though not statistically significant. However, males
were found to be more literate than females in IQSs and this difference is significant at a level
of 0.05 per cent. An explanation among others of these differences in English literacy between
boys and girls in public and IQSs could be the more traditional gender-related social roles in
IQSs. Nevertheless, the difference between male and female English literacy scores was not

53. Pupils in GEP3 schools outperformed their peers in non-GEP3 schools at a 1 per cent
significant level. As observed for English literacy, pupils in IQSs were also significantly more
literate in Hausa language versus pupils in public primary schools (p<0.01) (see Table 23). The
findings at the end-line evaluation indicate no significant difference between genders, both in
general and within school types. Overall, pupils in IQSs performed better than those in public
primary schools. This may also be attributed to them being relatively older than the pupils from
public primary schools.

8.3.5. Results of English and Hausa literacy by proficiency category
54. The proficiency bands or levels of the pupils were generated based on the scale score for both
English and Hausa literacy. At baseline, proficiency bands for English assessment were developed
in November 2015 in a benchmarking workshop. The cut-off scores for Hausa proficiency bands
were drawn to reflect the proficiency bands used for English assessment. This indicates that, for
both English and Hausa literacy, similar skills are expected to fall within each proficiency band.
The descriptions of the range of knowledge and skills expected by pupils achieving each
proficiency band are illustrated in Annex 10.
Figure 23 shows the trend in the percentage of pupils by performance in each English
proficiency band at baseline, midline and end-line. Results show a 29 percentage point decrease
in the pre-literacy band for the English language proficiency between the baseline and end-line.
There appears to be no marked difference in the trend of emerging literacy in English language
proficiency level between the three rounds of evaluation. However, in line with GEP3-RANA
programmes objective, the percentage of pupils achieving basic English literacy increased
from about 10 per cent at baseline to about 40 per cent at the end of GEP3 programme.
This indicates about a 30 percentage point increase in basic English literacy rates between
baseline and end-line.

The percentage distribution of pupils for the pre-literacy level in Hausa proficiency dropped by about
8 percentage points from the baseline to the end-line, while the basic literacy rate in Hausa
language literacy increased from 2 percent from the baseline to 4 percent for both midline and
end-line (Figure 24). These results show some marginal improvement in Hausa basic literacy at
the end of GEP3 interventions.

55. Assessment of English literacy proficiency in GEP3 intervention schools (treatment group) by state
(see Figure 25) showed that the proportion of children achieving basic literacy proficiency in
English was the highest for Katsina, followed by Niger, Zamfara, Bauchi, Kano and Sokoto in that
order. Figure 26 shows that no pupil achieved basic literacy in Hausa proficiency in Kano and
Niger states by end-line and a negligible proportion of pupils had Hausa basic proficiency in the
remaining states, except in Zamfara where about 6.8 per cent of the pupils displayed Hausa
basic literacy.

The English and Hausa proficiency bands (pre-literacy, emerging literacy, and basic literacy) were
compared by the gender of each pupil using the Rasch scale scores. The proportion of girls
attaining basic English literacy proficiency at end-line was slightly higher (30 per cent) than the boys
(28.8 per cent). Likewise, slightly more girls (1.4 per cent) than boys (1.0 per cent) achieved basic
literacy in the Hausa language at end-line. These findings were not significant.

8.3.6. Numeracy assessment
56. The estimated means and proficiency bands of numeracy scale scores are presented in this
section. Figure 27 shows that pupils in Katsina state (537.8) had the higher mean scores in
numeracy tests which are followed by the performance of pupils in Kano (531.9) and Bauchi
(510.5) states. Niger state had the lowest performance with a mean scale score of 453.2.
The results of numeracy tests by gender within each of the states are presented in Figures 28
and 29. It is observed that girls’ performance slightly outweighs numeracy scale scores of boys’ in
Katsina, Niger and Sokoto states at end-line while the results from the remaining states reveal the
opposite. However, when the school types are compared, the performances of girls in numeracy
tests are somewhat higher than their male counterparts in both IQSs and formal primary schools
(see Figure 29).Gender are also observed for the proportion of pupils achieving pre-numeracy and
emerging numeracy.

The percentage distribution of pupils by their proficiency bands by the state is presented in Figure
30. The distribution shows that between 27 per cent and 42 per cent of pupils in all the states,
except Niger, achieved basic numeracy at end-line. Katsina (43.3 per cent) has the higher number of
pupils with basic numeracy, followed by Kano (36.9 per cent) and Bauchi (29.8 per cent). Niger has
the lowest number of pupils achieving basic numeracy with 11.9 per cent.
Considering gender differences in achieved numeracy scales, the finding in Figure 31 indicates an
approximate equal number of boys and girls achieving basic numeracy at end-line. Similar patterns
by gender are also observed for the proportion of pupils achieving pre-numeracy and emerging
numeracy.
However, there is an enormous gap between the proportion of pupils achieving basic numeracy in
IQSs and formal primary schools. The findings in Figure 32 indicate that more pupils attending IQSs
achieved basic numeracy (41.9 per cent) than their counterparts attending formal primary schools
(27.9 per cent). Likewise, fewer pupils in IQSs (5.2 per cent) fell within the pre-numeracy level than
those in primary schools (9.9 per cent).

57. A significance test using independent T-test statistics shows that pupils in GEP3 supported
IQSs score significantly higher in numeracy tests than their counterparts in the control
group (p<0.01) (see Table 24). The performances of both boys and girls were approximately equal
in general and when examined separately by school type (IQS and formal primary schools).
Though the overall performance in numeracy tests is higher in GEP3-supported schools than in
the control schools, this difference is not statistically significant.
The estimated means and standard deviations of scale scores for numeracy in IQSs at baseline
and end-line are presented in Table 25. The results indicate that while boys’ performances in
numeracy tests outweigh the girls’ at baseline, girls overtook boys at end-line in the numeracy
test performances.

8.3.7. Association between pupils’ household wealth index and their
performance in numeracy and literacy tests
58. The socioeconomic dimension of learning outcomes of pupils who benefitted from GEP3
interventions is presented in Figure 33. The findings show that pupils from poorer households
performed better in both numeracy and literacy (English and Hausa) than those from richer
homes. Similar patterns were observed when examined by school type (see Tables 26 and 27).
However, the differences were marginal.
It could be suggested that the reduction in the contribution of children, especially girls, from poor
households to income generation for the family (many of them stopped hawking) was likely
counterbalanced by CTP and the sensitisation it came with. CTP facilitated the improvement of
access for poor children and a more conducive learning atmosphere, due to the combination of
interventions (teachers’ training, CTP, local advocacy and visible local authorities’ support).
Moreover, selective targeting of the poor for these multiple interventions contributed to closing
this gap.

The availability and capacity of teachers were assessed via the head teacher survey, classroom
observations and qualitative interviews. The findings on the output 3 indicators on basic literacy
and numeracy of the pupils are displayed in the previous section.
On average, for the classroom observation, each class comprised of 47 pupils (24 boys and 23
girls). In the head teacher survey, there was a mean of about 10 teachers per school on average.
However, this varied across the types of schools. Public primary schools had an average of 10
teachers whereas the IQSs had a slightly higher number of teachers per school with a mean of
13. In terms of the proportion of male to female teachers, IQSs had an average of seven female
teachers compared to four in public schools. The end-line recorded the highest population of
teachers per school with an average of 10 compared to the baseline and midline averages of 7
and 8 respectively.
There was no significant change in the teachers’ population across the public primary schools from
baseline, however, there was a significant increase in the number of teachers of IQSs from a
baseline average of six teachers per school to 13 at end-line (P = 0.016). Figure 34 displays the
mean teacher population by school type from baseline to end-line.

The treatment schools had an average of 11 teachers compared to the control schools which had
an average of five teachers, demonstrating a reduced teacher-to-pupil population in the treatment
schools.
Teachers’ classroom observations
Teachers’ classroom practices were observed. Figure 36 indicates the proportion of teachers that
provided learning activities to capture the attention of pupils during a class session. The
indicator was captured in three observations at intervals of five minutes from the start of a lesson.
The graph depicts a reducing trend in the learning activities as the lesson continued. The majority
(90 per cent) of the teachers provided learning activities within the first five minutes of the lesson
while 77 per cent provided learning activities beyond 15 minutes of the lesson.

61. In terms of learning resources used by teachers, at end-line, teachers’ textbooks were used
more (26.7 per cent) compared to baseline (9.5 per cent) and midline (2.2 per cent). There was
a considerable decline in the proportion of classes that used tools and objects from the local
environment at end-line (0.8 per cent) compared to 15.1 per cent at midline. The use of posters,
charts and pictures also increased from 6.5 per cent to 7.9 per cent. This could be attributed to
increased rate of material support use, whether it is planning and management of material (such
as the lesson plan) or didactical elements (such as posters, charts, or pictures), to the improved
skills acquired through the training component of the project. Better-trained teachers are indeed
more aware of the need to anticipate and plan the lessons, and keener and more comfortable
with the use of graphical support and didactical materials in general70. Details of the learning
resources used in the surveyed schools are in Figure 37.

62. The teachers’ actions while giving lessons were observed and rated with a score of 1 (low) to
5 (high). The average scores for all classrooms observed are presented in Figure 38. The
teachers’ explanation of content was rated highest across all the schools observed with an
average of 3.68 (70 per cent) followed by the statement that teachers treat all pupils respectfully
with an average of 3.52 (70 per cent). The indicators – that teachers explicitly articulate the
objectives of the lesson, and the teacher redirects misbehaviour and focuses on the expected
behaviour – scored an equal average of 3.44 (69 per cent). The lowest score was of teachers
monitoring pupils during group work with an average score of 3.26 (63 per cent).

The behaviour and actions of pupils during the lesson were also observed. The action of girls
or boys asking open-ended questions was rated low with scores of 2.65 (52 per cent) and 1.87
(37 per cent) respectively. This score indicates the need for more interventions to ensure the
classroom environment is friendly and open for pupils to ask questions. Analysis by gender of the
teacher indicated no significant differences between the scores on pupil’s actions.
63. Efforts made by the programme to increase the number of teachers in schools were
highlighted by stakeholders in the interviews. HiLWA was seen to have been successful in
lobbying for teaching positions to be given to young women in the communities. The teacher
scholarship programme was perceived to have contributed to teacher capacity building,
especially due to all the incentives attached to the scheme. The teachers’ scholarship scheme
that was given to encourage girls to go to school was mentioned by several government
stakeholders as an important change via GEP3. This initiative was put in place to ensure that
the young women would be employed as teachers upon completion of their education – and
that they were well trained and dedicated and received enough technical support while in school
to be able to deliver quality teaching.
64. There was clear evidence of numerous varied and relevant capacity-building activities,
mentioned frequently and appreciated by the stakeholders in the key informant interviews,
head teacher survey and FGDs of teachers. These included methodological training for teachers,
management training for head teachers, administrative staff and education managers. Changes in
pedagogical practices were perceived and observed broadly, from the way classes were handled,
the topics presented to the pupils, to the appearance of the classroom, with aesthetics being
taken into consideration to enhance motivation and learning. Teaching methodology improvements
were reported with a perceived improvement in learning outcomes. The teachers were reported
by several national and state government stakeholders to have improved in terms of good quality
education delivery.

“Their quality of teaching is improved and then they were also taught to improvise teaching
aids to suit the environment or community where they find themselves. They were taught
to facilitate as opposed to teaching so that they make the children think for themselves…”
Federal Government Stakeholder
The findings from the qualitative interviews differed somewhat from those of the quantitative
surveys and classroom observations regarding teaching quality. However, the improvement in learning
outcomes was a point of agreement. Nevertheless, while some stakeholders in the KII and FGDs
perceived an improved quality of teaching in GEP3 schools, several government stakeholders
highlighted gaps in the teaching quality and problems linked to the training of teachers.
Sub-par teaching quality and poor quality of teachers sent for training were underscored in
the KIIs. Even though the capacity building and improvement of teacher capacity were noted as a
strength of the programme, some stakeholders did not consider the teaching quality as good as it
should be. This was confirmed by the classroom observations carried out in this evaluation. Key
informants attributed this sub-par quality to inadequate teaching aids or poor comprehension of the
teaching material by teachers – and indicated a need to train people with the appropriate
capabilities.
Several elements were perceived by UNICEF, government stakeholders and other key informants as
contributions of GEP3 to the programme around governance and capacity of teachers.
“So, you are lacking in the basic teaching aids that will aid you to exhibit the knowledge you
have which would affect changes in the children at the end of the day, increase the
awareness in terms of the subject matter and in terms of the quality of teaching you are
delivering to them. At the end of the day, the support and the resources are not available to
you. You are bound to use what you have on the ground which I think is not the best
practice.” State government stakeholder, Niger
“For the teachers’ training, the LGEA level had to be honest and sincere because some of
the people they are sending are not comprehending what the resource persons are taking
them through, because of their low level of understanding. They need to send somebody
who is capable so that they can get what the trainers are giving them. I think the successes
are many but those are the few weaknesses if it was being addressed, I think we can forge
ahead.”
State government stakeholder, Bauchi
8.3.9. The effects of governance in schools through monitoring and
management structures
65. Eighty-five per cent of schools with SBMCs indicated the SBMCs were supportive of the
implementation of GEP3 in their schools. The type of support SBMCs provided to the schools
at the end-line included sensitisation of GEP3 to the community as mentioned by 71 per cent of
schools, followed by classroom renovation 41 per cent, provision of money on regular basis for
school maintenance 38 per cent and provision of teaching/learning aid 24 per cent.
The indicators evaluated to establish the change in the external monitoring included head teacher
attendance of management training, frequency of visits by government officials (FME and SMoE)
and UNICEF, frequency of meetings with the LGAs and the existence of functional SBMCs in
schools. As shown in Figure 39, 77 per cent of the schools held meetings with the LGAs while
75 per cent received visits by GEP officials (a baseline of 80 per cent of schools received a
monitoring visit). Further, 60 per cent of head teachers surveyed had attended management
training and 92 per cent of the schools had functional SBMCs in place.

The training of teachers has been useful in the overall running and management of schools as
indicated by 90 per cent of the teachers surveyed. This indicates the training was resourceful
towards improving the head teachers’ management skills. There was also no statistical significance
between the benefits of the head teacher training in IQSs and public primary schools surveyed.
85 per cent of the schools with SBMCs indicated the SBMCs were supportive of the
implementation of GEP3 in their schools.
66. The findings in the head teacher survey on the SBMCs were also supported by the
household survey findings. In gauging the effectiveness of SBMCs/CBMCs in the HHs, Figure
40 shows that nearly all households that benefitted from CTP reported that children’s schooling
has focused/functional SBMCs/CBMCs compared to almost half of the households in the control
group. Likewise, about 85.1 percent of the CTP beneficiary households compared to 20.3 percent
in the control group reported that GEP3 made SBMCs/CBMCs more focused/functional.
Significantly more CTP beneficiary households (63.3 per cent) than those in the control group (6.2
per cent) reported having been influenced by GEP3 programme to join SBMC/CBMC.

67. GEP3 worked with monitoring and evaluation (M&E) teams at the state levels including the
department of planning and SUBEB and the capacities of the M&E teams were reported by
stakeholders to have been improved in terms of collection of data and management. The SUBEB
especially was considered by the key informants as quite cooperative and equipped, and to have
provided strong support to the implementation and monitoring of GEP3 programme. The
cooperation between the states (i.e., SUBEB) and local government levels was considered vital to
the success of activities on the ground. The state-level stakeholders in several states were
considered to have the necessary resources to carry out their work.
Monitoring structures put in place at the community levels were reported as useful. Training of
the SBMCs was perceived as instrumental in influencing the availability of teachers in the
schools because of the key monitoring roles they played. The social accountability element
(related to the availability of teachers in schools at the appropriate times) due to the monitoring
carried out by SBMCs was highlighted several times in the interviews. The SBMCs also followed
up with parents at the community level to ensure that their daughters are allowed to go to and
stay in school.
UNICEF staff indicated that monitoring and evaluation were embedded in the programme
design cycle. They also reported that with each implementation of the mapping and listing tool,
they reflected on the research process and used what they learned to improve both the
programming for girls and the quality of data collected. They also responded well to changes in
context.
However, an important unintended negative effect of GEP3 programme seen in this evaluation is
the increased pupil-to-teacher ratio. Though this has been highlighted in several other evaluations,
(UNICEF Girls’ Education Portfolio (2009–2015) and UNICEF Nigeria GEP-CTP Evaluation 2017) and
the information has not been appropriately used to address the discrepancy between investments
made in improving enrolment and retention of girls in schools and those made in improving the
QE 2. What are the factors (internal and external to UNICEF) that contributed to the
attainment of GEP3 programme and results the most?
QE 3. What are the factors (internal and external to UNICEF) that hindered the attainment of
GEP3, including CTP, programme and results the most?
Other questions: Has GEP3 generated significant positive or negative, intended or
unintended, higher-level effects at a community and state level?
68. Like the quantitative evidence, qualitative results showed that GEP3 displayed a high level of
effectiveness in enrolment and retention of girls in school and was also effective in
achieving the completion of girls’ education in all the states. This was noted in the face of
the challenges presented by the rampant insecurity in the states and the COVID-19 pandemic.
There were noted losses of some of the gains made by the programme (which will be seen
more clearly in subsequent sections), but the level of success attained due to the programme’s
interventions appeared to have muted these to some extent and there was strong quantitative
and qualitative evidence of effectiveness.
8.3.10. Drivers of change
69. Different factors (internal and external to UNICEF) led or contributed to the attainment of GEP3
achievements. Community ownership and involvement were perceived by stakeholders as key
drivers of change. The communities were perceived as the most important stakeholders in the
dynamic, and their acceptance of the interventions was critical for the programme’s success.
However, going beyond that, the communities’ active roles in taking ownership of the problems
and their solutions were considered the main pathway to actual and sustainable changes.

“The host community because the no matter how you work, without those at the
community level you can't get the results.” SMoE stakeholder, Bauchi
“You see, before you cannot get an Imam of a town giving his land for his LGEA to construct
a class or a school, but that has started happening now. You see this is a very important
improvement, not only the Imam, but the community are also gathering to give their
financial support, inviting us to open schools for them.” LGEA stakeholder, Kano
The SBMCs were mentioned most frequently as key drivers of change – their roles were
noted as critical. They sensitised and mobilised the communities, enlightening parents on the
need to allow their children who are at home to go to school; and carried out other advocacy
activities. These enabled them to achieve the desired results – increasing the enrolment and
retention of girls in schools and the reduction of early marriages for girls in the communities.
In some states, the MAs were mentioned frequently as drivers of change. The change in
enrolment in Kano was attributed to a considerable extent to the use of the MAs.
“They have succeeded a lot. Before the coming of GEP3 you see a lot of our girls roaming
about in the towns, hawking mangoes, fura de nunu, but because of the influence of this
Mothers’ Association the number has been reduced immensely. They go house to house to
influence the mothers to accept sending their girls to school and they have made a lot of
impact. They have contributed with the uniforms, books bags and so many things….” LGEA
stakeholder, Kano
The role of traditional and religious leaders was also reported frequently as important for
enabling the required changes in mindset and cooperation needed at the community levels.
Additionally, the HiLWA which were identified as community “champions” comprising women who
had benefitted from basic education without compromising cultural and religious ideals, served as
influencers to encourage parents to allow access to basic education for female children. Their
influence as change drivers in terms of the cash transfer component did not emerge so clearly
from the different qualitative data as did their crucial role as sensitisers and facilitators of
enrolment and retention of girls in school.
The government, especially the Ministry of Education (federal and state) stakeholders were also
mentioned as critical for the achievement of the results. The improved capacities of the
government, GEP3 stakeholders and the government’s commitment from the national level
enabled the commitment at the state level. This political commitment eventually influenced
budgetary allocation – were the pathways by which the government drove change.
Advocacy backed by government policy and commitment – in this regard, the cash transfer
programme was highlighted as an example Also, the government was reported as learning from
GEP3-CTP programme and using those lessons to implement its programme.
“They took the lesson learned from GEP3 to shape and fashion the design of the national
programme. Those are some of the things that can really drive change…” UNICEF
stakeholder
“When it came, people in the community are saying that they will teach children bad
things..” LGEA stakeholder, Katsina

8.3.11. Hindrances to achieving the desired change
70. Several factors were highlighted in the qualitative interviews and discussions as hindering the attainment of
the desired programme results. These included:
Strong-rooted stereotypes – sometimes due to cultural and religious factors or inflexibility of some
people were reported as barriers that still had to be overcome. Some people were considered (by both
national and state government stakeholders) as set in their ways (dogmatism) and unwilling to change or
“rock the boat” – these presented limitations in the acceptability and uptake of interventions.
Limited funding was mentioned in several ways – a funding gap that limits the scale at which the
programme can be implemented; limited funding at local levels – the example was given in one of the states
of lack of transportation for many of the teachers who were nominated for training but could not transfer
themselves to the venue; budgetary limitations at state level – with some states not matching funding
due to lack of political will or prioritisation of education. This means that work done such as the CTP for
which the desire was for the government to design similar programmes and take them to scale has not been
accomplished.
Geographical barriers presented by hard-to-reach areas were also considered as an impediment to the
programme. Places with difficult-to-access terrains prevented mentors and master trainers from getting to the
schools and other community locations to do their work.
Lack of interest and illiteracy of parents were considered important barriers. The most frequently
mentioned issue was the perception of some parents that girls were needed more for chores or work at
home, mostly hawking and farming. Some mothers that were willing to allow their girls to go to school would
keep them at home during the harvest season to help on the farm, after which they would be allowed to go
back to school.
Lack of interest of the parents in the school activities or the progress of the children in school was mentioned
frequently in the discussions as making change difficult. This meant that when the children did not go to
school, the parents would not know and assumed that the children were in school. This was especially
important when the child did not have the interest to be in school as was the case with some children.
“Some of the parents will tell their children that house chores are more important than school
work, so they have to stay at home and do the work before they come to school.” FGD G4G,
Zamfara
“Some of the girls when they say they will enrol them they will say that they want to hawk.
They will say that they are being bullied and lack of interest in school. Some of the girls hide
when they see that schools close that is when they will come.” He for She FGD, Zamfara
71. Nevertheless, the FGD participants mostly referred to these incidences as what occurred more before GEP3
and noted that understanding of the value of girls’ education had caused a shift in the priorities.
Logistical difficulties were also reported as hindrances to change. These included financial issues such as
money for PTA dues (though some perceived this as more relevant for secondary schools) and girls’
menstrual periods which were compounded by a lack of sanitation facilities for girls in some schools
(these were also highlighted as a hindrance in the teachers and the boys FGDs).
Sexual harassment of girls on the way to school – distance from schools was mentioned as a hindrance
more in the context related to the need to ensure that girls were not harassed by boys on their way to
school – in this regard, FGD participants noted that girls were encouraged to walk in groups to and from
school. The implication of this was not mentioned, but it is possible that when such a group was not feasible,
parents may be reluctant to send their girls to school. This harassment of girls on their way to school by
men/boys was noted as an important deterrent.

“Yes, some of the men stop s when they are on their way to school, they try to stop them
and so this has affected the level of attendance.“ FGD G4G, Zamfara
”Sometimes they write our names on our school bags and all these men that for a very long
time have been trying to find our names are able to know our names and then you are just
walking on the streets, and they call you by your name and so that has affected the
attendance in school.” FGD G4G, Zamfara
Inactive SBMC at some community levels – there is a variation of capacities of the SBMC in
different communities. Some have active and others inactive School-Based Management
Committees. The crucial roles played by the SBMCs meant that inactive ones produced a
significant gap in the achievement of results.
Inadequate government support was considered an impediment. It meant that teachers that
needed help or technical support did not receive the support needed. Also, efforts made in
enrolling the children were sometimes not sustained, because the children were not retained in
schools due to inadequate support for teachers.
Interestingly, insecurity was not mentioned as often as many other hindrances. This could be
because of the conditioned acceptance of the insecurity situation which had prevailed over a long
period. Nevertheless, in the FGDs it was highlighted that after parents had been convinced by
sensitisation and awareness creating activities to send their children to school. The gains made in
enrolment were not always sustained because of insecurity concerns. Overall, long-lasting
insecurity issues had an implicit influence on outcomes in Niger state, a factor that should be
considered in future interventions or follow-up efforts. In the same sense, the strengthening of
local public governance in states such as Sokoto and Bauchi should be considered as a platform
for scaling up.
Corporal punishment in schools was also perceived as discouraging for parents. Similarly,
bullying was also mentioned in the FGD of teachers as one of the things that made change
difficult.
“There are people that when they come to school and when they get flogged or they get
punished for doing something that is wrong and they go and tell their parents, their parents,
take them out of school and just allow them to be hawking on the streets.” FGD G4G,
Zamfara.
8.4. Impact of GEP3 2012–2022
Overall finding: There was a high Impact of GEP3 2012–2022 on pupils’ learning outcomes in six
states.
Overall finding: There was a high impact of the unconditional cash transfer on households’ livelihoods,
girls’ enrolment, and learning outcomes with unintended benefits to boys in Niger and Sokoto states.
Quality of the evidence: Strong
The DAC criterium of impact is defined as, “the extent to which the intervention has generated or is
expected to generate significant positive or negative, intended or unintended, higher-level effects.” In
essence, what difference did the intervention make?

..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
The overall conclusions of the independent evaluation team on the impact of GEP3 are
summarised below:
Preliminary conclusions of impact of GEP3
IMP 1: The impact of CTP on girls’ enrolment in primary schools was strongly positive and
statistically significant (p<0.01). Overall, the estimated difference (DID) in the reported number of
children enrolled in primary 1 to 3 at end-line indicated that households that benefitted from
GEP3-CTP enrolled more girls in primary 1–3 than households that did not benefit from the CTP
(0.921 compared with 0.766). (Para 74-77)
IMP 2: The impact of CTP on household spending on girls’ schooling was strongly positive and
statistically significant (p<0.05). The termly household expenditure on female child education was
at least 500 Naira higher in households that received cash transfers compared to control
households. Also, CTP households spent more on girls’ than boys’ education (about 733 Naira per
term). When disaggregated by state, the difference was more in Niger (746 Naira) than Sokoto
state (718 Naira) in favour of girls’ education expenditure. (Para 78)
IMP 3: The results of impact analysis using the DID regression modelling approach revealed that
GEP3-RANA had a positive impact on English and Hausa literacy learning outcomes at both
midline and end-line. There was an increase in the number of pupils that achieved basic English
literacy by 6.3 per cent and 4.7 per cent percentage points at midline and end-line respectively.
The slight decline in the programme impact between midline and end-line was likely due to
disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and insecurity in the region. (Para 79)
IMP 4: While stronger positive impact related to the achievement of English literacy was recorded
for boys (a 7.9 per cent percentage point) than girls at midline (a 4.3 per cent percentage point),
the degree of positive impact for girls (a 7.9 per cent percentage point) overtook the boys’ at
endline (a 1.2 per cent percentage point). This was also due to the significant drop in programme
impact for boys. The drop in impact for boys is an undesirable effect that requires proper
examination. A possible reason could be that, in addition to the disruption caused by the COVID-
19 lockdown and insecurity, the focus on girls may have led to issues regarding boys to be
missed. (Para 79-80 and 83)
IMP 5: Overall and in each of GEP3-CTP states (Niger and Sokoto), the proportion of pupils
achieving basic literacy was higher in GEP-CTP communities than non GEP3-CTP communities.
Furthermore, female pupils from GEP3-CTP communities achieved higher basic English literacy
scores compared to those from non-GEP3-CTP communities. At state level, this achievement was
more evident in Niger state. (Para 81 and 82)
IMP 6: National population surveys showed improvement in the trend in literacy rate among
young women aged 15–24 years; reduction in early marriages, adolescent pregnancies and
childbearing in the focal states. (Para 72 and 73)
IMP 7: An unintended negative effect of GEP3 was the (persisting) increase in pupil-teacher ratio
due to the massive increase in enrolment without a corresponding increase in teacher population.
This has an important implication for quality of education and has been highlighted in other
evaluations. (Para 87)
QI 1. To what extent has GEP3 achieved the expected results related to impact defined in the
business plan?

8.4.1. Long-term effects and impact of GEP3 as defined within GEP3
logframe/results framework
This section examines the expected long-term effects and impact of GEP3 as defined within the
Logframe/results framework of the impact indicators. The indicators addressed in this section include
the literacy rate of young women (15–24 years), the rate of early marriage (under 19) in target
states and the rate of early childbearing (had a live birth before the age of 15). Secondary data
and reports were reviewed and analysed including those from the Education Census (i.e., annual
school census), the available national and state EMIS Report (MICS 2011, 2016, 2021) and NDHS
(2013, 2018) as applicable.
72. Analysis of secondary data from the 2011 and 2021 MICS, presented in figures 34–36, showed clear
evidence of an increase in the literacy rate of young women, reduction in adolescent pregnancies and
childbearing in most focus states. MICS 2021 did not include data on literacy rate for young women 15-24
years at state level; only at the level of geopolitical zones.
Figure 41 provides an assessment of the literacy rate of women aged 15–24 years in two successive MICS
surveys (MICS 2011 and 2016) by GEP3 intervention states. Available results show an improvement in the
trend in literacy rate among young women aged 15–24 years between 2011 and 2016 in all the states,
except Sokoto. The improvement in enrolment was more pronounced in Zamfara and Bauchi states where
the literacy rate nearly doubled within the first five years of GEP3 interventions.

73. In Figure 42, results on the rate of early marriage (under 19) in the target states show that
early marriage rates decreased between the 2011 and 2021 surveys in all GEP3 target states by
at least 23 percent per state (Bauchi, Kano, Katsina Sokoto and Zamfara) as evidenced in the
2011, 2016 and 2021 MICS reports. The decrease in early marriage rates between 2011 and 2021
was up to 35 per cent in Sokoto and Zamfara.
Findings from three successive surveys of MICS in 2011, 2016 and 2021 show that early
childbearing before the age of 15 pointedly decreased in all the six target states. Between 2011
and 2021, Zamfara recorded close to 12 percentage points difference in early marriage rates
followed by about 6 per cent difference recorded in Sokoto. The lowest percentage difference in
early childbearing rates between 2011 and 2021 was observed in Bauchi state (about 0.6 per
cent decrease) and Niger state (about 2.5 per cent decrease). However, it should be noted that
both Bauchi and Niger had the lowest early childbearing rates (3.0 per cent and 2.7 per cent
respectively) at baseline in 2011. However, the MICS data does not allow a treatment-control
comparison of programme impact within GEP3 target states.

In the qualitative interviews, key roles played by the SBMCs and the MAs in supporting awareness
creation were reported frequently by stakeholders. Both organisations were focused on changing the
attitudes of the female caregivers/mothers towards the education of female children by talking to mothers
in households to see the need for children to be in school and tracking the progress of the children to ensure
that they were enrolled and retained in schools.
Changes in early marriages practices were also frequently reported by the community and government
stakeholders. They were of the view that GEP3 sensitisation activities had enabled the mothers and fathers
to gain an understanding of the disadvantages of early marriages versus the advantages of education for
female children. The mentoring programme for girls also revealed disadvantages of marrying early and
advantages of education to the girls themselves.
The influence of G4G activities in enabling a change in mindset of the girls towards early marriages was
highlighted several times in the FGDs. It was reported that this enabled the girls to put up some resistance
when there was a move to marry them off early.
The role played by the SBMCs was noted as critical in reducing early marriages for girls. The SBMC and CBMC
members also highlighted in their FGDs that in addition to the sensitisation of the communities about the
importance of female children’s education, they played mediatory roles in families – convincing the men to
release their daughters to go back to school when they noticed absenteeism of girls from school that could
signal an imminent dropout.
“Nowadays children are very insistent that they would want to finish schooling before the go
into marriage, they don't agree to marry until they finish school.“ FGD SBMC and CBMC, Bauchi
“Before, sometimes you will see a girl in school and before you know it, you will stop seeing her
and the reason will be that she was married away and would have to drop out of school. But
with the introduction of this programme and the measures carried out by us the SBMC's, now
you will see that child when enrolled, they will remain until they graduate from school.
Dropouts have reduced drastically though we can't say it's total.” FGD SBMC and CBMC, Bauchi
“We appoint the female in the SBMC’s to find out the reason why a female child had not been
coming to school should she be missing classes and if there are needs for us the males at the
SBMC's to intervene, maybe talk to the father of such child then we obliged and do so.” FGD
SBMC and CBMC, Bauchi

Nevertheless, in the different states, community men, women, girls and boys in the FGDs
indicated that, although these positive changes had occurred, there were still issues of early
marriages and dropouts. FGD respondents usually noted that there was still the practice of
early marriage going on usually in “other” localities.
“They do marry them out to someone at the age of 10 years old, but in other villages.” FGD He
for She, Zamfara
“For instance, not people in our community but people in other villages, we do hear them
marrying smaller children out, but now they are aware of it, they know the importance of school
and they have enrolled their children in school. FGD He for She, Zamfara
8.4.2. Overall programme impact of GEP3 on pupils and households in
line with the programme ToC and assumptions
In this section, the impact of GEP3 interventions were estimated including the CTP on pupils’,
especially girls’ enrolment. Estimating the programme learning outcomes and household spending
on education for girls and boys was an important component. Please note that CTP was
implemented only in Niger and Sokoto states. The OPM English and literacy assessments were
carried out at baseline and midline in Katsina and Zamfara states.
8.4.2.1. Programme impact of GEP3 – CTP interventions – Comparison of
net enrolment ratio (access) in primary education between
treatment group LGAs and control group using the HH survey
74. With respect to GEP3 output 1, it was assumed that improved financial access for poor
households through unconditional cash transfers would have a positive impact on girls’ enrolment.
At both baseline and end-line evaluation through household surveys, caregivers, who were mainly
female, were asked about their estimated average expenditure per term on girls' schooling at
baseline (before receiving CTP) and end-line (after receiving CTP). At school level, head teachers
were asked to provide the enrolment figures in the school per male and female children at
baseline and end-line of CTP intervention.
Evidence provided in Table 29 indicates that the impact of CTP on girls’ enrolment in primary
schools is strongly positive and statistically significant at the end of GEP3-CTP intervention.
This suggests that the cash transfers to female children through female caregivers led to a
significant increase in girls’ enrolment in schools between baseline and end-line of GEP3-CTP
intervention. As expected, the result of the DID estimate for boys shows that the CTP did not
have an impact on boys’ enrolment in schools.

75. Overall, the estimated difference in the reported number of children enrolled in P1-P3 at end-line
indicated that households that benefitted from GEP3-CTP enrolled more girls in P1-3 than
households that did not benefit from the CTP. At state level, CTP benefitting households in Niger
state also tend to enrol more children in primary school than the non-CTP benefitting households
in the state. However, the same cannot be said in Sokoto in terms of the CTP impact on
female children’s enrolment at end-line. The enrolment of children in P1-P3 was always lower than
those from non-CTP-benefitting households both in general and at state level (Table 30).

76. Using the household data collected from states where the CTP was implemented, the estimation of the net
enrolment ratio (NER) and the gross enrolment ratio (GER) for girls and boys at baseline and end-line are
presented in Tables 31 and 32. Unlike the regular NER and GER estimation, the estimation of these indicators
in this evaluation is “adjusted” since the age range covered in both baseline and end-line surveys are from
five to 11 rather than the official primary school age of between six and 11 years. Also, the focus of the
evaluations was not only on enrolment in primary schools but general enrolment in schools, regardless of the
level of education. In the case of GER, while the denominator included the total number of children between
five and 11 years in the households, the numerator comprised children between five and 11 who were
enrolled in school.
As shown in Table 31, the NER for girls of 100 per cent at end-line shows that all children between the age
of five and 11 years in the household were enrolled in school at end-line in Niger and Sokoto states, unlike at
baseline when some of them were not in school (NER<100). It is important to note that, while the estimated
value of NER for girls increased from baseline to end-line in CTP households, the estimated value of
NER decreased between baseline to end-line in non-CTP households displaying the importance of the
CTP in driving enrolment and retention of girls in schools even in the face of insecurity and other
setbacks like the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though the estimated NER for boys also increased from
baseline to end-line, there are still some boys in CTP households (about 5 per cent) who were not enrolled in
school at end-line, unlike their female counterparts.

77. The adjusted gross enrolment ratio (GER), as presented in Table 32, shows that all the estimated GER values
are above 100 per cent which could be an indicator of late or overage enrolment in schools. For both girls
and boys from CTP households, the GER values increased from baseline to end-line though the increase is
higher for girls than for boys.

78. Table 33 presents the result of the estimate of CTP impacts on household spending on male and female
children’s schooling. The impact of CTP on household spending on girls’ schooling was strongly
positive and statistically significant at the end of GEP3-CTP intervention. The termly household
expenditure on female children’s education was at least 500 Naira higher in households that received cash
transfers compared to control households. About 100 Naira more is also observed to be spent on boys’
education in CTP households than in control households, though this is not statistically significant. This
indicates that boys might have also marginally benefitted from the cash transfers to households though the
girls were the major beneficiaries as reflected in the household education financing of girls per term. When
reviewed in terms of household consumption patterns, boys in CTP households who reported three meals a
day benefitted along with girls and the whole household.

The assessment of the difference between average expenditure on girls’ and boys’ education by CTP
recipient households showed that households that received cash transfers spent more on girls’ than boys’
education (about 733 Naira per term) in both Niger and Sokoto states (Table 34). When disaggregated by
state, the difference was more in Niger state, by about 746 Naira, than Sokoto state (about 718 Naira) in
favour of girls’ education expenditure.

8.4.2.2. Programme impact of GEP3 – RANA and CTP interventions on
pupils’ English and Hausa literacy
79. As previously mentioned, Rasch’s modelling approach was used to generate English and Hausa
literacy at baseline, midline and end-line. As demonstrated in the effectiveness section, the
percentage of pupils achieving basic literacy increased from about 10 per cent at baseline to
about 32 per cent and 40 per cent at midline and end-line respectively. The basic literacy rate in
the Hausa language marginally increased from 2 percent from the baseline to 4 percent at both
midline and end-line. The results of impact analysis using the DID regression modelling
approach reveal that GEP3-RANA has a positive impact on English and Hausa literacy
learning outcomes at both midline and end-line. The use of impact in this context connotes
the ability of the programme to significantly provide basic literacy skills to more pupils compared
to the baseline figure. However, while we could identify the statistically significant effect at
midline for both English and Hausa literacy learning outcomes, the same could not be established
at end-line for both learning outcomes. More specifically, the impact analysis results in Table 35
show that there was an increase in the number of pupils with basic English literacy by 6.3
and 4.7 percentage points at midline and end-line respectively. This indicates a slight
decline in the programme impact between the two follow-up surveys. Similar results are
obtained for the programme impact on Hausa literacy where the estimated impact decreased
from a percentage point of 1.8 at midline to a percentage point of 0.2 at end-line. Generally, it
was observed that the programme had more impact on English than Hausa literacy.

When the impact results were disaggregated by state, GEP3-RANA programme had a positive
impact on English and Hausa learning outcomes at both midline and end-line in Katsina
state. The estimated impact of the programme on English literacy was statistically significant at 5
per cent at midline in the state. In Zamfara state, the impact of GEP3-RANA on both English
and Hausa learning outcomes were positive at baseline and negative at end-line, when
compared to baseline status (Table 36).

80. Further, since the focus of GEP3 is mainly on girls’ education, it is necessary to examine the
heterogeneous impacts of RANA on the gender of pupils achieving basic literacy at the end of
GEP3 intervention. Table 37 presents the differences by gender in the share of programme
impact on basic English literacy. The positive impacts of RANA were observed on the basic
English literacy attainment for both boys and girls at midline and end-line.
Interestingly, while stronger positive results were recorded for boys than girls at midline
and only significant for boys; the positive result for girls overtook that of boys at end-line,
only significant for girls. The positive effects achieved for boys in a programme supposedly
designed for girls are not unexpected since RANA interventions, to a large extent, covered all
pupils present in GEP3 schools regardless of gender. It was also observed that that the
programme impact on boys achieving basic English literacy dropped from a percentage
point of 7.9 to a percentage point of 1.2 between midline and end-line while that of girls
increased from a percentage point of 4.3 to a percentage point of 7.9 between midline and
end-line. The drop in impact for boys is an undesirable effect and requires proper examination.
There may be several reasons for this, namely that the focus on girls may have skewed
attention from boys and it is also possible that the insecurity in the region presented more
distraction to the boys than the girls; also given that more female teachers were trained and
deployed, it was not clear if there was a change in learning dynamics for the boys given that
some boys tend to respond better to male teachers. The shift to girls in relation to role
modelling reinforcements without a corresponding element for boys may have contributed to this
skewed pattern. However, it should be noted that there is no evidence to support these
assertions and relevant research in this area would help to shed more light on specific reasons.

81. When the programme impacts were disaggregated by state, it was found that the overall GEP3-RANA
programme impact on girls and boys achieving basic English literacy was somewhat similar to what was
observed in Katsina state. However, in Zamfara state, the programme impact on girls dropped from being
positive at midline to negative at end-line. Similarly, no gain was recorded in basic English literacy for boys in
the states as the programme impact remained negative at both midline and end-line when compared to
baseline (Table 38).
Table 39 shows a descriptive analysis comparing basic English literacy proficiency scores between pupils
from communities that benefitted from girls’ education cash transfers (treatment group) and those who
didn’t benefit from the cash transfers (Control Group). The findings indicate that overall and in each of
GEP3-CTP states (Niger and Sokoto), the proportion of pupils achieving basic literacy is higher in
GEP-CTP communities than in non-GEP3-CTP communities. When examined from a gender lens, the
findings further show that girls from GEP3-CTP communities achieved higher basic English literacy
scores than those from non-GEP3-CTP communities. At state level, this achievement was more
evident in Niger state as the difference between the girls’ English basic literacy scores between the
CTP and non-CTP group in Sokoto state were approximately the same.

82. Results of the differential impact of the RANA programme on basic Hausa literacy by gender are
presented in Table 40. Although not statistically significant, the findings show that RANA increased
the proportions of both male and female pupils achieving basic Hausa literacy at both midline and
end-line compared to baseline. However, a decline in impact is observed between midline and
end-line for both boys and girls in the basic Hausa literacy learning outcomes.
When the differential impacts were further disaggregated by the two GEP3-CTP states (Table 41),
similar result patterns are observed, except in Zamfara where the impact of the programme
became significantly negative for female pupils at end-line.

83. The reduction in the impact estimates recorded from midline to end-line in Tables 38 and 41
could be attributed to the incessant insecurities in all the focal states, especially in Katsina and
Zamfara, after the midline survey was completed in 2017. This was made worse by school
closures occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic which struck during the final year of GEP3
intervention in 2020. These findings are also not surprising since most pupils in primary 2
assessed at end-line enrolled into schools towards the end of the programme when insecurity
was at its peak in both states. This is coupled with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
schooling. It is also worth considering that different cohorts of pupils were assessed at midline
and end-line since many of the pupils at baseline and midline had completed basic education or
moved on to higher classes.
8.4.2.3. Programme impact of GEP3 – RANA and CTP interventions on
pupils’ numeracy
84. Overall, unlike male pupils, the proficiency scores obtained by girls in basic numeracy in GEP3
schools outweigh those of their female counterparts from non-GEP3 schools. When disaggregated
by states, similar result patterns are also recorded in Niger, Katsina and Kano states where girls
in GEP3 schools outperformed their peers in non-GEP3 schools in basic numeracy proficiencies
while the opposite is true in other remaining states. However, none of these relationships is
found to be statistically significant at a level of less than 5 per cent (Table 42).

85. Table 43 shows a descriptive analysis comparing basic numeracy proficiency scores between
pupils from communities that benefitted from GEP3-CTP (treatment group) and those who didn’t
benefit from cash transfers (control group). The findings indicate that there is a higher proportion
of female pupils from GEP3-CTP communities achieving higher basic numeracy scores than those
from non-GEP3-CTP communities. At state level, this achievement is also observed in Sokoto
state. However, in Niger state, the proportion of female pupils achieving basic numeracy in GEP-
CTP schools is lower by about 1 per cent when compared to their counterparts from non-GEP3-
CTP schools in the state.

QI 2. Has GEP3 generated significant positive or negative, intended or unintended,
higher-level effects at community and state level?
The programme generated numerous intended positive, including higher-level, effects many of
which were highlighted in previous sections and some of which will be highlighted in the
subsequent sections of the document. To avoid redundancy, this will not be repeated. Focus on
unintended positive or negative effects generated by the programme is crucial.
8.4.3. Unintended positive effects
86. The programme had an unintended positive effect of increasing resilience and capacity to respond
to setbacks in the community and education system. Flexible and innovative coping strategies
were used to deal with the challenges presented by the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic
– the development of radio educational programmes, parents’ teaching and community mentors
were a few of the strategies that helped to reduce the effect of the pandemic on pupils’
learning outcomes. These are described in more detail in subsequent sections.
8.4.4. Unintended negative effects
87. The preliminary nature of the CTP negatively impacted the families because the stipend
was stopped after two years while the children were still in school.
Then the negative side of it is being a pilot programme that lasted for two years. And Niger not
been able to sustain the programmes,
You know, it is really having a negative effect on those families that were halfway to through
the school and somehow dropped at the middle of the whole thing, a situation whereby you rely
solely on stipend, you know, to support the child to school and suddenly just stopped you see
to that extent it has consequences. Niger SMoE
Another unintended negative effect of GEP3 was the (persisting) increase in pupil-teacher
ratio due to the massive increase in enrolment without a corresponding increase in the
teacher population. The issues relating to the quality of education seen in the assessment of
the capacity of teachers in the previous section also derive from this mismatch which is a strain
on the system.

QI 3. What long-term transformative change or difference did the programmes have on
communities, institutions and children?
8.4.5. Long-term transformative changes or differences
88. The qualitative findings support the quantitative evidence that the sensitisation and the cash transfer
components of GEP3 influenced household decision-making positively and led to increased enrolment and
retention of girls in schools.
In general, qualitative feedback on the effectiveness of raising awareness of girls' schooling highlighted the
following benefits retained by the community:
An educated girl, when she marries, will know how to take care of her children and her home.
She can also transit to higher education and embrace professions such as those of a teacher, lawyer, doctor
and nurse. In the health sector this trend is seen as extremely beneficial to women, as it will allow women
to be examined by other female health professionals.
“Yes, now they are enrolled, because the mothers have now seen the importance, so now
when you go to the hospital, you will see girls treating women, before when they take
someone to the hospital, it is a man who will treat her.” CCW, Zamfara.
Once the participants were convinced, the last argument raised was the financial barrier,
including the loss of income when a girl can no longer participate in farming or hawking (selling
small wares) to help her mother. In this case, the cash transfer was recognised as making a
real difference when the final decision was made. In states where the CT component was not
part of the intervention, the distribution of uniforms, books and other school materials were
mentioned as having helped to address financial barriers.
89. By far, the most signi cant change due to the programme reported by the communities,
state and local government stakeholders in the various states, was increase in enrolment of
children, particularly girls, in schools. The FGDs of the different community level groups in all
the states, all displayed the consensus that enrolment of girls and their retention in schools had
improved because of GEP3 interventions and activities. The programme had tackled issues related
to enrolment, retention and completion using multi-faceted interventions many of which were
reported frequently by the different community, government, UNICEF, and other programme
stakeholders.
A key element was the enrolment campaigns that had been carried out through the
years.FGD participants credited the change of attitude of community members to the massive
sensitisation of the community members on the importance of education of female children.
They emphasised that carrying along all the relevant community level stakeholders and the
traditional, religious and community leaders, in the sensitisation efforts was key to the
transformational change in attitude. The different activities of GEP3 that were carried out by key
community-level groups such as G4G, He for She, the MAs, HiLWA, in addition to the crucial
roles played by the SBMCs and the CBMCs all generated a collective thrust. Stakeholders in the
interviews perceived that a substantial effort had been made towards enrolment even beyond
GEP3 intervention areas.
90. Intense sensitisation and awareness creation at the community levels led to a positive change
of attitude towards girls’ education among men, women and girls – the programme
succeeded to a considerable extent in encouraging men to support the education of female
children.

“We really have seen changes because our parents are also not happy to see us at home, so
we all now can read.” FGD G4G, Bauchi
“Each year, the enrolment campaign is flagged of by the state Executive Governor and all
the top Government functionary attending and stepped down to the local level. So, this
campaign is increasing awareness at both states and community levels about the
importance of girls' education, bringing on board all those that serves with the business of
education; the traditional rulers, the religious leaders, parents, mothers, associations,
everyone, about the importance of Girl-child Education, it’s a widespread sensitization.”
FGD HILWA, Sokoto
“There was tremendous, tremendous, tremendous input in terms of enrolment not only in
GEP3 focus LGAs in the entire state. This programme has really helped, there are people
that are sent to go into the community to sensitise parents, they tell them that girl education
is good they should enrol them (girls) in school.” SMoE Stakeholder, Niger
“Before we don’t have schooling materials but now, we have been given bags, book and
other things; because of that, girls are coming the more, this UNICEF has helped.” FGD in
Out of School Boys, Bauchi
The change of attitude of community members towards girls’ education was highlighted in the
FGDs of the girls who were participating in the G4G programme and credited to what they were
taught in the programme. They indicated how they were encouraged to stop hawking (selling) wares
on the streets and how this has increased enrolment in schools. Similarly, the HiLWA in their FGDs
indicated that the G4G programme focused on ensuring that girls developed a voice, gained
confidence, and interacted with other girls who could act as mentors to showcase the value of
education for girls. The aim was to change the mindset of s – to stimulate the desire in them for
education. This was considered by different stakeholders as having enabled a motivation in the girls
to complete their education.
Community men noted that the change of attitude was also occasioned by the economic value of
education seen in girls in the communities who had been allowed to go to schools. Examples
were given of how household decision-making on enrolling girls in school was influenced by
the wider community network.
Community members, including boys in the FGDs, highlighted that educated girls were now
perceived with more respect and admiration, further encouraging others to want to emulate
them. An interesting change in mindset mentioned in the discussions in Bauchi was the perception
that educated girls were more attractive to marry.
“In most cases, you find that all schools that have the G4G, they are giving this type of
training on self-confidence and self-esteem. Most times we take them to Abuja to meet
other girls and make them to sign an undertaking that they will complete their education
from primary to secondary schools in most cases. Aah so far so good, about 100 percent are
still going to school even when they don’t have any kobo on them. Then in that regards I
would say, ah we have succeeded.” FGD HiLWA, Katsina
“Nowadays when an educated girls come back into the community you will see the way she
is admired and she is look upon as if she is a white lady, like a celebrity, because of the level
of education she has.” FGD SBMC/CBMC, Bauchi
“There is when a girl is not educated, they don’t marry them, that is why there is
improvement.” FGD In and Out of schoolboys, Bauchi

..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
The overall conclusions of the independent evaluation team on the efficiency of GEP3 are
summarised below:
Preliminary conclusions of value for money of GEP3:
EFFI 1: The project demonstrated value for money through enrolling 120 per cent of the targeted
number of girls. Instead of a million girls, 1,283,024 girls were enrolled at a unit cost of £43 ($60) per
girl and £55 ($75) per girl retained in school when expenditure is considered. (Para 98)
EFFI 2: A total of £77,200,000 (87 per cent) of the budget was utilised in GEP3 by 2020. Using cost
saving and cost sharing approaches successfully, the annual expenditure was always less than the
annual budget. The highest expenditure was in 2018/9 with 92 per cent of the budget being spent.
(Para 98)
EFFI 3: The net present value (NPV) results for the early learning – (GEP3) intervention and the cash
transfer intervention are positive. This shows that GEP3 interventions offered good value for money.
(Para 100 and 101)
EFFI 4: The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for the early learning intervention is 10 per cent and for the
cash transfer 16 per cent. These are the annualised rates of return for both Interventions
respectively. Since both IRRs are above the real discount rate of 5 per cent, the two projects offer
value for money and should be accepted. (Para 100 and 101)
EFFI 5: The rate of enrolment and the wage rate were important factors in determining the cost
benefit of the project. For instance, a decrease of 10 per cent in the number of pupils enrolled saw a
sharp drop in the NPV value from £7.3 to £6 trillion while an increase of 20 per cent in enrolment
results in an increase in the NPV from £7 trillion to £11 trillion. Similarly, the wage rate also impacted
the NPV. (Para 101)
EFFI 6: Globally, a value assessment of GEP3 (2012–2020) and the Cash Transfer Programme
demonstrated value for money based on a cost benefit analysis. Also, the use of the project
framework demonstrated that the money was worth spending. This shows there is opportunity for
scale-up. (Para 91, 98-101)
EFFI 7: The high pupil-teacher ratio created classroom space, material, and human resources gaps,
and thereby challenging the efficiency of the system. (Para 97)
91. To understand the efficiency of the programme, there was an examination in which teaching and
learning take place with the head teacher and classroom observation surveys. Different materials
and human resources were assessed to determine how they were used and maintained. The VfM
analysis was also carried out to determine the cost-benefit ratio of implementing GEP3
programme in six northern Nigeria states over a period of eight years; to determine the cost-
benefit ratio of implementing the unconditional cash transfers; and to provide an indication of the
costs at which the eventual results were delivered. The assessment was carried out in two parts.
Firstly, a cost-benefit analysis of GEP3 from (2015– 2020) was carried out. This timeframe was
chosen because the project underwent a redesign in 2014 and the unconditional cash transfer
project in Niger and Sokoto states was implemented between 2014 and 2017. Secondly, using the
project framework, the unit cost for each additional girl enrolled into school and how much it
cost to improve the quality of education in an IQS were determined. The assessment compared
“without GEP3 scenario” against “GEP3 scenario” to determine the cost-benefit ratio of
implementing the project.
92. Overall, the programme displayed efficiency. However, there were some gaps especially related to
infrastructural maintenance and external monitoring. The burn rate of the project per year slowly
increased over the years to 129 per cent. However, the overall expenditure rate was 54 per cent.
This enabled the enrolment of 1,283,024 girls in school as opposed to a target of 1,000,000.
There was evidence that GEP3 offered good value for money.

QEFY 1. To what extent has GEP3 delivered results in an economic and timely way (How well
were resources used?)
8.5.1. School infrastructure, monitoring and management
93. To assess how well resources were used in the programme (Q1), the use, monitoring and
management of both infrastructural, material and human resources was analysed. This analysis of
the schools’ infrastructural status indicated that 70 per cent of the schools needed repairs at
end-line. A larger proportion (73 per cent) of public primary schools needed repairs compared to
55 per cent of IQSs. There was a consistent reduction in the proportion of schools that
needed repairs from baseline (93 per cent) to midline (87 per cent) and end-line (70 per
cent). This result was significant (p=0.000). This suggested that the school grants received by the
treatment schools had enabled some degree of maintenance culture of the school infrastructure.
The proportion of schools with source of drinking water (including water pots/drums for pupils)
was 49 per cent at end-line. This is a significant improvement from the midline score of 41, but
not much different from the baseline of 47 per cent. Overall, a greater proportion of IQSs has at
least a source of water for their pupils. The availability of water sources according to school type
is displayed in Figure 44 below.

The availability of toilets for pupils across all types of schools was poor. Pupil to toilet ratio
in IQSs was 198:1 compared to 246:1 for public primary schools. This indicated inadequate toilets
for pupils in the schools. The ratios in the control and treatment groups were 262:1 and 246:1
respectively.
In terms of school improvement support provided specifically by GEP3, the project provided
various ways of support to the schools through repairs and supplies. As shown in Table 45, both
IQSs and public schools benefitted from school repairs, school uniforms, monthly financial support,
classroom construction, chairs and tables. However, improvement of sanitation facilities (boreholes
and toilet construction) was only done at the public schools.

Stakeholders in the KII and community members in the FGD also highlighted infrastructure
available and material improvements. The valued elements included:
The existence of more classes than before, including the feature of less children per class
(fewer than 80 children per class).
The existence of tap drinking water at schools.
Common perceptions in the sense of more girls (than boys) in school due to the programme.
The material help provided by the programme and the policy on school gratuity was identified
as clear adjuvants of girls' retention at school.
Importance of providing free uniforms as this was perceived to have allowed enrolment of
families without economical means.
“The free uniforms provided by GEP3 to the pupils is helping a lot. For example, there was
a pupil who stopped coming to school for a while because his uniform is bad. I told the
headmaster the boy's problem, and he was given a new uniform. From then on, he didn't
miss school again.” Trained teacher, Kano
“I know about 10 homes of orphans that their children were not coming to school at all, but
now they are coming because the children got uniform, books, pens and other learning
materials at no cost.” Female parent, Kano
94. The indicators evaluated to establish the change in the external monitoring include head teacher
attendance of management training, frequency of visits by GEP3 officials, frequency of meetings
with the LGAs and the existence of functional SMBCs in schools. As shown in figure 44, 77 per
cent of the schools held meetings with the LGAs while 75 per cent received visits from
GEPs of cials. Further, 60 per cent of head teachers surveyed attended management training
and 92 per cent of the schools have functional SBMCs.

95. The training of teachers had been useful in the overall running and management of schools
as indicated by 90 per cent of the teachers surveyed. There was no statistical significance
between the perceived benefits of the head teacher training in IQSs and public primary schools
surveyed. There was clarity among respondents in the interviews regarding how to know that
funds were being correctly allocated and used. There was some social accountability for funds
that involved control measures – formal and/or informal. Respondents mentioned indicators
such as the presence of improvement plans presented for approval, monitoring tools and direct
observation of physical improvements to the school premises being made. These improvements
were enumerated, such as renovated classrooms, rehabilitated school buildings,
construction/increased number of latrines, etc. A dimension of perceived appropriate funding
allocation was the teacher's training and workshops. They were identified by many
respondents as important components of the improvement process undertaken by GEP3.
Enhancing the quality of teaching was reported as having gone hand in hand with updated and
reinforced competencies and skills among teachers.

96. Other reported positive outcomes include proper monitoring and evaluation of the programme.
Improved monitoring and data management skills were reported as enhancing accountability
and transparency. The EMIS was indicated as widely used and mentioned by respondents as a
source of verification in terms of the monitoring modality of GEP3 implementation in the field.
The standardisation of the procedures and the decentralisation of GEP3 data were reported
as strengthening the efficiency of the programme due to improved quality of data collection
and data treatment practices.
A key weakness reported by some stakeholders was the relative lack of synergy or
coordination among key partners at the state level, with projects being undertaken without
central communication. The duplication of efforts arising because of the lack of synergy was also
highlighted. Overlapping efforts were noted as a concern considering the funds were not enough
for all the needs identified.
“I know sometimes there is no synergy in the programmes they are carrying on so which
brings about gaps in funding because some people will be duplicating the same activity
when they would have carried out other activities to bring out more benefits for this sector.”
Federal Ministry of Education stakeholder
“I think there should be more synergy and more collaboration among the partners. If we,
do it that way we can put our resources together, then we will be able to achieve more
instead for all of us focusing on one thing differently thereby duplicating a lot of activities.”
State Ministry of Education, Bauchi
97. This massive increase in enrolment did not come without problems. Among the most
mentioned drawbacks were the overall conditions in classes, especially in terms of spaces
available for pupils and the pupil-teacher ratio. This unintended negative effect had several
consequences.
a) Pedagogical consequences: with less space, there are limited possibilities for the teacher
and children to move and exchange, hindering the variety of activities and flows of
interactive learning possible. An overcrowded classroom normally would mean difficulty to
concentrate for the slower learners, hardship to follow the teacher and the lesson, and of
course, very little interaction for each pupil, as well as a more static and motionless attitude
from children.
“What we are still battling with in our schools is how to accommodate children in our
classes in the manner it should be. This has not been achieved until now. In a class you may
find pupils amounting to about one hundred and fifty or two hundred or even more. A lot of
enrolment but there are no spaces for the children to sit”! Trained teacher, Bauchi
“In a class the only place for a teacher to stay is just at the board he can't move forward
away because the class is so crowded no space to move or even turn so there has been this
problem of lack of sufficient classes in the schools up till now.” Parents, Bauchi
b)Students-teachers ratio: with increased enrolment not followed by massive recruitment of
teachers, the volume of teachers available (and trained) is lower in relation to the pupils and
even though some mitigating actions were taken to remediate the lack of staff, quality and
relevant learning are surely needed. Some schools requested the help of volunteers to
alleviate the staff shortage or introduced the logic of shifts to maximise the use of
classrooms and premises.
“In some places there are shifts. They separate the children, just like this system of shifting,
some will do morning, and some will do afternoon and they take primary 1 2 3, mornings,
they will occupy all the classes of the school, then they separate them.” Katsina, female
parents
“In a class you may have two different classes with the teacher taking turns. Sometimes we
have shortage of classes, and we have to merge them.” Trained teacher, Sokoto

c)Classroom material shortage: The high number of pupils also has consequences on the
teaching material available. More children mean less access to furniture, chairs, books, etc. As
a teacher from Kano says: “
“We have shortage of desks, enough classrooms, teaching materials and teachers.”
Trained teacher, Kano
In some areas, these problems were addressed locally. For instance, in Kano, the local
governments (through the governor) invested in infrastructure to deal with the renovation and
infrastructural development to create more access to education. Others requested the intervention
of the community to alleviate the lack of infrastructure, which seemed in line with the
involvement of the community in the performance and results of schools.
Communities were also mobilised to provide facilities that would serve as classrooms, or in
terms of paying for the extra staff needed:
It is worth noticing the central role of SBMC and MAs in mobilising the community around the
school needs and enrolling community teachers to join those teachers assigned by the state – an
example is Niger state. In addition to this, the difficulty of an effective learning environment was
highlighted by teachers complaining that too many children attended school and teaching them
“Because of this association (SBMC) that has introduced that people in the community pay
some volunteer teachers every month because the teachers in the school are very few, and
you will see one businessman, and he will contribute, so different people contribute to the
society to make the school develop. The wealthy among the community build the class or
pay teacher’s salary so that is how the school develops.” Male parent, Katsina
8.5.2. Cost-benefit of GEP3
To determine the cost-effectiveness (Q2) and value for money (Q3) of the programme, the
VfM performance was compared against the original VfM proposition in the business case and
a cost-benefit analysis of GEP3 and GEP3-CTP was carried out.
QEFY 2. To what extent were the results delivered cost-effectively with the available resources?
98. The results of the programme were delivered cost-effectively with the available resources.
An analysis based on the original VfM proposition in the business case demonstrated that GEP3
spent less than the benchmarked unit cost for most activities and there was still
overachievement of the target with regards to the number of girls enrolled – a total of
1,283,024 girls instead of 1 million additional girls. The unit cost expended per additional girl
enrolled was much lower than what was budgeted. It was estimated that £107.3 would be
spent per additional girl enrolled in the business case. However, this amount was not spent
in any year. The highest spent was £75 per additional girl enrolled in 2016 and the least
was £38. Because the annual target of 100,000 girls was exceeded each year at a lower
than budgeted cost, the project did provide value for the money. Table 46, Figures 46 and
47 display the findings.
The unit cost of reaching a girl was much reduced in 2017 and 2020 compared to those in
other years. This is because in those years, although the additional number of girls reached was
much higher than the previous years, this was achieved at a lower cost to the project. In 2017,
additional girls were reached by applying savings emerging from Naira depreciation and savings
from SBMC and CBMC training. While in 2020, the operating costs were kept low despite
implementations resulting in the lowest overhead cost ratio between 2016 and 2020. Operating
costs were reduced through leveraging partner resources to achieve results while reducing
spending from the project side. An example was the collaboration between UNICEF, the Education
Sector Support Programme in Nigeria (ESSPIN) and NEI Plus, which resulted in the use of
resource materials and personnel developed by ESSPIN and NEI Plus minimising project costs.
This underscores the importance of collaboration and leveraging existing systems as a

99. Though the benchmark leverage ratio of $1 to 0.8 was not achieved, the project gradually spent
fewer dollars to leverage a dollar from the states. In 2015, 21 dollars was spent to leverage 1
dollar but in 2019/20, $10 was spent to leverage $1 from the states. However, there was a jump
back to $22 in 2018/9, but by 2020/21, the project spent $10 to leverage a dollar from the
states. It is important to note that these values are when a constant dollar exchange ratio of
199.05 is considered. When the Naira depreciated against the dollar from 2017 onwards, more
dollars were spent leveraging a dollar from the states. See figure 47 below.

The project was able to limit its overhead expenses to roughly 10 per cent of the programme expenditure
between 2015–2019, which was less than the approved 22 per cent, allowing more funds to be
committed to actual implementation (see table 48).

100. The project successfully enrolled over 1,283,024 girls over the period, about 140,000 girls
annually into primary school, ranging from 142,233 in 2015/2016 to 317,134 girls in 2019/2020,
exceeding the annual target of 100,000 girls. Each year of the project, a new cohort of girls is
enrolled in primary 1. These girls spend the next six years in school.
The findings show that the project represents value for money. The net present value (NPV)
is £7.3 trillion with a cost-benefit ratio of 14.2. An internal rate of return (IRR) of 10 per cent is
obtained, which is higher than the real discount rate of 5 per cent. The cost-benefit ratio is
above 1, which means that the benefits exceed the costs of implementation. Therefore, the
project offers value for money. The IRR is the discount rate at which a project’s NPV becomes
zero. Since the IRR exceeds the discount rate, the project generates returns more than other
investments in the economy and is considered worthwhile.
101. To determine the robustness of the results, the assumptions about input data were varied
to see the range of potential outcomes. This analysis helped to identify the point at which the
net benefits for the project no longer exist. The range of potential outcomes for differing inputs
was gauged using a sensitivity analysis. A sensitivity analysis helps to determine the potential
where the net benefits of the project are no longer positive. Details of the sensitivity analysis
and a table summarising the results of varying the inputs are in Table 49 below.

The sensitivity analysis shows that the degree of enrolment and the wages earned are important factors
in determining the cost-bene t of the project. A decrease of 10 per cent in the number of pupils enrolled sees
a sharp drop in the NPV value from £7.3 to £6 trillion while an increase of 20 per cent in enrolment results in an
increase in the NPV from £7 trillion to £11 trillion. The wage rate also impacts the NPV, with an increase of 50 per
cent in the wage rate for either the educated or both the educated and uneducated or increasing the wage rate in
line with the yearly market returns of primary school education, 7 per cent results in an NPV of £ 11 trillion. The
rate of survival to Grade 5 and the cost of education both seem to have a limited impact on the cost-benefit ratio
of the project as the NPV value does not vary much from the baseline. The cost-bene t analysis of the CTP
also yielded a positive NPV of £64billion and an internal rate of return of 16 per cent higher than the cost
of capital investment. A one-way sensitivity analysis shows that the amount of stipend per beneficiary impacts
the cost-benefit of the project. The higher the stipend per beneficiary, the lower the NPV and IRR on the project.

8.6. Sustainability of GEP3
Overall findings: GEP3 has established sustainable transformative gains with strong
community ownership that will secure the culture and practices of girls’ education
Quality of the evidence: Strong
The DAC criterium of sustainability is defined as, “the extent to which the net benefits of
the intervention continue or are likely to continue.”
The evaluation questions used for assessing the sustainability of GEP3 are summarized below:
QS 1. To what extent are the net benefits of interventions likely to continue after the UNICEF
support has stopped?
QS 2. How likely are the benefits (including resilience to risk) to last and under what conditions?
QS 3. Is government capacity sufficient to implement and monitor a government-supported CTP in
Niger and Sokoto states?
QS 4. Should the CTP, or a variant of it, be scaled up to state level? If the programme is to be
scaled up, which aspects of the operation must be modified and strengthened for it to operate
effectively at the state level? Which aspects of the programme should remain the same?
The questions on sustainability were answered by triangulating findings from the semi-structured

The overall conclusions of the independent evaluation team on the sustainability of the net
benefits of GEP3 are summarised below:
Conclusions of sustainability of GEP3
SUS 1: There are multiple potentials for the sustainability of the net benefits of GEP3 interventions,
but the key bottleneck relates to government financial commitment. (Para 102)
SUS 2: The extensive and meaningful community participation in GEP3 in all the states displays an
important potential for sustainability. Replication/imitation efforts at local levels including
financial/operational support from local mentors and communities are very promising in terms of
keeping the flow of benefits emerging. (Para 105 and 108)
SUS 3: The scaling up efforts undertaken by some states (although limited by funding availability and
important differences among states) are evidence of local ownership and high interest in
continuing/reinforcing the process. For instance, the Sokoto state is documented to have
successfully transited the CTP into a state-run programme. (Para 105 and 109–110)
SUS 4: Through the education-related local capacities training schemes those capacities were
strengthened enough to ensure scaling up. (Para 107)
SUS 5: There is reported awareness on the need to scale up GEP3-CTP project to cover more states
more evenly. The key deterrent in the sustainability component at all levels is poor government
funding. (Para 103 and 104)
QS 1. To what extent are the net benefits of interventions likely to continue after the UNICEF
support has stopped?
102. It was important to examine the extent to which the net benefits of interventions are likely to
continue after the UNICEF support has stopped by reviewing what elements (intrinsic or extrinsic)
denoted potential for sustainability. There are multiple potentials for the sustainability of the
net benefits of GEP3 interventions, but the key bottleneck relates to government financial
commitment.
There is sufficient government capacity to implement and monitor the programme at
national and state levels. The FME, SUBEB, SAME, SMoE were major drivers of the
programme – and there was evidence of national and state ownership of the programme and
clear political commitment. The states have developed sustainability plans to enable the
programme activities to continue beyond GEP3. Most of the states (Bauchi, Katsina, Kano, Sokoto
and Zamfara) detailed plans to institutionalise enrolment drive campaigns in SUBEB and/or at
community levels; continued and expanded training of teachers, teacher facilitators and head
teachers; and the digitisation of EMIS to support Annual School Census among other things (see
Annex 12). All indicated government budgetary commitments to these activities and in some
cases (Kano, Katsina and Sokoto), funding was leveraged from the World Bank-funded Better
Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA) Programme for some activities in the sustainability
plans. The key gap relates to a financial commitment by the government. There was no
evidence of an actual release of government funds for the activities in any of the states.
There was also ample evidence of local ownership and the use of local capacity generated
via intensive advocacy efforts of the programme. The LGEAs are important drivers of the
programme at the local level and there was evidence of commitment and capacity of the
government stakeholders at the local level. Even beyond that, SBMCs and other key community-
level groups received extensive training and were provided with resources to function. Regular
financial commitments made by the Mothers Associations and some community leaders in
addition to extensive community participatory activities within the programme are examples of
local ownership and commitment. It is widely documented that the participation of communities
in the operation of schools helped to increase access, enrolment, and retention of children in

school in different contexts72,73. The society/community plays an important role as facilitator and
partner in Education74.
103. The extensive and meaningful community participation in GEP3-CTP in all the states
displays an important potential for sustainability. Intrinsic elements relating to the strong
motivation displayed by key stakeholders, such as SBMC, HiLWA, MAs, and the transformational
change in the mindset of communities, including girls, denote the potential of the net benefits of
the programme lasting beyond donor support.
Moreover, Sokoto State continued the GEP 3 cash transfer with state funds from 2017. Although
this has been constrained to a degree by budgetary release towards the programme, GEP3 has
served as a foundation for the strengthening of cash transfer systems in the state including the
launch of the SDG Joint Fund Programme to accelerate SDGs through social protection, with
Sokoto as a focus state75. However, this is a programme that has considerable operational costs
and without firm and sustained financial commitment by the government, the likelihood of
loss of some of the net benefits of interventions is high. Even with UNICEF support, poor
funding by the government impedes governance in the sector.
“It is unfortunate that the state doesn’t match the funding while the resources for the
education are there. When you look at the utilization beyond recurrent and capital
expenditures it a very little amount that goes to soft aspects of teachers training, of
governance, to really look at the effectiveness of programme, so budget flows continue to
be a major constraint.” Stakeholder, UNICEF
Stakeholders in the interviews also identified the need for extra funds to assure sustainability plans that
would ensure the long-term impact of GEP3. As the project comes to an end, stakeholders expect that this
new stage and effort will be mainly performed by the Government at all levels.
QS 2. How likely are the bene ts (including resilience to risk) to last and under what
conditions?
104. The COVID-19 pandemic and the persisting insecurity situation in many of the focal states, have
tested the resilience of the programme. Certain opportunities, due to the COVID-19 situation,
were highlighted in the interviews– such as the rethinking of educational modalities and
strategies. However, both the COVID-19 crisis and insecurity have influenced and disrupted the
flow of GEP3 outputs. There were evident losses in retention and learning outcomes,
though the programme also displayed resilience and retained many of its benefits.
The consequences of the pandemic were global and did not just affect the girls. Students had to
stay home during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 for seven months before being able to return
to classes. Further down the line, the ongoing fear of COVID-19 vaccination compounded issues.
As one of the consequences, school attendance dropped, and at the same time, the number of
out-of-school children increased largely. The COVID-19 situation brought a varied series of changes
and dysfunctions to the project, from very high numbers of absenteeism, both from children and
teachers to stopping the school curricular programme. Disturbances to the ongoing process were
high, with long-bearing effects. Additional effects of the pandemic reported were girls being
married off during the lockdown and increased pregnancies among girls because they were forced
to stay at home.

“This pandemic has negatively influenced the retention, some of the pupils visited their
relatives, some have gone to Benue, Lagos and other places. It is only when they come back,
they will resume back to school. There are some girls who got married in between the
period of the pandemic. A lot of complaints come to the office - there are no pupils, some
teachers went to some other areas due to the pandemic and there are lot of things that was
affected”. LGA, Kano.
“Yes, many of the girls got pregnant and many of them stayed out of school. We had some
information that some of the girls got pregnant and for that reason they could not go back
to school. These are some of issues that affected the schooling of girls”. HiLWA, Kano.
In their FGDs, girls and boys highlighted their perceptions of the lockdown. Schools were closed
and, according to the children, that slowed down their learning. Many of them did not do much
at home, whereas some did study. As expected, not everything they learned in school was
retained by the time school reopened. Most importantly, the protracted school closures led to
some of their friends dropping out of school.
“It affects us, if not because of Coronavirus now we would have been in JSS 1.” Girl, Bauchi
“We all forgot what we were taught. When we came back, our teachers had to revise with
us our previous lessons before teaching us new things.” Girls, Kano
“We were not happy because the period we were meant to be studying, we were meant to
stay at home doing nothing” versus “We were not happy but some of us used the period to
attend lessons.” Boys, Kano
“Some of us are not happy with the corona holiday, some came back while some don’t
return, some prefer hawking than to return back to school, they tell us that they will not
come back to school, that they are tired.” G4G, Sokoto
105. Nevertheless, stakeholders used some innovative strategies to address learning during the
lockdown. During the crisis, teaching programmes were developed for radio and television that
were aimed at ensuring the pupils were busy with schoolwork, even though they were at home,
which had greater success than planned. The uptake was higher than anticipated. Stakeholders
reported receiving land from communities to build schools and gave the example of receiving a
farm (Kano). The G4G programme led to the development of skills resulting in some unanticipated
positive effects. Girls developed skills to make petroleum jelly, liquid soap, do knitting, mats and
baskets weaving and bead making (Katsina). There was considerable community support and
participation during the COVID-19 restrictions, highlighted by the financial support (including
transportation) provided to mentors in the communities.
106. In terms of insecurity, impressions vary. For instance, there is no feeling of insecurity in Kano
according to one respondent. For others, insecurity has always been a part of the landscape in
some regions, so mechanically transferring the (eventual) effects of it to the project doesn’t seem
fair. Insecurity was not felt as solely influencing GEP3, it was perceived as a much larger
problem, affecting everything. There was a feeling that endemic insecurity could be as paralysing
as the COVID-19 pandemic.
QS 3. Is government capacity sufficient to implement and monitor a government-supported
CTP in Niger and Sokoto states?
............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

107. There is substantial government capacity for the implementation of a scaled-up version of the
CTP in Niger and Sokoto states. Technical capacity and political willingness are available for
such a project, but the main constraint for both states would be their ability to provide
sustained funding for the CTP. The previous evaluation (2017) noted that Sokoto State
Government had developed the CTP scale-up plan and an implementation committee had already
been set up to implement the programme from April 2017. The evaluation also highlighted that
their programme implementation unit (PIU) in Sokoto state had the necessary capacity to
implement and monitor a government-supported CTP if given adequate financial support.
QS 4. Should the CTP, or a variant of it, be scaled up to state level? If the programme is
to be scaled up, which aspects of the operation must be modified and strengthened for it
to operate effectively at the state level? Which aspects of the programme should remain
the same?
108. At the time of the impact evaluation of GEP3-CTP in 2017, Niger State Government was planning
on sustaining the CTP in the six targets LGAs, while the Sokoto State Government was planning
for a scale up to the 23 LGAs in Sokoto State. This was an indication of a political will to
sustain the programme and implement a scale-up in Niger and Sokoto respectively. Yet, despite
the willingness and political goodwill, the findings in each of the two states indicate that the
government’s capacity to sustain or scale up the CTP is tightly constrained by funding.
On the other hand, the social protection policy measures initiated by the Federal Government in
2016 and formally introduced to Nigerians in 2017 are classified into eight categories and GEP3-
CTP fits perfectly under policy measure 2: “Provide scholarship, learning materials, uniforms and
cash transfers for children in poor households and children living with disabilities”.
However, it is important to note that “Nigeria's spending on social protection is considered low
compared to other sub-Saharan African countries. Comparative analysis on per capita GDP to
social protection for six sub-Saharan African countries, including Nigeria, indicates that though the
richest country among the six, Nigeria spends a lower share of GDP on social protection”76.
Social protection is not a key priority for the Federal Government, as reflected by the limited
funding available for it. Furthermore, as there is no ministry to champion social protection causes,
there is no drive to develop the social protection policy.
109. However, new developments in Sokoto state potentially favour sustainability and expansion
of GEP3-CTP. The evaluation of the SDG4 project in Nigeria (2021) noted that Sokoto state
has successfully transited a cash transfer scheme, the “Girls’ Education Project” reducing
gender gaps in public primary schooling, into a state-run programme. Thus, favouring its
selection to pilot a social protection project aimed at developing a model for federal states of
Nigeria. The expected impact is described as follows: “The expansion of existing state-owned
cash transfer programmes promoting girls’ education, will help to increase the proportion of
children both girls and boys at the end of primary education achieving at least a minimum
proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) Mathematics (SDG 4.1). Additionally, the communal
engagement, of women and adolescent girls in social behavioural change communication activities
will strengthen the efforts made in the reduction of infant and child mortality due to malnutrition
(SDG 2.2). Improved participation in a decision-making process by women and adolescent girls
through their inclusion in the establishment of communal project management committees will
create conditions that advance rather than undermine gender equality and women’s empowerment
(SDG 5)”. Thus, confirming sustainability in terms of CT provision as well as gender sensitivity.
Moreover, as described in the next section related to Equity and Gender Equality it seems that
sustainability could be better found in positive changes related to gender discrimination linked to
the socio-cultural context of patriarchal communities in Nigeria.
110. In answering the questions in this section, key informants indicated what a scale-up of the CTP
should look like:
Scaling up must also consider the transfer of ownership of GEP3 results, the inclusion of more
cost-effective work modalities and standardisation (digitalisation) of some processes and protocols.
These identified improvements, all of which have emerged at different levels through the
implementation of the project, would aim at a long-lasting impact based on the lessons learned
and best practices identified. They would mainly focus on facilitating closer and more effective
monitoring and follow-up mechanism to render a more realistic sustainable effort.

Of particular concern is the need for procedures’ digitalisation, it is important to mention that it
relates to the perception of an increasing (physical) insecurity factor. Indeed, it was mentioned as
being at the origin of this need to digitalise accounting procedures (payments, transfers and so
on). Digitalisation would be a way of minimising exposure to insecure environments, transferring
and transporting valuables included.
“The aspect I would say which I also see as a very good practices that of accountability is
the movement of funds because we need to go electronic now because of the insecurity.”
SMoE, Niger.
It is worth noticing that according to the respondents, the state level should be in charge of the
scale-up process as they are better placed to manage and monitor the calling-up process.
Furthermore, it would be very relevant to consider that those perceptions of a more
homogeneous and even coverage in the scaling-up effort run very high among respondents. This
scaling up should be thoroughly planned as not all local governments are benefitting from the
programme.
The clear and recurring re-vindication was that many states and communities that were not
included in the project should be included in the scaling up “so that everybody should get it”.
Additionally, to this last point, there was a concern and the expressed need to increase the
training coverage to train those beneficiaries that have not yet been trained (within the already
covered states).
8.7. Resilience of GEP3
Overall findings: GEP3 was resilient to internal and external setbacks including insecurity and the
COVID-19 pandemic
Quality of the evidence: Strong
The evaluation questions used for assessing resilience of GEP3 are summarized below:
QRES 1. To what extent was the project resilient to internal and external setbacks (economic,
conflicts, the pandemic, etc.)?
QRES 2. To what extent has the GEP programme responded effectively to risks and threats?
The questions on resilience were answered by triangulating findings from the semi-structured
interviews, focus group discussions and the desk review.
Because of the similarities in the questions, these have been addressed together. Please note that the
preceding section on sustainability also addresses some elements of the programme’s resilience from
a perspective of the likelihood of continuation of benefits.

The overall conclusions of the independent evaluation team on resilience of GEP3 are
summarised below:
Preliminary Conclusions of Resilience of GEP3
SUS 1: Even though the COVID-19 crisis influenced and disrupted the flow of GEP3 outputs, it also
brought reflection and reengineering of certain educational practices, modalities, and strategies.
They included the more direct involvement of stakeholders, local media, and the rethinking of
learning. (Para 111 and 112)
SUS 2: Innovative mitigation strategies used during the COVID-19 lockdown period, such as
teaching programmes on radio and television and village-level mentorship activities enabled
learning for girls and boys, with a higher level of participation than expected. (Para 113)
SUS 3: Massive abductions of school children and people in the programme areas was an
ever-present threat for the project, but qualitative evidence displayed a general perception of the
structural insecurity as part of the landscape. Nevertheless, obvious challenges were presented by
insecurity in the states, especially in Niger state. (Para 114)
SUS 4: Overall, female mentors/mentees empowered by the project, such as HiLWA, G4G or
female teachers, seemed to be better prepared and more sensitised to issues of gender-based
violence which helped create spaces for addressing them. (Para 115)

Overall, in terms of the programme’s resilience to risk:
111. Community-based ownership of GEP3 as evidenced in other sections, proved to be the right
platform for confronting one of the main threats of the programme – the COVID-19
epidemic. An unexpected situation was not only affecting school attendance in the regions where
the project was being implemented, it was a national and worldwide crisis affecting all social
activities. The flexible and innovative strategies developed to cope with the drawbacks of the
unimaginable context (radio educational programmes, parents teaching, school shifts, etc.) seemed
to play a double role, to help maintain social contact and provide learning for pupils in numerous
places.

..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
112. In terms of monitoring and following up of GEP3 by central authorities and LGA, the desk
reviews carried out through this evaluation process showed that the unprecedented
character of the pandemic caught all levels of management off-guard, strongly influencing
and disturbing the data collection efforts especially from mid to the end of 2020. Thus,
some monitoring tools and protocols in place stopped gathering in-field information due to the
lack of reliable contacts in the regions’ local administrations, who were under lockdown
themselves, or due to the interrupted school activity (teachers not attending classes, children
being kept at home). These gaps in information, though non-negligible, were compensated by the
qualitative and quantitative information collected for this evaluation which started in April 2021.
113. As already noted in the sustainability section, innovative mitigation strategies used during the
COVID-19 lockdown period such as teaching programmes on radio and television and village level
mentorship activities enabled learning for girls and boys on a higher level than expected. There
was considerable community support for these strategies shown via moral and financial (including
transportation) support provided to mentors in the communities.
114. The insecurity problems in the northern regions of Nigeria also worsened during the last
part of the project (which influenced the implementation of this evaluation field phase). The
increasing massive abductions of school children and people in the concerned areas were an ever-
present threat for the project. Paradoxically, evidence collected qualitatively refers to a
globally assumed context, where structural insecurity seems to be a part of the landscape.
As mentioned repeatedly, insecurity issues have always been present, not necessarily being
perceived as clearly deteriorating in the last four or five years. Evidence shows that reality differs
from the perceptions collected through the qualitative tools. Niger state was challenged by
insecurity especially during the evaluation data collection period.
115. In terms of gender-based violence (GBV) such as rape, harassment and molestation, the
problem seems to have worsened with the lockdown periods during the COVID-19
pandemic, with girls being kept at home for longer periods exposing them more to this kind
of violence. There is evidence nevertheless, of growing awareness of this social problem and
instances exists at school level where these problems are discussed. Geographical distance
between the schools and homes is a variable directly related to the perception of danger and
risk of GBV on the road to or from school. Spontaneous strategies such as walking in groups to
school have partially palliated this threat.
Overall, female instances empowered by the project such as G4G or female teachers, seem to
be better prepared and more sensitised to these issues, which helped create spaces to address
them.
8.8. Gender Equality and Equity
Overall findings: Strong benefits to the female gender was achieved by GEP3 with evidence of massive
girls’ enrolment in schools; and social and economic empowerment of women. Programme benefits
were fairly evenly distributed across all wealth quintiles with evidence of pro-poor benefits in learning
outcomes
Quality of the evidence: Strong
The evaluation question used to assess gender equality of GEP3 is recapitulated below:
QE 1. To what extent has GEP3 addressed inequalities in education, and incorporated gender
equality and the empowerment of women and girls into the design, implementation and
results achieved?
The evaluation question on gender equality and equity was answered by triangulating quantitative and
qualitative findings from the household survey, desk review, semi-structured interviews, and focus
group discussions.

The overall conclusions of the independent evaluation team on gender equality and equity
of GEP3 are summarised below:
Preliminary conclusions on gender equality and equity achievements of the programme
GEN 1: There was strong evidence of massive enrolment of girls and a significant positive impact
of the programme on girls’ learning outcomes (see previous sections on effectiveness and impact)
GEN 2: Pupils’ learning outcomes were mostly similar across the five quintiles of wealth
distribution with the poorest quintile interestingly performing better than the richest quintile. This
implies a pro-poor element of the programme. (Para 58)
GEN 3: The programme favoured the enrolment of girls across households of different wealth status
Analysis of the NER in relation to the wealth status of households showed only a little difference
between the richest and the poorest households for the NER of girls in the CTP households (93.4
vs 92.5) compared to the same variable for the boys (93.6 vs 90.4), implying that the
gender-sensitive CT intervention bridged the divide for girls. (Para 120)
GEN 4: The use of women by the programme – especially as mentors and high-level advocates
was a strategy that produced both intrinsic and extrinsic benefits – the activities of the HiLWA
generated high-level political interest in girls’ education, but even more importantly, the mentoring
of the G4G led to a change of mindset among the girls – a good foundation to set towards any
long-term change. (Para 118)
GEN 5: The project worked holistically with women – Mothers’ Associations, HiLWA; and girls
(G4G) and engaged with multiple stakeholders including community-level decision-makers to
systematically address drivers of gender inequality. Fundamentally, the programme aimed to drive
behaviour change norms by implementing advocacy and awareness programming with men
(SBMCs, He for She, religious and community leaders, etc.) alongside support for women’s
resources, voice, and decision-making. However, there was not much evidence to suggest that the
project considered the intersection with several social vulnerabilities (including disability and
displacement). (Para 116-119)
GEN 6: An even broader approach was adopted – improving the school environment to allow good
management of periods at school; offering a life skills programme in the “Girl 4 Girl” component;
and taking different barriers and concerns into account that could represent an obstacle to the
pursuit of schooling for a girl who has reached puberty. (Para 124 and 126)
GEN 7: There was evidence of social and economic empowerment of women and improved
livelihood for households because of the CTP. This appeared to have influenced the position of
women in decision-making within the family and community – highlighted by the evidence of
increased investment in girls’ education made with the cash transferred to mothers. (Para
121–123)
GEN 8: However, the socially transmitted fear of (and shame associated with) a pregnancy out of
wedlock, which is also a major reason for girls’ early marriage after their first menstruation, didn’t
seem to have been adequately considered in the programme design. (Para 124)

8.8.1. Addressing gender in the design and implementation of GEP3
The design and implementation of GEP3 took gender issues considerably into account, but
there were limitations.
116. GEP3 aimed to promote gender equity by transforming gender norms, relations and roles at the
household and community levels to tackle girls’ education, stimulate gender empowerment and
reduce early marriage. The project worked holistically with women through groups like Mas,
HILWA; and girls (G4G) and engaged with multiple stakeholders, including community-level
decision-makers, to systematically address drivers of gender inequality. Fundamentally, the
programme aimed to drive behaviour change norms by implementing advocacy and awareness
programming with men (SBMCs, He for She, religious and community leaders, etc.) alongside
supporting women’s resources, voice, and decision-making. However, there was not much
evidence that the project considered the intersection with several social vulnerabilities
(including disability and displacement). Nevertheless, there was an element of focus on
marginalised and vulnerable groups in the CTP, although it was limited by the targeting process.
117. There was active consultation and meaningful participation of relevant groups in shaping
the project objectives and implementation. Community leaders, HILWA, religious leaders, youth
groups (boys and girls) and women’s associations were all engaged in the programme
implementation. However, it was not so clear how many of the groups were involved in the
design phase. The women change agents (HILWA and the MAs, etc.) and the male champions
(SBMCs and He for She, etc.) were important advocacy and awareness generation drivers within
the communities. The capacity of the change agents appeared to have been increased by training
and the project initiatives.
118. The use of women by the programme – especially as mentors and high-level advocates was
a strategy that produced both intrinsic and extrinsic benefits – the activities of the HiLWA-
generated high-level political interest in girls’ education, but even more importantly the
mentoring of the G4G led to a change in mindset among girls – a good foundation to set
towards any long-term change.
The pictures painted in the psyche of different things they can be in addition to being a wife
and mother, stimulated a voice in the young, enabling them to challenge decisions made by their
parents for early marriage – something that may never have occurred to them without the
influence of the programme.
119. Positive changes relating to gender empowerment also provided a potential for
sustainability. CTP was structured to give women caregivers a voice in their daughters’ education
and there is evidence that the programme logic worked in this regard with an unintended positive
effect of improved spousal relationships because of the cash transfers (this could easily have
gone the opposite direction within the patriarchal context).
8.8.2. Gender, equity and CTP
120. The programme favoured the enrolment of girls across households of different wealth statuses (see table 41).
Net enrolment ratios for girls and boys in the treatment groups (GEP3-CTP) were higher in HHs in the highest
wealth quintiles compared with the other wealth quintiles. For the boys, there was a clear difference in
enrolment ratio between the richest and the poorest households (93.6 compared to 90.4) However, for
the girls, the difference in the NER between the richest and the poorest households was less (93.4
compared to 92.5) because of the increased enrolment among poor households, implying that the CTP
bridged the divide for girls.

Low 92.5 90.4
Middle 92.7 92.5
High 93.4 93.6

..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Also, comparing the average household expenditure on girls’ and boys’ education by household
wealth status before and after receiving cash transfers, findings showed that there was more of
an increase in expenditure on girls’ education than that of boys’ education within the households
that received GEP3-CTP. The findings further revealed that the households within the highest
wealth quintile spent more on the education of girls and boys after receiving CTP when
compared to the other wealth quintiles. This was displayed more for boys compared to girls.
While girls benefitted from CTP almost equally across wealth quintiles, boys showed more of a
benefit in HHs in the highest wealth quintile. See Table 51.

and after receiving the cash transfer

High 3,426 4,616 1,191 2,745 3,245 500
121. There was also qualitative evidence of social and economic empowerment of women and
improved livelihood for households because of the CTP. Participants in the FGDs perceived
that the money given as an unconditional cash transfer was substantial and reported that it was
used as seed money to invest in small businesses. Mothers invested to generate regular profits
to continue their daughter's education after primary school or even beyond secondary school.
Poverty reduction was mentioned, but with no substantive details.
122. Another positive effect already mentioned was the improvement of the relationship between
spouses. The wife's gain in financial independence seemed to have removed some of the
tensions generated by the woman's economic dependence within the household.
“In some ways it has cemented the relationship between husband and wife. The cash is
given to the mothers and not the fathers, so the husband will be forced to talk to the wife …
Let’s go straight to the point, you know, because of the economic empowerment, the
husband now respects her woman, that’s why the relationship is better, she doesn’t have to
be asking for money all the time.” HiLWA, Sokoto.
123. A reduction in early marriages was mentioned frequently by the FGD respondents. There was
evidence of recognition of a change in the social status of an educated woman. It was reported
as the desired status both by female and male/young and adult FGD participants – not only for
professional or socio-economic reasons but also in terms of household management improvement,
including better socialisation with and support of children. Though there was evidence of
transformation change in mindset, difficulties still exist – due to strongly-rooted social
prejudices.
124. GEP3 adopted a holistic gender-sensitive approach – by improving the school environment so that
it allows good management of periods at school; offering a life skills programme in the “G4G”
component and considering different barriers and concerns that could represent an obstacle to the
pursuit of schooling for a girl who has reached puberty.
Despite the latter, socially transmitted fear of (and shame associated with) a pregnancy out
of wedlock, which is also a major reason for girls’ early marriage after their first
menstruation, didn’t seem to have been adequately considered in the programme design.
The value assigned to virginity and the risk of prenuptial sex greatly gears the imposition of early
marriage for the sake of girls’ finalising schooling, its associated fulfilment and eventual emotional
and personal happiness. This gap in underestimating the logic underlying the early marriage
dynamics in its psychosocial dimensions weakened the potential impact GEP3 could have had in
such practice.

125. The most compelling element of change in gender equality would have been undoubtedly a
unanimous and straightforward change in the defined script for a daughter by the different groups
from the community that participated in the FGDs. Indeed, the change in the script to include
the option for a woman to contribute to the family income through paid work outside the home
does not seem to have been fully embraced by the older generation.
While both boys and girls mentioned girls becoming doctors, teachers, or lawyers as one of the
main outcomes of girls' education, the main outcome mentioned by fathers and men, in general,
was that an educated woman can properly look after the house and children and even help them
with their homework. In these traditional and conservative communities, even after having
benefitted from the project, only a minority of men would accept that their wives have a job
outside the home. Mothers and women also mentioned that educated women are preferred
because they know how to behave and control themselves to avoid arguing with their husbands.
They also mentioned that men still want to control their wives, which means that there is still
this norm that a girl must be submissive and dependent on her husband.
In so far as these different groups from the community also explained that nowadays most men
prefer to marry a girl who has studied, the number of married girls with a child, at school has
increased, meaning that husbands are permitting their wives to continue their studies.
“Yes, it used to be impossible to have junior secondary school female students who
were not engaged, but this is no longer the case. Instead, they have different
aspirations to become doctors, nurses, pilots, teachers, etc. They have successfully
shifted their views on early marriage and are now aiming for a better future because the
world has changed”. Teacher, Kano.
“The difference is clear; men prefer to marry educated women because they know that
they are understanding and can take good care of their home while the uneducated
women can hardly take care of their home … Men prefer educated wives because they
can help their children with their homework and help them when they have difficulties
in their studies”. Female parent, Kano.
“I think it’s a matter of preference some educated women do not want to work probably
because their husband can provide for them, and in some cases it’s the husband who
do not want his wife to go out and work because he believes that is his responsibility to
provide for the family and the mother should look after her children to train them.”
HiLWA, Sokoto
“When you have money, you allow her to continue, after marriage.” Male parent,
Sokoto
“Early marriage may mean before the age of 18, but there are still girls that are over 18
and still in junior secondary who still get married, so as you can see, it does not stop
them from going to school.” HiLWA, Bauchi.
“Here you will see the girls are many, some are even pregnant, or with an infant. Some
of them come for enrolment and probably left education before.” Female parent,
Bauchi
Also, as reiterated in previous qualitative analysis, the delay of girls' marriage was mentioned as
influencing the importance given to girls' education. However, the fact that a girl may not want
to marry because she wants to pursue a career was mentioned as a positive and possibly
accepted exception where previously it would have been considered a failure of the parents to
fulfil their responsibility to marry off their daughter.

..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Also, a girl's period affects the amount of education she receives. For instance, physical pain or
discomfort, lack of menstrual products and WASH infrastructures can contribute to preventing girls
from attending school. Girls are often forced to stay at home during their periods. This leads
them to repeatedly miss school days and fall behind in their studies. When they can no longer
keep up, girls are discouraged by their poor performance and sometimes end up dropping out of
school altogether.
126. By adopting a gender-sensitive approach, in particular by improving the school environment
so that it allows good management of menstrual periods at school, but also by offering a
life skills programme in the “G4G” component; the programme proposed a holistic approach,
considering different barriers and concerns that could represent an obstacle to the pursuit of
schooling for a girl who has reached puberty.
Indeed, the life skills programme contributes to the transformation of the gender discriminatory
role where girls are to be prepared to be submissive and silent wives who do not take part in
conversations within the extended family. Traditionally, it is the parents, or even the father, who
make decisions about the daughter, who is thus conditioned. However, participation in life skills
sessions enables the adolescent daughter to improve her ability to communicate, negotiate, solve
problems, make decisions, have critical thinking, and manage stress and emotions. While the
programme runs parallel awareness-raising sessions on girls' schooling and gender equality, parents
and community members will have to be prepared to accept that adolescent girls use their skills
and allow them, for example, to give their opinion on choices that concern them.
However, talking about sexuality remains a taboo in these communities and in the absence of
sex education that would allow adolescent girls to make informed choices about their sexuality
and prevent unwanted pregnancies, marriage at the onset of puberty remains the best option for
parents as it guarantees that their daughter's sex education will be provided by the husband and
that pregnancies will be legitimised by the marriage.
Sex education and reproductive health should be part of life skills modules for adolescent girls,
which did not seem to be the case and was never reported in the interviews or focus group
discussions. Similarly, it seems that there isn’t any training in parenting skills or even an inter-
generational dialogue strategy, which would allow parents to benefit from this sexual education.
This would allow mothers to use dialogue rather than marriage to prevent unwanted pregnancies
outside marriage.

9. LESSONS LEARNED
The evaluation highlighted several lessons from the programme.
Methodologically speaking, the comprehensive societal approach (considering a wide range of
social, psychosocial, cultural, and economic factors) was shown to be effective in inducing the
change in perceptions and behaviour intended. Indeed, the combination of an array of intervention
types, using different change-inducing modalities such as training, awareness-raising, role modelling
(HiLWA), peers influence (G4G) and financial incentives (CTP) were internally complementary and
allowed targeting different types of stakeholders (community, school population, teachers, local
authorities, families) adequately.
Having said that, this comprehensive project design was shown to have a management challenge
due to a change in project management culture, for authorities as well as UNICEF staff.
Coordination, information, and reporting seemed to be the main challenges at the beginning, which
were eventually overcome by quality-oriented practices. Readapting and better operationalisation of
the ToC in 2014 proved to be a good decision to render the project more concrete and feasible.
Key strategies of the programme such as RANA, G4G, HiLWA mentoring, IQS are recommended
as good practices. RANA’s evidence-based approach to early-grade literacy and numeracy has been
shown in this evaluation to achieve fundamental reading and numeracy skills for both girls and
boys. GEP3-supported IQSs showed the effectiveness of the RANA intervention even more than the
public primary schools in terms of English and Hausa literacy, as well as numeracy. Although the
pupils were significantly older than their counterparts, this also meant that children that were
missed in the public primary system have been effectively captured and are benefitting from quality
education. The imitation strategies used by HiLWA and G4G were important drivers of
transformational mind shifts among girls. This holds the potential to eventually drive the change in
social norms that are required to enable the desired shift in the defined script for girls in the
community. Moving forward, a multi-sectorial approach (involving the women's affairs and social
protection line ministries, for instance) would be useful to maintain and propel the momentum
achieved by GEP3.
The combination of geographical and categorical targeting was demonstrated to be effective for
the identification of beneficiaries from the low-income group bracket but failed to prevent exclusion,
as the poorest caregivers were not selected. The programme has an extensive network of
community-level stakeholders (such as SBMC and CBMC) which could have been leveraged better
to ensure better targeting of the most marginalised groups within the communities. Furthermore,
while targeting the right population for the CTP is important, planning for onward education is
also critical for success. For CTP to be more effective, enough secondary schools must be available
in the communities as well so that the children can easily transition.
The programme’s focus on massive enrolment and retention of pupils proved to be an effective
strategyand contributed to reducing out-of-school children as well as early marriages and early
childbearing among girls younger than 15 years. Also laudable was the evidence of transformational
shifts in mind-set regarding girls’ education in the communities – a result of immense and
consistent community sensitisation and high-level advocacy activities of the programme. However,
enrolment and retention of pupils should have been accompanied by a corresponding increase in
the teacher population to ensure the desired quality of teaching and learning.
Though there was evidence of a reduction in early-marriage practices, the change appeared to be
limited due to strong-rooted stereotypes and inflexible attitudes linked to culture and religion.
However, the G4G strategy of changing the mindset of girls is stimulating a push-back, although to
a limited degree.
The combination of early learning and cash transfer interventions had a multiplier effect on
girls’ enrolment, retention and completion. Indeed, this evaluation has shown the value of cash
Plus initiatives. This is an important finding and should inform the package of interventions for the
next programme cycle. The cash transfer strongly impacted household spending on girls’ education
even though it was unconditional. Although qualitative interviews suggested that caregivers may not
have invested the money as they should have due to the unconditionality, this finding was not
supported by quantitative evidence.
............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Page 139
Final Evaluation of Girls’ Education Project Phase 3 (GEP3) 2012–2022 in Northern Nigeria Evaluation Report
..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
It appears that most of the beneficiaries used the money for its intended purpose. This finding is
supported by literature on the non-conditionality of cash transfers77,78. It is recognised that the
misuse of cash is usually minimal and in no way justifies the costly expenses generated by a
control system that should be put in place to monitor the provision of conditional cash.
This makes a case for the scale-up of the CTP both in Niger and Sokoto states and the extension
of the programme to other pilot and extension states. It also seems that six states out of 37 are
not enough and stakeholders recommend scaling up further.
A key focus of UNICEF is to ensure that learning occurs. In that sense, the strategy must be
broader than just cash transfer and should include enrolment rights, working School-Based
Management Committees, etc. Several inefficiencies in the system occurred as unintended negative
effects due to massive enrolment and retention of children in schools such as overcrowding in
classrooms necessitating shift systems of classes in some areas. Better planning to address the
increase in access generated by the programme is needed. The Education portfolio multi-country
evaluation (2018)34 reflected on the Nigerian situation and noted that UNICEF programming had not
taken context and available resources into account, and that interview and observational data
showed that the continued emphasis on access was disproportionate to the investments in
improving the quality of education in schools.
While a stronger positive impact related to the achievement of English literacy was recorded for
boys than for girls at midline, the degree of positive impact for girls overtook the boys at end-line.
The drop in impact for boys is of concern and requires further examination. A possible reason could
be that, in addition to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 lockdown and insecurity, the focus on
girls may have led to issues regarding boys being missed.
The relative lack of synergy or coordination among key development partners in education in
the country has resulted in the inefficient use of available resources. The UNESCO briefing note
which details how to ensure appropriate coordination mechanisms in education at national level
states, “Achieving the aspirations of the education goal and targets in the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development requires coordinated efforts among all partners involved at all levels. In all
cases, strong multi-stakeholder partnerships and unity of action are essential for successful
integration of SDG4-Education 2030 commitments and focus areas into national education
development efforts.” The core is the need for unity of action to stem the duplication of efforts
within the sector reported by several stakeholders. This would need to be a government-led,
inclusive process using a system-wide approach; but development partners such as UNICEF can
stimulate discussions with the government on the practical ways that coordination and synergy can
be achieved.
The tenacity of programme implementers has enabled them to overcome many hindrances and
implement creative solutions in the programme. They were able to come up with methodologies
that were used to have the level of success achieved by the project. The seven-month COVID-19
pandemic lockdown and the persisting insecurity in the region eroded programme gains. The level of
impact that was seen because of the programme interventions despite the disruptions pointed to
the fact that before the COVID-19 crisis, the programme was on a trajectory to achieve higher
levels of effectiveness and impact.
The importance of meaningful community engagement is seen very clearly in this evaluation. The
degree of local ownership of the programme – displayed by the political and financial commitment
of key community leaders and stakeholders showed the usefulness of the programme’s advocacy
activities as well as the effective identification and involvement of relevant stakeholders. Community
members in different groups and networks were involved in the implementation and monitoring of
the programme. This leveraging of community resources was key to the level of success in
enrolment and retention seen in the programme.

The evaluation shows clearly that poverty has a major influence on whether a child goes to school
or not and provides evidence of potential for more effectiveness when the CTP money is given
to the mother rather than the father. This is interesting given the patriarchal context. It suggests
that the socio-economic empowerment of women even in such a context enables them to have a
voice in the household, decision making. It is also possible that the mediatory roles played by the
SBMC in the communities contributed to the success at the household level. Women’s influence
over decision-making within their family, particularly regarding the use of household income, can
play an important and enduring role in shaping the welfare of their children. Cash transfer
programmes often target women to increase their control over household resources79. Empirical
evidence on the effectiveness of this approach is varied and indicates the importance of local
context41.
The programme aimed to strengthen the capability of schools to provide improved learning
outcomes through the professional development of teachers, head teachers, school infrastructure
development planning and provision of lesson plans and other teaching resources. It succeeded in
doing this to some extent but gaps in several areas including teaching quality still need to be
addressed.
Dissemination plan for lessons learned: In addition to the evaluation report being published online
by UNICEF, dissemination forums will be held at national and (focal) state levels and the results of
the evaluation will be presented also using the policy brief (four pages). The evaluation findings have
been shared with the FME and UNICEF plans to use social media and hold discussions with
youths etc. to further disseminate the findings. OAG is available to develop additional policy briefs
in different thematic areas and an infographic if required.
10. FINAL CONCLUSIONS
GEP3 programme showed evidence of relevance, effectiveness, and positive impact with evidence of
sustainability of the transformative gains made within the period.
GEP3-CTP tackled relevance by addressing enrolment and retention of girls across six states in
northern Nigeria with a comprehensive and systemic approach (considering financial, social, and
identity components) which proved to be successful. A comprehensive situational analysis of basic
education in northern Nigeria was undertaken to support the programmatic design and proper
prioritisation of relevant needs and causal determinants factors/barriers to pupils' education in
northern Nigeria. The programme displayed an adequate application of the Results-based Planning and
Management (RBM) approach. The monitoring and evaluation framework contained adequate vertical
logic of results chains and horizontal logic of measurement of results (indicators, baseline, targets,
etc.) to successfully track and adjust the project.
The CTP was appropriate in terms of design and delivery approach addressing the three dimensions
of demand bottlenecks, given the contextual realities in Niger and Sokoto States regarding girl
education.
The anticipated “imitation strategies” identified such as Girls for Girls or the role of HILWA or MAs
were influential, even beyond girls.
There was evidence of strong and useful synergies between the community-level stakeholders
involved (SBMCs, MAs, HILWA, CBMCs) involved in the programme. Some limitations still exist
mainly around entrenched societal and cultural norms some of which are beyond the scope of the
programme and the sector.

Most of the assumptions in the ToC were proven by evidence but the assumption related to
effective learning through infrastructure and teachers provided by local and central authorities was
not fully proven. Although materials were available, and infrastructure was globally provided by
authorities (though not always sufficient and with some need for repairs), the lack of newly
recruited teachers to fulfil the pressing staffing needs given the increasing number of children
enrolled was evidenced early in the project and hindered impact in quality learning outcomes.
In terms of coherence, GEP3-CTP was intentionally structured to align with global strategies on
girls’ education – integrating elements from the evidence used globally in designing interventions for
girls’ education. GEP3 as implemented in the six focal states was coherent with education and the
broader policy environment at the Federal and State levels. The Programme was aligned with the
national strategic policy on education as well as the national social protection and gender policies,
and the adapted policies at state levels. The project considered key contextual elements and causal
factors in formulating the hypotheses underlying the design of GEP3 interventions. Consideration for
the contextual issues relating to financial access, socio-cultural practices and continuity of use was
also seen clearly in the CTP design. As far as alignment of the GEP- CTP with the local and
contextual realities is concerned, some sociocultural elements still must be addressed; especially
those aspects which are so deeply entrenched in societal and cultural norms that they are likely
beyond the scope of one programme or one sector.
Regarding effectiveness, GEP3 achieved its Expected Results (Outcomes and Outputs) agreed within
the Business Plan in the strategic area of access to an exceptional extent and in the two other
strategic areas of quality and governance of the Education Sector to a fairly good extents The
programme was highly effective in achieving enrolment and retention of girls in schools. It enabled
a definite shift in mindset regarding the importance of education for girls and created a norm in
many communities of a raised profile for educated girls. The combination of the early learning and
the cash transfer interventions significantly displayed the most effectiveness, with the highest
proportion of households with 1-2 or more girls who had completed nine years of schooling
compared to the early learning intervention only and control groups. The CTP specifically, was
effective in improving household consumption and welfare for the beneficiary households in Niger
and Sokoto states and significantly influenced increased expenditure on girls’ education as well as
the decisions to send and retain girls in school in the two states. The training was key to
improving the quality of teaching and learning, as well as raising awareness of the relevance of the
core problem (girls’ access to education) but evidence from classroom observations and qualitative
interviews indicated gaps in the quality of teaching. This was attributed in part to inadequate
teaching aids or poor comprehension of the teaching material by teachers – and indicated a need to
train people with the appropriate capabilities.
An unintended negative effect of GEP3 was the (persisting) increase in pupil-teacher ratio due to
the massive increase in enrolment without a corresponding increase in the teacher population. This
has an important implication for the quality of education and has been highlighted in other
evaluations.
The impact of the CTP on girls’ enrolment in primary schools is strongly positive and statistically
significant, and the impact of the unconditional cash transfers on household spending on girls’
schooling was strongly positive and statistically significant. The results of impact analysis using DID
regression modelling approach revealed that GEP3-RANA had a positive impact on English and Hausa
literacy learning outcomes at both midline and end-line. However, there was a slight decline in the
programme impact between midline and end-line – likely due to disruptions caused by COVID-19
pandemic and insecurity in the region. While a stronger positive impact related to the achievement
of English literacy was recorded for boys than girls at midline, the degree of positive impact for
girls overtook the boys at end-line. This was also due to a significant drop in programme impact for
boys. The drop in impact for boys is an undesirable effect and requires proper examination. A
possible reason could be that in addition to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 lockdown and
insecurity, the focus on girlss may have led to issues regarding boys being missed. National
population surveys showed improvement in the trend in literacy rate among young women aged
15–24 years, a reduction in early marriages, adolescent pregnancies, and childbearing in the focal
states.

Concerning the efficiency of the programme, GEP3 spent less than its budget yearly. The highest
expenditure was in 2018/9 with an expenditure rate of 92 per cent. However, the project using
cost-saving and cost-sharing approaches successfully enrolled a total of 1,283,024 girls in school
as opposed to a total target of 1 million girls. The net present value results for both the early
learning and the cash transfer intervention are positive. This shows that the interventions offered
good value for money. The internal rate of return (IRR) for the early learning intervention is 10
per cent and for the cash transfer – 16 per cent. These are the annualised rate of return for
both interventions respectively. Since both IRRs are above the real discount rate of 5 per cent,
the two projects offer value for money and should be accepted. The rate of enrolment and the
wage rate are important factors in determining the cost-benefit of the project. Globally, a value
assessment of GEP3 (2012–2020) and the CTP demonstrate value for the money based on the
cost-benefit analysis. Also, the use of the project framework demonstrated that value was gotten
from money spent. This shows that there is an opportunity to scale up the programme.
Nevertheless, a key issue to be addressed is the high pupil-teacher ratio which created classroom
space, material, and human resources gaps leading to inefficiencies in the system.
There are multiple potentials for the sustainability of the net benefits of GEP3 interventions
but the key bottleneck relates to governments’ financial commitment. Even though the COVID-19
crisis influenced and disrupted the flow of GEP3 outputs, it also brought reflection and
reengineering of certain educational practices, modalities and strategies. They included the more
direct involvement of stakeholders, local media and rethinking of learning. The extensive and
meaningful community participation in GEP3 in all the states displays an important potential for
sustainability. Replication/imitation efforts at local levels are very promising in terms of keeping
the flow of benefits emerging. The scaling-up efforts undertaken by some states (though limited
by funding availability and important differences among states) are evidence of local ownership
and high interest in continuing/reinforcing the process. For instance, the Sokoto state is
documented to have successfully transited the CTP into a state-run programme. Through the
educational-related local capacities training schemes, those capacities were strengthened enough to
ensure scaling up. There is clear awareness of the need to scale up GEP3-CTP project to cover
more states and more evenly. The key deterrent in the sustainability component at all levels is
poor government funding.
Regarding gender equality and equity, the use of women by the programme – especially as
mentors and high-level advocates was a strategy that produced both intrinsic and extrinsic
benefits – the activities of the HiLWA generated high-level political interest in girls’ education, but
even more importantly, the mentoring of the G4G led to a change in mindset among girls – a
good foundation to set towards any long-term change. The project worked holistically with women-
MAs, HiLWA; and girls (G4G) and engaged with multiple stakeholders including community-level
decision-makers to systematically address drivers of gender inequality. Fundamentally, the
programme aimed to drive behaviour change norms by implementing advocacy and awareness
programming with men (SBMCs, He for She, religious and community leaders, etc.) alongside
support for women’s resources, voice, and decision making. However, there was not much
evidence that the project considered the intersection with several social vulnerabilities (including
disability, displacement and socio-economic status. Nevertheless, there was some element of
focus on marginalized and vulnerable groups in the CTP though limited by the targeting process.
GEP3 adopted an even broader approach – Improving the school environment to allow good
management of periods at school; offering a life skills programme in the “G4G” component and
considering different barriers and concerns that could represent an obstacle to the pursuit of
schooling for a girl who has reached puberty.
There was evidence of social and economic empowerment of women and improved livelihood for
households because of the CTP. Despite the latter, socially transmitted fear of (and shame
associated to) a pregnancy out of wedlock, which is also a major reason for girls’ early marriage
after their first menstruation, didn’t seem to have been adequately considered in the programme
design.

The most compelling element of change in gender equality would have undoubtedly been the
change in the defined script for a daughter by the different groups from the community that
participated in the FGDs. However, the changing definition of a daughter's script varied from one
generation to the other. It was clear in this evaluation that for the older generation, the main role
of a girl is still to be a mother and wife maintained by her husband, and formal education helps
them to fulfil this role better. For the younger generation, both boys and girls, their perceptions
were that education allows girls to consider professional careers such as doctors, etc. as well as
have financial independence, which is a key to transforming the household gender dynamics such as
a submissive/dependent wife-husband relationship into a more balanced and equal one.
The evaluation highlights a need for intergenerational dialogue which has been demonstrated to be
an effective strategy for programmes aimed at abandoning harmful social norms and creating an
enabling environment for adolescent girls and young girls to pursue studies further and delay the
age of marriage through mutual understanding between different generations in a community.

11. RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the rich evidence in this evaluation, the team shares a series of considerations to be into account for
future UNICEF interventions.
Strategic Recommendations
Criteria Text of the recommendation Recipients Level of priority
RELEVANCE To reinforce the relevance of this kind of LGAs, Federal Ministry Medium
intervention, we recommend generating a of Education, SMoE,
better understanding of the stakeholders’ UNICEF
constellation of future project designs.
Considering the elaboration of the
situational cartography (including own
agendas and interests) should be proposed
as a precondition at the project
management level. Moreover, this would be
in line with addressing the school
ecosystem as a social reflection of the
community in which it is embedded,
including the socio-cultural specificities it
entails. The- acknowledgment of this strong
school-community interaction would be
empowering for the steering team of such
projects. Increased relevance will likely be
tackled by considering that any wide-scope
educational project must be socially
permeable to its context, especially when
aiming at deep-rooted behavioural changes.
This is especially valid in large
geographical-scaled projects such as GEP3.
Numerous respondents mentioned the
diversity of realities that the project had to
address as a hindering factor. Access to
anthropological and sociological
tools/expertise would reinforce this
enriched approach to quality baseline
information.
Operationalisation of this recommendation
would focus on:
a) Validating end-line impact levels of the
current GEP3 evaluation at the state level
(and for each state) through workshops
organised by SMoE and UNICEF in which
one of the points should be a thorough and
critical analysis of stakeholders. This
collective analysis enriched by local entities
would help identify gaps as perceived by
SMoE and LGAs and would help to
complete a more relevant and updated
landscape.
b) Implementing local studies to understand
more about the drivers of not just girls but
boys’ education in the face of insecurity
would be another way to obtain this
necessary updated information.

Criteria Text of the recommendation Recipients Level of priority
COHERENCE Improvement of the alignment of future FME, UNICEF Medium
initiatives with the development and political
national priorities. Special attention should
be given to linking how they contribute to
the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG) and the Agenda
2030, closely linked to GEP3 intervention:
Goal 4. Ensure inclusive and equitable
quality education and promote lifelong
learning opportunities for all; Goal 5.
Achieve gender equality and empower all
women and girls.
Moreover, this alignment with both core
SDGs addressed by GEP3 and UNICEF
priorities should also be supported by a
more thorough and contextualised analysis
of eventual supplementary SDGs such as
(but not only):
Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms
everywhere.
Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and
promote well-being for all at all ages.
Even though the Theory of Change (ToC) of
GEP3 design does relate to the SDG, project
management should ensure a more
consistent approach to these worldwide
references in development all along with the
implementation and evaluation phases. This
approach should be put in place for all future
interventions.
EFFECTIVENESS 1. The government should create a more FME, UNICEF High
enabling environment for gender equality
and transforming discriminatory social
norms that affect girls. National, state and
local governments should commonly
support approaches to changing power
relations between men and women, girls
and boys – at the community, local,
institutional and national levels. At local and
state level, this could be achieved by a
concerted effort to raise awareness among
civil servants, for example through an
HR-oriented training programme or MOOCs
on these transversal issues.
Clear policy strategic adaptations in terms of
girls’ social inclusion would most likely
enable change in this direction.
At a higher policy-making level, this could be
operationalised by focusing on reinforcing
regional institutional integration. In his
sense, priority should be given actively

reaching out and reinforcing sectorial
programming with adequate methodological
and technical tools. Indeed, many regional
and supranational organisations and working
groups such as UN Women and UNESCO
(especially through curricula development
by the IIPE80 or policy-making support by IBE81
have created specific programmes and
working groups to develop, accompany and
enable authorities to reinforce this strategic
social domain.
In this sense, the incorporation of the
inclusive curricula notion, not only covering
gender, but also ethnical and social
minorities and children with disabilities,
should be considered a priority in the
educational sectorial development plans.
EFFECTIVENESS 2. Decrease the pupil: teacher ratio to cope FME, UNICEF High
with the massive increase in enrolment. The
need to increase teachers’ recruitment and
training in the system to sustain the flow of
benefits from the project is evident.
Through a comprehensive effort to train and
inject new contingents of trained teachers
the existing gap between pupils and
teachers would be tackled.
Such as a Teachers Training Master Plan82
should include an in-service component and
a pre-service training component.
a) The in-service component includes newly
hired future teachers with a minimum profile
and a programme to level them up in a short
time span (1-2 months) through self-training,
online training when possible, and/or
delocalised training sessions (resources’
centres at local levels).
b) The pre-service component aims at a
further impact on the system by increasing
the number/profiles of teachers entering
formal training. The number of female
teachers should be an important variable
in this profiling of candidates. The

level or local levels should be able to
respond to long-term demographical
projections including a stable representation
of girls (sustainable impact of GEP3
Programme).
3. The holistic gender-sensitive approach FME, SMoE, LGAs, High
should be maintained. By improving the SBMC, UNICEF
school environment so that it allows good
management of periods at school;
offering a life skills programme in the “Girl
4 Girl” component and considering
different barriers and concerns that could
represent an obstacle to the pursuit of
schooling.
The validation state-wide workshops on
GEP3 results could be a good opportunity
to sensitise authorities to the strengths of
this global approach. By proving the added
value of such an approach.
Advocating for the Girl 4 Girl, He for She
and similar strategies through the
dissemination of the very positive results
it achieved within GEP3 would also go in
this sense.
EFFECIENCY 1. Having proved through the present UNICEF, FME, SMoE High
evaluation that GEP3 was efficient in
terms of Value for Money, the
recommendation is to include cash
transfer initiatives whenever possible,
especially with the Plus
(complementing cash transfers with
additional inputs, services, and
linkages to other services) element.
Given that this finding highlights the
importance of financial support for
beneficiaries, financially supporting
poor households should be part of
the follow-up strategy for girls’
enrolment and inclusion whenever
proper monitoring is possible.
Therefore, we propose that
integration, or scaling-up of this
financial household component as
part of a more comprehensive
inclusive education intervention
strategy, should be considered in
future programmes.

2. Improving the synergies among FME, SMoE, LGAs, High
EFFICIENCY
development partners regarding the SBMC, UNICEF
implementation of interventions in the
education sector. This absence of
coordination undermined the efficiency level
expected from them and was reflected in
duplication or overlapping efforts, showing
inefficient use of limited resources.
This synergy could start by boosting
communication through the creation of
project coordination cells at the SMoE. Else,
UNICEF should advocate improving
networking among partners and
international and national education
stakeholders by introducing digital common
platforms and/or shared databases to better
centralise information on in-field
interventions. The objective is to render
visible ongoing relevant projects in the
education field to national educational
managers and decision-makers.
SUSTAINABILITY 1. Benefit from the existing conditions to FME, LGAs, UNICEF, High
scale up GEP3, covering more states and SMoE
more evenly. The latter, as mentioned
before in efficiency, should be combined
with demonstrated cash transfer value for
the money based on a cost-benefit analysis
and the findings from the existing scaling-up
efforts undertaken by some states (though
limited by funding availability and important
differences among states) contributes to a
positive environment for this new phase to
take place.
2. A post-evaluation steering committee
assessment from a representative panel of
stakeholders involved (PFE and others)
should determine which conditions must be
met and monitor the compliance with them
to launch the scaling-up effort.

Operational Recommendations
Criteria Text of the recommendation Recipients Level of priority
EFFECTIVENESS 1. The methodological project approach
based on the prior development of a
pragmatic proposal of the Theory of Change
must be implemented across the board for
socially sound projects. The proven added
value that GEP3 worked with a shared:
coherent, concise, comprehensive
complete and consistent common view of FME, UNICEF High
the change expected must be implemented.
Besides, it would allow local level
implementers to be trained in a
state-of-the-art straightforward project
management methodological approach
being used worldwide.
2. For projects that focus so overwhelmingly
on social representations and tackle
ambitious behavioural changes, a
multidisciplinary programme approach must
be structurally envisaged at the design
phase for all projects. The combination of a
comprehensive set of scientific knowledge,
conceptual frames but moreover; UNICEF Medium
methodological tools will allow a global
understanding of the forces and stakes.
Particular attention should be given to
cultural, historical, and psychological
variables that are sometimes oversimplified
or overlooked when formulating the
intervention logic. So, multidiscipline should
be a quality criterion when assessing or
selecting an adequate project design.
EFFICIENCY 1. To prevent exclusion error targeting,
SBMC members should be better involved
in the targeting process and prepare a list of
the poorest households with school-age
girls from their communities to be SBMC, FME, SMoE Medium
cross-checked with the list prepared by the
state and local government authorities. This
strengthened collaboration will allow more
accurate identification of beneficiaries.
To achieve this, SBMMs role in future
projects should be clearly stated and
clarified. Thus, having an operational role in
defining sampling, especially if
much-disaggregated information is needed.
Sensitising SMoE and LGAs to the key role
they have, should also be implemented to
assure their active participation.

EFFICIENCY 2. The programme should consider FME, LGAs, SBCMs High
integrating a Sexual Reproductive Health UNICEF for the
Rights (SRHR) sensitising module in the module/toolkit
G4G package or another awareness-raising
local interface. This information effort would
help support the indirect objective of
preventing unwanted teenage pregnancies
which could impact girl education and
sustain child marriage, hindering the
long-lasting impact of GEP3.
By elaborating such a training module or
toolkit locally (as opposed to using an
external material), the cultural context would
be taken into consideration as well as the
lesson learned from the current GEP3
impact evaluation.
SUSTAINABILITY 1. A competency-based curriculum is FME, UNICEF Medium
recommended for initial teacher education
programmes and training. The curriculum
would involve a conceptual framework for a
new model of competency-based teacher
education (including transversal
competencies on gender equality and
gender-based social inclusion) to enhance
teachers’ professional competencies and
raise the quality of learning processes. This
would also favour long-term sustainability to
the culturally based process of integrating
girls into the Nigerian education system.
A Teachers Training Master Plan as
presented in a previous recommendation
would have to include the pedagogical
platform based on a nationally or regionally
validated competency referential, an
experimental phase (sampling of Teachers
Training Schools), assessment and a later
generalisation phase for all national teachers
training institutions. The semi-experimental
methodology will allow us to steer and
adjust eventual incoherencies or inefficient
elements in the training engineering device
sustaining the Master Plan.
SUSTAINABILITY 2. Any new intervention should consider SBMC, FME, SMoE Medium
reinforcing the results related to monitoring,
management, transparency practices and
competencies acquired by LGAs and other
authorities to build up from them and
enhance the quality of any other oncoming
educational project. The progress in this
domain across the six states involved is
remarkable and building up from this
achievement is a matter of institutional
accountability.
MoE could certify those acquired
competencies through a validation scheme
and specify them in post descriptions to
render them visible and sensitised of their
relevance.
