EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
12
This is an evaluation report of the UNICEF Education Programme (2018-2022). The evaluation was conducted
between December 2021- December 2022.
Background
The Education Programme Strategy (1) for the UNICEF Country Programme 2018-2022 focuses on three major
priority areas: a) out-of-school children; b) quality learning and teaching; and c) early childhood education,
under the larger outcome of ensuring that ’Girls and boys, particularly the most disadvantaged, participate
in quality early childhood and elementary education with learning outcomes at grade-appropriate levels, by
2022’. The outcome was reached through five output result areas, and an additional output was added
(Output 506 on COVID-response) after the Mid-Term Strategic Reflection in 2022(2), to capture responses to
and adaptations in programming during the COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF’s educational programming,
interventions and implementation modalities , is based on its classification of states into three typologies:
High Burden, Tribal States and Transition states. More context and background to the evaluation and the
Education Programme is provided in Sections 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3.
Purpose of the Evaluation and its Audience
The overarching purpose of the evaluation was to generate learnings on implementation modalities – what
worked and how; as well as what gaps emerged, if any – in the interventions rolled out since 2018 under the
UNICEF Education Programme in India. The evaluation findings and recommendations will feed into UNICEF
India’s upcoming Country Programme (beginning in 2023 and decision-making on education policies and
processes at national and sub-national levels). The overall goal and objectives of the evaluation is presented
in Section 1.4 and the intended audience is presented in Section 1.7.
The scope of the evaluation encompassed the Education Programme from 2018-2021 and covered all the six
output areas. The geographic scope of the evaluation was national but also with an in-depth focus on a
sample of seven states (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Odisha, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu)
among three state typologies for the purpose of primary data collection. The primary intended audience for
the results from this study is UNICEF staff, government and other stakeholders who will be involved in the
next UNICEF Education Programme. The scope of the evaluation is elucidated in Section 1.5.
Evaluation Methodology
This evaluation is theory-based and utilised evaluation methods of Contribution Analysis and Process Tracing,
especially Bayesian Updating. Evaluation evidence was assessed using the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development’s Development Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC) criteria of relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and sustainability. Questions related to equity, gender equality and
human rights considerations, especially those pertaining to marginalised and vulnerable populations, were
integrated into all of the evaluation criteria. The criteria and corresponding questions are presented in
Section 1.6.
The evaluation study utilised mixed-method research, including extensive analysis of the documents, Results
Assessment Module (RAM) reports, key informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) with
the UNICEF and stakeholders at the national, state and district levels. Contribution Analysis with elements of
Process Tracing, in particular, Bayesian Confidence Updating was employed to test the effectiveness of the
Theory of Change (ToC). Contribution Analysis provided the overarching framework to arrive at credible
causal claims about the UNICEF Education Programme’s contribution to output result areas, considering
other factors that may have influenced the achievement of these result areas. The evaluation team, in
consultation with UNICEF, developed six contribution claims around the six output areas, and constructed
output-specific ToC using the COM-B (Capacity, Opportunity, Motivation- Behavioural Change) approach.
13
UNICEF’s contribution to change was assessed by mapping evidence of change against the behaviour
changes, links and assumptions (causal pathways) in the ToC.
The evaluation team used a combination of process tracing and Bayesian Updating to investigate two specific
causal claims on how UNICEF’s Education Programme influenced the strengthening of special training
programmes and increased programming and activities around responsive parenting. The Bayesian Analysis
helped to measure confidence in UNICEF’s contribution claims, and to update the evaluation team’s
confidence in them according to the relevance of emerging evidence through document review and KIIs. This
involved establishing prior and posterior probabilities and estimating the probative value of the evidence.
The methodology is further set out in Section 2.2.
Evaluation Findings
The main findings are described for each evaluation criterion and structured around the key evaluation
questions that guided the evaluation.
• Relevance: The UNICEF Education Programme was well aligned with the national and state priorities as
outlined in various policy documents and with the UNICEF strategic goals and SDGs. The Programme
responded appropriately to the changes in the context, especially because UNICEF realigned its
programming substantively and in a timely manner to deal with the emergence of the COVID-19
pandemic. Interviews with UNICEF staff and document review show that the state typology-based
programming approach is relevant to the contextual barriers in the three state typologies. Different
activities were accorded different priorities in the three state typologies, although certain challenges
affected the effectiveness of the typology-based approach - such as the absence of typology-based ToC
and monitoring plans, limited opportunities to facilitate cross-learning within the typology states, and
lack of a nuanced understanding of the approach at the state level. Detailed findings corresponding to
each evaluation question under Relevance can be found in Section 3.2.
• Effectiveness: RAM analysis shows that UNICEF was mostly 'on track' to achieve its intended targets, with
the exception of targets under Output 502 (ECE) due to pandemic-related challenges. However, this
analysis does not take into consideration the indicators which were deactivated or revised as a result of
the pandemic. The evaluation found evidence to confirm UNICEF's contribution to most key change
activities across the six output areas. Evidence on certain activities, such as the establishment of model
anganwadi or ECE centres under Output 502 (ECE), implementation of DRR activities under Output 501
(Policy and planning for equitable quality education), capacity building of supportive supervision groups
under Output 504 (Quality education and learning) and capacity building of community groups under
Output 505 (Demand for quality education), were mixed and varied depending on the state. While the
causal mechanism to establish increased programming around responsive parenting and strengthen the
delivery of special training programmes was weak, the evaluation found proof to ascertain UNICEF's
direct technical and financial support in leading to these changes. Internal and external stakeholders
noted accelerating factors such as strong state leadership and hindering factors such as frequent change
in government staff, changing government priorities and funding constraints. The stakeholders also
noted unintended positive outcomes such as increased institutional appreciation for evidence-based
planning, increased parental involvement and teacher-led innovations in programming and some
unintended negative outcomes such as high degree of reliance on UNICFE’s continued financial and
technical support. Findings from the evaluation on questions corresponding to this criterion can be found
in Section 3.3 and Section 4.
• Efficiency: Most activities were reported to be completed within the stipulated timeframe with minor
delays noted due to bureaucratic processes for facilitation and approvals, ad-hoc requests from the
government, long internal processes at UNICEF and pandemic-related challenges. The current financial
14
template did not allow for analysing overspent funds, but all allocated funds were utilised. However,
internal and external stakeholders reported insufficient funds to meet the expected goals and targets.
External stakeholders also reported that the proportion of staff in state offices is incommensurate with
the quantum of work, and while reporting positive feedback on working relationships, highlighted a few
technical areas for improvement, such as monitoring and evaluation, digital education and public
financing and planning. Detailed findings corresponding to each evaluation question under Efficiency can
be found in Section 3.4.
• Coherence: The evaluation noted close convergence with the work of government stakeholders and
other implementing partners. A need for a degree of separation of its work from that of government
partners and broadening of engagements with non-traditional and emerging actors in the education
sectors was noted by external stakeholders. While government partners provided overwhelmingly
positive feedback on UNICEF's modalities of engagement, implementing partners raised a few concerns
related to the duration of partnership engagements, coordination and communication and reporting
mechanisms. UNICEF's strong relationship with the government, its ability to provide technical expertise
and act as a knowledge partner and its convening power as a UN agency were some of the strongest
comparative advantages highlighted by interviewees. However, internal convergence between different
sectors within UNICEF, with other UN agencies and with other major UN initiatives was found to be weak
and primarily forged through individual capacity and leadership rather than through systematic modes
of collaboration. Findings from the evaluation on questions corresponding to this criterion can be found
in Section 3.5.
• Sustainability: Several examples of the integration of UNICEF interventions within government
programmes or scale-up of initiatives using government resources and capacity emerged. The focus on
institutional strengthening and involvement of government staff, including teachers and ECE workers
and use of community volunteers contributed towards enhanced sustainability of the initiatives. The
primary challenges related to sustainability include the capacity (technical and financial) of the
government institutions as well as evolving priorities and personnel turnover in both UNICEF and the
state leadership. While external stakeholders highlighted UNICEF's role as a knowledge partner, it was
noted that UNICEF could take a more proactive role in driving research and learning agenda in the
education sector by creating an enabling environment for collective learning with all development
partners and a need to strengthen monitoring. Detailed findings corresponding to each evaluation
question under Sustainability can be found in Section 3.6.
Conclusion, Best Practices and Lessons Learned
• The evaluation identified several best practices or innovations within the Education Programme’s
interventions, such as technology-enabled solutions to increase coverage and monitoring of
programmes, integration of DRR in education, improving equity and access through mother tongue-
based multi-lingual education, integration of mental health and life skills within secondary education
curriculum, leveraging community volunteers to strengthen the capacity of and sustainability of
interventions, the inclusion of active supervision and mentorship to strengthen teacher capacity
programmes and programmatic interventions to address learning loss.
• The evaluation team has distilled several lessons from the evaluation that could strengthen the Education
Programme and improve its effectiveness and efficiency of the Education Programme such as
strengthening the annual plan review process, improving the multi-sectoral programming approach and
convergence, and strengthening linkages between demonstrations and evidence generation around
innovations with policy advocacy. The evaluation also noted the flexibility of the UNICEF’s programming
approach, emphasis on evidence generation and knowledge management and partnership with technical
agencies improve the effectiveness and relevance of the Programme.
15
• The future ToC for the Education Programme should consider the following:
o Consider capacity building and technical support as a vehicle for institutional and system
strengthening.
o Explore the role of technical support in promoting policy advocacy.
o Identify clear outputs and outcomes in relation to partnerships within the ToC.
o Include leveraging public and other external resources as an output within the ToC.
o Consider UNICEF’s advocacy work, as well as its outputs, such as its participation in numerous
committees that provide inputs into policy and operationalise the policy within the ToC.
o Explicitly link UNICEF’s knowledge management function to sector-wide research and learning
agenda.
A detailed description of the conclusions is presented in Section 5 and best practices and lessons learned is
presented in Section 6 of the report.

1.1 Introduction
This report presents the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the evaluation of the UNICEF
Education Programme 2018-2022. The evaluation was commissioned by the Country Office of UNICEF India
and was carried out between December 2021- December 2022. It covers the entire UNICEF Education
portfolio during the first four years (2018-2021) of the five-year Programme.
Section 1 of this report provides the context, an overview of UNICEF’s Education Programme (2018-2022)
and describes the scope and the objectives of this evaluation, the evaluation questions and the intended
users of the evaluation. Section 2 explains the evaluation methodology, including the evaluation approach,
data collection and sampling strategies, and limitations and challenges faced by the evaluation team. This
section also highlights the ethical considerations and evaluation management process. The findings resulting
from the evaluation are presented in Section 3, organised according to the evaluation criteria (relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, and sustainability) and the evaluation questions. Section 4 presents
robust evidence of UNICEF’s contribution to the increased integration of responsive parenting in Integrated
Child Development Services (ICDS) plans and the delivery of special training programmes for out-of-school
children in the selected study states. Based on the findings, conclusions are presented in Section 5, best
practices and lessons learned in Section 6 and recommendations in Section 7.
1.2 Context
This section sets out the current context and shifts in the policy landscape and major programmes and
initiatives directed by these policies with regard to the UNICEF Education Programme’s three main priority
areas; a) early childhood education; b) quality learning and teaching and c) out-of-school children. Each
subsection covers the landmark changes leading up to the beginning of the current Country Programme cycle
in 2018 and provides an overview of the policies that have emerged between 2018 and 2022. To throw light
on the drastic changes in the operating environment as a result of COVID-19, a pre- and post-pandemic
comparison of key statistics and unintended positive and negative changes are also presented within each
subsection.
A. Early Childhood Education
Policies on support and resources for early childhood care and education in India can be traced back to the
National Policy of Education of 1986. Since this landmark policy, several centrally sponsored schemes and
further legislations have come into effect to strengthening ECCE delivery in the county. The most significant
of such initiatives is the centrally sponsored and state-implemented Integrated Child Development Scheme
(ICDS) which provides non-formal, pre-school education to children up to six years of age, in addition to
health and nutrition services. However, the efficacy of the ICDS scheme has been hampered by poor
implementation stemming from poor resource allocation, poor governance, and programmatic deficiencies
such as inadequate focus on education within service delivery (3). To address some of the issues, ICDS was
restructured with a renewed focus on early childhood education through the National ECCE Curriculum
Framework in 2013. Further, global and national focus on ECE increased with the introduction of the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 and the inclusion of “quality early childhood development,
care and pre-primary education” under SDG 4.2. ECE activities are also integral to achieving at least seven
SDGs.
However, challenges remain with the quality of ECE activities and are reflected in the school readiness levels
in India. The India Early Childhood Impact Study (IECEI) reported that almost 57% of children are not ready
to learn even as they enter school in Class 1 (4). Further, 42.7% of rural Indian children in Class 1 were unable
to recognise the letters of the alphabet in their medium of instruction, and 35.7% were unable to recognise
numbers from 1-9(5). This is surprising given that the IECEI report found that more than 80% of children were
19
participating in some form of institutional learning by age 4 in the sample states of Rajasthan, Telangana, and
Assam (4). The statistics, in conjunction, imply that failures in school readiness are not due to issues related
to access to ECE centres but due to issues around practice and quality of ECE.
The current cycle (2018-2022) of UNICEF’s Education Programme has witnessed a further rise in the
awareness and importance of ECE, and its inclusion within national education and child development policies.
In 2019, two major centrally sponsored schemes to operationalise ECE (ICDS and the National Creche
Scheme) along with four other programmes with components of ECCE were brought under a consolidated
scheme known as the Umbrella ICDS. Further in 2019, the erstwhile scheme of Sarva Shiksha
Abhiyan, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education was subsumed under the
new Samagra Shiksha programme. Samagra Shiksha was proposed to “treat school education holistically
without segmentation from pre-nursery to Class 12” (6)and supports pre-primary education through co-
location of anganwadi centres in primary schools wherever feasible, in convergence with the department of
WCD, or through a pre-school section in primary schools. Correspondingly, INR 803 crore was allocated
towards ECE in the 2019-20 Samagra Shiksha budget(3). The rising importance of ECE and school readiness
was also reflected in the National Education Policy (NEP) of 2020, which recommends the inclusion of children
between the ages of three to six years within the school systems and promotes universalisation of pre-
primary education by 2030(7).
However, efforts to implement guidelines and strategies were affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic and
consequent challenges related to funding and the operating environment. For example, the total approved
allocation for pre-school education under Samagra Shiksha dropped by approximately 60% to INR 319 crore
in 2020-21. Further, anganwadi centres were closed due to lockdowns and restrictions on mobility and face-
to-face interactions in the country from March 2020 and reopened at different times in different states in
2021. Despite the increased policy focus and prescriptions, pandemic-related challenges have resulted in the
reduction of children enrolled in pre-primary education between 2018 and 2021. According to data from the
most recent reports of UDISE+, this drop is estimated to be about 20.5% from 119.5 lakhs in 2018-19 to 94.95
lakhs in 2021-22(8). However, home-based learning programmes initiated during COVID-19 have garnered
interest and attention on responsive caregiving and parenting. Although programmes such as ICDS, the
National Creche Scheme and POSHAN Abhiyaan have elements of parental engagement and involvement, a
rapid assessment of learning situations during the pandemic found evidence of increased parental
engagement during this period, as compared to pre-COVID engagement(9).
B. Quality Learning and Teaching
Emphasis on learning in India has largely focused on evaluation and examination reform, as evidenced by
Section 10 of the National Policy on Education of 1986. This emphasis on examination was carried forward in
the RTE Act of 2009 through which the federal government initiated a “No Detention Policy”, as a method to
encourage stress-free learning and instead directed the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) of
students through the Right to Education Act. Through consistent monitoring of students’ performance, the
CCE was aimed to help teachers customise teaching practices and hence improve learning outcomes.
However, the absence of explicit learning outcomes was heavily criticised and in 2017, the rules were
amended to “provide for the preparation of class-wise, subject-wise learning outcomes”(10). Evaluation of the
CCE system in schools did not show concrete improvement in the learning outcomes of children in primary
and upper primary schools(11) and the framework was scrapped by the federal government in 2018, with a
provision for states to decide if they wanted to continue with the No Detention Policy.
The public discourse on the global and national decline in learning levels garnered strength in recent years,
aided by reports published by the World Bank, ASER and policy drafts issued by the Ministry of Education in
India. Globally, quality learning has also found renewed focus through its inclusion under SDG 4.1 – “By 2030,
ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading
to relevant and effective learning outcomes”(12). The increased focus on the need to strengthen the end result
20
of the schooling process and to ensure learning is also reflected in NEP 2020. The national “learning crisis”
was acknowledged in NEP 2020 which stated “Various governmental, as well as non-governmental surveys,
indicate that we are currently in a learning crisis: a large proportion of students currently in elementary school
– estimated to be over 5 crore in number – have not attained foundational literacy and numeracy, i.e., the
ability to read and comprehend basic text and the ability to carry out basic addition and subtraction with
Indian numerals”(7). To tackle this crisis, the NEP 2020 promotes the universalisation of foundational literacy
and numeracy (FLN) by 2025 as its highest priority. To operationalise this priority, a national mission on FLN
or the National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy (NIPUN) Bharat was
set up by the Ministry of Education. The NEP also includes teacher education reforms and assessment reforms
to address the learning crisis, and several initiatives have been launched since 2020 in this regard. For
example, the National Initiative for School Heads’ and Teachers’ Holistic Achievement (NISHTHA), an
integrated in-service teacher training programme, was launched by NCERT. Similarly, CBSE launched the
Structured Assessment for Analysing Learning levels (SAFAL) framework in 2021 for competency-based
assessment for grades 3, 5 and 8 focusing on testing for core concepts, application-based questions and
higher-order thinking skills.
The need for a shift in the focus and initiatives aimed at improving learning levels is further underscored in
the light of data from the pandemic years. A comparison of learning outcomes as reported in the National
Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017 and 2021 show a decline in the absolute learning levels across all grades and
subjects except in grade 10 language(13). The average learning achievement reportedly dropped by four
percentage points between the two rounds of surveys. An ASER study on the status of learning in Karnataka,
Chhattisgarh and West Bengal during COVID-19 show similar results- the reading level of children in primary
grades stayed steady or showed marginal improvements between 2014 and 2018 but dropped from 2018 to
2021(14). Further, a 2021 study on the impact of Covid-19 on learning finds that across five states of India,
92% and 82% of children surveyed had lost at least one specific ability in language and arithmetic
respectively(15). That is, 92% of children could not satisfactorily finish at least one task in language tests (such
as describing an experience orally, reading with comprehension, reading familiar words or writing about a
picture), and 82% could not satisfactorily finish at least one task in arithmetic tests (such as identifying single
and two-digit numbers; performing arithmetic operations; using basic arithmetic operations for solving
problems; describing 2D/3D shapes; reading and drawing inferences from data). The digital divide witnessed
during the promotion of remote learning initiatives during the pandemic has also exacerbated the demand
for digital education. Correspondingly, the final approved draft of the NEP 2020 had an exclusive chapter on
ensuring equitable access to and use of digital resources for education.
C. Out-of-School Children
The Millennium Development Goals of 2000 emphasised the universalisation of elementary education across
the globe. Towards achievement of this goal and in the backdrop of poor rates of enrollment and high drop-
out rates in the country, the Government of India launched the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in 2001 with a view to
provide quality elementary education to children between the ages of six to fourteen years. The initiative
also promoted the establishment of informal centres in areas not serviced by formal schools and adopted
measures to ensure inclusion of marginalised children within the school system. The scheme was largely
successful with attendance improving from 69% in 2000 to 80% in 2004-05 in rural areas, and from 83% to
88% in the same time period in urban areas. The RTE Act of 2009 further looked to increase enrolment rates
in the country, through its mandate to provide “free and compulsory education to every child in the six to
fourteen age group” (16). The RTE Act also proved to be successful in reducing the number of out-of-school
children in the country- the District Information System of Education (DISE) data shows that enrolment in
upper primary classes increased by 19.4 % between 2009 and 2016(17). Gender inequities in enrolment rates
have also reduced over the years with the percentage of girls (15-16 years) not enrolled in schools dropping
from 20% in 2008 to 13.5% in 2018(18). However, statistics on out-of-school children remain a cause for
concern for specific groups of students, including children with disabilities and those from minority groups.
21
The continued focus on bringing children into or back to schools is echoed through SDG 4.1 which aims to
“ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading
to relevant and effective learning outcomes” by 2030. At the national level, NEP 2020 has renewed the
importance on initiatives for out -of-school children with the aim to attain 100% Gross Enrolment Ration
(GER) by 2030. Further, it aims to bring around two crore children back into schools through an open
schooling system(19). These initiatives come in the wake of increased proportion of out-of-school children as
a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to ASER 20220, the proportion of children in the age group of
6-14 years not currently enrolled in school decreased from 2.5% to 1.6% between 2018 and 2022(20) . The
largest decrease in percentage of children (age 15-16) not enrolled in school from 13.1% in 2018 to 7.5% in
2022. (21).
1.3 Subject of the Evaluation – UNICEF’s Education
Programme (2018-2022)
The overarching goal of the Education Programme that began in 2018 was to ensure that ‘Girls and boys,
particularly the most disadvantaged, participate in quality early childhood and elementary education with
learning outcomes at grade-appropriate levels, by 2022.’ The Education Programme has three main priority
areas: a) early childhood education (ECE); b) out-of-school children; and c) quality teaching and learning
delivered through six output areas (refer figure 1). The output areas cover a range of activities, including
strategies to build government capacity and to deliver quality education, improve governance, decision-
making, Figure 1: Output Areas
programme
design and
implementation
and increase
engagement of
all stakeholders
to create more
supportive
learning
environments.
The
Programme,
with a total
budget
allocation of USD 50.23 million, is executed in close collaboration with relevant government departments at
the national, state and sub-state levels and implementing partners which include NGOs and CSOs (more
details on the stakeholders involved in the Programme and budgetary allocation can be found under
Coherence and Efficiency in Section 3.5 and 3.4 respectively). The Programme ToC is presented in Annexure
2.1 and a detailed description of the output areas is provided in Annexure 2.2.
For the period of the current Education Programme, a major shift in the overall education programming and
implementation was brought about by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic from early 2020. During this
period, UNICEF assisted the government in adjusting its Education Programme and there was a revision to
the Strategy Note(1) and the introduction of Output 506 (COVID-response) to better align UNICEF activities
with government priorities and adapt and respond to pandemic conditions. This included work on remote
learning solutions, safe reopening of schools, increasing access to digital materials, tools and platforms,
providing necessary psychosocial and emotional support to teachers and increased collaboration with various
line departments to provide convergent services to children.
22
The 2018 Programme also had an increased focus on the inclusion and mainstreaming of children from the
most marginalised communities, and improving the quality of learning through foundational learning, life
skills education and addressing inherent systemic methods of teaching that impede learning.
Geographically, UNICEF India undertakes or supports activities in 17 states and union territories which are
classified across three state typologies based on the “level of development and operating environment”(22).
Further, within each state, UNICEF has at least two demonstration districts.
• High-burden states: The high-burden states include Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,
and West Bengal. These states have the largest burden in terms of infant mortality rate, under-5 mortality
rate, low school attendance and child marriage, among others.
• States with large tribal populations: These include Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Assam. The
proportion of burden on key issues related to children are as high in these states as in high-burden states.
However, these states face additional challenges due to civil strife.
• Transition/ Learning Lab states: These include Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat,
Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. These states are characterised by developed social systems, stronger
governance and institutions and private sector presence.
1.4 Evaluation Purpose and Objectives
The purpose of the evaluation was to generate learnings on implementation modalities – what worked and
how as well as what gaps emerged, if any – in the interventions rolled out under the UNICEF Education
Programme in India between 2018-2021. This evaluation’s strategic recommendations are intended to
inform the upcoming Education Programme 2023–2027. In support of the evaluation purpose, the primary
evaluation objectives were:
• To assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, and sustainability of the UNICEF
interventions at the level of the districts, state, and the country
• To establish the degree of alignment between the needs and contexts ranging from the level of districts
to states/state typologies and the nation
• To document good practices and lessons learnt, and
• To identify bottlenecks and challenges in UNICEF’s approach
1.5 Evaluation Scope
Temporal Scope: The evaluation covers the period from 2018 to 2021.
Thematic Scope: The evaluation assessed the progress of the Education Programme as a whole and covered
the six output areas.
Geographic Scope: The scope of the evaluation was national but with an in-depth focus on sample of seven
states among three state typologies for the purpose of primary data collection (refer to figure 2). The seven
23
states were proposed in the Terms of Reference by Figure 2: List of States Sampled for the Study - Typology Wise
UNICEF. For example, Uttar Pradesh is one of the
larger programming states of UNICEF in terms of
funding and implementation, whereas Bihar has a
unique programming context amongst the high-
burden states. Assam and Odisha bring the context
and setting of civil strife states to the evaluation.
Amongst the transition states, programming in
Tamil Nadu is delivered from a social policy lens,
focusing on secondary education. Programming in
Maharashtra focuses on early childhood education
and quality learning and teaching, as does
programming in Karnataka.
1.6 Evaluation Questions and
Criteria
Evaluation Criteria: The ToR provided a clear mandate for this evaluation to be carried out using the
Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD)(23), namely relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and sustainably excluding impact. In
addition, questions around gender and equity were included to comply with UNICEF policy in all evaluation
criteria. To address equity, we explored the extent to which UNICEF’s Programme addressed the needs of
the various groups of marginalised children and girls. The criteria are elaborated below:
Table 1: Description of the Evaluation Criteria
Criteria Description
The key areas explored under this criterion were the alignment of the Education
Relevance Programme with the global priorities (UNICEF global strategic plan, Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), and core commitment to children), Country Programme,
national and state priorities and the local contexts. We explored the relevance of the
interventions, Programme design ToC, the extent to which issues of equity were
addressed in the Programme design and responsiveness of the Programme to changing
needs (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic).
We explored questions about the intended results achievement, unintended outcomes,
Effectiveness contributing/ hindering factors and lessons learned. We also sought to understand the
effectiveness of the ‘state typology design’ in achieving the results.
We assessed if the UNICEF activities were delivered in a timely manner and if the
Efficiency resources (funds) were efficiently utilised to achieve the results.
We explored the extent to which UNICEF was able to build synergies and coherence with
Coherence the government and other development actors to deliver the educational priorities.
We explored the extent to which the interventions were sustainable and what measures
Sustainability were considered during the design and implementation to ensure sustainability. We also
assessed the challenges to achieving sustainability.
24
Gender and We explored the extent to which UNICEF is mainstreaming gender in the Education
Equity Programme and using gender-disaggregated data and evidence to inform the design and
implementation of the Programme.
Evaluation Questions: The ToR provided 39 evaluation questions which were reviewed, refined and finalised
in consultation with the UNICEF team during the inception phase. The evaluation questions that guided this
evaluation is provided in Figure 3 and a complete evaluation matrix with questions, sub-questions, relevant
indicators, sources of information and analysis method is provided in Annexure 3.
Figure 3: Evaluation Questions
1.6.1 Departure from the Terms of Reference
The ToR provided 39 evaluation questions nested under five criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency,
coherence and sustainability and an additional consideration around cross-cutting issues such as gender and
equity. During the inception stage, the evaluation team highlighted the ‘evaluability assumptions’ by
assessing the evaluation questions around two parameters: ‘Whether the evaluation question is essential or
desirable’ and 'To what extent the evaluation question can be answered'. The assessment was based on the
25
evaluation team’s analysis based on various criteria such as quality and quantity of the available data or
reflects qualitative issues such as bias or lack of clarity regarding certain evaluation questions or to reduce
redundancy in the questions (e.g., similar questions were combined or brought as sub-evaluation questions).
As a result, several modifications were made to the original evaluation questions outlined in the ToR and
Annexure 12 summarises the changes made to the evaluation questions.
On commencement of the data analysis and report writing phase of the evaluation, the following evaluation
questions were combined for the purposes of avoiding duplication of findings and brevity of the overall
reports. As this was finalised post the submission of the inception report, the evaluation matrix was not
revised retrospectively to reflect this change.
• The evaluation sub-questions 1.1.2 (relevance) and evaluation sub-question 2.1.5 (effectiveness) were
combined.
• The evaluation question 1.2 (relevance) and evaluation sub-question 2.1.2 (effectiveness) were
combined.
• Evaluation question 1.3 (relevance) and 2.2 (effectiveness) were combined.
Another significant departure from the inception report was the inability to achieve the proposed sample for
data collection. More details of this are presented in Section 2.7 in chapter 2.
Given the complexity and scale of the evaluation, the report exceeds the suggested length as per the Global
Evaluation Report Oversight System (GEROS) format and as recommended in the ToR. Condensing the
information in the report or executive summary may have led to the loss of pivotal findings and has been
agreed on with the UNICEF ICO.
1.7 Intended Users
The intended audience for the results from this study is primarily UNICEF staff at India Country Office (ICO)
and state level involved in the UNICEF Education Programme and the government partners at the national/
state level. The secondary audience comprises implementing partners at the national/state level, including
Community-Based Organisations (CBOs)/ Civil Society Organisations (CSOs)/ academic institutions and the
private sector. In addition, the evaluation will be of interest to other donors who collaborate with or invest
in UNICEF Education Programme. The learnings from the study will eventually also be developed into a policy
brief, guide areas of improvement, create successful models and develop strategies that can be rolled out
widely in the next cycle.

METHODOLOGY
27
2.1 Evaluation Implementation
The evaluation followed a sequential process comprising of three key phases – inception phase, data
collection phase and analysis and reporting phase. Each phase included activities contributing directly and/or
indirectly to evaluation deliverables, as seen in Figure 4.
Figure 4: Evaluation Implementation Plan
2.2 Evaluation Methods
The technical approach for this evaluation was guided by OECD-DAC criteria(23), United Nations Evaluation
Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards(24), the Ethical Guidelines in Evaluation and the Code of Conduct for
Evaluation(25) in the United Nations system. A theory-based evaluation method that combines Contribution
Analysis and Process Tracing, especially Bayesian updating was employed to assess the effectiveness, clarity,
relevance, and coherence of the ToC. The Contribution Analysis provided the overarching framework to
arrive at credible causal claims about the UNICEF Education Programme’s contribution to output areas, taking
into consideration other factors that may have influenced such outputs. On the other hand, elements of
Process Tracing guided the evaluation team’s decisions about what kinds of evidence to look for, and what
criteria to use to judge the strength of that evidence.
The primary evaluation methods were qualitative, including extensive analysis of the documents, analysis of
the Results Assessment Module (RAM) reports(26), KIIs and FGDs with UNICEF and stakeholders at the
national, state and district levels (refer to Section 2.3).
2.2.1 Reconstruction of Theory of Change
The Education Programme had a specific ToC (refer to Annexure 2.1) that traced the education sector
challenges to potential areas of influence and improvement through UNICEF activities, thereby creating
multiple levels of pathways from outputs to intermediate outcomes to overarching goals of the UNICEF
Programme. As the first step for the evaluation, the team developed an evaluation ToC that laid out the
channels for measurable change that will be assessed as part of this evaluation, while taking stock of the role
of the intervention activities, assumptions (about reach and behaviour change) as well as external factors on
the targeted education outcomes in the UNICEF Programme ToC (Refer to figure 5).
28
Figure 5: Evaluation ToC
2.2.2 Contribution Analysis
Contribution Analysis was employed to assess UNICEF’s contribution by mapping evidence of change against
the behaviour changes, links, and assumptions (causal pathways) in the ToC. As highlighted in Chapter 1, the
ToC for the UNICEF Programme is centered on six output areas; hence, the Contribution Analysis also focuses
on the six output areas. Using the COM-B (Capacity, Opportunity, Motivation- Behavioural Change) approach
(refer to Annexure 4.1), the evaluation team developed output-specific ToC (refer to annexure 4.2) and
detailed contribution claims for each output.
The Contribution Analysis approach Figure 6: Steps involved in Contribution AnalysisToC
involves five steps (refer to figure 6),
including developing a Logic Model
or ToC for intervention and gathering
evidence in order to explore the
intervention’s contribution to
observed outcomes. By verifying the
that the intervention is based on and
taking into consideration other
influencing factors, Contribution
Analysis can provide evidence that
the intervention did or did not make
a difference. Contribution Analysis
provides a helpful and intuitive framework, but not a prescribed set of methods and processes for assessing
a ToC. The steps followed in the Contribution Analysis are expanded in Annexure 4. The contribution claims,
reach, assumptions and behaviour changes underpinning the ToC of each output area are provided in
Annexure 4.3
2.2.3 Contribution Tracing
29
Contribution Tracing is a rigorous quali-quantitative approach that combines Process Tracing and
Contribution Analysis to test the validity of the claims through the process of Bayesian Confidence Updating.
The Bayesian Confidence Updating helps to establish the strength of causal links by assigning probabilities to
causal claims or hypotheses, and formally weighing evidence to update the researchers’ confidence in these
claims being true or false. Contribution Tracing requires the evaluators to develop a specific testable
hypothesis, identify the relevant evidence, refine the hypotheses, code data against the evidence and apply
and interpret the tests.
As Contribution Tracing is a time and resource-intensive exercise, it was proposed that this method be
applied at a granular level, that is, for a single output or outcome using a case study approach with
‘accountability lens’. This approach was applied to an identified causal link in the ToC that is crucial where
UNICEF particularly wants to understand and generate robust evidence of their contribution and learn about
what works, for whom, in what contexts and why in order to inform future education programmes.
For Contribution Tracing, the evaluation team developed two claims exploring UNICEF’s contribution towards
two output areas.
• CLAIM 1: Increased awareness among ICDS Figure 7:Steps involved in Contribution Tracing
officials as a result of UNICEF’s technical
support has led to increased
programming around responsive
parenting
• CLAIM 2: UNICEF Education
Programme’s technical support to
identify and map out-of-school children
has led to strengthened delivery of special training programmes.
The steps followed in the Contribution Tracing are presented in figure 7 and expanded in Annexure 5. Findings
of the Contribution Tracing exercise are presented in Section 4.
2.3 Data Collection Methods and Sampling Strategy
The study employs a mixed-method research design. These include document review, secondary analysis of
the RAM reports, and qualitative primary data collection. The use of multiple methods enabled cross-
referencing, validation and triangulation of information gathered from different sources.
2.3.1 Desk Review and Secondary Data Analysis
A large volume and a comprehensive number of documents were reviewed in this evaluation including the
programme strategy note, Results Assessment Module (RAM) reports, budget reports, publications by
UNICEF including evaluation and assessment reports, policy briefs and other research reports and external
reports and data published by the government. A complete list of documents reviewed is available in the
References section.
2.3.2 Semi-Structured Interviews With Individuals, Groups and Focus Group
Discussions
The key methods employed for the evaluation include KIIs and FGDs.
• Key Informant Interviews: In-depth interviews were conducted with a range of stakeholders at the
national, state and district levels. The list of the participants is available in Annexure 9.
30
• Focus Group Discussion: FGDs were organised at the district level with teachers, master trainers, School
Management Committee (SMC) members and anganwadi workers.
The qualitative data collection was conducted over a period of five weeks from the beginning of October until
the first week of November. To ensure that high quality data could be collected, and the instruments are
relevant, a piloting of the data collection tool was conducted in September 2022.
2.2.2.1 Stakeholder Mapping and Sampling Strategy
Two groups of stakeholders were considered for this evaluation:
• Internal stakeholders: These were UNICEF staff at the national and state level who had been closely
involved in conceptualising, implementing, and monitoring the Programme.
• External stakeholders: UNICEF had worked with a diverse set of stakeholders in the implementation of
the Education Programme. The primary partner was the Government (at the national/ state/district
level) and NGOs and CSOs, either leading or supporting activities at all levels. The secondary
stakeholders for the evaluation study include the school management committee members, principals,
teachers, and the early childhood development (ECD) workers or anganwadi workers and anganwadi
helpers.
The full list of potential key informants was compiled during the stakeholder mapping process, forming the
sampling frame for interviews. The evaluation team sampled approximately 195 stakeholders using a
maximum variation purposive sampling approach for this study that allowed us to speak to a diverse range
of institutions and organisations to construct a holistic understanding of the Programme’s effectiveness and
relevance. The stakeholder mapping exercise also provided us with information on the area and nature of
engagement of the individuals with UNICEF; hence the evaluation team had also considered this as one of
the criteria for the selection of respondents to ensure that the evaluation reflects the breadth of activities
that UNICEF had implemented. We also considered the gender, institutional and hierarchical diversity of the
stakeholders while sampling the respondents for data collection. The sampled list of respondents was
finalised in consultations with the UNICEF team at the national and state level.
By the completion of the evaluation, a total number of 152 individuals were engaged as key informants.
Distribution of the interviews across the various stakeholder types, states and gender is presented in the
Annexure 7.1. In addition, a total of 154 teachers, master trainers, anganwadi workers and SMC members
were engaged through FGDs. A total of 30 FGDs were conducted across six states, and the distribution of the
FGD across states and the composition of the participants is presented in Annexure 7.2.
All consultations were conducted remotely via telephone or video conferencing platforms such as Zoom/
Microsoft Team or Google Meet based on the respondent’s convenience.
2.2.2.2 Instrument
Discussion guides were developed for each stakeholder type at the national, state and district levels, which
contained detailed questions around the evaluation criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence
and sustainability. Additionally, questions were drafted specifically for the two claims that used the
Contribution Tracing approach, administered to a sub-set of the sampled respondents purposively identified
by UNICEF for testing the claims. The main areas of enquiry for the specific stakeholder cohort and the
detailed questionnaire are provided in Annexure 10.
2.4 Data Analysis
All primary and secondary data were subjected to qualitative content analysis. The process for qualitative
analysis involved transcribing the qualitative data, collected through interviews and FGDs, coding of all
qualitative data followed by collating and summarising into categories and themes to answer the evaluation
questions and sub-questions. An iterative process was followed for coding and categorisation to identify
31
emerging patterns. Finally, triangulation of qualitative interview data and other secondary information was
conducted to synthesise the evaluation findings and draw conclusions.
The evaluation team used MAXQDA qualitative analysis software to help systematically extract qualitative
data from the wealth of documentation produced by the UNICEF over the evaluation period and the
interviews/ discussions conducted by the team.
2.5 Ethical Considerations
The evaluation approach was guided by relevant UNICEF’s Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research,
Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis (27), UNICEF-Adapted UNEG Evaluation Reports Standards(24), UNEG
Norms and Standards for Evaluation(28), and UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation(29). The research design,
data collection and informed consent document was reviewed and approved by Sigma Institutional Review
Board (IRB) (Refer to Annexure 11). This ensured proper protocols were in place for informed consent, data
protection and safeguards to protect the rights of participants, among other things. With respect to ethical
approaches to managing evaluation participant data, the evaluation specifically ensured the following:
• Confidentiality: All participants were assured of the confidentiality of any information they share, and
care was taken to protect the participants’ anonymity through the use of anonymised interviewee codes
for each respondent, ensuring that the recordings were uploaded onto the Cloud and not shared over
email, and ensuring that only the evaluation and field team had access to the recordings and transcripts;
• Preventing disclosure of identity: Appropriate measures were put in place to prevent any individual
data from being published or otherwise released in a form that would allow any subject’s identity to be
disclosed or inferred;
• Informed consent: We obtained oral-informed consent from all participants and ensured that
participants have the contact details of the evaluation team to withdraw or change their consent at any
time; and
• Data security: Raw data such as interview transcripts and recordings were stored in a password
protected file system with limited access and be anonymised. Furthermore, the transcriptions and audio
recordings were transferred to Athena’s server through secure means using an encrypted shared drive.
Only team members had access to the folders for the project’s duration.
Furthermore, all the core evaluation team members have completed the UNICEF’s Ethics in Evidence
Generation. Furthermore, all the researchers involved in the data collection underwent training on ethics as
part of the enumerator training.
2.6 Evaluation Management
Quality control was exercised throughout the evaluation process and the evaluation adhered to the quality
of the evaluation process and deliverables as outlined in the UNICEF-Adapted United Nations Evaluation
Group Norms and Standards(28). More specifically, the evaluation team used the following processes:
• Application of Global Evaluation Report Oversight System (GEROS): The evaluation conformed to the
UNICEF global evaluation reports oversight system standards for evaluation.
• Quality of data collection and data analysis: The following activities were undertaken to ensure the
quality of the data collection and data analysis:
o The virtual interviews were recorded (with prior explicit consent). The transcripts were reviewed
against the recordings for quality assurance. Random quality checks of the transcripts were
conducted to review for completeness, language, and other criteria.
o The core team members as well as members from the UNICEF Evidence Unit randomly spot-checked
the researchers’ interviews intermittently. The objective was to provide feedback to the researchers
32
on the interviews, identify additional probe areas and evaluate their performance or need for
additional training.
o Regular debriefing with the researchers were done during data collection.
o The quality of data analysis was supported through triangulation of results from multiple data
sources (that is document review, KIIs disaggregated by stakeholder type and FGD).
• Meetings with the Evaluation Management Team (EMT) and Programme team in UNICEF: Regular
check-ins and meeting were held by the evaluation team with the EMT and Programme team in UNICEF
India Country Office (ICO) on key points to confirm progress and document changes, decisions, and client
feedback during the evaluation. The weekly meetings with the UNICEF Evaluation Manager and Country
Office provided key points for reviews and escalations.
• Peer – Review of all the deliverables: Dr Sudhanshu Joshi and Ms Melanie Punton, who are part of our
technical backstopping team, reviewed our analysis and our key deliverables as part of our quality
control measures.
• Editorial Quality Assurance: Ms Aruna Balajee provided professional copy-editing support so that the
final reports are engaging, well-formatted, and are compliant with UNICEF publication requirements.
2.7 Limitations of the Study
The key limitations and mitigation strategies used for this evaluation is presented in table 2.
Table 2: Limitation and Mitigation Measures
Limitations Mitigation Measures
Methodological Limitations
Subjectivity For the interviews, a positive bias towards UNICEF due to social desirability was a
of qualitative possibility. However, triangulation of data sources and data methods helped mitigate the
data effect of these biases to the best extent possible. The study employed a mixed method
research including primary data collection, and document review that allowed the
evaluation team to triangulate stakeholders’ opinions with secondary information,
wherever available. Furthermore, interviews were conducted across different stakeholder
cohorts (government, implementing partners and others) and levels (national, state and
district) which further strengthened the research rigor. Additionally, interviews were also
conducted with independent sector experts who were not involved in the UNICEF
programming or implementation but had knowledge of the UNICEF work/ interventions.
Recall bias The evaluation focused on a four-year period (2018-2021) which could have resulted in
some information loss on UNICEF’s interventions and nature of support. The evaluation
team included appropriate probes in the instruments based on information from the
document review and the stakeholder mapping exercise to aid respondents’ recall of
activities.
Remote All the interviews and discussions were conducted remotely which could have resulted in
interviews ‘respondent fatigue’ or missing of non-verbal cues by the interviewer. This was addressed
and through use of video conferencing facilities (wherever possible), interviewing to saturation
consultations and triangulating information from various sources. Additionally, interviews with UNICEF
staff were conducted in multiple rounds given the length of the questionnaire and to avoid
fatigue in responses.
Lack of To overcome this methodological challenge, we proposed to use Contribution Tracing
transparency where the evaluators transparently assign probabilities to causal claims and weigh new
in assessing evidence to update the evaluators’ confidence in these claims. The original and updated
the strength probability values that is, the strength of evidence, were verified with a small set of key
of evidence stakeholders. The evaluation team worked with UNICEF India to identify the key
that lead to stakeholders and verify the contribution claims through a workshop.

Challenges in Data Collection
Respondent The evaluation team worked with UNICEF to generate a comprehensive list of stakeholders
selection bias in each of the state. The evaluation team then sampled the respondents to ensure diversity
in intervention/output areas and gender, to the best extent possible.
Timelines The time period for the data collection coincided with two key holidays in India – Dussehra
and and Diwali. Consequently, the evaluation team had limited timeframe to follow up with
compressed relevant stakeholders and some of the key stakeholders were unresponsive or could not
data be reached. This limitation was managed during the data collection phase by involving
collection stakeholders from the secondary ‘reserve’ list or by working with the state teams for
phase appropriate replacements.
Inability to Due to the compressed timelines and logistical challenges in scheduling interviews with the
achieve the key stakeholders, all the planned interviews and discussions could not be achieved.
proposed In Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Assam, we achieved only 80%, 28% and 93%, respectively of
sample the proposed sample. Regarding FGDs, we only achieved 65% of the proposed sample.
The evaluation team, in consultations with the UNICEF ICO and field offices, developed a
priority list and targeted those stakeholders during the last week of data collection. As the
evaluation team was able to conduct interviews with a diverse group and triangulate
information through document review, it was agreed that the current sample size was
adequate to answer the evaluation questions.
Sampling Although the evaluation team had developed a clear sampling strategy for the evaluation,
difficulties it was not always possible to follow this plan to interview our selected respondents. For
instances, the number of respondents nominated for the data collection at the national
and state levels was lower than the sample size proposed by the evaluation team. The
original sampling strategy included interviewing UNICEF’s implementing partners at the
district level. However, certain states, such as Assam engaged implementing partners only
at the state-level and not at the district-level. In many instances, the information provided
as part of the stakeholder mapping was either incorrect or outdated, and the stakeholder
diversity, as originally envisioned, could not be achieved. The evaluation team was flexible
and adaptive, implementing alternative strategies to ensure that the evaluation could be
conducted properly. For instance, the evaluation team tried to increase the number of
government respondents interviewed at the district level to get adequate sub-state
representation and insights.
Gender Our original approach was to purposively sample principals, teachers and SMC workers who
balance in are women or belong to specific marginalised communities, for the FGDs from the list of
the FGDs stakeholders provided by UNICEF. However, given UNICEFs limited role in directly engaging
with the teachers, AWW, SMC members, master trainers etc., generating a comprehensive
list was a challenge. Hence, a convenience sampling approach was used by the evaluation
team, and we had to rely on UNICEF’s government and implementing partners to facilitate
and organise these FGDs.
Turnover There were administrative and bureaucratic shuffles and reshuffles, where government
officials were moved from one department to another. There were also changes within
UNICEF, with staff being relocated or reassigned to another state or to the ICO. This risk
was mitigated by including those external stakeholders who held previous positions or
sampling those who had been in the position for extended periods. For UNICEF staff, small
group discussions were conducted where the former staff was invited to the meeting to
contribute towards the discussion.

3.1 Overview
This chapter summarises key evaluation findings and the analysis of evaluation questions. The description
has been structured around five evaluation criteria and 12 key evaluation questions. For each evaluation
criteria, a detailed analysis is presented under the key evaluation questions. Where appropriate, the narrative
has been merged due to overlap between questions. Additionally, the findings from the Contribution Analysis
centred around the six output areas is presented under the OECD DAC criteria of effectiveness.
3.2 Relevance
This section is to assess the alignment of the Education Programme to the existing global, national and state
priorities and policies of India in education and the extent to which the programming context addresses the
unique context of the state typologies and local context. It also examines the relevance of the programming
in addressing the needs of marginalised and vulnerable children.
EQ 1.1 How aligned is UNICEF’s Education Programme with evolving global
(UNICEF global strategic plan, SDGs, and core commitments to children) and
national priorities (Samagra Shiksha, NIPUN Bharat, NEP 2020, RTE, etc)?
Evaluation Finding: The Education Programme is closely aligned with global priorities and national plans
and policies. The evaluation noted UNICEF’s contribution to shaping national policies such as the NEP 2020
and identified mechanisms through which it ensures relevance and appropriateness of work, including a
process of co-creation with government stakeholders, situational analysis to informing programming areas
and mid-term review. The Programme was able to respond appropriately to changes in the operating
environment such as COVID-19 and introduction of NEP 2020 through rapid assessments and the MSTR.
External stakeholders reported that UNICEF could have better leveraged its global experience on education
in emergencies during the pandemic and highlighted a few areas where its role can be further
strengthened such as adolescent and secondary education.
A. Alignment with UNICEF’s Strategic Plans and Global Priorities
The UNICEF Education Programme was aligned with the goals and targets of other relevant global
initiatives. UNICEF India’s Country Education Programme (2018-21) is relevant to the priorities in the
strategic plan in terms of its core commitment to children, considering the needs of the most vulnerable and
marginalised, focusing on gender and equity, and responding to changing needs in education in light of the
COVID-19 pandemic. An overview of how the change strategies relate to the activities and goals of the
Education Programme in India is described in table 3.

Additionally, the Education Country Programme is aligned with other priorities of UNICEF in education and
with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Some examples of the activities under the current
Education Programme that contribute to the goals of other UNICEF initiatives are evidenced in table 4. The
Programme contributes to global and national progress towards SDG 4 on ‘inclusive and equitable quality
education and lifelong learning for all’, with a more direct relationship with sub-targets 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.6, 4.a,
4.c on achieving free primary and secondary education for all, ensuring boys and girls can access quality early
childhood care and education (ECCE), enhancing equity and gender parity, focusing on foundational literacy
and numeracy (FLN), prioritising children with disabilities and special needs, and improving the quality of
teachers. Through its overall focus on girls, the Programme also aligns with the goals of SDG 5 on gender
equality.

B. Alignment with National and State Policies and Priorities
National development priorities have considerably informed the Education Programme development for
2018-2022. The evaluation found that the Education Programme is aligned with national policies and
programmes such as NEP, NIPUN Bharat (Mission on FLN) and the ECCE Policy. External stakeholders at the
national and state levels attested to the relevance and alignment of UNICEF-supported activities with the key
policy changes and initiatives. Table 5 maps the Programme’s output areas with the aims of various national
policies and provides confirmation of this alignment.

The evaluation found that UNICEF ensures the relevance of activities it undertakes through a process of
co-creation with relevant stakeholders while developing annual workplans. UNICEF’s internal respondents
confirmed that consultations were held with the relevant departments annually to reach mutual agreement
of Programme activities for the upcoming years. Government partners at the national and state-level
corroborated this claim and reported substantial efforts by the UNICEF ICO and state staff to understand
government priorities and develop contextually appropriate programmes. In addition to consultations with
stakeholders, UNICEF also established the relevance of its activities through situational analyses and
secondary research. For example, a review of the country and state-specific strategy notes for education
reveals that a detailed situational analysis was conducted prior to the start of the current Programme cycle,
which helped to establish baseline and identify priority areas to shape the programming at the country level.
38
Furthermore, UNICEF’s work has been integral to shaping relevant national/ state policies in education
during the evaluation period. Select examples of key policies to which UNICEF has contributed are listed in
below.
• National Education Policy (NEP 2020) – UNICEF played a leading role in advising the government on NEP
2020 strategies through participation in consultations and helped states in adapting to NEP 2020
priorities.
• National Curriculum Framework (NCF) and support to states – Consulted with government at national
level to provide inputs on curriculum for NCF-FLN 2022. Prior to the NCF FLN 2022, through the Country
Programme, UNICEF has also been assisting states in designing curriculum to align with national
educational priorities. For instance, UNICEF supported Bihar government on integrating updated ECCE
curriculum into the ICDS system.
• NIPUN Bharat – Provided inputs on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy at the national level, created
forums in states convening NGOs/CSOs and assisted states in implementing FLN mission aligned with
NEP 2020 priorities.
• Child Safety Policy in Karnataka – UNICEF developed the framework for Child Safety in Educational
Institutions and conducted policy advocacy to include it in the State Education Rules
• Bodo Land in Assam – MoU between UNICEF and Bodo Land Territorial Council for developing special
education policy for the area, due to its unique autonomous nature.
• NEP 2020 and COVID-19 strategy in Tamil Nadu: UNICEF participated in two government committees to
advise the state on how to implement NEP 2020 in Tamil Nadu and identified priority areas and
interventions for the COVID-19 education strategy.
• Odisha ECCE Policy – UNICEF is a member of the state committee on ECCE and has provided technical
support to the government leading to redrafting of the ECCE policy. UNICEF has advocated for school
entry age to be changed from 5 years to 6 years

Implementing partners and independent experts also noted t hat UNICEF should work in niche areas, rather
than working on areas that are either considered ‘low-hanging fruits’ or currently overrun by other
development actors. The Education Programme Strategy Note echoes this call by partners, reporting the
need for ‘adopting greater focus and prioritisation in programming’.
C. Missing Areas of Interventions
While the overall feedback on the relevance of its activities was positive, UNICEF’s internal stakeholders
noted specific instances of misalignment between its priorities and that of the government, resulting in
non-achievement of intended results and activities. For example, in Tamil Nadu the government focus was
on strengthening primary education which meant continuous dialogue had to take place to improve the
quality of secondary education. Further, the lack of a culture of a transparency was reported to inhibit

programmes, which might add to relevance of activities
prioritised in workplans.
Stakeholders also highlighted specific areas in which UNICEF should expand programming, such as vocational
training and life skills. Government stakeholders who are in the process of adopting NEP 2020 felt that
UNICEF could offer greater support on vocational training in secondary education for students of classes 9-
11. Master trainers for life skills and state-level government stakeholders were of the opinion that emphasis
on life skills would benefit classroom teaching by enhancing students’ self-esteem and countering gender
stereotypes. Additionally, some external stakeholders felt that the Programme could benefit from increased
programming on menstrual hygiene awareness for adolescent girls.
D. Adapting the Education Programme to Evolving Priorities
External stakeholders at the national and state-levels acknowledged UNICEF support in adapting and
responding to changes in the environment, such as the introduction of NEP 2020 and COVID-19 disruptions
to schooling. UNICEF’s COVID responses were informed by a range of rapid assessments and analyses such
as how many students were receiving access to remote learning, which resources were most used and
helpful, and what more teachers and parents were looking for with respect to remote learning thereby
enhancing its relevance. UNICEF-supported activities as part of its response to the pandemic are further
detailed in Section 3.3 under Contribution Claim 6 (EQ 2.1). Implementing partners attested to UNICEF
support in adapting existing programmes for digital environments or devising strategies to address delays in
timelines due to COVID-19. New areas of programming, such as emotional well-being and mental health
initiatives were introduced after the Mid-Term Strategic Reflection (MTSR) as a result of the pandemic. The
MTSR(2) also details how changes were made to programming due to the introduction of NEP. UNICEF
adapted the programming to support multi-lingual mother tongue learning in tribal areas, to align with the
NEP 2020. To adapt to the focus on pre-primary education in NEP 2020, UNICEF worked with different
government ministries and departments to coordinate efforts on delivery of ECCE strategies, and to devise
unified state strategies. To reflect the priority on digital learning in NEP 2020, UNICEF provided support for
remote and digital learning to state governments through training on virtual classrooms for teachers during
the pandemic, creation of digital resources and development of remote learner management systems.
Further evidence of UNICEF-supported activities during the pandemic and its effectiveness can be found in
Section 3.3.
Whilst many stakeholders expressed satisfaction with UNICEF’s support during the COVID-19 crisis and their
prompt involvement, some of the external stakeholders consulted during the evaluation suggested that
UNICEF could have played a more meaningful role in school reopening because of their role as a global leader
and their cross-country exposure to working in emergencies. They felt this comparative advantage of UNICEF
in education in emergencies could have been leveraged more effectively.
EQ 1.2 How relevant is the UNICEF Programme and its interventions to the
specific context of state typologies and local contexts?
For a more comprehensive response, the evaluation team have presented the response for EQ 1.2 as well as
sub-evaluation questions on the effectiveness of differential targeting under 2.1.2 here.
40
Evaluation Finding: Programming in different states was relevant to addressing the contextual needs of
the states. Evaluation noted a clear focus on out-of-school children in high burden and tribal typologies of
states and improved learning outcomes in transition states. However, the evaluation findings show that
the typology approach is not effective due to challenges in implementation such as a reported lack of
nuanced understanding among state offices on how to implement the approach. UNICEF staff at the state
level could not comment on how the differential approaches have led to achievement of results since they
did not have clarity on activities or implementation modalities in other states. Documentary analysis do
not show differences in the mechanism through which activities were executed and rather noted
similarities in the approach.
A. Relevance of the Typology-Based Approach to Programming
The evaluation found evidence of the relevance of differential targeting based on state typologies.
UNICEF’s programming approach based on the status of key indicators related to education and contextual
barriers has led to different activities being accorded different priorities in the three state typologies, as
described below.
High-burden states include those with poor learning and schooling levels, such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh,
from the states selected for the evaluation. Evidence from the RAM reports confirm that these states worked
in all three priority areas (early childhood education; out-of-school children; and quality learning and
teaching), as intended. In addition, there is an increased focus on reducing school dropouts and absenteeism
and ensuring that children transition from the primary to secondary education level. Correspondingly,
UNICEF assisted the state government in Bihar to develop targeted initiatives aimed at increasing enrollment
among children of the Musahar community while Uttar Pradesh focused on integration and reduced
dropouts among children with special needs in the state. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar also reported the
development and establishment of digital monitoring systems to identify and track out-of-school children to
ensure retention and transition of those at risk of dropping out. Additionally, internal stakeholders of UNICEF
also highlighted a number of community-level interventions and more handholding or ‘down-stream’ work
in these states, as envisioned.
Tribal states are defined by their ethnic and linguistic diversity and varying topography that affects the access
to education. In Odisha, internal and external stakeholders reported specific interventions such as the School
Sanjog programme to reach children from the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTG) and focus on
other geographical locations occupied by vulnerable communities, within UNICEF programming. In Assam,
UNICEF activities focused on children living in tea gardens and in other tribal-dominated areas such as Bodo
and Pokhrajhal, Joharahat, Gulpara and Rawa. Additionally, external and internal stakeholders in Assam
reported programming related to education in emergencies, given its high susceptibility to natural disasters.
A significant initiative noticed in these states is the promotion of mother tongue-based learning and
translation of resources used in ECE and quality learning interventions into non-dominant state languages.
Transition states selected for the evaluation such as Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu have relatively
better schooling outcomes, with a lower proportion of out-of-school children. UNICEF engagements in these
states were found to take on more of a policy and advocacy role and focused on ‘upstream work’ focusing
on government systems. In Maharashtra, UNICEF supported the strengthening of educational institutions
through the KPALP programme whereas in Karnataka, UNICEF’s support to the Nalli Kali programme is
primarily delivered through the state Samagra Shiksha mechanisms. Tamil Nadu, with its unique social
protection approach to programming, focused on adolescent responsive schooling and provided technical
assistance during the pandemic to ensure the social and emotional well-being of adolescents. Stakeholders
highlighted lower levels of direct engagement at the district and community levels in these states.
41
B. Effectiveness of the Typology-Based Approach to Programming
The evaluation team could not distil the effectiveness of differential targeting since there was no common
ToC or monitoring system to track overall progress. Internal stakeholders raised concerns on whether the
approach was as ‘differential’ as envisaged and highlighted several overlapping areas of work between the
three typologies. For instance, UNICEF worked with implementing partners in Maharashtra to establish the
causes of high dropouts and improve learning outcomes among vulnerable and tribal groups in the state,
similar to initiatives found in the high-burden typology of states.
Based on secondary information available in RAM reports, the evaluation team did not find substantial
differences in the mechanisms through which different activities were implemented, as was intended with
the typology approach. For example, both Uttar Pradesh (high-burden state) and Maharashtra (transition
state) reported programmes (TELOS and KPALP correspondingly) to enhance learning outcomes through
institutional strengthening and capacity building. Similarly, Assam (tribal state) and Maharashtra (transition
state) witnessed demonstration-based programmes (Learning Enhancement Programme and Level-based
Learning Programme) to improve foundational skills. Further, in high-burden, tribal and transition states like
Bihar, Assam and Tamil Nadu respectively, UNICEF provided technical support to the relevant government
departments in developing disaggregated data profiles based on UDISE data for evidence-based planning.
However, this could not be verified through interviews since UNICEF staff at the state level did not have much
visibility on the execution or achievement of relevant areas in other states.
Additionally, internal stakeholders highlighted that while the approach was well-designed with a strong
rationale, several challenges hampered its execution on-ground as intended. Most notably, UNICEF staff
members at the state level reflected that the allocation of resources and prioritisation of work to be
undertaken are influenced by its state typology. This restricts programming in certain areas, even when
relevant. For example, transition states have geographical pockets with high concentration of out-of-school
children but exclusion of Output 503 (Education for out-of-school girls and boys) from its prioritised area of
work implies that these states cannot undertake interventions to address this issue. Additionally, internal
stakeholders from transition states highlighted that the inability to take on field interventions due to resource
constraints limit their ability to demonstrate innovative programmes and influence policy and planning.
State-level internal stakeholders across the three typologies reported that UNICEF extended support to
governments on ad hoc requests, which are sometimes outside the scope of work permitted by the state
typology approach implying that on-ground implementation is not as rigid as planned. Respondents also
reported that there were limited opportunities to exchange knowledge and resource or share best practices,
either within or across state typologies. At the national level, UNICEF staff believed that the execution of the
approach was hampered by the lack of nuanced understanding and appreciation of state typologies among
state UNICEF offices and relevant external stakeholders such as government departments and implementing
partners.
EQ 1.3 How relevant is UNICEF’s Programme in addressing inherent equity
gaps – taking into consideration the disparities regarding caste, residence,
gender, religion, disability, and wealth?
To avoid duplication and overlap and for a more comprehensive response, the evaluators have merged the
above question with the evaluation question 2.2.
Evaluation Finding: The Education Programme addressed relevant gender and equity concerns in different
states, primarily through focusing interventions in areas with higher concentrations of marginalised and
vulnerable communities. The evaluation noted that while the Programme was gender-sensitive, very few
instances of gender-transformative programming to address structural barriers were found. In
comparison, equity considerations were more carefully integrated into programming through activities
such as translation of resources into non-dominant languages and flexible learning initiatives to reach out-
42
of-school children from marginalised and hard-to-reach areas, especially in the high burden and tribal
typologies of states.
A. Relevance of UNICEFs Programme in addressing equity and gender gaps
Documentary review and external stakeholder interviews attest to the relevance of programmes and
specific programme components in addressing gender and equity gaps in education. Integration of equity
dimensions in the current Programme cycle is guided by the vision that ’Every Child Learns,’ as set out in the
Education Programme Strategy Note. In addition, the note refers specifically to improved UNICEF efforts to
promote inclusive education by ’focussing particularly on children excluded based on gender, children with
disabilities, the poorest, ethnic and linguistic minorities and children affected by emergencies.’ Documents
arising out of the Strategy Note, such as the Country Programme Action Plan and state-specific strategy notes
for education also reflect this focus.
National and state-level external stakeholder interviews provide further confirmation of the relevance of
UNICEF’s activities in this regard. Respondents reported that UNICEF’s focus districts for programming
usually have a concentration of marginalised and vulnerable communities, and that the interventions are
aligned with the needs of the community. For example, UNICEF works closely with the tea garden
associations in Assam to deliver education services to children in difficult to access areas. Similarly, a large
proportion of out-of-school children from the Muslim community in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have been
integrated into flexible education through UNICEF- education in madrasas.
B. Effectiveness of UNICEFs Programme in addressing equity and gender gaps
While there was evidence of the relevance of activities aimed at promoting inclusive education, the
evaluation found mixed evidence of the effectiveness of activities aimed at ensuring gender equity in
education. Analysis of indicators from RAM indicate that activities with gender and equity components are
well ‘on-track’ to be achieved within the Programme period (Refer Annexure 8.2 for the detailed RAM
analysis). While these indicators were found across all output areas, most were concentrated within Output
503 (Education for out-of-school girls and boys) and Output 505 (Demand for quality education). Further,
stakeholder interviews highlighted examples of UNICEF-supported activities to address gender barriers to
education (such as early marriage) and empower girls, such as revitalisation of Meena Manches in Uttar
Pradesh and development of Kishori calendars in Odisha. RAM data suggests that UNICEF provided technical
assistance to state governments in the collection, analysis and use of gender-disaggregated data and
differential planning based on the same. High-burden states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar reported focus
on identification and mainstreaming of out-of-school girls, especially in areas with poor enrolment such as
Devipatan in Uttar Pradesh. Implementing partners and community-level stakeholders interviewed in these
states also provided testimonial evidence on the effectiveness of programmes on financial literacy for girls
and SBCC strategies for improvement of attendance among girls.
However, while some interventions integrated gender transformative components, such as the clearly
defined role of men in the Vatsalya and Ghare Ghare Arunima Responsive Parenting Programme in Odisha,
most activities did not display systemic efforts to address structural barriers. For example, the RAM
presents the number of participants trained as part of various capacity-building activities, disaggregated by
gender. While this is gender sensitive, it is unclear whether UNICEF orchestrated clear plans and initiatives
to ensure gender representation in trainings. A handful of external stakeholders reflected on the same and
highlighted the need for a gender-transformative approach to education programming.
On the other hand, the evaluation found instances of careful integration of equity considerations in
programming, including translation of resources into non-dominant languages, promotion of mother tongue-
based learning, flexible learning programmes targeted at integration of out-of-school children from specific
43
communities and programming aimed at children with disabilities (in specific states). A few examples,
collated from RAM reports and stakeholder interviews, is detailed in Table 6.
Table 6: Select Examples of Equity Considerations in Education Programme
Uttar • In Uttar Pradesh, UNICEF supported the development of the SAMARTH intervention for
Pradesh children with special needs, including establishment of a social model to screen children
with disabilities in schools and development and distribution of accessible worksheets on
language and mathematics.
• UNICEF assisted the development of a framework on disability-inclusive education with
a five-year roadmap to promote inclusive schools.
Bihar • UNICEF supported targeted interventions, such as special training programmes, for the
Musahar community in the state. Community volunteers were trained to monitor school
attendance and ensure retention and transition among school-going children.
• UNICEF provided technical assistance in revising the curriculum of madrasas in the state
and developing new textbooks and workbooks in line with the revised curriculum. It also
extended support to maulavis and madrasas during the pandemic to ensure continued
learning through digital platforms.
Assam • UNICEF supported Samagra Shiksha in differential planning, as a result of which the state
plan for education reflected the needs of various social groups covering 13 minority-
concentrated districts, two schedule tribe dominated districts, seven aspirational districts
and 13 tea garden districts.
• UNICEF supported a community radio programme to raise awareness on COVID-
appropriate behaviour during the pandemic. The programme was translated into Shadari,
the dialect used by tribal communities residing in tea gardens.
Odisha • UNICEF, in collaboration with SCERT and District Institute of Education and Training
(DIETs) in the state, supported the remedial learning programmes in tribal-dominated
districts to ensure retention and transition of children.
• Workbooks and activities developed under the Ghare Ghare Arunima responsive
parenting programme was translated into multiple tribal language by the Academy of
Tribal Languages and Culture with support from UNICEF.
Mahara • UNICEF supported evidence generation to determine socio-economic causes of high
shtra dropout rates among children from tribal communities. The evidence generated was
used to develop a SBCC strategy to address transition from elementary to secondary
education.
• UNICEF provided technical assistance in undertaking an equity-based review of state
textbooks in Marathi, Math, English, Science, and Social Science from grades 1 to 10
Tamil • UNICEF supported the development of contextual adolescent responsive school plans
Nadu based on three typologies of geographies within the state- coastal, tribal, and hilly areas.
Despite the effectiveness of these specific programmes or components, equity considerations within
general education programming at the national and state levels need to be further strengthened. Internal
and external stakeholders across states highlighted the need for more programmes and initiatives focused
on children with special needs, urban poor, and migrant children. State-specific gaps in targeting were also
noted by respondents within and outside UNICEF: in Maharashtra, there was an expressed need to focus on
tribal communities; whereas in Tamil Nadu, programming in schools with higher concentration of Scheduled
Tribe population was highlighted as a gap.
3.3 Effectiveness
This section assesses the effectiveness of the Programme or the extent to which the Programme has achieved
or is likely to achieve its intended results and evaluates the contribution of UNICEF. The description of the
44
results are organised according to the six output areas as described in the Programme ToC. UNICEF’s
contributions towards key outcomes were assessed through Contribution Analysis. Each of the output area
was developed into a corresponding contribution claim. For each claim, the evaluation team developed a
causal pathway (Annexure 4.2) which outlines how the intervention is thought to have contributed to a
specific change. Key activities under each of the output areas were first identified based on financial
expenditure and further validated and revised with the Education Programme team. Related changes in
opportunities (such as trainings) resulting due to the activities, and the reach of these opportunities were
then established. Finally, changes in behaviour resulting from improved opportunities and motivation were
mapped.
The findings from the Contribution Analysis are structured along activities, reach and behavioural change
related to each contribution claim. We have used the terms ‘strong’, ‘mixed’ or ‘moderate’ and ‘weak’ to
signify the strength of evidence supporting the argument. A description of the qualifiers is provided below:
• Strong: Strong has been used throughout the report in instances where we have triangulated the
information from various stakeholder cohorts across levels and from different states.
• Moderate/ mixed: These have been used in instances where the information has been triangulated
from relatively fewer sources or have relevance in only one state typology.
• Weak: Weak to denote the strength of evidence has been used in instances where the information
primarily relies on a single or limited source of evidence.
EQ 2.1 To what extent was UNICEF effective in achieving its planned outputs,
both at national and at state levels, in the three priority areas of work?
Evaluation Finding: Analysis of indicators presented in the RAM show that UNICEF is ‘on track’ to achieve
most of its intended targets and results under all output areas, with the exception of Output 502 (ECE).
Achievement of results under this output areas was reported to be ‘constrained’ due to the pandemic.
However, the analysis does not clearly present the effects of the pandemic on the progress of the
Programme since it did not consider the indicators that were deactivated or discontinued due to COVID-
19 or considers the revised targets, wherever applicable.
A. Achievement of Results
To answer this evaluation question, the evaluation team examined data from UNICEF’s Results Assessment
Module (RAM) to understand the progress of planned outputs against set targets. Extent of achievement of
results were measured by analysing self-reported ratings provided against individual indicators. The
description of ratings, as provided in the RAM(26), is provided below.
• On Track – The target is equal or more than the annual target.
• Constrained – Progress update is less than the annual target.
• No Progress- No data as the indicator did not have an annual target.
• Not reported – Non availability of data for reporting

period with improvement over
time as well. However, some Source: RAM Data
indicators recorded no visible progress1 between 2018-2020 but were reported in 2021. Overall, the
reporting increased in 2021, from only 12 indicators of 21 (57%) being reported in the first three years to 19
of 21 indicators (90%) reported in 2021. Progress on achievement of results under each output area is
detailed below.
Disaggregated analysis shows that the Programme is on track to meet its targets under output area 501
(Policy and planning for equitable quality education). Two out of three indicators were self-reported as
‘constrained’ in 2021, but a closer review indicates that they are close to their respective annual targets for
that year. The Programme has also surpassed its targets for the indicator on number of states that reported
having a differential education plan for equitable access and learning. Specifically, nearly all of the states
selected for this evaluation were reported to be on ‘on track’ to achieve targets for all the three indicators.
However, Karnataka reported ‘constrained’ achievement on having a differential education plan for equitable
access and learning, whereas Uttar Pradesh indicated ‘constrained’ achievement on implementing a
comprehensive school safety programme, which was reported to be delayed due to covid.
The achievement of the targets under output area 502 (ECE) was mixed, and there was no clear trend of
improvement over the evaluation period. From the qualitative analysis of the progress update described in
the RAM documents, COVID-19 constrained the progress on the indicators, evidenced by the partial non-
reporting during 2020 and limited time to reinitiate activities in 2021. However, the Programme again
surpassed the targets for two of its indicators: the percentage of frontline workers trained in counselling
parents and the number of states that have developed mother tongue-based early childhood education
packages. Similar to the national picture, all of the selected evaluation states reported ‘constrained’
achievement related to running of ECE centres and implementing quality ECE programmes.
The Programme reported being ‘on track’ to achieve targets for all the indicators under output area 503
(Education for out-of-school girls and boys). The indicators were consistently on track throughout the
reporting period, and the number of out-of-school children accessing elementary education surpassed the
targets, reaching nearly twice the estimated achievement up until 2021. There were also more states, than
planned, responding to the strategies to improve access for disadvantaged children at scale and in a
sustainable manner. Of the four sampled states where this output area was implemented, all but one
reported that they were on track to meet the relevant targets. Odisha reported indicators with no progress
or those that were constrained. Review of the qualitative comments around the indicator on out-of-school
children indicate challenges around Covid-led school closures which affected the data collection.
The Programme reported being ‘on track’ for most of the indicators under output area 504 (Quality
education and learning). Two indicators were reported as being ‘constrained’. We also observed that the
Programme exceeded its targets against indicators related to implementation and innovation. However, the
Programme fell significantly short on the indicator related to the number of adolescent students receiving
1 ‘No Progress’ implies that there was no visible reporting or assigned annual targets for the given years, indicating
that no action was taken. ‘Not Reported’ simply means that the data is missing.
46
life skills training – only 8% of the target was achieved. At the state level, a majority of the indicators have
been reported to be ‘on track’, but there are a few that were ‘constrained’ as well. The main reasons cited
across multiple indicators was COVID-19 and associated school closures.
The Programme was ‘on track’ to meet most of its targets under output area 505 (Demand for quality
education). For two out of three indicators on the number of states reporting gender responsive strategies;
and implementing social and behaviour change communication strategies supporting back to school and age-
appropriate learning at home, the Programme has exceeded its targets.
Overall, the Programme was ‘on track’ to meet the targets under the output area 506 (COVID-response).
However, as the output was introduced in 2020, there were data gaps which made it difficult to ascertain the
progress of the indicators.
Annexure 8.1 presents output-wise indicator performance against the latest targets.
IMPACT OF COVID-19 on the Achievement of Results
In the RAM reports, the master list of indicators also included indicators which were tagged as
‘Deactivated’. Based on consultations with the UNICEF staff and review of the updated national monitoring
matrix (2021), the deactivated indicators were excluded from the analysis. The list of deactivated
indicators is presented below. There were five indicators that were omitted from the analysis, given that
they were not included in the final results matrix from UNICEF, just under 20% of the overall 26 indicators.
These were from output areas 501 (Policy and planning for quality education- 2), 504 (Quality education
and learning- 1) and 505 (Demand for quality education-2). The exact indicators are detailed below.
• Output 501: % of increase in government allocation (50,000 Cr) for elementary education (of total
education budget.
• Output 501: Number of states that have a disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategy and implemented with
robust monitoring mechanism within the Education Sector Plan.
• Output 504: Number of states that have effectively used learning assessment data for teacher
professional development, curriculum reviews, pedagogical practices, and development of learning
resource material.
• Output 505: Number of states with resourced gender specific strategies in education departments’
plans to create demand for elementary education.
• Output 505: Number of states implementing evidence-based communication, community
engagement and community mobilization through partnerships to promote and incentivize school
participation, learning and retention, including social protection measures, cash transfers and
scholarships/stipends.
Furthermore, the evaluation team noted that some of the indicators in each output area were slightly
altered (in framing, measurement type, etc.) and presented as new indicators in 2021. However, in order
to analyse the progress over time, these were grouped with their previous iterations.
In terms of analysing the achievement of results, the relevant targets were taken from the RAM reports
and triangulated with the Monitoring Plan document, 2021. We observed that nearly all of the indicators
had targets revised downwards for the years affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. While many remained
‘on track’ due to this revision, some were still unable to reach even those levels. There were also indicators
that were not discontinued but did not report data in 2021. Consultations with Programme team indicated
that the non-reporting of data was due to the impact of the pandemic. Hence, the evaluation team
assessed the achievements based on the 2020 achievement levels and targets.
Qualitative analysis of the descriptions reporting progress and achievements provided in the RAM reports
highlight that COVID-19 is cited as a reason for delay or change of direction in all of the output areas. This
is largely on account of the closure of the platform of service delivery, namely, schools and anganwadi
centres. For example, the implementation of the DRR strategy within the Education Sector Plan (one of
47
the deactivated indicators) was cited to be delayed because of the pandemic in Uttar Pradesh in 2021.
However, we observed that UNICEF was able to modify the programme activities and shift to online
mediums to continue delivery in some form and thereby achieve its targets. For example, under output
area 504 (Quality education and learning), UNICEF effectively adjusted its technical support across states
in completion of planned activities and in ‘continuity of learning’ , leading to implementation of remote
learning programmes in seventeen states, reaching 57.5 million students (28.4 million girls). Across states,
UNICEF trained teachers on digital platforms and tools and established a Learning Management System to
support self-learning and blended training programmes reaching 125,000 users. Under Output 505
(Demand for quality education), school closures compelled use of traditional, online and mass media
platforms for social and behaviour change and continued learning. UNICEF’s advocacy made online
learning programmes available on Direct-to-Home (DTH), national and state Doordarshan channels,
cumulatively reaching 67 million people. Meena radio programme, on enhancing life skills, broadcast in
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir reached more than 30 million
parents and children cumulatively.
B. Establishment of UNICEF’s Contribution Across the Output Areas
Contribution Claim 1: How and to what extent has the UNICEF Education Programme contributed to increasing
the capacity of the policymakers and functionaries in the national and state governments to use data and
evidence for implementing and monitoring education policy and programming in the three typologies of
states?
Summary of Contribution: The evaluation noted strong evidence of UNICEF’s support towards
strengthening of data systems and institutional capacity to use data in planning and programming. The
trainings devised as part of these activities had a wide reach and provided relevant government officials
with the opportunities to improve their knowledge and use of data. This has resulted in increased
evidence-based planning. Evidence also suggests that UNICEF provided significant support towards
operationalization of NEP and Samagra Shiksha guidelines. However, the evidence on planning and
execution of DRR activities is mixed and varied depending on the state.
A. Activities
Document review and external stakeholder interviews present strong evidence of UNICEF’s technical
support under output 501 (Policy and planning for equitable quality education), at an aggregate level. Key
activities under this output area include facilitation of evidence-based planning and programming,
operationalization of NEP guidelines and recommendations, development and roll out of school safety
programmes, establishment of DRR guidelines and implementation of National Assessment Survey (NAS)
and post-NAS activities. However, the evaluation found varied degrees of evidence across the states to
support these key change activities.
Evidence on UNICEF support for strengthening data
“With UNICEF support, we developed
systems, using data for planning and programming, and Prashikshak portal at SCERT to ensure
conducting various student assessments and NAS activities real-time data management which helped

interviews with government stakeholders and RAM results
capture UNICEF assistance in analysing UDISE+ data for KII Respondent
capturing indicators pertaining to the Performance Grading
Index (PGI), administered by the Ministry of Education. Some states also highlighted specific interventions
under the realm of evidence-based planning. In Bihar, real-time monitoring of data from the BEST (Bihar Easy
48
School Tracking) mobile app has been decentralised to the block level by establishing Block Educational Data
Management Centres (BEDMCs) with UNICEF support. In Maharashtra, UNICEF provided technical assistance
for a rapid assessment survey to understand the reach and uptake of home learning packages. Guidelines for
enumerators on how to reach teachers and parents and resources such as Excel Sheet and Google Form
templates for data collection and data analysis were provided by UNICEF.
Evidence from external interviews support the claim that UNICEF aided in the operationalisation of Samagra
Shiksha activities and NEP 2020 guidelines. In Bihar, UNICEF is involved in the annual planning exercise of
Samagra Shiksha activities and in Odisha, UNICEF supported the implementation of NEP guidelines related to
co-location of anganwadi centres within school premises. However, certain states such as Maharashtra also
reported inability to support state government institutions with implementation of activities under Samagra
Shiksha due to limited bandwidth and financial resources. In Uttar Pradesh, UNICEF provided technical
support to Samagra Shiksha on evidence-based planning for different interventions under the flagship
education programme of Government of Uttar Pradesh (GoUP) – PRERNA.
Mixed evidence exists on UNICEF support to implement and operationalise policies and programmes related
to school safety. While states such as Bihar, Odisha and Assam witnessed UNICEF support in implementing
school safety programmes, developing guidelines and handbooks on child-friendly spaces in emergencies
and disaster preparedness in schools, transition states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka did not report
much planned activities related to disaster risk reduction.
B. Reach and Reaction
Primary and secondary evidence, from external interviews and documents, show significant UNICEF
support in expanding the reach of and reaction to key change activities, with mixed evidence on some
activities in different states. The most significant among these claims was the support extended by UNICEF
for strengthening data systems and executing student and learning assessment exercises. Some examples of
instances where UNICEF supported capacity building for data collection, analysis and planning are provided
in table 7.
Table 7: Reach of UNICEF Supported Training Under Output Area 501
• In Uttar Pradesh, UNICEF partnered with ACER (Australian Council for Educational Research) to provide
a training-of-trainers (ToT) model of capacity building for state and district-level government officials
on conducting learning assessments, analysis of data to create a feedback loop and taking timely
remedial measures. In 2020, a group of 22 master trainers were trained who further oriented 43,003
teachers across the state.
• In Bihar, a total of 76 senior and state education functionaries were trained by UNICEF on undertaking
gender and equity-based analysis of data from UDISE+ and BEST monitoring app portals.
• In 2018, UNICEF trained 150 state and district officials involved in the EMIS to conduct quality and
accuracy checks on UDISE data and conducted disaggregated data analyses.
• At the national level, data from RAM indicates that over 3,000 education functionaries and teacher
educators from different states have been trained on incorporating NAS findings in their annual
planning.
Source: RAM Reports
Capacity building for disaster preparedness in schools was noted in select states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,
Odisha and Assam. One hundred and seventy-six schools in the Devipatan division of Uttar Pradesh were
developed as Model Risk Informed Schools, and 176 teachers and 2640 School Management Committee
(SMC) members were oriented on training children to react to natural disasters. In Bihar, the Safe Saturday
Programme on school safety was extended to 4000 madrasas in the state with the help of 76 master trainers.

appreciation and use of data in planning and programming.
External stakeholders who were interviewed reported an increase in their capacity to understand and analyse
data and provided examples of evidence-based planning. A few examples, collated from interviews and RAM
data, is highlighted in table 8 below. While the evaluation found confirmatory proof of evidence-based
planning to deliver education services to marginalised groups, the evidence on data-based gendered planning
is not as strong. In most cases, gender-disaggregated analyses of data were reported but the evaluation team
did not find major programmes or policies that were implemented based on this data. Similarly, the evidence
on improved inter-departmental collaboration, resulting due to the key change activities supported by
UNICEF , is mixed. In states such as Odisha, Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the evaluation noted
collaboration with state disaster management departments (or equivalent) or with the DRR sections within
UNICEF. However, no substantial evidence was observed with respect to other departments such as those
concerning health and nutrition.
Table 8: Examples showing improved evidence-based planning
Uttar • UNICEF’s technical assistance towards monthly monitoring and analysis of data on
Pradesh supportive supervision activities to improve learning (EEKSHA) has led to the
planning of district-level interventions to improve the performance of poorly
performing schools
• UNICEF supported state and district-level data analysis on children with disabilities,
leading to the development and execution of a targeted intervention called
SAMARTH.
Bihar • Data from UNICEF-supported real time monitoring app BEST was used to develop
convergent programmes and deliver services in Niti Aayog’s thirteen aspirational
district.
• Data from the BEST app, which indicated an acute dearth of secondary schools in
the state, led to the establishment of 3885 schools.
Assam • UNICEF-supported orientation on analysis and use of UDISE+ data led to the State
Mission Office of Samagra Shiksha developing differential plans and focused
interventions in 13 minority concentrated districts, two Scheduled Tribe (ST)
dominated districts, seven aspirational districts and 13 major tea tribe dominated
districts.
• UNICEF’s support to the SCERT in analysing the NAS 2017 data helped to identify
training needs of teachers, which led to the development of a comprehensive
teacher development plan and additional open education resources (OERs) by
SCERT to support teachers to improve classroom transaction and pedagogical
practices.
Odisha • UNICEF partnered with AIR to develop a state framework for learning assessment,
in collaboration with the assessment cell established at SCERT. Items for child-
centred assessment in grade 3, 5 and 7 in mathematics and language was
developed and were used by SCERT for the annual summative examination held in
2019-20.
50
Maharas • UNICEF support, through AIR, led to the development of a state team for learning
htra assessments. Based on learning assessment data, the Early Grades Learning
Programme was further revamped in 2019.
Karnataka • UNICEF supported the development of a micro survey to assess classroom
processes, teacher quality and student participation. Data from the micro survey
was used to develop district and block interventions.
Tamil • UNICEF supported the development of a mobile app called ARS (Adolescent
Nadu Responsive Schooling) App. Evidence and data collected from the app will be used
for advocating a change in the state annual planning template, thus sharpening the
adolescent and equity lens at scale in state planning process.

Contribution Claim 2: How and to what extent has the UNICEF Education Programme contributed to increasing
the capacity of functionaries in the national and state governments to improve school readiness through
appropriate pre-primary education?
Summary of Contribution: Evidence provides strong confirmatory proof of UNICEF’s technical and financial
assistance to states in strengthening their school readiness curriculum, development of resources aligned
with the new NEP guidelines and curriculum, and capacity building for key actors to implement the same.
External stakeholder interviews and documents confirmed the coverage of these training and capacity
building activities and attested to increased delivery of ECE interventions. External respondents also
attested to increased motivation and commitment from government officials on ECE-related activities,
such as responsive parenting interventions, and increased levels of awareness to deliver ECE services
among anganwadi workers and pre-school educators. More evidence on UNICEF’s contribution towards
responsive parenting interventions in Odisha, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh can be found in Section 4.2.
However, the strength of evidence supporting the establishment of model ECE centres2 as a key change
activity was found to be mixed across states.
A. Activities
The evaluation found strong evidence of UNICEF’s support towards activities under output area 502 (ECE).
Key activities identified for this contribution claim include developing or strengthening school readiness
curriculum, supporting state governments in establishing model ECE centres and providing training to
anganwadi workers. While all states implemented various activities related to pre-primary education, the
range and scale of these activities varied.
External stakeholder interviews and documentary evidence provide confirmation that UNICEF offered
significant technical and financial assistance to states in improving school readiness through the review of
ECE curriculum and the development of TLMs in line with the revised curriculum. UNICEF also supported the
states in the formulation of guidelines and handbooks to aid pre-primary educators in using and
understanding the curriculum and resources. At the national level, RAM data shows that UNICEF facilitated
the formation of a joint committee to review the school-readiness curriculum for children between 5-6 years
of age. At the state-level, government stakeholders acknowledged UNICEF support in devising state plans
and manuals for operationalising ECE guidelines as set out in the NEP and NCF. Community-level respondents
attested to receiving new or adapted TLMs such as activity books, workbooks and play materials in states
such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. States such as Odisha, Maharashtra, Assam and Uttar Pradesh
also reported the translation of these materials into non-dominant state languages to ensure inclusive ECE
services. A list of the major initiatives supported by UNICEF in this regard are provided in table 9.
2 In the Indian context, ECE centres refer to anganwadi centres.

Table 9: Major Initiatives Supported by UNICEF Under Output Area 502
Uttar • UNICEF provided technical support to review the ECE curriculum in the state and
Prade develop training manuals on operationalising the curriculum for district-level ICDS
sh functionaries.
Bihar • UNICEF provided technical assistance to the ICDS department to develop a five-year
road map to operationalise ECE guidelines as set in the NCF. UNICEF supported the
contextualisation of relevant TLMs to the state needs, and developed a calendar of
activities to be used by anganwadi workers for home visits and demonstrations
during the pandemic
Assam • UNICEF provided technical support to develop a facilitators’ guide for the rollout of
a responsive parenting package called Parvarish ke Champion, including posters,
videos and flipbooks.

videos on responsive parenting.
Odisha • UNICEF conceptualised a theme-based monthly calendar of activities based on the
revised ECE curriculum called Nua Arunima and adapted the same for home-based
learning environments, called Ghare Ghare Arunima(30).
• UNICEF also provided technical assistance to developing materials such as Kuni
calendars for the Vatsalya programme–a responsive parenting intervention for
children under the age of three years.
Maharash • UNICEF, in collaboration with Vikramshila Education Resource Society, assisted the
tra ICDS department in implementing the digital aspects of the Ankur responsive
parenting programme during the pandemic. UNICEF provided technical and
financial assistance towards developing and disseminating fortnightly calendars and
training of anganwadi workers.
Karnataka • UNICEF supported the DWCD and Department of School Education (DoSE) in
developing and finalising the age-wise curriculum for children between 3-6-years.
Source: RAM data and Consultations with Stakeholders
Significant evidence also exists to support the claim that UNICEF supported the capacity development of ICDS
functionaries at all levels, ranging from the development of an e-learning course on ECE-related themes at
the national level to execution of blended-training programmes for anganwadi workers in collaboration with
government and implementing partners. A list of major capacity building initiatives including their coverage
is provided in table 11. Most capacity building activities were delivered in a cascade model and leveraged
substantial support from state and district-level ICDS systems.
The evidence of UNICEF’s support for establishing model centres of ECE and capacity development towards
the same is mixed across states. While states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha reported establishment
of these centres in their respective RAM reports, no activity was reported in the other states.
B. Reach and Reaction
Evidence from RAM reports and external stakeholder interviews show UNICEF support in expanding the
coverage of training activities and distribution of relevant ECE materials. As with activities, the strength of
evidence on the coverage of training to establish model centres is weak. A few examples of capacity building
initiatives supported by UNICEF across states and their reach are illustrated in table 10.
52
Table 10:Reach of UNICEF Supported Training Under Output Area 502
• In Uttar Pradesh, a three-tier, seven-day blended capacity development programme was developed
by UNICEF. The programme trained 676 master trainers, who in turn provided mentoring support and
training to 3,520 block-level trainers and 94,4996 anganwadi workers.
• UNICEF Bihar supported the development of ECE-eILA, an online course for capacity building of ICDS
functionaries. As many as 1,04,148 female anganwadi workers and 2650 lady supervisors were
enrolled in the course in 2020. Three thousand two hundred fifty-seven middle level ICDS functionaries
(CDPOs, DPOs and lady supervisors) were oriented to mentor and monitor anganwadi workers for
home-based ECE interventions during the pandemic through UNICEF-supported virtual training.
• In Assam, UNICEF supported strengthening the systemic capacity of Anganwadi Workers Training
Centres and mid-level training centres in providing induction training to anganwadi workers. Through
this process, 79 CDPOs were trained on using the ECE quality monitoring tool to monitor the
performance of anganwadi centres in 33 districts. During the pandemic, 5,815 anganwadi workers
were also trained on responsive parenting interventions with UNICEF support.
• UNICEF Odisha supported the state government in the development of a e-learning course in Odia
language on ECE and education, to reach around 75000 anganwadi workers and 1000 supervisors.

C. Behaviour Change
The evaluation found strong evidence of behaviour changes with respect to planning and delivery of ECE
service at the state and sub-state levels as a result of UNICEF’s technical and financial assistance, and the
reach of these activities. State and district-level government stakeholders highlighted UNICEF’s role in
demonstrating ECE interventions through pilot projects, such as the Ankur programme in Maharashtra, and
further advocacy and technical support to ensure ownership of these interventions by relevant state
departments. Implementing partners testified to this increased ownership and reported the involvement of
government functionaries at all levels. Anganwadi workers, supervisors, and other community-level ICDS
workers reported an increase in their understanding of ECE aspects and ability to execute activity-based
learning methods.
The strength of evidence on increased inter-departmental collaboration is also strong. Respondents from
education departments noted working in close collaboration with other relevant departments such as the
WCD and Department of Social Welfare (DSW). In Odisha, documentary evidence shows the WCD
collaborated with the Department of Social Welfare to ensure responsive parenting materials reached
anganwadi workers during the pandemic. RAM data reports that in Uttar Pradesh, UNICEF facilitated
collaboration between DoSE and DWCD to develop a five-year road map on ECE activities while in Assam,
UNICEF coordinated with the DSW and the state SCERT to increase the capacity of training centres involved
in orienting anganwadi workers.
Contribution Claim 503: How and to what extent has the UNICEF Education Programme contributed to
increasing the capacity of functionaries in the national and state governments to deliver flexible education
services to reduce dropouts and the number of out-of-school children?
Summary of Contribution: The evaluation found strong evidence to support the claim that UNICEF assisted
states in developing, flexible and alternate learning programmes for out-of-school children and improving
the quality of these programmes in the high-burden and tribal typology of states. UNICEF’s support
towards solutions to identify and track children and innovative contextual programmes were specially
acknowledged by external respondents. More evidence on UNICEF’s contribution to identification of out-
of-school children and programming is detailed in Section 4.2. UNICEF also assisted in training relevant
government functionaries and community volunteers to execute these key change activities, which has
improved knowledge and motivation to further support out-of-school children. The evidence on specific
53
activities such as special training programmes were strong in states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and
Assam.
A. Activities
Documentary evidence and external stakeholder interviews provide strong evidence of UNICEF-supported
activities to identify and track out-of-school children, and interventions aimed at their mainstreaming in the
high burden and tribal typology of states. UNICEF provided both technical and financial assistance to support
technology-based solutions, such as the BEST app in Bihar and the SHARDA portal in Uttar Pradesh, to identify
out-of-school children based on surveys. UNICEF collaborated with implementing partners at the state and
sub-state levels to develop innovative flexible learning programmes such as School-in-a-Van and other
mobile learning centres, which saw further uptake during the pandemic due to COVID-19 disruptions to
schooling. In states where the population of out-of-school children is concentrated among specific
communities such as among Muslims and tribal populations, UNICEF supported alternative learning
programmes such as in madrasas and mobilised community volunteers to deliver these programmes in hard-
to-reach areas. External stakeholders also reflected on UNICEF’s support for revising the curriculum and
quality of TLMs being used in alternate learning programmes such as in madrasas. A state-wise breakdown
of UNICEF-supported interventions for out-of-school children or activities to improve capacity in delivering
these interventions is listed in table 11.

Odisha • During the pandemic, UNICEF collaborated with the SC & ST Development,
Minorities and Backward Classes Welfare Department to develop the Alternate
Learning and Mentorship Programme (ALMP) for children from tribal communities
with low access to digital resources. UNICEF supported the formulation of learning
materials and orientation of teachers on online and offline modes of teaching.
• UNICEF, in partnership with 8 CSOs reached out-of-school children through mobile
learning programmes such as School Sanjog in 2021.
Assam • UNICEF supported a special package of multi-grade, multi-level (MGML)
interventions to improve the quality of teaching and learning in special training
programmes in the state.
• In partnership with Pratham Education Foundation and Samagra Shiksha, UNICEF
provided technical and financial assistance towards the capacity development of
education volunteers in monitoring special training programmes in the state.
Bihar • UNICEF supported the implementation of S4D programmes in schools across the
state, as an innovative strategy to bring children back to school and to retain those
at risk of dropping out.
• UNICEF supported the revision of the curriculum in madrasas in the state,
development of TLMs in line with the revised curriculum in Urdu and training of
teachers to use these materials.

B. Reach and Reaction
The evaluation found strong evidence of the reach of some activities, such as special interventions and
training on integration of out-of-school children, and technical assistance for special training programmes.
For example, in Odisha, evidence from an internal stakeholder interview shows that more than 40,000
54
students from PVTGs were reached through the School Sanjog programme during the pandemic. Similarly, in
Bihar, UNICEF reached 47,907 children through 332 mobile learning centres, implemented in collaboration
with six CSO partners in the state in 2021. UNICEF Assam also collaborated with CSOs, tea garden associations
and district administrative council to bring around 3,183 out-of-school children into mainstream education
in 2019.
The reach of training activities to aid teachers, school management committees and relevant government
officials in the identification and mainstreaming of out-of-school children was also found to be strong. In
Uttar Pradesh, UNICEF assisted in orienting 75 district coordinators on revised strategies of integrating
children from most deprived groups and 9000 master trainers on interventions under the SHARDA initiative
in 2019. In Assam, it supported the Samagra Shiksha in developing a pool of 145 master trainers (as of 2019)
on S4D programmes.
Out of the four high-burden and tribal typology states selected for this evaluation, three reported activities
on special training programmes (STP) and related capacity building. Special training programmes are a unique
form of government-led intervention where children identified as being out of school are offered bridge
courses and remedial learning opportunities before integration into full-time, mainstream education. Special
training programmes were especially strong in Bihar, where a cadre of community volunteers called Shikha
Sevaks were trained to identify and monitor out-of-school children. The evaluation also found considerable
documentary evidence of UNICEF’s financial assistance towards establishment of non-residential special
training programmes and capacity building for the same. Likewise, in Uttar Pradesh UNICEF’s advocacy for
special training programmes resulted in a 400% increase in the budget allocation for these programmes by
the Samagra Shiksha in 2019-20. UNICEF also supported the training of 225 master trainers on STPs, who
further trained around 1,33,555 teachers as of 2021.
C. Behaviour Change
The evaluation found evidence of behaviour change related to

programme.
Community-level respondents such as master trainers and SMC members spoke to the effectiveness of the
trainings received through UNICEF’s implementing partners and reported an increase in the ability of
teachers to understand the needs of children in special training programmes, devise appropriate teaching
methods and deliver life skills education.
Evidence from documents and internal and external interviews also highlighted increased collaboration
between schools and communities to identify, monitor and retain out-of-school children. Specifically in Uttar
Pradesh, UNICEF’s collaboration with ActionAid has resulted in a huge volunteer base who are involved in
routine identification and monitoring of out-of-school children as well as linking them to other government
schemes. During the pandemic, these volunteers acted as essential linkages for continuing home-based
learning and the distribution of learning materials. Similarly, in Bihar, children in special training programmes
are monitored by Shiksha Sevaks, who are community members trained through UNICEF’s implementing
partners such as Development Network.

Contribution Claim 4: How and to what extent has the UNICEF Education Programme contributed to increasing
the capacity of functionaries in the national and state governments to deliver quality education and enhance
skill development?
Summary of Contribution: The evaluation found strong evidence of UNICEF’s technical assistance towards
improving learning outcomes through activities such as the capacity building of supportive supervision
groups, development of TLM, promotion of life skills education and learning interventions based on
assessment data. Documentary review attests to the coverage of these activities across most states, while
state and district-level interviews with external respondents provide testimonial evidence of the changes
in motivation and behaviour of relevant stakeholders to deliver quality education. However, certain states
such as Karnataka saw weak evidence of activities related to the strengthening of supportive supervision
groups and life skills education.
A. Activities
Evidence from document review and external stakeholder interviews strongly supports the claim that
UNICEF assisted states in demonstrating technical approaches for improving the quality of learning,
including capacity building of teachers and supportive supervision groups on pedagogical practices and
mentoring, use of learning assessment data to develop targeted interventions and establishment of
interventions on life skills. While the evidence is strong at an aggregate level, the strength of evidence on
some activities varied across the states.
Evidence on technical assistance to strengthen supportive supervision groups was strong across all the states.
Supportive supervision groups consist of training institutes such as DIET and support institutes such as Block
and Cluster resource centres with coordinators who mentor and provide academic support to teachers. Some
states highlighted specific interventions for supportive supervision groups, such as the development of a real-
time monitoring app, EEKSHA, for the observation of classroom practices in Uttar Pradesh. UNICEF also
partnered with Ignus in Uttar Pradesh to pilot and scale up the ‘Targeted Enhancement of Learning Outcomes
through Supportive Supervision (TELOS)’ approach to improve the performance of cluster and block resource
coordinators, thereby improving the learning outcomes of children. In Maharashtra, UNICEF partnered with
Centre for Equity and Quality in Universal Education (CEQUE) to develop and implement a systematic
programme called Kendra Pramukh Academic Leadership Programme (KPALP) to increase the capacity of
Kendra Pramukhs, or Cluster Resource Coordinators. No major initiatives were reported for this activity in
other states, such as Karnataka.
Data from RAM reports also provide examples of

State-level government and implementing partners also provided evidence of UNICEF assistance in
implementing life skills programmes. At the national level, one of the key interventions was the development
of the Career Guidance Portal, in association with Aasman Foundation and iDREAM Careers. Tamil Nadu has
been the state champion in adopting life skills programming in education with its flagship ‘Take it Eazy’
intervention. Developed based on UNICEF’s global life skills education framework, the programme focused
on improving adolescents’ emotional wellbeing, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Technical assistance towards execution of learning assessment and advocacy for further uptake varied from
state to state. While Uttar Pradesh and Bihar collaborated with ACER to develop state capacity on learning
assessments, Odisha partnered with AIR to develop a state blueprint for child-centered assessment in grades
3, 5 and 7 in mathematics and languages. Maharashtra also collaborated with AIR to develop the capacity
and knowledge of state resource persons on learning assessments.

trainings and their coverage in various states is presented in the table below.
Table 12:Reach of UNICEF’s Capacity Building Activities Under Output Area 504
• In Uttar Pradesh, UNICEF supported in constituting the state resource group with 223 members who
were selected through a rigorous process. Similarly, 2,855 block resource coordinators were selected
and trained to provide supportive supervision to teachers.
• In Assam, UNICEF assisted capacity building of 244 district resource group members and cluster
coordinators who in turn trained and mentored around 2285 teachers in four districts.
• In Maharashtra, 209 state resource persons (master trainers) were oriented on learning outcomes,
who further trained 2,456 Kendra Pramukhs. The KPs were able to mentor teachers in approximately
49,120 schools and influence the learning outcomes of 1.47 million students in the state.
• In Karnataka, UNICEF assisted the training of 30 state resource persons, 110 master resource persons
and 2500 teachers in the English Nalli Kali level 2 curriculum.
Source: RAM Reports
The reach of other key activities under this contribution claim was also strong. States such as Uttar Pradesh
and Bihar in collaboration with ACER provided training to master trainers on key aspects of learning
assessments, such as item development and data analysis. In Assam, UNICEF’s advocacy and capacity
enhancement interventions led to the establishment and training of a pool of 50 technical experts, who
provide guidance to the state on planning large-scale learning assessments.
C. Behaviour Change
The evaluation found substantial evidence of improved capabilities of supportive supervision groups to
provide academic mentorship. District and community-level stakeholders further testified to increased
teacher motivation and capacity to apply pedagogical practices and use TLM. A few testimonies from
interviews with state and district-level government respondents are presented below as evidence.
The positive relationship between the Kendra Pramukh and teachers was noticed. UNICEF focused much on
the pedagogy, creating a healthy classroom atmosphere, aligned teaching and learning, and maintaining
57
a culture-based classroom that helped the teachers directly and more and more teachers came forward to
empower and increase their students’ skills. Teachers are now able to do assessments of the students,
improve their teaching-learning practices, and could reach pedagogy to the students in the tough time.
- KII Respondent
The teachers have better capacity than earlier and can manage the classes in a more systematic and
organised way. The leadership qualities of the cluster leaders have changed.”
- KII Respondent
Respondents from teacher training institutes such as DIET and relevant state departments also provided
evidence of increased development and quality of TLM in line with learning outcomes and other interventions
to improve the quality of learning. Selected evidence from the documentary review in this regard is presented
below.
“In no uncertain terms, the teachers express the significance of the Level-Based Learning (LBL) in
improving the foundational skills in Marathi for upper primary students.”
- Report of the LBL pilot in Palghar and Hingoli(32)
“There are also clear efforts to strengthen geographical skills throughout the Geography books,
through demonstration and practice-based activities. The Science books also contain a variety of
activities that encourage observation-based learning and are written with the aim of generating
curiosity and instilling a spirit of enquiry among learners.”
- Textbook Analysis Report(33)
External stakeholder interviews also attested to increased knowledge and use of learning assessment data in
planning and delivering activities to improve learning outcomes, as shown below.
“As far as learning outcomes is concerned it has come out as a major focus point since the last 2-3 years.
We have come out with the grade-wise competency mapping. UNICEF provides technical support on
many of these areas.”
- KII Respondent
“The teachers have enhanced their skills in data analysis, as they do better data analysis of the children
than earlier.”
- KII Respondent
In learning assessment, the learning outcome document that was supposed to be developed was to
cover learning indicators and pedagogical process, that was meant to assess elementary level (class 1-8)
education covering subjects like-Mathematics, Science, Language and Social Science. More specifically
how to assess students in the classroom, how the process of pedagogy, and how it would take children
towards learning outcomes. This process continued for nine months, the document was developed and
implemented as well as used in the capacity building of teachers, it was also used in classroom
interaction and made part of assessing the children and integrating them in the report card. The
document proved fruitful.”
- KII Respondent
The evidence on behaviour change related the increased capacity of block and cluster resource coordinators
and use of learning assessment data is weaker in Karnataka. The evaluation also did not find significant proof
of integration of life skills education in Maharashtra and Karnataka. However, this is primarily due to the lack
of implementation of activities aimed at these changes rather than due to other internal or external hindering
factors.

Contribution Claim 5: How and to what extent has the UNICEF Education Programme contributed to increasing
the capacity of functionaries in the national and state governments to use social and behaviour change
communication (SBCC) strategies to improve access to learning for the most vulnerable population?
Summary of Contribution: The evaluation found varying strength of evidence across states on activities
related to the development, implementation and capacity building for SBCC activities. Initiatives to
strengthen the capacities of SMC members were stronger in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Assam than in the
transition states, which saw lesser activity due to resource constraints. Furthermore, the coverage of
activities and the resultant change in opportunities, motivation and behavioural change is difficult to
establish since SBCC strategies were reported to be a cross-cutting area integrated within programmes
and interventions under other output areas, as opposed to a stand-alone output area with independent
programming.
A. Activities
Documentary review and external stakeholder interviews provide proof of UNICEF’s support for activities
under output area 505 in specific states. Key activities identified under this output area include technical
support for the development and implementation of SBCC strategies, capacity building of relevant
government officials and community-based groups to implement these strategies and to enhance demand
for quality education.
The evaluation found evidence of UNICEF’s assistance towards building awareness of community groups
such as school management committees (SMCs) and panchayat raj institutions (PRIs) on the importance of
quality education. UNICEF also offered technical support for the promotion of inclusive education, including
developing specific gender plans and training government officials on gender and equity issues. A list of major
UNICEF-supported initiatives in this regard are highlighted in the table 13 below.
Table 13:Major Initiatives Supported by UNICEF Under Output Area 505
Uttar • UNICEF initiated SMC Connect, an IVRS-based system to disseminate information on
Pradesh educational provisions under the RTE for SMC members.
• UNICEF assited the state government in designing and rolling out the ‘Meena Campaign‘
to revitalise Meena Manches, a platform for girls in schools to discuss gender and social
issues. It also supported the capacity building of master trainers.
• UNICEF supported the capacity building of state resource group members, district
coordinators and academic resource persons to improve gender equity in schools.
Bihar • UNICEF assisted in the training of nodal teachers in schools across the state on menstrual
health and hygiene practices.
• UNICEF supported the state government in revising the module for training of SMC
members, and trained master trainers on the revised module.
• UNICEF supported the development of a SBCC strategy to improve attendance in
government schools. The strategy was approved, adopted and funded by the Bihar
Education Project Council.
Assam • UNICEF trained senior Samagra Shiksha officials on how to develop gender inclusive plans
and account for equity consideration within monitoring & evaluation activities
• UNICEF in collaboration with Tezpur University, demonstrated a life skills education
through folk art model to tea garden communities in the state.
Odisha • UNICEF provided technical support in state-level master trainers to further mentor SMC
members in developing school development plans.
• UNICEF partnered with the State Institute of Rural Development (SIRD) to capacitate
Panchayat Standing Committee on Education (PSCE) members on issues of reduction of
out-of- school children in Rayagada district.

59
All states reported implementation of advocacy and awareness campaigns on the safe reopening of schools
and the promotion of safe hygiene practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Uttar Pradesh, UNICEF
provided assistance in developing the Tara Hai Tayyar video series whereas in Bihar, it supported the Safe
Thursday programme for promotion of covid-appropriate behaviour in school premises as well as in the
community. In addition, some states carried out SBCC strategies specific to local contexts such as Say yes to
education, no to child marriage in Uttar Pradesh and Folklore for social change and adolescent empowerment
in Assam.
In general, the evaluation noted that SBCC activities were mostly built into interventions such as tracking
and identification of out-of-school children or promotion of quality learning. As such, the full contribution
of UNICEF’s support toward these activities is difficult to establish. From the evidence available, SBCC
strategies were noted to be weaker in the transition states. Respondents reported financial and personnel
shortages as the primary reason for weak programming under this output area.
B. Reach and Reaction
The RAM documents the reach of UNICEF-supported activities, while internal and external stakeholder
interviews provide testimonial evidence of the themes covered in the training, and its effectiveness. The
documents also show evidence of UNICEF’s advocacy to promote inclusive education. However, as
mentioned above, the exact coverage of the activities is difficult to confirm since gender and equity issues
were included as part of training on activities covered under other output areas. For example, the RAM
data on output area 505 covers the capacity building of SMCs and other community volunteers to track and
identify out-of-school children but this is also captured under activities reported in output area 503
(Education for out-of-school girls and boys). Similarly, the RAM provides information on the development
and implementation of life skills education (covered under output area 504 on Quality education and
learning), responsive parenting interventions (covered under output area 502 on ECE) and COVID-19-related
awareness campaigns (covered under output area 506 on COVID-response).
C. Behavioural Change
Evidence from the district and community-level interviews show increased awareness among community
members of the provisions for quality education and gender and equity barriers to achieving inclusive
education for all. In addition, respondents reported increased awareness and confidence among girls and
increased community involvement as a result of specific strategies. Two select testimonies attesting to these
changes are provided below:
The work that has emerged out of the last 5 years is that SMCs are informed adequately and capacitated
well about their roles, they can do a very good job in engaging with parents and ensuring their
participation.
- KII respondent
The most important takeaway is confidence which is easily seen in these girls. Another is being vocal is
something that we have seen. When I started this initiative, the girls used to be very shy. Even in the group
they hardly even speak, so it was very difficult for us to work on the initials. Now we can see the confidence
in them. I have been in the field for 20 days and I have seen that there are many things they have started.
Sometimes we have also learned from what they have started. Being proactive on the ground, talking not
only about these things but they become the voice for their own peers. Secondly, the involvement of the
community. There are areas, where we know that even if we don’t work, our people are there to connect
with ensuring that securing is supporting us. The department was willing to do so because they have seen
us working with them. We have seen that people have accepted and taking education seriously. There are
women, there are mothers who say, “I couldn’t do it but there are our girls who will do it now, will bring
the opportunity”.

Contribution Claim 6: How and to what extent has the UNICEF Education Programme contributed to increasing
the capacity of functionaries in the national and state governments to provide continued access to education,
especially for the most vulnerable, during the COVID-19 pandemic?
Summary of Contribution: Strong evidence exists to confirm UNICEF’s assistance towards remote learning
interventions, capacity building of teachers to use digital resources and deliver online and blended forms
of learning, and development and operationalisation of guidelines for school reopening. Responsive
parenting packages aimed at continuing ECE activities saw the most reach. As a result, several
interventions to ensure continued learning were implemented by government functionaries. External
respondents at the state and district level also reported increased capacities of teachers to use online
platforms and tools to deliver lessons.
A. Activities
Documentary review and external stakeholder interviews provide strong evidence of UNICEF’s technical
and financial assistance to states during the pandemic for improving access to remote learning materials
and programmes, development and operationalisation of SOPs for safe reopening of schools and conducting
awareness campaigns to promote covid-appropriate behaviours. While support was observed in all the
states, the intensity of activities varied depending on the state context.
Evidence of UNICEF-supported remote learning activities was found

Unnayan Bihar- Mera Mobile, Mera Vidyalaya programme. Bihar,
Uttar Pradesh and Odisha also reported integration of learning materials developed on Digital Infrastructure
for Knowledge Sharing DIKSHA(34) led by NCERT. To ensure continuity of learning, lessons were disseminated
through mass media such as radio and TV, and with social media platforms such as YouTube. UNICEF assisted
the launch of an exclusive TV channel Gyan Brikshya in Assam to stream lessons, while in Karnataka, it
supported the state’s YouTube channel Makkala Vaani for continued learning. In Bihar, lessons for specific
classes were broadcast on Doordarshan and later uploaded to the YouTube channel of the Bihar Education
Project Council. In hard-to-access areas, textbooks, workbooks and information on digital resources were
distributed and promoted through frontline workers such as ASHA and anganwadi workers, collaborating
with the respective government departments, and mobilising community volunteers. For example, UNICEF
facilitated a partnership between the department of education and the departments associated with the
State Rural Livelihood Mission (SRLM) and National Health Mission (NHM) to promote the e-Pathshala
programme. SRLM circulated the e-pathshala content and oriented frontline workers through the NHM to
disseminate the information during home visits.
In addition to these digital or remote learning resources, UNICEF also assisted states in the formulation and
implementation of blended learning programmes, such as mobile learning centres. Mobile learning centres
such as School-in-a-Van, and School-in-a-Bus were devised to reach children residing in difficult geographic
terrain such as tea gardens or communities with low digital accessibility and connectivity. In Bihar, UNICEF in
collaboration with implementing partners, reached out to the vulnerable Musahar community with vans and
buses customised with books and audio and video content for children. In Odisha, UNICEF worked with the
state SC & ST department and CSOs to conceptualise and implement the School Sanjog (School-in-a-Van and
School-in-a-Bike) programme for children from ten particularly vulnerable tribal groups. In Odisha, UNICEF
collaborated with SCERT and the Department of Education to implement a blended learning programme
61
(Alternative Internship Programme), where pre-service student teachers offered classes to children in hard-
to-access areas.
More generally, UNICEF also provided technical and financial assistance for specific interventions to reduce
learning loss as a result of disruptions to schooling. In Assam, UNICEF provided technical assistance in
developing a reading programme, Shukroboriyaa Kaahini, for children in grades 1-8. UNICEF Maharashtra
collaborated with the government and Pratham Books to implement the Goshticha Shaniwar reading
programme for students in grades 1-8. The e-books were curated and shared via WhatsApp through a multi-
tiered dissemination channel to ensure maximum reach. A similar campaign was undertaken by UNICEF Bihar
in association with Pratham Books, where stories in local languages were selected and shared with parents
and children in the Missed Call Do, Kahani Suno initiative. UNICEF Tamil Nadu collaborated with the
NalandaWay Foundation to undertake a special programme called Take it Eazy to help adolescents improve
their emotional well-being during the pandemic.
Evidence also exists on the development or adaptation of home-based ECE interventions in specific states. In
Odisha, the Nua Arunima package of interventions was adapted for home-based learning and promoted as
the Ghare Arunima programme. Additionally, a new calendar of activities for children below the age of three
years, called Kuni Calendar, was developed and promoted among parents. In Maharashtra, the pilot Ankur
Responsive Caregiving Programme was scaled up and implemented digitally across the state . In Uttar
Pradesh, UNICEF assisted in the development of a 12-week responsive parenting package with instructional
clips of activities and audio files of rhymes and stories developed in Hindi and Awadhi.
The RAM reports(26) show that in specific states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, UNICEF supported state
governments in the safe reopening of schools by developing detailed guidelines. In Assam, UNICEF assisted
in conducting a rapid assessment of WASH services in schools and assisted the state Samagra Shiksha in
installing hand washing stations in selected tea garden schools. In Maharashtra, UNICEF Education and WASH
sections implemented a Back-to-School Project to demonstrate differential models of preparation for safe
school reopening.
B. Reach and Reaction
The evaluation found confirmatory proof of UNICEF’s assistance in training government officials at
different levels to deliver remote learning activities and ensure the safe reopening of schools. While the
reach of these activities was significant in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Odisha, the level of coverage was
much lower in the transition states.
Documentary evidence shows that UNICEF mostly supported the capacity building of district and community-
level stakeholders through virtual platforms during the pandemic. Implementing partners involved in the
execution of pre-existing programmes attested to UNICEF’s support in adapting training materials and
delivery of training through other platforms. Respondents from focus group discussions highlighted new
topics introduced during the training to ensure teachers, students and parents had the right information and
access to resources for continued learning. The table 14 below highlights the coverage of UNICEF-supported
capacity building activities in various states.
Table 14: Reach of UNICEF Supported Training Under Output Area 506
• UNICEF supported the training of 4,978 anganwadi workers and supervisors on the responsive
parenting package in Uttar Pradesh. The trained ICDS functionaries were able to cover around 51,545
children between 3-6 years to ensure school readiness.
• In Assam, UNICEF collaborated with the Department of Social Welfare to train 2010 supervisors and
30,000 anganwadi workers on responsive parenting for young children. UNICEF also worked with the
state Samagra Shiksha. UNICEF, in collaboration with Samagra Shiksha, capacitated 1178 education
volunteers to improve remote teaching learning practices for children enrolled in special training
programmes.
62
• In Bihar, UNICEF supported the training of 257 middle-level ICDS functionaries and 2767 lady
supervisors in mentoring anganwadi workers to deliver home-based ECE activities.
• UNICEF Maharashtra provided technical assistance in conducting 5 webinars on the Learn from Home
Package developed by MSCERT, through which 3600 education officials were trained on ensuring
continued learning.
C. Behaviour Change
Testimonies from external stakeholder interviews below show that relevant government functionaries were
actively involved in the development and implementation of remote learning interventions and had the
necessary knowledge to operationalise guidelines for the safe reopening of schools.
During pandemic, schools were closed, but online classes were conducted with support from Bihar
Education Project Council (BEPC) and SCERT, for which teachers were trained on content delivery of the
textbook over online means. The work was mostly done by BEPC, but the resources were provided by SCERT.
UNICEF helped in providing facilities from ICT and their experts. Apart from this, e-material was developed
for class 1-8 students. That material was shown in “Mera Doordarshan, Mera Shiksha Ke Adhar”
programme. The support was provided by UNICEF, and it helped in bridging gap for children who were not
able to access education.
- KII Respondent
RMSCERT in partnership with UNICEF has formed a resource group that is working on a checklist that will
guide school functionaries in developing a feasible plan for opening schools safely (when state allows for
the same).
- Digital Education Report (17)
District-level respondents involved in the orientation of teachers also reported improved capacities to use
remote learning resources and deliver classes through virtual or blended modes. A few pieces of evidence
from interviews are presented below to validate this behaviour change.
The positive change is also seen in the capacity of the teachers. Through UNICEF’s projects, the teachers
first got to know about the home learning packages during the pandemic, because nobody knew what to
do during the pandemic when everything was closed. Everybody doesn’t have the same resources. The
children mostly didn’t have a smartphone in their house. Parents could mostly afford Rs. 1000-2000
phones. So, at that time with the support of UNICEF, the digital material reached the children.
- KII Respondent
For the first time in madrasas, there was implementation of technology. All madrasas have collaborated
with us under this initiative. Maulavis have used digital learning for the first time, only through the
intervention of UNICEF. It is a significant achievement for us.
- KII Respondent
Within UNICEF, increased inter-departmental collaboration was observed to provide convergent services to
children. The Education Programme coordinated with the WASH, Child Protection and C4D programme to
run awareness and advocacy campaigns, promote safe hygiene practices and safe reopening of schools.
C. Accelerating and Hindering Factors
The evaluation found several internal and external accelerators and hindering factors affecting UNICEF’s
achievement of results in the study states. Internal factors contributing to achievement of results are similar
to responses elicited for UNICEF’s comparative advantages and are presented in Section 3.5. Internal and
external hindering factors are explained in detail as relevant throughout the report but is summarised below.
Hindering Factors
63
External stakeholder interviews highlighted challenges affecting programming, including issues related to
staffing, funding, internal processes and short-term vision. These internal barriers are elucidated below.
• Inadequate staff within UNICEF and staffing-related delays were reported to affect the Programme
implementation in some instances. Challenges related to internal staffing and capacity are further
detailed in Section 3.4 under EQ 3.3.
• Long-drawn internal processes within UNICEF reportedly affected the timeliness and responsiveness of
UNICEF activities. These factors and supporting examples are elucidated in Section 3.4 under EQ 3.1.
• Internal stakeholders reported that funding constraints hindered the implementation of activities as
planned. Financial constraints and related changes in programming can be found in Section 3.4 under EQ
3.2.
• External stakeholders also highlighted that current programming is constrained by the lack of a long-
term vision. This is further explained in Section 3.2 under EQ 1.1.
In addition to internal barriers, stakeholder interviews also highlighted several factors affecting the external
enabling environment.
• Operational and systemic challenges while working with the government hindered the timely
achievement of results. These deviations from the workplans are explained in Section 3.4 under EQ 3.1
• Oft-changing state leadership, along with differing programming interests and preferences of incumbent
duty bearers had negative consequences on UNICEF’s ability to achieve intended results. This challenge
is further detailed in Section 3.4 under EQ 3.1
• Internal stakeholders and implementing partners noted that lack of transparency within government
systems affected UNICEF’s ability to undetake relevant activities. EQ 1.1 under Section 3.2 provides
further details and supporting examples for this barrier.
• The low levels of digital penetration in specific states hampered the reach and effectiveness of digital
interventions to ensure continued learning during the pandemic. This is explained under EQ 3.1 under
Section 3.4.
Accelerating Factors
Respondents provided similar responses when asked about organisational or internal factors that accelerated
programming and UNICEF’s comparative advantages. These responses are synthesised in Section 3.5. In a
few instances, internal stakeholders reported that strong state leadership and close inter-departmental
coordination aided in the achievement of results within stipulated timelines. These factors are set out in
detail in Section 3.4 under EQ 3.1.
D. Unintended or Unanticipated Outcomes
The evaluation found evidence of negative and positive unintended outcomes; however, most of these
unanticipated outcomes have directly or indirectly arisen as a result of the pandemic.
Positive outcomes such as improved data quality and institutional appreciation for evidence-based
planning, increased parental involvement in education, enhanced focus on emotional well-being and
mental health issues, teacher-led innovations and increased focus on bridging the digital divide were
observed in the evaluation. National level implementing partners and government functionaries reported
shifts in the attitude of relevant government departments and organisations to strengthen data systems and
enhance capacity of officials on learning and competency-based assessments. The pandemic and resultant
home-based learning interventions (such as those on responsive parenting) has seen increased awareness
and involvement of parents in their children’s education, from early childhood to secondary levels and
increased demand generation for quality interventions. Similarly, the pandemic witnessed great efforts by
teachers to ensure continued learning in the form of innovative initiatives such as School at your Doorstep or
‘Shala Tumcha Daari’ and interventions to provide psychosocial support to parents, teachers and students,
64
such as the Take it Eazy programme in Tamil Nadu. External stakeholders at the national level noted that the
difficulties in reaching marginalised and vulnerable communities through remote learning interventions
during the pandemic has highlighted the digital divide as a focus area for governments and other actors.
The evaluation found evidence of unintended negative outcomes, including overreliance on UNICEF for
financial and technical assistance and widening of gender and social equity gaps. The most common
negative externality reported was the overreliance on UNICEF’s technical and financial assistance. This
dependency threatened ultimate sustainability and government ownership of demonstrated interventions
and is more fully explored under Section 3.6 on Challenges to Sustainability. While no other negative
outcomes were reported as a result of UNICEF supported initiatives were reported, respondents noted
changes in the operating environment as a result of COVID-19. The pandemic has resulted in further learning
loss, potentially unravelling efforts made thus far to improve learning outcomes. It also resulted in re-
establishing challenges to inclusive education. Children from marginalised and vulnerable communities have
been disproportionately affected by the general and education-specific challenges caused by the pandemic
and will result in further disparities in access to quality education.
EQ 2.2 How effective has UNICEF support been in addressing inherent equity
gaps or taking into consideration the disparities regarding caste, residence,
gender, religion, and wealth?
The response to this evaluation question is presented under the EQ. 1.3 (Relevance) for a more
comprehensive overview of the UNICEF’s Programmes relevance and effectiveness in addressing gender
and equity gaps.
3.4 Efficiency
The Efficiency section of the TOR assesses the Programme’s timely and cost-efficient implementation across
the following dimensions a) timeliness of implementation; b) sufficiency of financial resources; and c)
sufficiency of human resources.
EQ 3.1 To what extent were UNICEF activities delivered in a timely and
organised manner?
Evaluation Finding: Programme activities were mostly completed within the stipulated timeframe with
some delays noted due to dependence on the government for facilitation, bureaucratic processes for
approvals, ad-hoc requests from the government, procedural delays within UNICEF and on account of
pandemic restrictions.
According to data provided in RAM reports, UNICEF is well-positioned to achieve its targets, including the
gender and equity-related targets. Evidence from interviews on achievement of independent planned
activities and results corroborate our findings from the RAM analysis. Further information on achievement
of results is presented in Section 3.3, under Effectiveness.

coordination and support were delayed due to delays in receiving inputs such as dates, schedules and list of
participants. It also affected the quality or closure of deliverables – in instances where key deliverables
included policy advocacy or meetings with relevant government stakeholders for obtaining feedback, project
closure and achievement of intended results were delayed due to the inability to secure meetings promptly.
National and state-level UNICEF staff highlighted that supporting government departments on ad hoc
requests further diluted the available resources and caused deviations from the annual workplan. At the
same time, respondents acknowledged that refusal to support the government on such requests could
weaken UNICEF’s positioning in the state and affect its ability to push and advocate for larger, strategically
important policies and programmes.
Additionally, UNICEF staff and implementing partners highlighted that change in government leadership
affected the timely completion of planned activities. Frequent turnover implied that UNICEF staff had to
spend time establishing working relationships and explaining project operations and goals to the new duty
bearers resulting in deviations from the workplan. UNICEF staff and implementing partners also reported
that government priorities changed depending on the state leadership and such changes in between
programming cycles either lead to activities being dropped or being achieved at a lower scale than intended.
The lack or withdrawal of government ownership and buy-in also resulted in interventions being
discontinued. Implementing partners and UNICEF staff testified that certain programmes – such as S4D are
successful in states such as Bihar and Assam due to political support from the state government. However,
similar programming was not successful in Maharashtra due to de-prioritisation by the state government
which led to S4D initiatives being discontinued for Maharashtra. In Karnataka, the government was not keen
on uptake of Output 501 (Policy and Planning for Equitable Quality Education) despite training programmes
on use of data and evidence being arranged by UNICEF, resulting in low enrolment rates for training of
government officers.

Government of India’s year of work (Apr – Mar) was
considered a hindrance by internal stakeholders. Furthe r , UNICEF staff responded that internal processes,
while ensuring necessary checks and balances, affects its ability to commit resources or finances to the
government without due approval in comparison to other organisations. Implementing partners raised
similar concerns, especially with respect to funding for unexpected or ad hoc activities requested by the
government. Internal and external financial reporting mechanisms were also noted to be cumbersome and
difficult to understand and execute. Implementing partners also highlighted that an adequate amount of
66
time for internal review by UNICEF is not accounted for in workplans, which negatively impacts the project
deliverables. Other concerns, such as the duration of partnership cycles affecting the sustainability of results,
are covered in Section 3.6.

engagements with the field. In certain instances, the
respondents noted pivoting to digital or using IVR technologies to deliver the planned activities, but the
activities were dropped in other instances. However, the reach and effectiveness of digital interventions was
also hampered by the low levels of digital penetration in specific states, especially at the grassroots level.
While digital communication came into the forefront after COVID, it has been difficult for parents to access
these services due to a lack of familiarity, making it challenging to reach the community. This mode was also
less preferable to girls, younger students, rural students and government school students(35).
Recurring, yet unpredictable climatic events like floods also impacted the efficient service delivery and fiscal
planning. Another potential challenge highlighted by the external stakeholder was related to geography and
terrain. For example, delays in accessing certain districts or establishing relationships with the community
compounded by infrastructure issues and language barriers also affected the project timelines.
External stakeholders acknowledged UNICEF’s role in mitigating some of the delays through its strong
understanding of government mechanisms. Respondents highlighted UNICEF support in the facilitation of
capacity-building activities (such as sending out letters to government departments, and coordination with
government departments for dates of training) as well as UNICEF’s ability to effectively navigate through the
layers of bureaucracy.
While changing state leadership and priorities was highlighted as a barrier, certain internal respondents
noted that strong state leadership helped in the timely execution of activities. A strong, committed
leadership and support of relevant government stakeholders reduced administrative barriers and proved to
be an effective mechanism to troubleshoot challenges related to duplication of efforts by different actors.
An internal stakeholder reported that in Bihar, the relevant state leadership set up regular meetings among
partners and NGOs as well as between internal stakeholders like the SCERT and Samagra Shiksha to address
communication and coordination challenges.
Strong working relationships between government departments was reported to be another factor
contributing to achievement of activities within stipulated timelines. At the national level, the Ministry of
Education supported UNICEF on its WASH in schools programming, and for operationalisation of the Swachh
Vidyalaya guidelines. At the state level, stakeholders in Odisha reported close coordination with the WCD to
conceptualise and execute responsive parenting interventions. In Assam, collaboration with the State
Disaster Management Authority led to development of school safety guidelines and programmes.
EQ 3.2 To what extent did UNICEF deliver activities within the planned
monetary resources allocated.
Evaluation Finding: UNICEF’s current templates for capturing financial information does not allow for
identifying overspending since it does not separately capture extra sanctions of funds. However, analysis
of financial data shows that the budget allocated was utilised in full. External and internal stakeholders
reported inadequate funds to carry out planned programmes and the evaluation noted instances where
67
activities were discontinued due to funding constraints. External stakeholders reported cumbersome
mechanisms for financial reporting while internal stakeholders reported that misalignment between
UNICEF’s financial cycle and that of the government’s often lead to lack of visibility in funding.
The evaluation team explored this question by analysing financial data(36) shared by UNICEF, in terms of the
actual use of funds across output areas, states and sub-interventions during the evaluation period. While this
approach captured underutilization, UNICEF’s current templates for capturing budget-related information
did not allow for an analysis of over-spending, as it did not separately capture extra sanctions or funds
released.

while ‘Policy Engagement, Public Engagement and Research’ together only covered 4.4%.
In terms of the sampled states, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar had a significantly higher share of the funds to be

shares of 14%, 13% and 9% respectively. Tamil Nadu and Karnataka had much lower shares at 4% and 3%,
respectively.

the only state at 100%, with the four other states above 90%. Assam and Tamil Nadu were the only states
below 90% but were only 1 and 2% short respectively.
C. Fund Allocation for Gender and Equity Related Activities
The budget data was also analysed to get a sense of the utilisation of financial resources against gender
and equity related interventions. Specific Intervention Codes (SICs)3 in the budget data were analysed to
understand overall and scheme-wise expenditure for equity and gender. Out of a total of 38 SICs, we have
mapped 10 (26%) that were dedicated to gender (4) and equity (6). Of the total, this expenditure was about
32% of which the lion’s share was allocated under equity (29%). Ninety-four per cent of the expenditure on
equity was towards technical assistance – equitable access to quality education (13%). Education analyses
including the Out-of-School-Children Initiative, Education Sector Analyses, (8%) and System Strengthening –
inclusive education for vulnerable children poorest quintile, ethnic/linguistic minorities, migrant children,
and non-citizens/ undocumented children (6%). The remaining 2% under equity was covered under System
Strengthening – risk informed programming, including climate, resilience, disaster, conflict, and emergency
preparedness (1%), Education humanitarian cluster/humanitarian sector coordination (0.6%) and System
Strengthening – mother tongue / multilingual education (0.3%).

By output areas 501 (Policy and planning for equitable quality education), 503 (Education for out-of-school
girls and boys) and 506 (COVID-response) have a sizeable share of equity-related allocation (41%, 86% and
95%, respectively). In all three areas, the SIC with the highest allocation was related to equity, with all of the
top three under output area 503 and the top two under output area 506 connected with equity. Gender-
related expenditure was the maximum under output area 505 (Demand for quality education), at 20% of the
overall allocation.
UNICEF was also efficient in utilising the funds allocated towards gender and equity-related activities. In
terms of utilisation for equity-related activities, the funds utilised under four of the six areas were above
94%, of which only one was from the top three SICs in terms of percentage share (‘Education analyses’).
Technical Assistance – equitable access to education and System Strengthening – inclusive education for
vulnerable groups had relatively lower utilisation levels of 85% and 84%, respectively. In terms of utilisation,
all funds utilised under SRGBV were relatively lower (82%), while for the remaining three areas they were
close to or equal to full utilisation.
D. Funding Related Challenges
While the budget analysis showed that UNICEF funds were effectively utilised, the internal stakeholders of
UNICEF were of the perspective that the Education Programme budget was inadequate to fully meet the
UNICEF stated goals and plans. In particular, the lack of clarity of the level and timing of funds affected
programme’s scale, quality and timeliness. UNICEF staff at the state and national levels reported that funds
committed at the beginning of the year were unavailable due to various reasons, resulting in planned
activities being dropped or delayed. Evidence from the RAM reports and interviews with implementing
partner interviews corroborate this challenge – the second phase of the Level-Based Learning Programme in
Maharashtra was discontinued due to financial constraints. Additionally, states reported that they received
an influx of unanticipated funds (to be spent by the end of each year) during the pandemic resulting in more
unplanned activities being taken up. Even during normal programme cycles, the misalignment between
UNICEF’s internal cycles (Jan- Dec) and government cycles (Apr- Mar) lead to activities being concentrated
during the latter half of the year. UNICEF staff also noted that the overall funds available for the Education
Programme in the country are not comparable to the budget available in other countries, or even comparable
with the budgets available for the Health and WASH programmes in the country. The increase in the number
of actors in the education sector in India and their capability to provide funding for government activities
compounded by UNICEF’s overall financial constraints necessitates further exploration of partnerships which
can prove to be mutually beneficial. In some instances, the projects were implemented in a phased manner
with specific milestones for each phase to address financial constraints. However, this had a negative impact
when it came to technology development as it affected the effectiveness and overall efficiency of the
solutions.
Nearly all of the implementing partners stated that the process of transferring the funds was smooth and
problem free, with the exception of Karnataka. Multiple respondents in Karnataka cited a one-month delay
at the start of the year when submitting the budget at the beginning of the Country Programme cycle, due
to pending approvals and delayed processing. An implementing partner cited that certain duty bearers within
relevant government departments step in during such period and offer to work with partners on a
reimbursement mode, but this was noted to be highly dependent on personal working relationships. In other
instances where UNICEF funding was delayed and governments could not provide financial assistance, the
work was reported to be halted.
The qualitative analysis also brought to light procedural hurdles that led to issues with funding access for
external stakeholders. Multiple respondents from the government and partner organisations highlighted
that the protocols to be followed for annual budget approvals were inhibiting, with releases tied to milestone
and little flexibility for reassignment of funds under sub-categories when the need would arise during the
year. Long funding gaps were subsequently responsible for a break in the continuity of project
71
implementation. Rigorous documentation requirements and a lack of flexibility posed challenges for
stakeholders being able to access funding from UNICEF. In Assam, UNICEF organised a training programme
for the financial staff of an implementing partner to circumvent this challenge.
Interviews with internal stakeholders identified several ways through which UNICEF and partners
consistently used resources and inputs to enhance the efficiency of financial resources within education
programming. Examples of some of the strategies and approaches highlighted by respondents are detailed
below.
a) Leveraging government funds (Samagra Shiksha): The Programme most often was observed to draw on
the available resources and budget from the government programmes such as Samagra Shiksha. In
Odisha, a stakeholder outlined how they aided the WCD in mediating with Samagra Shiksha to secure
funds for the co-location of anganwadi centres.
b) Other donor fundings: UNICEF’s technical contribution to the planning for the World Bank STARS
proposal with the government enabled leveraging of over USD 1.2 million for programming in
strengthening ECE services in anganwadi centres for 2021-22. In Maharashtra, funding from the STARS
programme was used to provide book packs along with activity books to engage children.
EQ 3.3 Were UNICEF’s human resources well utilised to deliver activities and
interventions?
Evaluation Finding: UNICEF staff offices were reported to be understaffed to undertake the current
quantum of work. External stakeholders provided positive feedback on their working relationship with
UNICEF staff but highlighted a few areas where technical capacity could be improved such as monitoring
and evaluation and emerging areas such as digital education.
The evaluation found mixed evidence of UNICEF’s efficient utilisation of human resources. UNICEF staff
reported that there was sufficient allocation of human resources at the national and state level to meet the
programming requirements. In many states, the existing UNICEF personnel were also supported by
consultants who brought specific technical expertise to support the Programme delivery. The strategy of
leveraging the technical capacities of other sections within UNICEF ICO and state offices (especially WASH,
DRR and C4D sections) for convergent programming, has further enhanced the efficient utilisation of the
UNICEF’s human resources. UNICEF staff highlighted specific instances of such convergence, such as
intersectoral collaboration to develop joint assessment plans to address natural disasters or other conflicts.
However, external stakeholders reported that UNICEF staff offices were understaffed in relation to the
scale and complexity of the programmes they are required to handle. External respondents across states
expressed the need for more responsiveness technical support, which is currently difficult given the
bandwidth of limited staff. Implementing partners reported observing UNICEF staff working long hours and
being overburdened with work, while appreciating their availability and accessibility. Information from the
Education Strategic Plan(37) substantiates this claim despite having the largest global education presence of
any international agency, the proportion of education-specific staff within UNICEF has decreased over the
last 10 years (down to 16% in 2016 from 20% in 2006) and is also low compared with peer organisations
(education staff is 32% at World Bank). . In a few instances, implementing partners reported issues relating
to frequent change of staff and delays in filling vacant positions. These changes resulted in a reported lack of
clarity, changing expectations around the results of the programming and deprioritisation of planned
activities based on personal interests, affecting its on-ground continuity and implementation.

trainings and programmes. External respondents at all –KII Respondent
levels acknowledged the domain knowledge and skillset
of UNICEF staff and highlighted their technical understanding of relevant thematic areas of programming,
especially pedagogical practices. Further, stakeholders attested to UNICEF’s understanding of government
systems and mechanisms, and experience working with various government departments.
However, certain external stakeholders identified challenges related to internal staffing within UNICEF,
including technical skillsets. Respondents expressed the need for improved capacity of state-level staff in
specific areas such as monitoring and evaluation, curriculum development, capacity building, financial
planning and budgeting, and emerging areas such as digital education. In addition, changing leadership with
changing perspectives within UNICEF were reported to cause delays due to the need for constant
recalibration and was noted to be a hindrance to long term implementation success. For example, the Bal
Shiksha project in Maharashtra was reported to be negative affected as a result of frequent change in
technical staff. Additionally, UNICEF staff also raised concerns regarding the efficient utilisation of personnel,
particularly UNICEF-supported consultants at the state level. The consultants are usually engaged for a period
of one year and renewal of contracts were reported to be an inefficient process.
3.5 Coherence
The coherence section of evaluation assesses UNICEF’s partnerships with external stakeholders in the
education, and convergence and internal coherence within UNICEF with other programme area. It also
evaluates the UNICEF’s positioning and comparative advantages in education programming.
EQ 4.1 How does UNICEF’s work fit with the work of external partners (global
partners, regional partners, government, partner programmes/interventions)?
Evaluation Finding: The Education Programme works closely in convergence with external stakeholders
including relevant government departments at state level and implementing partners. Interviews and
documentary evidence confirmed the length and bread of UNICEF’s engagements. However, independent
experts highlighted the need for some degree of separation of work to ensure UNICEF’s status as an
independent organisation and diversity in partnerships, especially in engaging with non-traditional
implementing partners.

with a larger population of vulnerable communities, UNICEF specifically engaged with the concerned
departments such as the State Disaster Management Authority in Assam, the Department of ST/ SC/ Minority
Welfare in Odisha and the Bihar State Madrasa Education Board. In Assam, UNICEF also engaged with District
Child Welfare Committees and tea garden associations to mainstream out-of-school children and roll out ECE
programmes. The state also witnessed a unique sub-state partnership with UNICEF partnering with the Bodo
Land Territorial Council. Evidence from interviews highlight UNICEF’s ability to develop and maintain working
relationships with government partners across national, state and district levels. Some of the major
government departments that UNICEF works with in different states is showcased in Table 17.
External stakeholders at the national level and independent experts testified to UNICEF’s close engagement
with government partners in operationalising government policies on education, describing UNICEF as ’the
natural partner for the Ministry and the Department of School Education’ and stating that ’UNICEF largely
works with the government. If we see the national policy, UNICEF has helped in every stage of developing the
curriculum in consultancy with women and child development.’ External respondents at the state-level
testified to the same, reporting that various state policy guidelines are ‘mainly steered by UNICEF’ and that
‘UNICEF’s role is to strengthen all such policy frameworks in the actual implementation’. Evidence of this role
can also be observed through its presence on various state-level committees such as the School Safety
Advisory Committee and Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN) Committee in Assam, Steering
Committee on Pre-School Education in Uttar Pradesh and COVID-related expert committee in Tamil Nadu.
However, a need for a certain degree of separation between the work UNICEF undertakes and that of the
government, to maintain its identity and presence as an independent organisation capable of criticising
government policies, if necessary, was raised by a few external respondents. UNICEF staff also highlighted
that close alignment with government activities and resultant support for ad-hoc requests sometimes led to
dilution of allocated resources, affecting planned programming in other areas. Lack of awareness among
government partners of UNICEF’s overall areas of work and country plan was reported to the primary cause
for this deviation. Certain modalities of operation, such as immersion of UNICEF-supported consultants or
personnel within government departments, were noted to be detrimental to maintaining an independent
identity. On the other hand, this approach was reported to be beneficial in gaining government departments’
support and confidence, improving UNICEF’s visibility in the state and its convening power or for facilitating
meetings. Further, some government stakeholders felt that UNICEF could increase the quantum of technical
resource persons extended to them, displaying a high degree of reliance on UNICEF for long-term technical
support and affecting government take-up and sustainability of programmes. While these stakeholders felt
that they would be able to continue and recreate the interventions conducted by UNICEF, they reported that
their pace and scale would be comparatively slower without UNICEF’s continued support. Government
stakeholders also noted the need to introduce mid-term review of the workplan formulated at the beginning
of the year and undertake corrective actions, if required.
Evidence from external interviews and document review speak to UNICEF’s strong financial and technical
partnerships with national and state-specific NGOs and CSOs, with scope for engaging more non-traditional
74
partners. The evaluation found that UNICEF consistently engaged with traditional organisations who have
worked in the education sector, and with UNICEF or other UN organisations, for a long period of time. At the
national level, implementing partners contribute towards the design and implementation of large initiatives
across multiple states and towards advocacy. For example, the Language and Learning Foundation supported
four states in improving learning outcomes through child-centered pedagogy, whereas the American
Institute for Research was contracted as a technical partner to provide support to the NCERT in analysing
NAS data and conducting other related activities such as development of assessment frameworks. At the
state and district levels, non-government stakeholders supported or implemented both pilot/demonstration
projects or larger initiatives and programmes. In Odisha, UNICEF partnered with National Institute of Mental
Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) to develop and pilot adolescent wellness workbooks in two districts
whereas in Maharashtra, a reading campaign was piloted (and later upscaled) in collaboration with Pratham
Books’ StoryWeaver. In Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, UNICEF supported the ICDS department in
strengthening pre-primary education through its partnership with Vikramshila Education Resource Society.
Several multi-state engagements with technical partners were also noted, mostly with larger organisations
such as Pratham, the NalandaWay Foundation and the Language and Learning Foundations or specialised
organisations such as Vikramshila.
The table 16 presents examples of partnerships and engagements by UNICEF in the evaluation states. The

NGOs and CSOs.

organisations were reported to be approachable and
open, welcoming of feedback and available to discuss -KII Respondent
issues and challenges through the course of implementation of the activities. Implementing partners
interviewed highlighted that reporting processes required of UNICEF partners had, in turn, strengthened
their internal capacity and administrative processes, now enabling them to apply for grants or work with
other international NGOs independently.
Despite the overwhelming positive feedback in favour of UNICEF’s partnership modalities, a few external
respondents raised challenges with respect to coordination and communication. In one instance, an
implementing partner relayed that the project delivery was affected by the lack of a clear sense of direction
and clarity from UNICEF and was further compounded by a change in UNICEF personnel managing the
project. An independent expert echoed this concern, stating that “Within UNICEF are these personal
preferences. Somewhere someone thinks I want a coaching programme for CRC, BRC etc., which are
sometimes preferences”. Smaller state and district-level organisations reported that the one-year duration
of the Programme Cooperation Agreements (PCA) hampered their ability to plan, staff and sustain activities
at the field level. Further, delays in awarding successive contracts posed challenges for smaller organisations
to continue their work and keep their field staff on payrolls. Some implementing partners expressed the need
to simplify UNICEF’s financial reporting processes but also reported that they received adequate training and
support to do so during the partnership. The evaluation team obtained mixed responses on partners’
perceptions of UNICEF’s degree of engagement. While some organisations appreciated that UNICEF was
involved in the planning but trusted them with the implementation of activities, some partners were of the
view that UNICEF could have been more proactive in its involvement in field-level activities. Implementing
partners in a few states highlighted that UNICEF works in a siloed approach and do not provide visibility on
the work undertaken by its other partners, hindering their ability to leverage on existing work or learn from
experiences of other organisations. UNICEF staff reported that multi-state and multi-sectoral PCAs with
specialised technical agencies sometimes resulted in cross-utilitisation and dilution of funds, resulting in non-
achievement of planned activities.
Despite the range of partnerships developed by UNICEF at the national and state levels, some respondents
felt there was scope for UNICEF to broaden its engagements. Evidence from internal interviews and
document review show only moderate engagement with academic partners, other development partners
and specialised technical agencies. Independent experts and government stakeholders believed UNICEF’s
current collaboration with the private sector was nascent and could be more structured and systematic, and
highlighted the need for a comprehensive strategy for private sector engagement. External factors, such as
challenges in equipping academic institutions to work in project cycles or concerns around sharing credit in
competitive spaces were reported to be current obstacles in broadening partnerships. In Assam, internal
stakeholders highlighted difficulties in finding mature partners with the right set of technical skillsets and
contextual understanding of conflict-afflicted areas.
The evaluation did not have enough opportunity to interact with other donors working in education sector
to understand alignment and complementarities of working with UNICEF. However, external stakeholders
highlighted the role of UNICEF as a coordinating or convening organisation.
77
B. Comparative Advantages of UNICEF
Throughout the interviews, respondents highlighted several organisational advantages of UNICEF in
comparison with other actors in the education sector. These comparative advantages are described below:
• Majority of the respondents reported UNICEF’s strong working relationship with national and state-
level governments to be its biggest advantage. UNICEF’s effective strategic positioning is evident
through its status as the partner of choice of the government in supporting reforms in education, as
described in the section above on its alignment with the work of government partners. Documents such
as the Education Programme Strategy Note also acknowledge this unique positioning as one of UNICEF’s
comparative advantages. Qualitative evidence confirms that UNICEF has adequately leveraged this
relationship to demonstrate, deliver and scale up interventions in collaboration with implementing
partners. External respondents also noted that several UNICEF-supported consultants have previously
worked in the relevant government departments and bring a sound understanding of government
mechanisms and processes, enabling them to plan and deliver activities efficiently and resulting in
increased sustainability of interventions.
• Multiple stakeholders recognised UNICEF’s ability to provide technical expertise, either through its
own highly qualified staff or its access to a network of national and international consultants.
Government stakeholders interviewed consistently acknowledged and appreciated UNICEF’s work and
reported confidence in relying on the organisation for technical advice and support. UNICEF internal
documents such as the national and state-level Education Programme Strategy Notes and UNICEF staff
at the national level also recognised its ability to provide and draw upon technical expertise from across
the globe. Implementing partners referenced UNICEF as a key ’knowledge partner’ bringing global
standards and conceptual frameworks into local contexts and applications, especially in the areas of ECE
and FLN. However, a few external respondents also believed that UNICEF has not adequately leveraged
its capacities to act as a knowledge partner and expressed the need for more research and knowledge
management to build advocacy on key challenges and flagship interventions.
• UNICEF’s intersectoral presence and “Obvious advantage is they hold multi-sectoral

documentary and qualitative evidence at the
state levels.
• UNICEF’s core commitment to children in its programmes and activities was acknowledged to be one
of its USP. The Education Programme Strategy Note identifies UNICEF’s ’mandate and normative function
centered on children’s rights’ as one of its comparative advantages. UNICEF’s ability to translate this
narrative into practice is evidenced through testimonies from external stakeholder interviews, with one
respondent describing UNICEF to have ‘developed a culture of child rights’.
• External and internal stakeholders at various levels recognised UNICEF’s convening power, acquired
through its credibility and visibility as an UN agency, as one of its most unique advantages. At the
national level, UNICEF leveraged this convening power to share lessons and experiences on FLN whereas
in states like Uttar Pradesh, it established the ECCE and FLN consortium. Stakeholders also acknowledged
UNICEF’s role in organising high-level consultations and collaborations on out-of-school children. The
78
national Educational Programme Strategy Note and its counterpart in states like Maharashtra and Assam
reference utilising this convening power to advocate for increased collaboration between various
government departments and with the private sector.
• UNICEF’s presence and relationships with government systems at all levels, and across years, has aided
its delivery of activities. Evidence from external and internal stakeholder interviews demonstrate that
UNICEF’s presence from the district to the state and national level has enabled it to act as a necessary
liaison and create a closed loop through which feedback and information can be transmitted. Further,
UNICEF’s presence through the years has created a rich institutional knowledge and legacy of state
contexts and mechanisms, adding to their acceptance and visibility in the states.
• UNICEF’s support on unique areas of work is recognised by its stakeholders. External respondents noted
that UNICEF engages in areas that are typically underfunded or under prioritised by other development
actors and government stakeholders. Some examples of areas of work that were appreciated by
interviewees include capacity building and institutional strengthening and contextual interventions such
as development of madrasas in Bihar.
EQ 4.2 How does the UNICEF Education Programme align with/fit with other
interventions being carried out by UNICEF?
Evaluation Finding: Internal convergence was reported to be weak and led by individual leadership rather
than systematic processes within the organisation. The extent of collaboration was closer with
departments such as Child Protection and WASH but weaker with other sectors such as Health and
Nutrition.
Analysis of documents indicate programmatic examples of inter-sectoral engagements which are provided in
table 17.
Table 17:Examples of Cross-Sectoral Work in the Education Programmes
• Strengthen the monitoring and validation system of Swachh Vidyalaya Puraskar in collaboration
with the WASH department for the Ministry of Education
• Training provided to the State Institute of Rural Development in Odisha in collaboration with the
child protection and health and nutrition sectors for developing child-friendly schools
• Back-to-School campaigns anchored by C4D and education departments in various states such as
Odisha and Bihar
• Development of teacher’s manual on school safety and security in collaboration with child
protection and DRR sectors in Uttar Pradesh
• Life skill development programme for in- and out-of-school children in convergence with child
protection and C4D sectors in Assam
• SBCC material on enrolment, retention and learning developed in convergence with C4D
department.
• Development of SOPs for school reopening in coordination with WASH and C4D departments in
Odisha
UNICEF’s intersectoral programming approach and integrated delivery of services is emphasised in its
Programme Strategy Note (1), Country Programme Action Plan(22) and state-specific strategy notes. UNICEF
staff also highlighted benefits to intersectoral programming, such as the ability to cross-utilise funds or
deliver convergent programming with limited personnel, resulting in efficient use of resources.
79
However, the evaluation team observed mixed evidence on the degree of UNICEF’s internal coherence.
While some staff reported efforts to deliver convergent services and activities, others noted that these efforts
were not formal or systematic and varied depending on individual capacity and leadership. UNICEF staff
reported that there was a lack of synergy between different sectors and attributed this to the lack of a formal
system to monitor, measure and share credit for collaborative interventions and achievements. For example,
a respondent noted that convergent activities find a place in the results matrix of the sector they are
collaborating with but might not have a corresponding indicator in the results matrix of the education sector.
The extent of collaboration also varied from state to state and between sectors. For example, Uttar Pradesh
noted close coordination with the health sector to deliver interventions aimed at children with special needs
while Maharashtra highlighted the need to strengthen engagements with the C4D sector. Overall, strong
alignment was seen with the sectors of WASH and child protection (necessitated in part by COVID-19
conditions) in comparison to the other sectors.
The evaluation also found mixed evidence on the coherence between different UNICEF programmes. While
documentary evidence mentions that the education sector would work in close collaboration with other
UNICEF initiatives such as the multistakeholder ‘Generation Unlimited’ programme, and with other UN
agencies, the evaluation did not find substantial evidence of such engagements from qualitative interviews.
3.6 Sustainability
This section explores the extent to which the Programme interventions can be scaled up, and the extent to
which sustainability is ensured. It also examines mechanisms of evidence generation and dissemination as
part of advocacy activities aimed at sustainability.
EQ 5.1 To what extent have UNICEF support programmes been embedded
in/integrated/costed into and or helped scale up government programmes?
Evaluation Finding: The evaluation found mixed evidence on sustainability of UNICEFF programmes. While
several initiatives were reported to be integrated within government plans or schemes, this was highly
dependent on the level of government buy-in. The focus on institutional strengthening and involvement
of government staff, including teachers and ECE workers and use of community volunteers contributed
towards enhanced sustainability of the initiatives. The primary challenges related to sustainability include
capacity (technical and financial) of the government institutions as well as evolving priorities and personnel
turnover in both UNICEF and the state leadership.
There is mixed evidence from qualitative interviews on the sustainability of UNICEF’s interventions.
Initiatives with strong government buy-in were reported to have a higher probability of being continued,
albeit at a slower pace and smaller scale. Document review and qualitative interviews provide evidence of
initiatives piloted by UNICEF across different states, which have ultimately been adopted or integrated into
other plans and programmes by the government. Select examples of such initiatives have been detailed in
table 18.
Table 18: Select Examples of UNICEF’s Initiatives That Were Scaled Up
Maharashtra • The Level-Based Learning Programme, an intervention to improve foundation
skillsets for students was piloted in two districts covering 60 schools and 1400
students. The intervention was later scaled by the government to cover 38,000
students across 2700 schools.
Assam • UNICEF provided technical support to the Department of Elementary Education and

Odisha • Based on learnings from the UNICEF-supported intervention Ghare Ghare Arunima, the
state government is funding similar activity-based books and developing various
learning resources. Further, the state has also allocated funding for translation of
responsive parenting calendars to tribal languages in the next five years
A. Factors contributing to increased sustainability
Closer examination by the evaluation team identified three mechanisms through which UNICEF has ensured
continuity of activities- emphasis on institutional capacity building, leveraging public capacity and resources,
and enhancing community involvement. These mechanisms are explained in detail below.
Documentary review and testimony from qualitative interviews show that UNICEF-assisted programmes
with a ‘minimal hinderance’ approach were more likely to be upscaled. Internal and external respondents
highlighted that building the capacity of ingrained institutions to deliver programmes ensure a certain degree
of continuity of activities. UNICEF has successfully adopted the approach of leveraging and strengthening
institutional capacity in multiple states. For example, the Learning Enhancement Programme in Uttar
Pradesh was upscaled by training State Resource Groups (SRGs) on learning outcomes, pedagogy,
performance monitoring and data-based decision making. SRGs further acted as master trainers and oriented
block resource coordinators on the same. In Assam, UNICEF enhanced the reach of its activities to identify
and track out-of-school children by strengthening the capacity of the district administration and SMCs on the
same. In Maharashtra, UNICEF assisted in strengthening the capacity of DIETs to provide training and
mentorship to cluster resource coordinators (CRCs) as part of the KPALP programme. The DIET trained six
state resource persons which will scale the training to CRCs across 5064 clusters in the state and build their
capacity through workshops.
UNICEF assured sustainability of interventions by involving government partners in the design and
implementation of interventions, to ensure government buy-in and interest. Stakeholders reported that
this strategy enabled government stakeholders to understand the programme and scale them up with
changes to suit government mechanisms and structures, if necessary. For example, in Tamil Nadu and
Karnataka, teachers were involved in the curriculum and textbook development which made it easier for
them to absorb the changes that were led by UNICEF and apply them in teaching.
81
UNICEF’s strategy of scaling up interventions by leveraging existing public funds for education removed
the dependency on external financing and ensured sustainability. Internal stakeholders reported that
UNICEF works with state governments to identify funds from existing budgets for education-related
departments and schemes to integrate successful pilot interventions into existing government programmes.
In Assam, UNICEF ensured continuity of activities aimed at mainstreaming out-of-school children by
leveraging funds from the Samagra Shiksha. In Tamil Nadu, the printing, dissemination, training, and
digitalisation of life skills workbooks was continued and upscaled through the SCERT’s budget. UNICEF has
also leveraged public financing for different activities in specific states and conducted evidence generation
activities to understand the amount of public funds available for education. For example, UNICEF assisted in
the development of costed plans for education strategy in specific states through public financing in Odisha.
In Tamil Nadu, it facilitated a Public Expenditure Review and disseminated findings from the same to build
advocacy for greater education expenditure in the state.

vocalisation of demands as a result of these activities.
Stakeholders also reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the unanticipated scale up of
certain interventions. For example, the closure of anganwadi centres led to enhanced focus on the
development and dissemination of responsive parenting kits and online tools to ensure home-based learning.
Large scale trainings were conducted to ensure that anganwadi workers were equipped to help parents use
these kits. In terms of teacher training, the transition to digital platforms ensured that a greater number of
teachers could be trained without geographical limitations – a relatively slower process in offline training.
Additionally, the role of WhatsApp, email and other e-platforms ensured cross-sharing of resource materials
and continued access to the training material.
B. Factors Affecting Sustainability
The evaluation team found several internal and external factors affecting the sustainability of the
interventions, including an overall dependency on UNICEF’s technical and financial assistance. While many
of the external respondents had a positive disposition to the continuation of activities or interventions piloted
by UNICEF, they highlighted that the complete withdrawal of UNICEF’s technical support could have a
detrimental impact on the scale, pace and quality of the interventions. Some challenges to sustainability, as
identified from qualitative interviews with internal and external stakeholders, are summarised below and
explained in relevant sections cross-referenced here.
• Frequent changes in state leadership and differing interests and priorities of incumbent duty bearers
were reported to be difficult to achieve government buy-in, thus affecting continuation of activities and
programmes. This challenge is further explained in Section 3.4 under EQ 3.1.
• Implementing partners reported that the one-year duration of PCAs and resultant lack of long-term
visibility affects sustainability of programmes. EQ 4.1 under Section 3.5 provides more details regarding
this challenge.
• Government stakeholders reported that while they would be able to continue UNICEF-supported
interventions, the scale and quality of the programmes would be adversely affected without UNICEF’s
technical support. This is also explained under EQ 4.1 under Section 3.5.
82
• Continued creation and dissemination of research to ensure government ownership of programmes was
highlighted to be important to ensure sustainability. UNICEF’s role in presenting evidence and lessons for
advocacy is set out in detail under EQ 5.2 later in this section.
• Lack of basic services and inadequate infrastructure in classrooms and AWCs were reported by UNICEF
staff and community-level stakeholders to hamper sustainability. District and community-level
respondents explained that anganwadi workers deal with the lack of basic services and infrastructure in
AWCs. Their concerns therefore become more immediate, such as the lack of boundary walls and
teaching equipment in schools and cannot always prioritise the learnings from trainings in the face of
these concerns. During FGDs, teachers across states mentioned that they require follow-up refresher
trainings to apply the principles taught to them during workshops and was noted by government
stakeholders as well.
EQ 5.2 What were the ‘lessons learned’ from the implementation of the
Programme and have they been shared with the sector stakeholders (within
UNICEF and with relevant government and development partners)?
Evaluation Finding: The evaluation found instances of evidence generation through initiation and
facilitation of research and strengthening of data systems to improve data for evidence generation.
Stakeholders highlighted UNICEF’s role as a leading knowledge partner but reported the need for a more
proactive approach to evidence generation and dissemination for advocacy on key issues. While internal
monitoring system and learning systems were noted, UNICEF staff reported that these systems in their
current form do not allow for synthesis of lessons or much cross-learning between states.
The evaluation identified a number of mechanisms through which UNICEF monitored, documented and
disseminated evidence generated from its activities. National and state-level external stakeholders reported
that UNICEF played a significant role in strengthening data systems to effectively monitor indicators related
to schooling and learning outcomes. These respondents also testified to UNICEF’s assistance in dissemination
of NAS data and findings among relevant stakeholders and the formulation of evidence-based differential
plans. More information of UNICEF’s contribution to strengthening monitoring and data systems can be
found in Section 3.3 under EQ 2.1. State-level external stakeholders also highlighted UNICEF-supported
digital initiatives to improve monitoring. In Uttar Pradesh, the SHARDA portal developed with technical
assistance from UNICEF, tracks out-of-school children through enrolment rates and monitors their
mainstreaming into schools. Similarly in Bihar, UNICEF supported the establishment and maintenance of the
BEST app to monitor real-time data on attendance rates, inspections of schools, and indicators such as
learning assessments, school cleanliness and number of available toilets for boys and girls. In Odisha, the
Prashikshak portal was developed by UNICEF to support the SCERT in monitoring progress and managing
real-time data on indicators related to DIET, such as attendance rates and nature of activities.
The evaluation noted the presence of internal monitoring and learning mechanisms that allow for cross-
learning among the states. For instance, UNICEF’s RAM is an internal tool(26) to monitor state-wise progress
of the Education Programme. Consultations with the UNICEF internal stakeholders reveal that RAM reporting
is critical for monitoring, as it helps them assess progress against the targets and allows them to reflect on
the factors accelerating or hindering their progress. The Enterprise Content Management (ECM) system and
the network meetings are other avenues that allow for sharing of lessons and best practices.
In addition to establishing institutional mechanisms for better monitoring, external and internal
stakeholder interviews and RAM reports provide evidence of specific research-based evidence generation
activities to inform programming. Implementing partners reported that they rely on UNICEF for continued
creation and dissemination of research for policy advocacy with government partners, as they do not work
83
on the same scale as UNICEF and therefore do not have access to the technical resources to conduct analyses
and research. The respondents also noted that government stakeholders do not immediately observe the
changes of UNICEF’s initiatives, thereby relying on UNICEF to present them with research and advocacy to
explain the benefits of their programming. Respondents felt that in the absence of continuous research by
UNICEF, government interest might reduce with time. A few select examples of evidence-generation
activities supported by UNICEF is provided in the table 19.
Table 19: Select Examples of Evidence-Generation Activities Supported by UNICEF
• In Karnataka, UNICEF provided technical assistance towards the administration of micro surveys on
quality indicators related to classroom processes, teacher quality and student participation. The
findings from the survey were used to prepare plans and monitor primary education quality through
the data obtained.
• UNICEF facilitated a e-consortium for government school to share information on conducting
activities during the pandemic in the form of a webinar series. Findings, recommendations, and best
practices shared by the consortium were submitted to the government and widely disseminated
across the state to plan for Audience Response Systems.
• In Maharashtra, UNICEF supported a capacity gap analysis of 2100 ICDS supervisors to understand
effectiveness of communication strategies related to programme activities during COVID-19. Findings
from the analysis were used to inform the strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, UNICEF
leveraged findings from a rapid assessment with caregivers to their use of activities disseminated.
Analysis from both surveys was used to increase access to resources through digital platforms (such
as TV, IVRS, radio).
• UNICEF commissioned rapid assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic to understand gaps in the
reach and distribution of home-based learning kits and developed targeted approaches to address
the same. During this period, it also commissioned and supported school reopening surveys based on
state-wise strategies for safe reopening of schools
Source: RAM Reports
Additionally, UNICEF also engaged in dissemination of evidence generated as part of its programmes through
development of policy briefs, which were further used for generating awareness and advocacy. For instance,
in Assam, UNICEF developed policy briefs on quality ECE in the state. Regional analysis on areas such as Bodo
land and tea garden districts capture differences within the state and help the state in planning interventions
and integrating equity into the programming process. In Odisha, UNICEF created a costed plan in partnership
with Pratham on second chance learning opportunities for marginalised children in the 15-19 age group, with
specific focus on girls. The findings of the costed plan were then converted to policy briefs to conduct
advocacy with the state government for the intervention.
While external stakeholders recognised the UNICEF’s role as a knowledge partner, a more systematic
approach to evidence generation, utilisation and dissemination was highlighted during discussions. The
unique position of UNICEF and its associations with technical institutes, research organisations and academic
institutions has made them key partner for data and evidence generation. However, there emerged a need
for UNICEF to convene efforts to build a more enabling environment for collective learning with all
development partners in the education sector, including government, donors and CSOs. Furthermore, while
we have qualitative evidence through consultations on research utilisation, there is no articulated strategy
in the Education Programme for using evidence generated through research and evaluation for wider policy-
level changes and commitments.
The evaluation team also noted certain drawbacks with the internal mechanisms for learning and sharing
of best practice. The RAM template in its current format does not allow for the Programme team to report
on unique innovations in state programming. Internal stakeholders also reported that although the
monitoring structure is well-established and followed, efforts to synthesise lessons from the RAM should be
improved. Further, UNICEF staff and consultants expressed the need for better structuring of network
84
meetings to allow for more opportunity to present best practices and deliberate on learnings or process
changes that could help improve planning around sustainability, policy advocacy, convergence and
engagements/ partnerships with the government and other stakeholders.

4.1 Overview
The findings from the contribution tracing are relevant for Evaluation Question 2.1 and specifically for the
sub-evaluation question EQ 2.1.4 -To what extent has UNICEF support contributed to the broader national
and state-level priorities? However, given the unique nature of the methodology and the case study approach
taken by the evaluation team, the findings from the Contribution Tracing are presented in a separate chapter
in the report.
This section presents the findings from the Contribution Tracing to two high-level questions posed by UNICEF
ICO, examining outputs related to two key components of the Education Programme.
• Contribution Claim 1 (Responsive Parenting): Increased awareness among ICDS officials as a result of
UNICEF’s technical support has led to increased programming around responsive parenting
• Contribution Claim 2 (Out-of-School Children): UNICEF Education Programme’s technical support to
identify and map out-of-school children has led to strengthened delivery of special training programmes.
The claim on responsive parenting was tested in three states – Maharashtra, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh while
the claim on out-of-school children was tested in two states – Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. For each claim, the
evaluation team developed a series of ‘hypothesised causal chain,’ using ‘process tracing’ and competing
hypotheses or rival claims to be tested. The evaluation team then specified the evidence we would expect or
like to see for each component of the causal chain if the ‘hypothesis’ was true. The data collection by the
evaluation team then focused on collating evidence. As described in Section 2 and Annexure 5, the analysis
focused on assessing each piece of evidence for both the level of confidence that this evidence exists when
the claim is true (sensitivity) as well as the level of confidence that this evidence might exist even if the claim
is false (type I Error). More information on Sensitivity and Type 1 error values and the parameters for
assigning values are presented in Annexure 6. The values were then plugged into the Bayesian formula to
measure confidence in the contribution claims and to update the measures of confidence based on emerging
knowledge. Table 20 provides the qualitative rubric that was applied to interpret the quantitative scores of
the level of confidence.
Table 20: Qualitative Description of the Level of Confidence
Practically certain that () is true 0.99+
Reasonably certain that () is true 0.95 – 0.99
Highly confident that () is true 0.85 – 0.95
Cautiously confident that () is true 0.70 – 0.85
More confident than not confident that () is true 0.50 – 0.70
Neither confident nor not confident that () is true (or false) – no idea 0.5
More confident than not confident that () is false 0.30 – 0.50
Cautiously confident that () is false 0.15 – 0.30
Highly confident that () is false 0.05 – 0.15
Reasonably certain that () is false 0.01 – 0.05
Practically certain that () is false Less than 0.01
The findings from Contribution Tracing analysis are structured along the various components of the
hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis before presenting the evaluation team’s assessment of the overall
confidence in the claim and causal mechanism as a whole.
87
4.2 Increased awareness among ICDS officials as a result of
UNICEF’s technical support has led to increased programming
around responsive parenting
Summary of the Contribution: The evaluation found low confidence in the causal claim that UNICEF’s
technical support has led to increased awareness of responsive parenting among ICDS officials, resulting
in increased programming around this area. The low confidence is due to the lack of evidence on UNICEF’s
advocacy with government functionaries and points to the need for more documentation of such activities.
However, we are ‘practically certain’ that UNICEF’s direct technical and financial support has led to
increased programming around responsive parenting, which was explored as an alternate hypothesis to
the causal link.
The first contribution claim on responsive parenting was broken down into three components or hypotheses:
• H1: UNICEF delivered technical support to the ICDS officials at all levels on parental engagement and
responsive parenting
• H2: There is increased awareness about parental engagement and responsive parenting among ICDS
officials at all levels due to UNICEF technical support
• H3: Increased awareness among ICDS officials, at the state level has led to increased programming
around responsive parenting
For this claim, two alternate hypothesis or explanation was explored in all three states:
• AH1: The pandemic and extended closures of schools and anganwadi centres (ECE centres) necessitated
the funding and implementation of parenting programmes focused on engaging parents to support
education and learning environments
• AH2: Direct technical and financial support provided by UNICEF has led to increased programming or
activities around responsive parenting within the ICDS department
4.2.1 Findings on the hypotheses
Table 21 illustrates the different components of the claim and the assessment of the posterior confidence.
Table 21: Posterior Confidence of the Hypotheses of Claim 1 on Responsive Parenting
Hypothesis Maharashtra Odisha Uttar

H1: UNICEF delivered technical support to the ICDS officials at 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000
all levels on parental engagement and responsive parenting
H2:There is increased awareness about parental engagement 0.9233 0.9797 0.9891
and responsive parenting among ICDS officials at all levels due
to UNICEF technical and advocacy support
H3: Increased awareness among ICDS officials, at the state 0.1500 0.1500 0.1500
level has led to increased programming around responsive
parenting
We have summarised the evidence and findings around the different components of the claims.
Hypothesis 1: UNICEF delivered technical support to the ICDS officials at all levels on parental engagement
and responsive parenting.
88
The posterior confidence in this component of the claim is 1.00 (Practically Certain) – this implies that based
on the evidence observed, we are ‘practically certain’ that UNICEF extended technical support to the ICDS
officials at all levels on parental engagement and responsive parenting.
There is strong evidence that UNICEF extended technical support on parental engagement and responsive
parenting in terms of capacity building of anganwadi workers, CDPOs, state-level master trainers, supervisors
and caregivers (Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha), contributed towards the development of training
manuals and handbooks (in Maharashtra), extended technical assistance to develop a tool to monitor the
quality implementation and reach and efficacy of Responsive Caregiving Programme (in Maharashtra) and
developed content and resource materials to implement responsive parenting activities such as activity
calendars (in Odisha).
The documentary evidence ranged from letters and written messages from the relevant department of ICDS
to government orders, handbooks, toolkits, materials and presentations prepared by the implementing
partners or directly by UNICEF. The type and nature of evidence varied based on the programming context
in each state. For example, in Maharashtra, we collected documentary evidence from UNICEF as well as the
implementing partner, while in Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, we relied more on government documents, such
as letters. A detailed description of documents and evidence of the nature of technical support is outlined in
the table 22.
Table 22: Evidence of capacity building on parental engagement and responsive parenting
Uttar • Letters received from the Department of Integrated Child Development Services
Pradesh provide evidence regarding the training and capacity-building programmes
conducted with support from UNICEF for anganwadi workers and TSG members
Odisha • The ECD case study document by the ICDS department outlines the technical
support provided by UNICEF towards the design of responsive parenting-related
activities
• Materials on activities for parental engagement in children’s education (such as
Kuni calendar) include UNICE’'s logo as an acknowledgement of UNICEF's
support
• Letter of the partnership between the government institute and UNICEF
describing the adaptation of responsive parenting activities in 17 non-dominant
mother tongue-based languages
Maharashtra • The PCA, with the implementing partner, provide evidence of the activities
supported by UNICEF to strengthen the capacity of ICDS for responsive
parenting, including training and capacity-building activities, the development of
resource materials and handbook for anganwadi workers. It also provides
evidence of the support provided by UNICEF to develop a tool for monitoring
the quality of the implementation of the responsive parenting programme
• Presentation by the implementing partner providing an update on the activities
implemented with support of UNICEF to build the capacity of anganwadi
workers, CDPOs, supervisors and state-level master trainers.
• The newsletter by the implementing partner provides evidence of the ‘reach’ of
the support to strengthen the capacity of the anganwadi workers
• Handbook on responsive care and parenting programme for anganwadi workers
is evidence of technical support provided by UNICEF towards creating guidelines
for programme implementation
• Government Orders/ letters from the ICDS department at the state level inviting
officials for training on responsive parenting
The interviews with the relevant external stakeholders in the states also validated and strengthened the
evidence base of the technical support provided by UNICEF.
89
“I have also received 3-4 kinds of training on ECCE from UNICEF which placed a lot of importance on
parenting and mother tongue based ECCE.”
“The focus on parenting in training has increased recently.”
“With the technical support received from UNICEF, we have developed a handbook for anganwadi
workers.”
“For responsive parenting, we made some posters, and designed a mascot called Tiki Mausi. This was a
local animated female character who will reach out to the parents and build awareness among the parents
that they have to teach their children. She would tell the parents about the importance of early childhood
education. In all these practices, it was UNICEF who provided us input, prepared the material, and provided
feedback.”
Hypothesis 2: There is increased awareness about parental engagement and responsive parenting among
ICDS officials at all levels due to UNICEF technical support.
The posterior confidence in this component of the claim ranged from 0.9233 in Maharashtra to 0.9891 in
Uttar Pradesh. Based on the evidence received for Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, we are 'reasonably certain' that
there has been increased awareness about parental engagement and responsive parenting among the ICDS
officials due to UNICEF’s technical support. In Maharashtra, the posterior value of 0.9233 implies that we are
'highly confident' that this component of the claim is true.
We were able to draw evidence on the 'increased awareness' primarily through interviews with the relevant
government stakeholders at the state and district levels. The interviews at the state level sought to
understand the stakeholders' perception of increased awareness among government officials at the state
and district levels. In contrast, interviews at the district level reported self-awareness or improved awareness
among the caregivers. In Maharashtra, confidence was marginally lower than in the other two states, as the
evaluation team had limited opportunities to interact with officials at the district level.
"During the last 3 years, we have seen some changes. For example, we understood that the children are
coming to Anganwadi centers only for 3-4 hours, but they are with their parents the rest of the time. So, if
we are aware of how to do parenting, it will have a good impact on our child. The learning outcome and
behaviour of the child have been changed due to this type of intervention."
- KII Respondent
Hypothesis 3: Increased awareness among ICDS officials, at the state level has led to increased
programming around responsive parenting.
The posterior confidence in this component of the claim is 0.15 in all states. This implies that based on the
available evidence, we are 'highly confident' that this hypothesis is false. To find evidence for this
component, the evaluation team posed questions to the key informants at the state level on changes that
happened in the department or programming due to increased awareness on parental engagement and on
responsive parenting. However, the respondents couldn't confirm this hypothesis. One key reason could be
that much of the training or capacity-building work around responsive parenting or parental engagement
was already linked to an activity or programme, supported by UNICEF. The absence of documentary evidence
means that the evaluation team was not able to access sufficient data, and the limited timeframe of the
project also meant that the evaluation team was unable to seek additional information from the key
informants to establish the causal link of increased awareness leading to increased programming.
90
The absence of documentary evidence indicates the need for additional efforts for evidence generation and
documentation. The evaluation team was not provided evidence of policy advocacy efforts conducted by
UNICEF that could have translated into 'improved awareness' among the ICDS officials. Research on the
outcome of advocacy efforts of UNICEF to inform policy or programme, feedback reports from the
participants of the training, capacity gap assessments and better documentation of meeting minutes
addressing advocacy efforts could have strengthened the evidence for this component.
4.2.1 Findings on the Alternate Hypothesis
The table 23 presents the assessment of posterior confidence for the alternate hypothesis that was explored
for this claim.
Table 23: Posterior Confidence for the Alternate Hypotheses for Claim 1 on Responsive Parenting
Hypothesis Maharash Odisha Uttar
tra Pradesh
AH1: Pandemic and extended closures of schools and Anganwadi 0.9698 0.9995 1.0000

implementation of parenting programmes focused on engaging
parents to support education and learning environments.
AH2: Direct technical and financial support provided by UNICEF 0.9995 0.9995 0.9996
has led to to increased programming or activities around
responsive parenting within ICDS department.
AH1: Pandemic and extended closures of schools and Anganwadi centres (ECE centres) necessitated the
funding and implementation of parenting programmes focused on engaging parents to support education
and learning environments.
The posterior confidence of the alternate claim ranged from 0.97 in Maharashtra to 1.00 in Uttar Pradesh.
Based on the evidence observed, we are highly confident in Maharashtra, and 'practically certain' in Odisha
and Uttar Pradesh that this alternate claim is true.
Document review and key informant interviews highlight the facilitating
"During COVID period, we
role that pandemic played in initiating activities or scaling up programmes

around responsive parenting. For example, the Ghare Ghare Arunima and Ghare Ghare Arunima"
calendar implemented by the Odisha government was meant to deliver
- KII Respondent
home-based play-way, an interactive method of education during the
extended closure of anganwadi centre during the pandemic. In Maharashtra, responsive parenting
programmes (such as the Ankur programme) was launched in 2018 and hence the focus on responsive
parenting predates covid. However, with covid, there was a digital adaptation of the Ankur programme which
helped with the programme's scale and state-wide implementation. During Covid, the videos on different
aspects of child development were circulated to anganwadi workers, who then shared them with parents
and caregivers via WhatsApp or during home visits. Prior to the closures of the anganwadi centres during the
pandemic, these activities were demonstrated in bimonthly parent meetings at the pre-primary centres by
the anganwadi workers to the parents.
However, evidence also indicates that UNICEF played a vital role in supporting these initiatives during the
pandemic. For example, UNICEF extended financial support for the content development and digitisation of
the content for the Ankur programme in Maharashtra. In addition, the technical support extended by UNICEF
for the design of the Ghare Ghare Arunima calendar has been outlined under Hypothesis 1.
"Ghare Ghare Arunima was developed by UNICEF for 3-6 years of children during COVID period."
91
"During covid, the work done by UNICEF came in front of everyone. Though they are working in multiple
fields but during covid we saw their effectiveness. Through the medium of Baal Pitara, calendar for parents,
the responsive parenting work was done. They visited the area and were in contact with Anganwadi
workers and us. So, they helped a lot during Corona"
AH2: Direct technical and financial support provided by UNICEF has led to increased programming or
activities around responsive parenting within ICDS department.
The posterior confidence in this component of the claim ranged from 0.995 in Maharashtra to 0.9996 in Uttar
Pradesh. Based on the evidence received, we are 'practically certain' that there has been increased
programming or activities around responsive parenting in all three states due to UNICEF’s direct technical
assistance. There is strong evidence that UNICEF's direct technical and financial support has led to increased
programming or activities around responsive parenting within the ICDS department as outlined below:
• In Uttar Pradesh, 'Dular programme' on responsive caregiving and early learning programme for parents
of children from birth to six years received support from UNICEF. This programme used an innovative
Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR) mechanism to reach out to parents. Another initiative on responsive
parenting in Uttar Pradesh was called 'Khushi Ki Chaupal', a community-based meeting to discuss
activities around early childhood education with the parents. UNICEF also supported this initiative and
the development of 'Bal Pitara' app that provided access to responsive parenting packages (32-week
calendar)
• In Odisha, UNICEF supported the ICDS department to launch 'Vatsalya' – a home-based, parent-led early
stimulation programme. UNICEF also extended technical support for the Ghare Ghare Arunima and Kunis'
calendar which provided a calendar-based list of activities for children in various age categories, to be
implemented with support from parents and grandparents at home.
• In Maharashtra, UNICEF extended technical and financial support and worked with its implementing
partner to support the design, implementation and monitoring of the Ankur- Responsive Caregiving
Programme in 2018 The package includes activities from all the domains of development- physical
development, sensory, cognitive and perceptual development, creativity, language, literacy, and
communication, personal, social and emotional development to help establish a play-based learning
routine for children at home.
For this component, we have considered two types of evidence: documentary evidence and key informant
interviews. The description of the documentary evidence is provided in table 24.
Table 24: Evidence of Technical Support Extended by UNICEF for Programming Around Responsive Parenting
Uttar • Instructional letters from the ICDS department on Bal Pitara, Dular and ECCE
Pradesh Chaupal activities which refers to UNICEF’s contribution
• Government Orders to the ICDS officers at the district level outlining activities to
be undertaken under the responsive parenting packages referencing UNICEF
developed material or handbook
Odisha • The talking points of the Principal Secretary provides an overview of all the
responsive parenting interventions implemented by the states such as Kuni
Calendar and men-streaming and acknowledge UNICEF as the technical
partner in the programme
• ICDS plan provides progress on the implementation of Vatsalya campaign,
mother tongue-based responsive parenting, Happy parenting, posters, Ghare
Ghare Arunima and Kuni Calendar, draft ECCE Policy
• The ECD case study documented by the ICDS department describes the
responsive parenting interventions (Kuni Calendar) and acknowledges
UNICEF’s role in supporting the intervention.
92
• The letter from the Principal Secretary to the DSWOs informs the release of
the ‘Ghare Ghare Arunima’ calendar and provides evidence of implementation
of responsive parenting-related activities in the state
Maharashtra • The PCA between UNICEF and the implementing partner describes the
partnership for piloting and scale up responsive parenting packages in
Maharashtra and the financial support extended by UNICEF towards the
programme
• Handbook on responsive care and parenting programme for anganwadi workers
provide evidence of UNICEF’s partnerships with ICDS to implement the Ankur
Responsive Caregiving Programme to help establish a play-based learning
routine for children at home. It also describes the activities included under the
responsive parenting package.
• Presentation by the implementing partner on the responsive parenting
programme – Ankur acknowledges UNICEF’s financial contribution towards the
programme implementation
• The newsletter by the implementing partner provides evidence of the various
activities conducted as part of responsive parenting and acknowledges UNICEF’s
role through co-branding and inclusion of UNICEF logo
The testimonies from the government stakeholders and implementing partners at the state level also provide
evidence of increased activities or programming around responsive parenting on account of UNICEF’s
support.
“Universalising the responsive parental programme in a big way, not through only one medium but using
different channels, like Dular or Khushi ki Chaupal. So, these things went well.”
“We got so many benefits from the Chaupal meeting. Parents of children aged between 3 to 6 years old
attend the meeting. In meetings, we teach activities by the medium of story, and the parents repeat it with
their children. The benefit of the Chaupal meeting is that the number of students has increased, and parents
now know the importance of Anganwadi. UNICEF helped us in achieving this.”
“UNICEF ran a pilot, and based on this pilot, quite a number of activities were later designed and developed.
UNICEF has given technical support and funding also. The design and implementation of the Aarambh and
Ankur programs on responsive parenting, training and capacity building etc. was done by UNICEF. So, the
foundation was laid by UNICEF and later implemented by the state.
"Ghare Ghare Arunima has reached homes across the state thanks to the excellent partnership between
UNICEF and the state government."
"It was UNICEF that developed resources and materials like Kuni Calendars, Nua Arunima etc. We could
not have strengthened ECCE in our state without the support of UNICEF."
4.2.2 Assessment of the Overall Claim
To quantify confidence in the claim as a whole, we have to take the lowest confidence value for an individual
component, which is Hypothesis 3. This is because, in Contribution Tracing, the overall claim as a whole is
the logical intersection of all components and its overall strength is thus dependent on the weakest link. In
summary, our confidence in the causal mechanism that increased awareness around responsive parenting
due to UNICEF's technical support has led to increased programming and activities within the ICDS
department is low.
While the causal link between increased awareness and increased programming is weak, there is strong
evidence of UNICEF's direct financial and technical support to increasing responsive parenting interventions
93
– which was explored as an alternate hypothesis. The confidence score for this ranges between 0.995 (in
Maharashtra and Odisha) and 0.996 in Uttar Pradesh. This implies that we are 'practically certain' in that this
hypothesis is true. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that pandemic-led school closure has necessitated
the funding and implementation of responsive parenting programmes to support education and learning
environments, the role of UNICEF during this pandemic couldn't be ignored and was also well acknowledged
during the discussions.
Hence, there is strong evidence to uphold the UNICEF's technical and financial support in increasing
programming around responsive parenting. The absence of evidence provides directions towards the
strengthening evidence base of UNICEF's interventions. Strengthening monitoring and feedback data from
the training participants and implementing evaluation of the advocacy efforts would have increased the
confidence in the causal mechanism.
4.3 UNICEF Education Programme's technical support to
identify and map out-of-school children has led to
strengthened delivery of special training programmes.
Summary of the Contribution: The confidence in the causal claim that UNICEF’s support has led to
increased identification and mapping of out-of-school children and in turn, resulted in strengthened
delivery of special training programmes is low. As with the first claim, this is due to the absence of evidence
linking increased mapping to strengthened delivery. However, evidence confirms that UNICEF’s direct
technical and financial support ‘certainly’ led to improved quality of special training programmes.
The main objective of the claim was to establish UNICEF's contribution towards strengthening of special
training programmes and exploring if there are reasonable 'casual links' between the improved tracking and
mapping of out-of-school children with the strengthened delivery of special training programmes. The
contribution claim was broken down into the three main components or hypotheses.
• H1: UNICEF provided technical and financial support to the Department of Education and NGOs to
develop technology-based and other solutions for mapping, tracking and identification of out-of-
school children
• H2: UNICEF-supported technology-based and other solutions have led to better tracking and
identification of out-of-school children by the Department of Education and other relevant
departments, such as the Directorate of Mass Education
• H3: Increased tracking and mapping of out-of-school children, as a result of UNICEF-supported
technology-based and other solutions has led to strengthened delivery of special training
programmes
For this claim, three alternate explanations were investigated.
• AH1: GOs/ CSOs/CBOs/ social activists independent of UNICEF, including their technical and advocacy
efforts has to led to strengthened delivery of special training programmes for out-of-school children
at the state and district level (Tested in both Uttar Pradesh and Bihar)
• AH2: Focus on identification and mainstreaming of out-of-school children as part of state plans for
the elimination of child labour has led to strengthened delivery of special training programmes
(Tested only in Bihar)
• AH3: The direct technical and financial support provided by UNICEF has led to the strengthened
delivery of special training programmes (Tested in both Uttar Pradesh and Bihar)
94
In Bihar, the presence of the State Action Plan for Elimination of Child Labour was identified as a possible
rival claim for improved out-of-school children programming and strengthened delivery of special training
programmes through document review and consultations with the UNICEF ICO. Hence, this alternate
hypothesis was explored in the state.
4.3.1 Findings on the hypotheses
Table 25 presents the assessment of the posterior confidence for the different components of the claim.

H3: Increased tracking and mapping of out-of-school children, as a result 0.2436 0.0005
of UNICEF-supported technology-based and other solutions, has led to
strengthened delivery of special training programmes
In the subsequent sections, we have presented the findings and evidence for the different components of
the claims.
H1: UNICEF provided technical and financial support to the Department of Education and NGOs to develop
technology-based and other solutions for mapping, tracking and identification of out-of-school children.
The posterior confidence in this component of the claim is 0.999 in both Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Based on
the evidence from documentary review and KIIs we are 'practically certain' that UNICEF extended technical
and financial support to the Department of Education and NGOs to develop technology-based and other
solutions for mapping, tracking and identification of out-of-school children.
In Bihar, UNICEF supported the development of the BEST app – a real-time monitoring of elementary schools,
including a module on out-of-school children. Furthermore, UNICEF was closely involved with Bihar Education
Project Council to provide technical support on data formats used by district officials to capture data on
migration and out-of-school children and supported the data collection, analysis, and reporting. UNICEF also
extended technical support on conducting validation checks and systems to improve the reliability and
credibility of the data.
In Uttar Pradesh, UNICEF extended technical support to the Department of Basic Education to develop the
SHARDA portal and app that helps identify out-of-school children, ensure their re-enrolment, assess their
learning levels, and mainstream them through special education training and track their overall progress.
Additionally, UNICEF has extended technical and financial support to conduct household surveys to identify
out-of-school children in the state.
The documents collated by the evaluation team and the evidence presented in these documents are
summarised in the table 26.

BEST app and household surveys to track out-of-school children
• Government Order issued by the Department of Mass Education to all the
district programming officers providing guidance on the data template for
mapping out-of-school children
• Bihar Education Project Council Minutes of the meeting provide evidence of
UNICEF's participation towards conducting sample surveys through mobile app,
creating a database on out-of-school children as well as technical support
provided by UNICEF towards data collection, analysis, and reporting.
• Guidelines developed by UNICEF to conduct household surveys and describing
the process for conducting validation checks on data
• Documents received from UNICEF confirming the financial support extended to a
technical agency to support the out-of-school-children data format and data
validation
• Government Order by the Bihar Education Project Council to the district officials
on the use of the BEST app and the data templates to mapping the out-of-school
children
Uttar • The State Plan 2020-21 by the Department of Basic Education which includes a
Pradesh chapter on out-of-school children acknowledges UNICEF's technical support
towards the formulation of guidelines and developing software and portal for
data entry and multi-level monitoring.
• Instructional letter from the Department of Basic Education to the district
officials on the SHARDA portal and app
Select testimonies from the key informant interviews evidencing UNICEF's support towards developing
solutions – technology and traditional surveys for mapping, tracking and identifying out-of-school children
are presented below.
"We have worked a lot on SHARDA app and developing a portal with the help of UNICEF."
"We have UNICEF supported team who visits and investigates the children who are still not going to school.
Through household surveys, these children are identified and registered."
"Key contribution of UNICEF is the resource and technical support provided for conducting surveys and
studies on the out-of-school children."
"The UNICEF programme is important. At the time when the Government of India portal wasn't ready, we
used to capture the data with paper and pencil. It was hectic and challenging to put the data on paper. To
reduce such issues, the application was created by UNICEF. The application did work well on the ground."
H2: UNICEF-supported technology-based and other solutions have led to better tracking and identification
of out-of-school children by the Department of Education and other relevant departments such as
Directorate of Mass Education.
The posterior confidence in this component of the claim is 0.85 in Bihar and 0.9698 in Uttar Pradesh. Based
on the evidence received, we are 'highly confident' in Bihar and 'reasonably certain' in Uttar Pradesh.
96
To assess this component of the claim, the evaluation team, during the KIIs, sought to understand external
stakeholders' perceptions concerning the benefits or utility of the systems and process for mapping out-of-
school children supported by UNICEF. The evaluation team also examined the documents to find evidence of
improved tracking and mapping of out-of-school children; however, the documentary evidence was limited
to presenting quantitative data on out-of-school children, and a pre-post analysis was not possible.
Furthermore, the situation of out-of-school children was complicated by Covid, and extended school
closures, which could have resulted in higher data reporting. Hence, the evidence for assessment is drawn
from the consultations.
Interviews with government stakeholders and implementing partners emphasised the advantage of the
technology-based solutions developed with UNICEF support to improve the monitoring of the out-of-school
children and their progress, as evidenced in the testimonies below.
"We have identified many children, enrolled them in the nearby schools, and try to reduce the gap in
education through the special training programme. For this, a portal was also made, which was developed
by the UNICEF."
"Today we have complete details of every single child. You can access the data anywhere. 95% of the
teachers use the mobile app to feed the data daily. The government is now encouraging and promoting
teachers who identify a greater number of out-of-school children. So, such environment building has been
done to bring out-of-school children into the mainstream. Now we identify around 4-5 lakhs of the out-of-
school children yearly."
"Due to the technological intervention, we can easily focus on the block, district, school-wise data. Earlier,
when we asked for the data, we used to receive the data manually. Through the technology, we receive
evidence-based genuine data that we upload in the portal that increased the figures of the data of the
children."
H3: Increased tracking and mapping of out-of-school children, as a result of UNICEF-supported technology-
based and other solutions, has led to strengthened delivery of special training programmes.
To assess this component of the claim, we relied on documents and KIIs. Documents provided evidence of
the contribution of the UNICEF's direct technical support towards strengthening the special training
programmes. During the KIIs, the evaluation team probed on the improved tracking and mapping of the out-
of-school children and its significance for strengthening the special training programme. The evaluation team
found some evidence from the interviews that the mapping and tracking process was an important aspect of
strengthening the special training programme. Since the key informants were free to identify any factors that
they thought were relevant to strengthening the special training programme, more evidence from the
interviews pointed towards the importance of UNICEF's direct support.
More research on the effects and utilisation of the tracking and mapping system for out-of-school children
and evaluation of the out-of-school children programme and initiatives could strengthen this component of
the claim.

Alternate Hypotheses Bihar
Pradesh
AH1: The activities of other NGOs/ CSOs/CBOs/ social activists, including 0.1598 0.0029
their technical and advocacy efforts, have led to strengthened delivery of
special training programmes for out-of-school children at the state and
district level.
AH2. Focus on identification and mainstreaming of out-of-school children as 0.0001 NA
part of state plans for the elimination of child labour has led to strengthened
delivery of special training programmes
AH3:The direct technical and financial support provided by UNICEF has led 1.000 0.9996
to the strengthened delivery of the special training programmes
The evaluation team explored three potential alternate hypotheses and found no evidence to support the
first two hypotheses. The evidence for the first two alternate hypotheses was drawn from the interviews
with the key stakeholders – the evaluation team, during the KIIs, probed for other factors that could have
potentially contributed to the strengthened delivery of the special training programmes. Both documentary
and KIIs were considered evidence for the third alternate hypothesis.
AH1: The activities of other NGOs/ CSOs/CBOs/ social activists, including their technical and advocacy
efforts, have led to strengthened delivery of special training programmes for out-of-school children at the
state and district level.
To draw evidence for the first alternate hypothesis, the evaluation team enquired about other organisations
that the stakeholder knew about that worked on issues related to out-of-school children and special training
programmes and the nature of support provided by these organisations. During the interviews, the
respondents mentioned other organisations that were providing similar training or support to that of UNICEF,
such as implementing special training programmes, supporting the capacity building of the community
volunteer or operating mobile learning centres. However, the organisations referenced during the
consultations were partners of UNICEF with whom they have financial partnerships. Hence, no information
was found to substantiate this alternate hypothesis. Therefore, the probative value of 0.1598 in Bihar implies
that we are 'cautiously certain', and 0.0029 in Uttar Pradesh means 'practically certain' that this alternate
hypothesis is false.
AH2. Focus on identification and mainstreaming of out-of-school children as part of state plans for the
elimination of child labour has led to strengthened delivery of special training programmes
The second alternate hypothesis sought to understand the significance of the State Action Plan for the
elimination of child labour in strengthening the delivery of special training programmes through discussions
with the stakeholders. The State Action Plan identified 'education' as key intervention strategy for reducing
and eliminating child labour. However, consultations with external stakeholders highlight that the education
department is responsible for providing access to education and remedial support on learning gaps to the
identified child labour or out-of-school children. This is achieved through convergence and coordination
between the labour and education departments. Hence, no information was found to substantiate this
alternate hypothesis. Therefore, the probative value of 0.999 in Bihar means that we are 'practically certain'
that this alternate hypothesis is not true.
AH3:The technical and financial support provided by UNICEF has led to the strengthened delivery of the
special training programmes.
98
The third alternate hypothesis sought to understand and assess if the direct technical and financial support
provided by UNICEF has led to the strengthened delivery of the special training programmes. The posterior
confidence in this component of the claim is 1.000 in Bihar and 0.9996 in Uttar Pradesh. Based on the
evidence received, we are 'practically certain' that the component of the claim is true. There is strong
evidence that UNICEF extended technical and financial support to strengthen special training programmes.
In Uttar Pradesh, UNICEF provided support to conduct training of the master trainers, SMC members, district
coordinators and teachers and develop learning and bridge course materials for the special training
programmes.
In Bihar, UNICEF extended technical and financial support to implement innovative programmes such as the
mobile library or 'school in the bus' to create an enabling learning environment for out-of-school children,
build the capacity of community volunteer (Shiksha Sevak or Tola Sevaks) on remedial support for out-of-
school children, develop training modules and conduct training of master trainers through the state
institutions, provide technical inputs to review and revise flexible learning guidelines and establish mobile
learning centres for mainstreaming of out-of-school children in seven districts in partnership with
implementing partners.
The documentary evidence to substantiate this alternate hypothesis and the description of the evidence in
the documents is outlined in the table 28.
Table 28: Evidence of UNICEF’s support to strengthening Special Training Programmes
Bihar • Letter from UNICEF addressed to the Bihar Education Project Council outlining
funding support to develop training modules and train master trainers
• Letter from Bihar Education Project Council informing UNICEF of the capacity
building programme for master trainer conducted and requesting for release of
funds
• Letter from the State Project Director, Bihar Education Project Council informing
the district officials of the establishment of the mobile learning centres by
UNICEF in partnership with the select NGOs
• Minutes of the meeting from the Bihar Education Project Council referencing
UNICEF support in the review and revision of the flexible learning modules,
training module and guidelines and also referencing UNICEF staff as participants
in the meeting
• Letter(s) from Bihar Education Project Council informing the district officials of
the training workshops for the Tola/ Shiksha Sevaks that will be conducted with
support from UNICEF
Uttar • The State Plan 2020-21 outlines the training of master trainers on special training
Pradesh and nodal teachers with support from UNICEF
• Guideline outlining the special training programme for out-of-school children
The evaluation team has triangulated the evidence from the document review through interviews with the
key stakeholders. Select quotes from the interview provided below will strengthen the evidence of the
support provided by UNICEF towards strengthening the special training programme.
"UNICEF has supported in conducting training programmes for the teachers and Tola Sevaks as well. In
addition, they aided us by providing materials."
"With UNICEF, we had a campaign on out-of-school children, and the main medium for this campaign was
our bus. So, in this bus we have a library with books in both Hindi and English language for the primary
students. They can also read and spend some time playing on our bus. The children are welcome to
participate in the sports. The bus is multipurpose like we make a shed with space with a favourable
99
atmosphere. Then after that, some children like to paint or draw; we also have materials like colours in the
bus. We also have laptops on our bus."
"UNICEF came with 3 teams and within 13 days, they visited 75 districts and trained the 9000 nodal
teachers on out-of-school children. The result was huge. So, it’s not only the technical support but also
reaching out to all the 75 districts, with teams, time, quality support and handholding at the block level."
4.3.3 Assessment of the Overall Claim
The overall confidence for the claim is determined by the lowest confidence value among the hypotheses,
which is Hypothesis 3 in this case. In summary, we are 'cautiously confident' in Bihar and 'practically certain'
that the causal link between improved tracking and mapping of out-of-school children and strengthened
delivery of special training programmes is false. More documented evidence on the impact of the improved
provision of detailed data and evidence on out-of-school children in the education system could strengthen
the causal claim.
While the causal link between improved tracking and mapping of out-of-school children and strengthened
delivery of special training programmes is weak, there is strong evidence of UNICEF's direct financial and
technical support to strengthening special training programmes – which was explored as an alternate
hypothesis. In Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, we are 'practically certain' that this is true.
The evaluation team found no evidence to validate the other two alternate hypotheses; hence, it has been
ruled out.

05. CONCLUSIONS
101
This chapter presents the overall conclusions based on summarised evidence and findings of the evaluation.
These are presented in line with the evaluation objectives outlined in the ToR.
5.1 Achievement of UNICEF's Education Programme in the
priority areas of Early Childhood Education, Out-of-School
Children and Quality Teaching and Learning
The evaluation assessed the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and coherence of the UNICEF
Education Programme in achieving the intended results and outcomes across the three priority areas.
Overall, the Education Programme across the six output areas and the intervention strategies were relevant
to the national priorities and UNICEF's priorities as outlined in the Country Programme documents and
strategic plans. There is strong evidence that UNICEF's Education Programme has been effective in achieving
key results across the three priority areas over the last four years.
• Early Childhood Education: Analysis of monitoring data shows that achievement of results under this
area were mixed, and limited in some instances by the pandemic. The evaluation noted significant
technical and financial assistance for programming around the promotion of school readiness in the high-
burden and tribal typologies of states through interviews with external stakeholders and documentray
evidence from RAM. The key activties under this area revolved around formulation of guidelines on
operationalisation of ECE policies, revision of ECE curriculum, development of workbooks and other
interactive resources in line with the revised curriculum and estbalishment of responsive parenting
programmes for home-based learning, especially during the pandemic. These activities along with
capacity building and advocacy to improve service delivery has resulted in greater ownership and
increased involvement of ICDS functionaries in planning and programming related to ECE. However, the
evaluation found that certain planned activities such as the establishment of model anganwadi centres
were reported only in certain states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha.
• Out-of-School Children: Indicators related to programming for out-of-school children were reported to
be on track during the evaluation period. UNICEF’s key contribution under this area includes the
establishment and strengthening of data systems and training of relevant government functionaries to
track and identify out-of-school children, supporting alternative learning institutions such as madrasas
and the promotion of flexible learning programmes such as mobile learning centres during the pandemic.
In the high burden states, UNICEF’s contribution towards special training programmes to mainstream
out-of-school children was also noted by external stakeholders. These activities were reported to have
improved the ability of government stakeholders to understand and analyse data and develop
differential education plans to bring children back to schools.
• Quality Teaching and Learning: Most indicators relating to this pillar were reported to be ‘on track’ with
a few indicators, such as that on life skills training, being constrained due to the pandemic and associated
school closures. The evaluation noted UNICEF’s contribution in supporting state governments to develop
quality TLM in line with learning outcomes and demonstration of technical approaches to improve
pedagogical practices. External stakeholders also acknowledged UNICEF’s support towards other key
activities under this pillar, including technical assistance towards analysis of NAS data and dissemination
of its findings, training of government functionaries on learning assessments, strengthening the capacity
of supportive supervision groups to provide academic mentorship to teachers and initiatives aimed at
improving life skills including the development of the Career Guidance Portal. The evaluation also found
several instances of programmes set up to improve learning outcomes such as the Level-Based Learning
Programme in Maharashtra and the Reading Enhancement Programme in Assam. These activities have
reportedly increased the capacity of DIETs and other institutions to train, supervise and support teachers
and to develop targeted plans to improve learning outcomes based on assessment data.
102
The evaluation noted that the Education Programme was anchored in a mix of upstream and downstream
strategies across the three pillars. For any downstream activities, we suggest that UNICEF consider pilot
initiatives only in emerging areas of interest. For example, school security, planning for an emergency, and
readiness for future pandemics. Any pilot or innovative programmes should be undertaken by UNICEF
leveraging the resources (technical and financial resources) of the state governments, embed it within the
state teacher support institution SCERTs and from there, the results and findings leading to programmatic
actions through the agency of the SCERT down to the DIET and classrooms.
Consultations with internal and external stakeholders also highlighted the need to strengthen the link
between the downstream and upstream activities and clearly chart out a clear plan for sustainability that
clearly outline how learnings from these downstream activities can be scaled up effectively. The
sustainability plan should include UNICEF's assessment of the sustainability of the initiatives across
parameters such as key actors and partnerships, co-development of solutions, inclusion and user buy-in
(community participation), capacity building, funding, strategy and planning and scalability and replicability.
The sustainability plan should also clearly identify avenues for scalability, define the roles and responsibilities
of the partners and the timeframe for assessment and scale-up. Given the challenges associated with
frequent changes in the leadership and staff turnover in the Government, it is important for UNICEF to secure
agreement and buy-in from the relevant government institutions at the start of the programme to replicate
and/or scale-up its activities.
The evaluation noted that the external stakeholders, specifically government partners, valued UNICEF's
technical support across the three pillars, specifically in the areas of systems/ institutional strengthening
and strengthening evidence generation, learning and knowledge management. The implementing partners
valued UNICEF's role in policy advocacy. This provides a direction for UNICEF's strategic positioning for the
upcoming programme. UNICEF's role in the upcoming Country Programme can be centred around extending
technical support for implementation, monitoring, evidence generation, and policy advocacy. Furthermore,
the evaluation team also noted that UNICEF has contributed to a design of a range of policies and education
programmes, including the National Education Policy and NIPUN Bharat on foundational literacy and
numeracy and has successfully placed itself in key positions with the Government at all levels as a strategic
partner to guide Government's planning in the education sector. In the upcoming Country Programme,
UNICEF's role must be to ensure the operationalisation and effective implementation of these programmes
by supporting the Government in planning, resource mobilisation, and monitoring.
UNICEF's role during the pandemic was also noted to be relevant, and the interventions across the three
pillars were appropriate to respond to the needs of the Government to handle the crises. The evaluation
team also noted that selected innovations were made, and many lessons and best practices, including
technology innovations, new programmatic areas etc. were identified from UNICEF's response during the
crisis which is discussed in Section 6 of this report. Moving forward, UNICEF needs to strengthen its
leadership and internal capacity to respond to emergencies, and specific recommendations are provided in
Section 7 of this report.
The evaluation also noted that the internal coherence is weak, and UNICEF has opportunities to accelerate
its effectiveness by strengthening its multi-sectoral approach. UNICEF can create complementarities and
synergies within its programme by developing guidance for programmatic convergence, which also outlines
the plan for results monitoring. The evaluation also noted UNICEF had enabled inter-sectoral coordination
and collaboration of the Government in a limited area, such as early childhood education. However, UNICEF
can potentially add significant value to the upcoming Country Programme by strengthening the
Government's intersectoral approaches in the area of DRR, adolescent and skill education, life skills and
education in emergencies.
Partnership with Government at all levels and with implementing partners was a strength of this Education
Programme. However, UNICEF needs to strengthen its engagement with other donor organisations,
103
academic institutions and newly emerging actors in the education sector and leverage its comparative
advantage in the role of a convenor more effectively. The expectation of the external stakeholders is that
UNICEF should take a more proactive role in bringing together diverse actors to plan and implement
coordinated and collective actions in education.
UNICEF’s human resources seem well allocated and efficiently utilised as the external stakeholders
expressed satisfaction with the leadership and technical expertise of staff. In addition, staff of UNICEF was
noted to bring a strong experience of working with the government, and an understanding of how the system
works, in addition to strong technical and sectoral expertise. The evaluation team also noted that the
leadership of UNICEF at the state and national had played an important role in driving partnerships with
external stakeholders collaboratively and transparently. However, the responsiveness to the request and
needs of the partners was limited due limited technical capacity available at field offices, and the need to
build the capacity of the internal staff of UNICEF in emerging areas were highlighted by the external
stakeholders.
The evaluation team has also identified a range of best practices across the three pillars and cross-cutting
areas which is discussed in Section 6 of this report. However, the UNICEF's process for monitoring,
evaluation and learning requires strengthening, and certain amendments can be made to the reporting
systems. While the RAM reports allow largely for output-level reporting, and there are some provisions for
the inclusion of qualitative information describing best practices, innovative programmes and progress
updates, the template itself was noted by the internal stakeholders as being 'not user friendly'. The reporting
structure can be re-looked, and there can be flexibility for the inclusion of qualitative findings on enabling
and limiting factors, sustainability plan, challenges to sustainability etc. that could guide advocacy efforts
and replicability and scalability of the initiatives. More specific recommendations to improve the UNICEF's
capacity to learn and improve its programming is presented in Section 7 of the report.
5.2 Relevance of the State Typology-Based Approach
While the state typology-based programming approach was noted to be relevant to address the contextual
barriers in the three state typologies, the implementation of the approach was severely constrained due to
factors listed below:
• Absence of clarity among state Programme team on how the typology approach can guide programming.
• Learning and exchange of best practices within and across the typology were limited.
• Performing evidence-based advocacy and planning in the transition states were noted to be a challenge
due to funding constraints and the inability of states to undertake demonstrations or pilots. The need for
the transition states to undertake downstream activities in new and innovative programming areas was
noted.
The absence of a typology-based ToC, results framework or monitoring data hindered the ability of the
evaluation team to assess the effectiveness of the approach through secondary information. However,
findings from primary data collection point towards the need to revisit the state typology-based
programming approach for the upcoming Country Programme. Recommendation for improving this
approach is presented in Section 7 of the report.
5.3 Performance of UNICEF's Education Programme in
Integrating Gender and Equity Principles
Equity and gender have been articulated within the current Education Programme, and the evaluation noted
efforts directed towards addressing the needs of marginalised communities, out-of-school children and
gender-responsive education. These efforts were also confirmed and acknowledged by external stakeholders
104
. Equity dimensions were integrated into the Programme through a focus on integration of out-of-school
children and initatives to promote quality learning for children from marginalised communities, such as
development of multi-lingual TLM and revision of curriculum within madrasas. Integration of gender was
seen in the Programme through activities such as campaigns to address gender barriers to education and
specific activities focusing on out-of-school girl children, gendered review of text books etc.
However, the need for strong integration of gender and equity dimensions across all the elements of
Education Programme was highlighted by internal and external stakeholders. UNICEF’s strategies and
operations need to be more explicit with regard to gender-transformative programming and inclusive and
equitable quality education and learning. Specific recommendations to address gender and equity
dimensions are provided in Section 7 of the report.
5.4 Inputs for the Theory of Change (ToC) to Inform the
Development of UNICEF's Education Programme for the
Next Country Programme 2023-27.
As presented in Annexure 2.1, the UNICEF Programme Theory of Change (ToC) maps the challenges facing
the education goals of the states and potential areas of improvement through UNICEF-supported activities
and strategies. UNICEF's strategies to achieve these goals include developing institutional capacity to scale
up the delivery of quality education, leveraging decision-makers, communities, and other stakeholders to
reduce the proportion of out-of-school children and increase engagement in early childhood education. The
ToC elucidates the multiple change pathways originating from these strategies to the six output areas, the
three intermediate outcomes, and the overarching goals of the UNICEF Programme.
Based on the Programme ToC, background documents and extensive consultations with the stakeholders,
the evaluation team developed an evaluation ToC that laid out the channels for measurable change that
could be assessed as part of this evaluation, while taking stock of the role of the intervention activities,
assumptions (about reach and behaviour change) as well as external factors on the education outcomes. The
evaluators also identified the enabling and disabling assumptions about the reach and behaviour of key
stakeholders as well as the external factors. Lastly, there may be external factors completely outside of the
spheres of direct and indirect influence of the Programme. These external influences could partly explain the
reasons for the achievement of (barriers to) the educational sector goals in the areas, over and above the
contributions of the UNICEF Programme. This revised ToC, including the assumptions, risks and potential
external factors formed the foundation for developing detailed contribution claims for contribution analysis
and contribution tracing hypotheses. Refer to Section 2.2.1 for the reconstructed ToC.
The following suggestions are made by the evaluation team for the revision of the ToC for the upcoming
Education Programme:
• Consider capacity building as a vehicle for institutional and system strengthening that can capture an
array of activities or support extended by UNICEF. The evaluation findings show that the current model
of ToT-based capacity building has worked well at the individual level for master trainers, teachers, AWW
and SMC workers as well as at the institutional level for DIET, CRC, BRC etc. Capacity building should also
be viewed in combination with other key strategies such as technical support and partnerships, as these
strategies reinforce one another. Together they have contributed to all six outputs.
• Consider how technical support can improve institutional strengthening and capacity building. This
evaluation finds evidence that technical support—building technology-based solutions for improved
tracking out-of-school children, developing guidelines and improving monitoring data quality helped
achieve the intended results through strengthening the partners' institutional capacity.
105
• Future Programme ToC may also explore the role of technical support in promoting policy advocacy. This
evaluation found evidence of technical support, especially for pilot interventions, producing useful
evidence that fed into developing SOPs, guidelines, and upscaling interventions.
• In the current Programme, strong partnerships with various government departments, implementing
partners (CSO/ CBOs), other UNICEF programmes such as C4D, WASH, DRR, health, etc., and onboarding
strategic partners like AIR for technical support played a vital role in achieving results. However, the
current Programme ToC does not include any outcome or output in relation to partnerships. We
recommend UNICEF develop a partnership strategy at the ICO and the state level, and the future
Programme ToC identifies clear outputs and outcomes in relation to partnerships.
• UNICEF's financial support to government and implementing partners have helped leverage public and
external donor resources for certain activities. Future Programme ToC should include leveraging public
and other external resources as an output. Developing strong partnerships also play a vital role in
mobilising external finance, and hence the interrelationship between partnerships and financial support
should be captured explicitly.
• UNICEF's role in coordination, advocacy and facilitating convergence among various stakeholders
including the government is acknowledged by the key stakeholders. The future ToC should explicitly take
into account UNICEF's advocacy work, as well as its outputs, such as its participation in numerous
committees that provide inputs into policy and operationalise the policy.
• This evaluation found limited evidence on the utilisation of the research and evaluation to inform policy
or programme planning and implementation. The current ToC does not acknowledge UNICEF's role as an
agency driving research and learning agenda. The future Programme ToC should explicitly link UNICEF's
knowledge management function to a sector-wide research and learning agenda.

06. BEST PRACTICES
AND LESSONS LEARNED
107
6.1 Overview
This chapter includes a discussion of the best practices and lessons learnt from the evaluation, followed by
conclusion and recommendations extracted from the findings of the evaluations. We believe the learnings
will have a wider impact on UNICEF and can be leveraged for programming in the education sector and in
other sectoral works within ICO.
6.2 Best Practices
A. Technology solutions as enablers for increased coverage and improved monitoring of programmes: This
Education Programme has witnessed an increased use of technology-enabled solutions (partly explained by
COVID-19 disruptions to schooling) across various interventions, including e-training of the teachers, e-
content and learning materials, mobile apps for improved tracking of out-of-school children and delivery of
age-appropriate content through the use of audio-visual means. UNICEF has also successfully leveraged low-
cost technology solutions such as radios and televisions to impart education during the pandemic or use
interactive voice response (IVR) to engage parents in responsive parenting (in Odisha and Maharashtra). The
Diksha Portal of the Ministry of Education, which was supported by UNICEF, had a positive impact on
teachers' capacity and improved their access to digital content and curriculum. The career portal is another
innovation that strengthens school-to-work transition by providing students, parents and teachers with
information on career opportunities. In Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, UNICEF has successfully leveraged mobile
apps (for example BEST and SHARDA Portal, respectively) to better track and monitor out-of-school children.
UNICEF has also successfully leveraged technology solutions such as telemonitoring, WhatsApp and online
surveys to facilitate better data collection and strengthen the real-time monitoring capabilities of UNICEF.
For example, in Odisha, the telemonitoring method was deployed to track the utilisation and uptake of Kuni
Calendar (ECE responsive parental interventions) and understand the opportunities and barriers to parental
engagement in education.
The stakeholders consulted during the evaluation highlighted that the technology-led solutions have helped
to improve the learning environment, and enhanced access to educational materials and resources. It has
also resulted in larger outreach, coverage and scale-up of the Programme or interventions.
B. Strengthened institutional capacity to integrate DRR in education: There is a growing recognition of the
impact of climate change on the education system, specifically on the children's access to learning facilities,
physical health and well-being and their academic performance. In this Programme cycle, states like Odisha,
Bihar and Assam invested a lot of efforts towards strengthening the school safety programme. For example,
in Odisha, UNICEF supported the development of guidelines, standard operating procedures SOPs, training
modules and a handbook on disaster preparedness for improved mitigation, preparedness, and preparing a
disaster management plan for educational institutions. As a result, all schools in Odisha are required to
develop a disaster preparedness plan based on the guidelines of the Odisha Education Department. There
were also efforts towards integrating disaster management into the school curriculum. In Assam, UNICEF
supported the State Disaster Management Authority in developing guidelines for ensuring child-friendly
spaces in emergencies, in line with the National School Safety Policy guidelines.
C. Improved equity and access to education through mother-tongue based multi-lingual education: This
Education Programme also witnessed a focus on multi-lingual education. Consultations with the external
stakeholders during the evaluation noted that availability of instruction materials and delivery of instructions
in non-dominant languages has helped in improving the engagement of children and learning environment.
For example, in Odisha, early childhood education materials such as the ECE calendar activities etc. was
developed in Oriya and in over 15 non-dominant tribal language. In Assam, UNICEF supported the SCERT and
Samagra Shiksha in developing learning material in Bodo, Hindi and Bengali, in addition to Assamese. UNICEF
108
also supported language mapping efforts in Odisha that allowed the state to understand areas where
children face a language disadvantage and define appropriate strategies for formally including non-dominant
languages in teaching and learning. In addition, UNICEF supported the review and development of textbooks
in tribal and regional languages for children and the capacity strengthening of teachers in select states.
D. Integrating mental health and life skills within secondary education curriculum: In states like Tamil Nadu
and Uttar Pradesh, there was substantial focus on the emotional well-being of children, which was further
catalysed due to COVID-19. Tamil Nadu has successfully integrated life skills within the school curriculum
framework, ensuring the sustainability and ownership of the initiatives. In collaboration with an
implementing partner NalandaWay Foundation, UNICEF Tamil Nadu developed well-being and life skills
workbook for adolescents studying in standards 9-12, which was in line with UNICEF's Life Skills Framework
and adhered to the TNSCERT guidelines. The development of the materials and resources used a participatory
and collaborative approach involving teachers as resource persons. Furthermore, the ’Take it Eazy’
programme was launched with support from UNICEF in Tamil Nadu to address adolescents' emotional well-
being and life skills through stories and art. The programme uses IVRS technology to deliver stories that equip
students with coping strategies and handle stress(38). According to the findings of the evaluation, the
programme had resulted in significant increase in the overall well-being of the children, specifically in
emotion well-being, problem-solving ability, social relationship and decision-making ability.
E. Leveraging volunteers to enhance capacity and sustainability of the interventions: The current Education
Programme has witnessed multiple initiatives that leverage volunteer support to improve the learning
outcomes of children. These initiatives help address capacity gaps within the government systems (for
example, staff vacancy among teachers) and have positive implications for the efficiency and sustainability
of these initiatives. In Bihar, through the creation and capacity strengthening of Shiksha or Tola Sevak, a cadre
of volunteer workers, UNICEF and relevant government departments have strengthened their efforts
towards identifying, tracking and mainstreaming out-of-school children. This also has wider implications for
the sustainability of programmes as it augments the government and UNICEF technical resources. In Odisha,
the Alternative Learning and Mentorship Programme was launched during COVID(39) in collaboration with
State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) to bridge digital and learning gaps in the state
and reach the most marginalised children. The pre-service teachers studying for the diploma in elementary
education (D.El.Ed) extended teaching-learning support to the children in their community, thereby ensuring
continuity in education. These pre-service teachers mentored the students on curricular, co-curricular and
socio-emotional aspects. These pre-service teachers also acquired skills in 'multi-grade, multi-level classroom
management, use of the developed digitisation materials, exploring Diksha and Madhu app, school safety
and child protection issues and hygiene behaviour' through the ALMP programme’s training components.
F. Strengthening teacher capacity programmes through focus on active coaching and mentorships: UNICEF
continued its investment in teachers' capacity by launching capacity-building programmes on pedagogical
skills, classroom management, and practices. UNICEF Maharashtra supported the state SCERT to build a
professional development programme for teachers and other stakeholders in the education ecosystem.
However, following-up with the trainees to understand the challenges in applying the learning and tools were
limited and most often there was no refresher programme. This could be mitigated to some extent by
building active coaching and mentoring as part of the capacity building programme.
UNICEF Maharashtra launched the Kendra Pramukh Academic Leadership Program in collaboration with
SCERT and with technical support from Centre for Equity and Quality in Universal Education (CEQUE). The
Kendra Pramukhs are academic leaders in the government school system who extend teacher support in a
cluster of 10-12 schools. The Kendra Pramukhs are trained in data analysis to understand problems of
learning and practice, making focused classroom observations, giving effective feedback, and drawing data-
based action plans. A unique element of the capacity-building programme is its emphasis on coaching and
mentoring. The faculty or resource persons from DIET are trained as 'Master Facilitator' who in turn train the
'Coaches', who in turn coach the Kendra Pramukhs. The KPALP programmes also involved establishing
109
professional learning communities where the Kendra Pramukhs can discuss the evidence from the data and
work collaboratively with their peer to develop action plans in the clusters. Interviews with KPALP resource
persons highlight that teacher coaching positively impacted teaching practices and student learning.
G. Programmatic response to address learning losses due to COVID-19: The pandemic has resulted in
significant learning losses, which require targeted interventions to prioritise foundational literacy and
numeracy and strengthen the mechanism of instruction delivery by offering bridge courses and catch-up
learning. The 'Kalika Chetarike' is a comprehensive programme launched by the Government of Karnataka
with technical support from UNICEF that aligns with the RAPID Learning Recovery Framework developed
jointly by UNICEF, UNESCO and the World Bank. The programme focuses on adjusting the curriculum to focus
on fundamentals. The programme has re-designed the existing curriculum to focus on learning recovery and
will focus on achieving all the prescribed learning indicators, class-wise, over syllabus-level teaching. The
teachers are also provided with a portfolio of Teaching–Learning-Materials (TLMs) that guide them on how
to assess children to understand students' current learning levels, group them, use relevant TLMs(39), etc.
The programmes also focus on building a cadre of master trainers who support the teachers in giving effective
instructions. The programme also includes activities that address the emotional well-being of children, and
teachers are equipped to plan and implement these activities.
6.3 Lessons Learned
Maintain an open dialogue and strengthen the annual plan review process throughout the programme
cycle for effective engagement with government partners. Various levels of government are essential
partners for UNICEF in creating an enabling environment that contributes to meeting the final goals of the
Programme, including sustainability. In all the states, UNICEF has sought strong alignments with government
institutions and has successfully leveraged public sector resources and capacities to enhance coverage and
sustainability of the interventions. However, a strong alignment with the government has a downside. In
many states, there has been a dilution of UNICEF focus, resulting in inefficient use of resources. UNICEF staff
extended technical support to the government on activities that weren't part of the original work plans.
Furthermore, gaps were noted in the evaluation on implementing and sustaining activities, as outlined in the
state strategy notes. Interviews with UNICEF stakeholders highlight that government partners at the state
level often don't have clarity regarding the overall Country Programme, which also contributes towards the
misalignment. Interviews with the government partners brought out the need to strengthen the review of
the status of the work plans. For more effective engagement with the state government, UNICEF could
consider dissemination activities to appraise the state government of the Country Programme and co-
creating state-level ToC in consultation with the focal ministry and quarterly and annual review of the
progress on the workplan.
Strengthened convergence and inter-sectoral coordination could improve the efficiency of the programme.
Realising the full rights of children requires coordinated efforts across various sectors- education, health,
child protection, disaster risk management and communication. For example, in the out-of-school children
programming, UNICEF has facilitated coordination in states like Bihar with Education Department and Labour
Department. Internally, the UNICEF team coordinates with the child protection team for out-of-school
children programming. Coherence with the WASH and DRR sectors (in select states) was also noted to be
strong. The integrated approach has delivered some positive results in terms of improving the efficiency of
the Programme. The involvement of other sectors has allowed the Education Programme to access additional
human and financial resources.
The adaptable and flexible approach to programming adopted by the Education Programme has helped in
the rapid response to covid as well enhancing the relevance of the Programme. UNICEF has adopted a
flexible and decentralised approach to programming where the field officers are allowed to employ a variety
of approaches according to the state context as long as it aligns with the larger Country Programme
110
objectives. This has enabled the state offices to prioritise certain output areas or interventions within output
areas to better align with the state priorities. This flexibility also allowed the UNICEF state offices to better
allocate the resources-both financial and technical resources. Furthermore, adaptive mechanisms like mid-
term reviews have helped UNICEF revise the Programme strategies and ensure that the interventions are
relevant to the state/ national priorities. The evaluation noted that this flexibility of the UNICEF programming
approach had enabled them to respond to the covid crisis in a robust and timely manner.
Evidence generation and knowledge management are critical for enhancing the effectiveness and
sustainability of interventions. Throughout this Programme cycle, UNICEF has supported the national and
state governments to strengthen and use data for improved planning. The role of UNICEF in strengthening
the National Achievement Survey (NAS) through its technical partnership with the American Institute of
Research (AIR) and the technical and funding support extended in the dissemination of the NAS findings was
appreciated by the stakeholders. The evaluation also noted instances of UNICEF-led and supported research
and evidence base to guide intervention designs. There is also a growing emphasis on monitoring and
evaluation to inform the planning and implementation of interventions. For example, Odisha conducted a
rapid assessment of the Alternative Learning and Mentorship Programme to assess student-level outcomes
in terms of continued engagement with education, teacher-level outcomes in terms of clarity of programme
objectives, motivation towards teaching and ascertain parents' and community's raised awareness towards
education. The findings from the evaluation guided the future development of the Programme. The
evaluation also noted instances where UNICEF has leveraged evidence-based advocacy to facilitate
programming and policy changes.
District-level programming should support learning: The Education Programme was a mix of upstream and
downstream activities. The upstream activities involved interventions such as technical support to the
NCERT, SCERT, Samagra Shiksha; policy advocacy; strengthening the evidence-based planning;
operationalisation of NEP; developing guidelines and standard operating procedures on school safety etc.
These strategies can be categorised as advocacy, evidence-based or institutional strengthening and are
focused at the state/ national level. UNICEF, especially in the high-burden and tribal states, have supported
project implementation or innovative initiatives on a pilot basis at district levels. District-level interventions
through partnerships with technical agencies or government institutions helped generate evidence on proof
of concept. However, there should be a clear linkage with policy advocacy or large-scale evidence-based
programming to facilitate the sustainability of the interventions. This will also require re-imagining UNICEF's
strength to convene stakeholders and inform policy dialogue.
Partnerships with technical agencies provide UNICEF with access to technical resources and expand
UNICEF's capacity to deliver initiatives. During this Country Programme, UNICEF-ICO and the field offices
have effectively leveraged financial and non-financial partnerships with implementing partners and technical
agencies. These partnerships have increased UNICEF's presence in the education sector and expanded
UNICEF's technical and implementation capacity to engage with government and community stakeholders.
The external stakeholders have appreciated UNICEF's approach to partnerships which was collaborative and
participatory. UNICEF and its partners worked jointly from the concept phase to implementation and
advocacy.

07.RECOMMENDATIONS
112
Recommendations were developed based on the assessments, analysis, key findings, and conclusions set out
in this report and have been informed by stakeholders' suggestions received during the consultations and
the evaluators' own experience. A total of thirteen recommendations were initially proposed by the
evaluation team and revised through a series of consultations with the Evaluation Manager, UNICEF's
Education Programme team and a recommendations’ workshop. The recommendation workshop with
stakeholders from the UNICEF ICO, Chief Field Officers, and the ERG members allowed for sense-checking of
the recommendations and ensured their relevance and ownership. Annexure 13 includes the concept note
outlining the recommendation workshop's objectives, agenda and participants.
Based on inputs received from the consultations and feedback from the recommendations’ workshop, the
initial recommendations were either deleted, modified or consolidated to arrive at a final list of eight
recommendations. The evaluation team has focused on the recommendations that are of the greatest
significance and utility for the UNICEF Education Programme. It includes a description of the responsible
organisations, their priority (high or medium) and time horizon (short (< 9 months)/medium (9-24 months)).
In the interests of maximising the utility of this section, low-priority and long-term recommendations were
not made.
Recommendation 1: UNICEF to prioritise key areas Responsible Organisation: UNICEF ICO, UNICEF
of programmatic focus where UNICEF has a Field Offices
comparative advantage and based on local needs in
the next Education Programme
Priority: High Timeframe: Short (within the design process of the
next Education Programme)
As noted under EQ 1.1 and EQ 1.3 under relevance, UNICEF has carried out various activities and
interventions across the three state typologies. Given the resource constraints and funding gap highlighted
under EQ 3.1 (efficiency), UNICEF runs the risk of spreading itself too thin. Therefore, we strongly
recommend that UNICEF pursue its work in a limited number of programmatic areas. The evaluation
team has identified such thematic areas and mapped them to the larger technical areas of work based on
our analysis of UNICEF’s priorities in the current Education Programme and its comparative advantages.
However, we strongly recommend that UNICEF prioritise the programmatic areas at the national and
state level based on a detailed education sectoral analysis that covers all of the sectors in education: early
childhood education, primary education and foundational learning, secondary and higher education, and
technical and vocational education and training. The sectoral analysis should also be equity and gender
focused.
The specific action points for UNICEF to consider for the upcoming Education Programme are outlined
below:
• UNICEF’s activities and priorities in the next Country Programme should focus on the following
technical areas: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building; Technical Support; Policy Advocacy;
Research, Evidence generation and utilisation and knowledge management. However, the evaluation
team acknowledges that there are inter-linkages between the technical areas of interventions, and
this is discussed in the Conclusion section, when discussing the recommendations for the future ToC.
• We recommend that UNICEF limit downstream activities or district-level interventions in the next
Country Programme to new or emerging areas of interest and closely link these to the upstream work.
In this modality, we propose that UNICEF leverage government funds and CSR funds for any
‘downstream’ work and extend support to identify and manage partnership to implement such work.
• UNICEF can extend technical support to support the implementation of work in the following areas:
o In inclusive education, UNICEF can extend technical support to the relevant state government
to mainstream disability-inclusive education in all education plans. UNICEF can support the
relevant departments by assessing the relevance and effectiveness of existing structures,
tools, capacities, and action plans to support the implementation of disability-inclusive
education
113
o Extend technical support to the NCERT/SCERT to develop appropriate pedagogical practices
for the use of mother tongue language in education.
o Extend technical support to support education specialists and other ed-tech organisations in
examining and integrating gender, equity, and inclusivity within digital solutions through the
creation of toolkit with best practices
o Extend technical support to relevant national and state ministry and departments to build
capacities to lead and implement programmes on secondary education, adolescent education,
life skills and school-to-work transition.
o Extend technical support to the relevant state departments to conduct school safety
assessments and implement school safety programmes.
o Extend technical support to the relevant government departments to implement quality ECE
programmes
o Extend technical support to the states to operationalise National Education Policy (NEP) 2020
and Foundational, Literacy and Numeracy Mission through the creation of guidelines, guidance
documents and systems strengthening of the education department at all levels
• UNICEF could consider working on institutional strengthening in the following areas:
o Continue work on building the capacity of the relevant ministry and department in education
for improved planning, monitoring, public financial management, policy implementation
o Strengthen institutional capacities of the SIEMAT/NCERT/SCERT/DIET to assess educator’s
competencies and implement teacher professional development modules
o Strengthen institutional capacities of NCERT/SCERT to improve the pedagogical practices of
the pre-primary curriculum and develop a customised teacher education curriculum for the
pre-primary teachers.
• UNICEF could consider working on evidence and research generation and utilisation in the following
thematic areas:
o UNICEF should also work to strengthen the government EMIS to better capture disability-
related data on access, participation, and learning, review the scope and quality of national
and state data systems in relation to disability-inclusive education and support the
development of disaggregated evidence basis for policy decisions
o UNICEF could support the relevant state governments to develop a detailed mapping of
mother tongue languages
o Improve monitoring of the quality of remote learning and digital education initiatives
• UNICEF could extend policy and advocacy support in the areas of:
o Inform policy on equitable and equal access to digital learning (addressing the digital divide)
o Strong advocacy work around the integration of life skills and job-specific skills within the
school curriculum
o The current Country Programme has seen innovative practices in out-of-school children's
programming, including tracking and monitoring children and interventions to address
learning gaps. Greater policy advocacy is required to scale up the data and evidence-
generation initiatives at a national level and ensure that the government counterparts and
other development partners use the data and evidence to develop new policies and
interventions targeting out-of-school children.
o Enhanced policy advocacy to adopt operational guidelines on model ECE centres.
Recommendation 2: Strengthen convergence and Responsible Organisation: UNICEF ICO, including
multi-sectoral approach within UNICEF across all the Education Team, C4D Team, DRR Team, WASH
programmes Team, Health Team, Nutrition, Social Policy, Social
Protection
114
Priority: High Timeframe: Medium
It was observed that the inter-sectoral convergence within UNICEF was mixed, and the convergence was
driven through individual leadership rather than a coherent, systematic institutional mechanism and
planning. The following action points are suggested to strengthen convergence within UNICEF
• Develop strategy, guidelines, or milestones to promote systematic integration between the sectors or
to guide collective results across sectors. The convergence strategy should also identify prioritised
areas of convergence with the Education Programme and assign responsibility (lead versus support)
• UNICEF can consider creating an apex-level committee at the national and state level, which includes
senior members of the various UNICEF programmatic areas to monitor the convergence strategy
Recommendation 3: Develop a systematic Responsible Organisation: UNICEF Education
approach to evidence generation, utilisation and Programme at ICO, Evidence Unit, UNICEF field
dissemination offices,
Priority: High Timeframe: Medium
To support strategic decision-making within UNICEF, there is a need for a more systematic approach to
research and evidence generation and utilisation. Furthermore, while UNICEF's role and comparative
advantage as a knowledge partner were acknowledged by the stakeholders, there was a need to
strengthen UNICEF's role in driving research and learning agenda in the education sector by creating an
enabling environment for collective learning with all development partners.
The following action points are proposed to strengthen UNICEF’s capacity to monitor and utilise research/
evidence for improved programming and strengthen the internal and external environment for evidence-
based planning and cross-learning:
• Develop a national research agenda in education through systematic evidence reviews and adopting a
consultative and consensus-building approach involving government, development actors in the
education sector and experts to prioritise research gaps. The agenda will help increase the research's
relevance and utility and better utilise limited resources for research and evaluation.
• Specific action points for improved monitoring include:
o Adopting a continuous quality improvement approach to monitoring and evaluation. Rapid
assessments or rapid cycle evaluations will enable UNICEF to assess, for example, the quality
of training, the utilisation or application of the training in improving classroom practices and
the utility of the parenting ECE materials, thereby allowing timely course correction and
improvement to the interventions.
o Deploying technology-based low-cost monitoring solutions, including telemonitoring, online
surveys and such, to strengthen the monitoring of programmes
• Specific action points towards better utilisation of evidence/ research for programming include:
o Conducting a study on research and evaluation utilisation to understand better how and when
in the course of programming are evaluations used and the changes or decisions. This could
also help drive evaluation and learning agenda within the Education Programme and provide
guidance to ensure that quality, relevant evaluations are conducted every time.
o Conducting evidence synthesis of evaluation findings across multiple evaluations in education
to improve the accessibility of information for the education specialist.
o Plan evidence generation exercises so that it can be linked with the UNICEF advocacy efforts
• To support external administrative data collection and strengthening external evidence base, we
suggest that UNICEF
115
o Support capacity building of state institutions like SCERTs to design evidence frameworks,
conduct high-quality research and better utilise evidence outcomes for effectively planning
o Continue to extend technical support to build capacity of government stakeholders at sub-
national levels to collect relevant and reliable data effectively and regularly and address data
gaps.
o Strengthen the capacity of its CSO partners to develop their advocacy and evidence generation
capacity and improve reporting that could be linked to UNICEF’s ‘upstream work’
• To strengthen knowledge management and dissemination, we suggest
o Collating and sharing research and data from UNICEF’s successful initiatives
o Promote more opportunities for cross-learning across states so that successful initiatives in
one state can be scaled up across other states.
Recommendation 4: Define a clear partnership Responsible Organisation: UNICEF ICO, UNICEF
strategy for the Education Programme, diversify Field Offices
partner base and implement process improvement
activities to strengthen partnership engagement
Priority: High Timeframe: Medium
The evaluation team noted the need to diversify and strengthen strategic partnerships for the Education
Programme. Partnership is defined by the evaluation team as all types of government and non-government
partners (CSO, academic partners, private sector, other development partners) and all partnering
modalities, both at the national level as well as at the sub-national level.
• Specific action points that UNICEF could consider are outlined below:
o Develop a detailed partnership strategy to define strategic partnerships of the ICO and, at the
state level, to strengthen relations with different strategic partners. The strategy should also
provide information on objectives, engagement modality, selection criteria, outcomes, and
performance metrics around a partnership with different groups and tailor approaches for
each. This should include groups such as private sector and academia, civil society,
development partners and Government.
o The partnership strategy could be built collaboratively and in participatory including
consultations with the state government, private sector, and other development partners,
thereby enhancing the relevance of the strategy to the critical needs of the state education
sector plans and priorities
• Specific action points that UNICEF can consider strengthening partner engagement are outlined below:
o Streamline and optimise the internal processes for partnerships and programme cooperation/
implementation agreements and consider multi-year multi-state engagements with the CSO
to ensure enhanced coverage, greater sustainability, and efficiency of the interventions.
o Organise regular partners conferences to present UNICEF's key program and outcome areas
with the other actors in the states actively looking for opportunities, including pledging
conferences for addressing critical gaps in the state education sector plans from the
perspective of identified areas for future support and allow for greater cross-learning among
the implementing partners of UNICEF
Recommendation 5: Review and revisit the state Responsible Organisation: UNICEF ICO, UNICEF
typology-based approach and strengthen typology- Field Offices
based monitoring and reporting and develop
typology-specific ToC
Priority: High Timeframe: Short
116
UNICEF's differential programme approach based on the state typology was largely relevant. However, the
effectiveness of the state typology-based approach was limited due to several challenges highlighted
under EQ 1.3 in relevance. It is recommended that the state-typology-based approach be revisited. Any
differential programming approach should consider the following action points:
• The classification of the states could benefit from more disaggregated analysis of education and
using more micro-level data in the Situation Analysis
• Strengthening typology-based monitoring and reporting,
• Develop typology-specific ToC to guide activities and results
Recommendation 6: Strengthen the integration of Responsible Organisation: UNICEF ICO, Gender
gender and equity principles and promote greater Specialist, Evidence Team
gender transformative programming and equity
analysis
Priority: High Timeframe: Medium
Gender and equity were key components of the current Education Programme, which was achieved
through the inclusion of gender, disability, marginalised communities and focus on disadvantaged areas.
Below are a set of actions that could support more effective integration of some key aspects of equity,
gender and inclusion in the upcoming Education Programme:
• Enhanced focus on marginalised children such as urban poor, transgender, and children with
disability in the next Country Programme
• Increase the usage of equity focus and inclusion-related indicators on gender, disability, and
disadvantaged communities in the situational analysis to understand critical gaps and develop
context-specific strategies as part of the planning process
• Identify and implement gender-transformative activities for the engagement of men and boys
within the Education Programme
• Better results mapping in the Education Programme to improve institutional accountability for
gender and equity
• Increase its financial resources and allocation towards gender and equity-related activities
• Augment UNICEF staff capacity on gender and other equality and inclusion-related concepts and
programming strategies
Recommendation 7: Adopt a systematic approach Responsible Organisation: UNICEF ICO, UNICEF
to education in an emergency within the larger Field Offices
India Country Office’s strategy for Emergencies to
enhance preparedness for future emergencies
Priority: Medium Timeframe: Medium
As noted under EQ 1.2 under relevance, UNICEF was able to realign its programme substantively to
respond appropriately to the pandemic. However, external stakeholders of UNICEF expressed that UNICEF
could have leveraged its comparative advantage on education in emergencies more effectively. Building
upon the experience from the pandemic, UNICEF could consider more systematic planning for future crises
(anticipated risks like flood, earthquake and conflicts etc.) in the upcoming education programmes.
• Specific actions on planning include:
o Within the larger ICO’s strategy for emergencies, quantify the risks that are likely to affect
education.
o Analyse the differences in risks and their impact on education at the sub-national level.
o The state strategy note should also include conflict/ risk analysis and identify severe risks that
could impact education services
• Specific actions on institutional strengthening and capacity building include:
117
o Build guidelines and SOPs for risk response in the education sector and improve UNICEF's readiness
to respond to a crisis by developing minimum preparedness activities in education for different
types of risks
o Focus on capacity building of UNICEF’s education specialists in emergencies
o Extend technical support to the relevant state departments to develop risk-resilient education
plans and ensure that plans and policies are in place to ensure continuation of education services
• Specific actions on the implementation include:
o Enhanced convergence with the DRR team
Recommendation 8: Identify capacity needs and Responsible Organisation: UNICEF ICO, UNICEF
augment technical capacity through strategic Field Offices, UNICEF Regional Office
partnerships and improved learning opportunities
for the UNICEF staff
Priority: Medium Timeframe: Medium
The technical expertise of UNICEF in various domains within education was noted as one of the
comparative advantages. However, it is essential to continue strengthening the technical capacity to
support the implementation and strategic positioning of UNICEF at the country and field office levels.
Therefore, UNICEF needs to consider providing more learning and development opportunities for staff
with transferable skills to diversify and develop their skills in critical areas and build strategic partnerships
to bring new technical expertise to UNICEF. Some specific action points include:
• Conduct a capacity assessment of the ICO and field offices to identify needs and capacity gaps to meet
the priorities of the next Education Programme.
• Determine how best UNICEF can build technical expertise – via internal resources or drawing support
available in the market or through strategic partnerships with academic partners or access to
specialised skills.
• Augment internal staff capacity through regular refresher training on emerging areas such as digital
education, adolescent programming, inclusive education and monitoring and evaluation and soft skills
like policy advocacy, and partnerships
• Explore Long-Term Agreements (LTA) for consultants and individual contractors to provide education
technical support services
