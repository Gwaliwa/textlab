Final Report
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This evaluation report is developed by the ET of Junction Bulgaria at the reporting phase of the
“Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on
Inclusivity”, commissioned by UNICEF Kazakhstan. The aim of this report is to present the object,
purpose, and scope of this FE, the methodology and data collection instruments, main findings,
conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations.
1.1. OVERVIEW OF THE EVALUATION OBJECT
The object of this FE is the composition of State Programmes for Development of Education with a
Focus on Inclusivity: The State Programme for the Development of Education in the Republic of
Kazakhstan for 2011–2020 with a budget of 509.7 billion KZT for the first phase of the programme
(from 2011 to 2015) 1; The State Programme for the Development of Education and Science of the
Republic of Kazakhstan for 2016–2019 with a budget of 1 423.4 billion KZT2; The State Programme for
the Development of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2020–2025 with a budget
of 11 578 billion KZT 3; The national project "Educated Nation" 2021-2025 with a budget of 1 970.5
billion KZT4. The goals of the programmes are oriented towards quality of education, human capital
development, socio-economic development of the country, equal access of all children to high quality
and inclusive education (pre-school and secondary education). This evaluation examines the state
education programmes implemented between 2011-2021 with the focus on inclusivity.
The programmes have been developed by the Ministry of Education, but also other ministries are
engaged in their implementation, such as Ministry of Higher education and Science, Ministry of
Healthcare of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan,
Ministry of Investment and Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Akimats of Astana and Almaty
cities, regions etc. The state education programmes are at a different stage of implementation. The
programmes have a national scope. The population groups that are covered are: national and local
stakeholders; children at risk of exclusion from quality and adapted education, due to family, social,
economic, and/or individual conditions.
1.2. EVALUATION OBJECTIVES AND INTENDED AUDIENCE
The purpose of this FE is to assess to what extent the state education programmes in Kazakhstan
implemented within the period of 2011-2021 have been contributing to inclusion of children of
different levels of ability as well as to examine the enabling conditions and bottlenecks which will
require further improvement. The evaluation aims to produce evidence-based recommendations for
strengthening the education system, to contribute to increased knowledge on the national inclusive
education agenda, and to improve national capacity to advance attainment of the Sustainable
Development Goal 4 targets.
The evaluation has specific objectives: to examine relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, and
sustainability of the programmes with a focus on inclusivity; to document the evolution of government
work on inclusion by analysing laws, policies, programmatic documents guiding the development of
inclusive education and construct the theory of change; to examine the extent to which the education
sector priorities on inclusion have been appropriately designed, efficiently, and effectively managed
in relation to global priorities, including the incorporation of equity, gender equality, and human rights
considerations; to assess some of the immediate results and good practices of what is working or not
and for whom; to identify existing challenges, barriers and gaps in the education system and provide
strategic recommendations aimed at creating an inclusive and resilient learning environment for every
child; to develop recommendations for future strategies in sustaining results and good practices and
addressing existing challenges and barriers.
The intended users of the evaluation are the UNICEF Country Office; Parliament, Government, Child
Rights Ombudsperson; Ministry of Enlightenment, the Government representatives; Local akimats;
x

Final Report
Civil Society Organisations. This FE is conducted in a period in which the next education policy
framework will be developed, and the evaluation will inform and contribute to the orientation of the
national policy towards inclusivity. The generated knowledge will be used by the Government to
address existing gaps and adjust reforms if needed.
1.3. EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
The purpose, scope and objectives of the evaluation define the methodology, which is based on a
mixed-methods approach including desk review, secondary data analysis and qualitative data
collection methods: key informant interviews, focus group discussions and observations. The
fieldwork was conducted in Almaty, Almaty region, Astana, Turkistan, Atyrau and Pavlodar selected
according to specific criteria: economic development, geographic location, area, ethnic distribution,
spoken language, urban/rural areas, level of child poverty, enrolment in early education and care. 32
key informant interviews were conducted, some of which dual, with 38 participants, including
representatives of national and local authorities, international partners, NGOs, PMPCs, RCs, UNICEF
and school/kindergartens. 19 focus group discussions were conducted with 89 participants, including
decision makers at national/international level, teachers/specialists, parents and students. 5
observations were conducted at schools chosen based on the criteria to have activities related to
inclusiveness and work with different groups of children.
1.4. MOST IMPORTANT FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
Relevance: Since 2011, the educational policy of Kazakhstan is oriented towards achievement of
inclusiveness of all children in education. The policies follow the international conventions and key
documents, which put an emphasis on the inclusion of all children and implementation of more
inclusive approach to education to overcome barriers and exclusion from the system. Most of the
priorities of the state educational programmes are in a medium to high level of alignment with the
global priorities - World Declaration on Education for All, UNESCO’s Policy and Guidelines on
Inclusion in Education, UNICEF’s Inclusive Education Initiatives for Children with Disabilities. In view
of teacher education and changes in the legislation all the programmes have planned priorities. Some
of the key global priorities such as encouraging the participation of parents, communities, and persons
with disabilities in the planning and decision-making processes, early identification and intervention
strategies and vocational aspects of inclusive education are not particularly outlined in the state
programmes and none of them directly address attitudinal changes and policy development. The
relevance is at a lower level also for creation of an inclusive learning environment and respect for
rights within education. There is evidence of a high level of alignment of the programmes with the
objectives of the National Development Plan of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2025 in view of
ensuring access and equity and improving the quality of education at all levels, demonstrating a strong
commitment to promoting human rights, children’s rights and inclusiveness. There are priorities and
activities related to children with SEN, with disabilities and living in remote areas. Children migrants
and in conflict with the law are only mentioned in one of the programs, while gender disparities are
not addressed in any.
Coherence: The programmes have similar goals and priorities, oriented towards equity and access to
quality education. They keep inclusiveness in their focus to a different extent. Every programme has
its own logic, including planning at different levels, which is defined differently but related to the goals,
tasks/priorities, SWOT analysis, and indicators. An analysis of the achievements, needs, bottlenecks,
and causality has not been identified. It could be found in different reports, but the programmes do
not refer to them. The topic of inclusiveness is a cross-cutting point in the different priority areas, but
it is not subject to separate policy, rather a part of the planned tasks on the other issues. The planned
activities for achieving the goals in all the programmes are realised in the educational sector in
partnership with all other sectors, related to the rights of education for all children. The intersectoral
integration is a challenge since a mechanism for its implementation has not been developed and each
separate sector (education, social protection and health) has its own structures and resources. The
xi

Final Report
planning and implementation of educational policy with a focus on inclusivity is done through a top-
down approach at the national level and realised at the local level. The local level administration is
dependent on the centralised plans of the government in order to implement the national policy. At
the different levels, there are different institutions and structures engaged with educational policy
and, in particular, inclusivity, which have specific roles and functions. Key stakeholders in
implementing the policy are local and international NGOs and organisations, as well as private entities.
The role of global partners and international organisations is of key importance as an initial boost.
Effectiveness: The process of reform in education in Kazakhstan goes in parallel with the endeavours
to make the school more inclusive and provide equal opportunities for all children to study in safe
schools oriented towards their needs. The understanding of inclusiveness in education develops
through setting clear goals in policy and with a transition from the medical approach to the bio-psycho-
social approach to disabilities and it is gradually changing towards inclusion for all children, although
there are still stakeholders who understand it through the lens of special needs children, children with
physical and mental illness. The different programmes and project have different outcomes and
indicators related to inclusiveness of education. The main outcome is creation of favourable
conditions for inclusiveness in secondary education, which is understood differently and developed
over the years, primarily with a focus on physical access and equipment and later including teacher
qualification and pedagogical changes. The national data shows that the share of schools that have
created such conditions has increased for the 10-year period and the target of 70% has been achieved.
However, the stakeholders believe this is a long process that takes time, and it is unrealistic to achieve
this, probably because of a different understanding of what these conditions mean. Additionally, the
system addressing the needs of children with SEN is more integrated than inclusive (children study
mostly in separate rooms, with separate specialists and according to an adapted program). The
analysis regarding the main components of the operational culture changes: leadership, pedagogy,
capacity building, technology and architecture, shows that still the achievement of conditions for
inclusiveness of education is a process that is not finished and has started from physical access
(architecture), going gradually into the inclusion of the rest of the elements. The data shows an
increase in the coverage of attendance of preschool for children aged 1-6. The average share of
kindergartens that created conditions for inclusive education is 67%. In spite of the enlarged scope
and high share of enrolment of children 3-6, the most used forms of ECD services are private centres,
special kindergartens, and home schooling and there is a steady number of special kindergartens. The
educational system in the country is characterised with a number of possibilities to ensure equal
access to education for all. This variety leads to different opportunities, but some of them are still
segregating and children are outside of the community, which makes the system look rather
heterogenous. The different vulnerable groups do not have equal access to education. In the period
of 10 years inclusiveness in education is developing in parallel with keeping the system for special
education. The number of children with SEN in general secondary education is increasing over the
years but there are still 14% of children in special schools in 2022, 10% are in special classes and 12%
are in home-schooling. When it comes to preschool, still 11% of children are in special groups in
general kindergartens and 13% are in special ones. The right to education of other groups of children
at risk of exclusion is ensured in general and boarding schools. There is a significant difference
between regions in terms of inclusion of parents varying from totally missing information to very
active parents who create services and organisations to support their children.
Efficiency: The investments in education are increasing during the years, which shows an
understanding of the importance and return of these investments. Inclusiveness in education is not a
separate area of financing, but rather a part of the common financial standards at the level of primary
and secondary education. The investments in physical access and buildings were prevalent until the
middle of the period of evaluation, after which bigger resources are allocated for digitalization,
salaries and capacity development of teachers, which is one of the biggest changes. Smaller resources
are dedicated to preschool education. Another important change is the gradual introduction across
the country of per capita financing, based on the number of students at each school. The allocated
xii

Final Report
resources for a child with SEN are the highest in home-schooling and similar for inclusive classes and
special classes in general education. This funding seems rather oriented towards children with
disabilities and learning difficulties, instead of towards all groups of children at risk.
Sustainability: There are legal mechanisms for sustainability described in the Law on education from
2007 and its amendments, related to defining special conditions for education, introducing the
procedure for organizing early identification screening; defining children with SEN and services
included in the special psychological and pedagogical support. The institutional mechanisms for
implementation appear to be sustainable since they have been functioning for a long time, including
transformation from correctional to inclusive approach. The financial mechanism ensures sustainable
resources for inclusiveness in education but the standards for children with SEN studying at home are
higher than for those in special or inclusive classes. There has been an increase in the salaries of
teachers, but their motivation also depends on the prestige of the teacher profession, quality of higher
education, continuous professional development. Steps have been made in this direction, but it is of
key importance to provide a variety of opportunities to pass training courses and be able to upgrade
teachers’ skills.
Lessons learned
This FE concludes that the “road” to inclusivity goes through different phases and the first steps in the
right direction have been taken. Although the system is still keeping special education, it manages to
develop in a way that would create preconditions for change. The ET identifies the following specific
lessons learned:
• Importance of more focused strategic planning and communication in terms of inclusiveness
in education with different stakeholders at the different stages of implementation of activities
towards achieving the common goals.
• The common agreement around a path to change at the planning phase of realisation of
policy is a key factor for identifying clear expected outcomes and impact, activities, assumptions and
risk mitigation and description of the road to these results, including planning at the local level.
• Importance of ensuring participation of all stakeholders, at a multisectoral level. The road to
change is long and passes through a change in attitudes, motivations, and capacity development.
• Need to ensure that the indicators for outcomes, related to inclusiveness in education, are
clearly defined, reliable and measurable and that high quality data is collected and analysed in a
proper way.
• Importance of development of early identification and early intervention integrated services
in order to implement the identification of developmental problems and support for parents.
• Development of integrated services for children at risk of exclusion from the educational
system and implementing a case management approach, which involves assessment and planning
according to the needs.
• There is a high level of importance of empowering principals, teachers, parents, and children
to develop their own “project of change” for each school, which would guarantee a high level of
commitment and ownership of all school level stakeholders.
• A systemic change could be ensured by efficient investing of resources in inclusive education,
taking into consideration the main components of educational reform, the right – based approach
and all components of the change like pedagogy, leadership, school environment, technology, and
efficient investment.
• The continuous professional development of all teachers and ensuring flexibility of their
work will provide opportunities for implementing of innovative approaches for working with children
at risk of exclusion and create a supportive learning environment.
1.5. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS
The recommendations are divided in the following groups: strategic, practical and operational.
xiii

Final Report
Strategic recommendations (focused on policy challenges in terms of inclusivity)
• Enhance horizontal and vertical multisectoral coordination/partnership. Establish a robust
coordination mechanism, which should facilitate effective collaboration and information sharing
among stakeholders, including government departments, educational institutions, civil society
organizations.
• Develop a mechanism for partnership and planning in the education sector, including resource
allocation and capacity building. This support would address the needs to include local authorities in
the needs assessment and planning of implementation of inclusiveness in education, fostering
collaboration between schools, teachers, parents, and children to address specific challenges related
to inclusivity.
• Policy oriented towards development of services on ECD, early intervention and prevention.
Implement comprehensive and evidence-based programmes that support the holistic development of
children, including their cognitive, social, emotional, and physical well-being. The findings from the
evaluation show that there is a lack of such services for children at an early age, so it is necessary to
enhance partnerships and build capacity in the education and health sectors.
• Adopt a policy framework focused on the development of integrated services, employing a
multisectoral approach for needs assessment and tailored support for children at risk of exclusion.
The findings of the evaluation indicate the lack of services which effectively meet the needs of
children, related to social, health and educational inequalities.
Practical recommendations (focused on development of services and quality of services)
• Creation of conditions for inclusiveness in education in kindergartens, in order to ensure the
access and quality of work with all children at risk of exclusion. This will meet the need identified by
the evaluation for increasing the access of children at an early age to preschool education.
• Secondary schools should continue their path to inclusiveness through rights-based planning
on what is most appropriate with the participation of all stakeholders, including parents in particular.
This will meet the need to address the differences in the regions and reduce the influence of the
centralised methodological approach.
• Ensure a well-planned and realised professional development of teachers to become agents
of change and flexibility to use pedagogical approaches and innovative techniques to guarantee
quality of education for all children. This will meet the needs for capacity development of teachers
identified in the evaluation.
• Ensure that the system is well-equipped, and beneficiaries are properly informed about
methodological materials in Kazakh language, digital resources, and tools for working with children
with different levels of abilities and needs. The evaluation has identified the need for methodological
materials and low level of digitalisation in some of the schools, especially in rural areas.
• Conduct additional analysis focused on per capita financing on inclusive education, in order to
determine the most efficient allocation and use of resources. The evaluation indicates that per capita
standards are higher for children with SEN studying at home and similar for special and inclusive
classes.
• Ensure methodological support for the implementation of a case management approach in
the assessment and planning process to address the holistic needs of children at risk of exclusion. The
evaluation has identified that the individual programmes used for students are only focused on
learning tasks rather than development of soft skills.
• Plan an analysis and revision of the role of PMPCs in view of implementing a gatekeeping
mechanism that ensures integrated support as the primary agency for providing recommendations to
social, educational and health and other sectors. This will address the need for gatekeeping and reduce
the workload by transferring a portion of the activities to other services.

Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
• Define a clear and common goal and formulate measurable specific indicators for inclusive
education. The findings show that the indicator on favourable conditions for inclusive education needs
to be specified and clarified.
• Develop a mechanism for integrated planning of the implementation of the state education
policy (in terms of programmes and strategies) with clear division of tasks, timeline, and
responsibilities of the different line ministries and implementing agencies.
• Review the suggested ToC to be taken into account in the process of development of new
educational policies. Since a ToC has not been developed for any of the programmes and now there
is a suggestion, it should be validated and/or updated by stakeholders.

The state education programmes have been developed by the Ministry of Education (MoE), (Ministry
of Education and Science (MoES) for the earlier programmes), but other ministries are also engaged
in their implementation such as Ministry of Higher Education and Science, Ministry of Healthcare of
the Republic of Kazakhstan (MH), Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan,
Ministry of Investment and Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Akimats of Astana and Almaty
cities, regions, etc.
The programmes are at a different stage of implementation. Two of them have been completed,
respectively their results and indicators should have been achieved. The National project 2021-2025
is being implemented. This FE will feed into the next education policy framework and will further
contribute to its implementation. The knowledge generated by the evaluation will be used by the
Government to address existing gaps and adjust reforms, if needed, so a key part is the need to
recommend directions for further education reform and development.
In 2023, the Concept of development of pre-school, secondary and vocation education of the Republic
of Kazakhstan 2023-2029 was developed, including 7 priority areas, related to creation of equal
starting opportunities, provision of quality education, protection of children’s rights, etc. Having in
mind that this concept is not a part of the scope of the evaluation, it has not been analysed, but its
main priority areas have been considered when developing the ToC.
The government of Kazakhstan included some specific results into the state programmes and action
plans. However, a document setting out the ToC with respective indicators/targets has not been
developed. The ToC is a critical step for prospectively defining the pathways of change, proposing a
package of evidence-based strategies, and articulating a chain of results, while also addressing the
gaps for inclusivity in education to achieve SDGs. It contains causal links, assumptions, and risks. Due
to this reason, at the inception stage of this evaluation, a ToC was reconstructed based on the
information from five key stakeholders. The reconstruction was based on preliminary desk review and
a discussion around the vision of the educational reforms, the goals and expected results (outcomes)
in relation to education reform in general and inclusive education in particular; the main bottlenecks
in the educational programmes in the country for the period 2011-2021; the main stakeholders in the
reform process.
2
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
The major bottlenecks are related to enabling environment, supply, demand, and quality. In terms of
enabling environment, there is a need for development of legislation and policy in view of inclusive
education. The social norms and beliefs regarding children with disabilities point to challenges in
understanding and prevailing medical approach to disabilities and “correcting deficits''. Furthermore,
bottlenecks are related to the prestige of the teacher profession and school infrastructure. In view of
the demand side, there is an increase in the number of children with disabilities and growth in the
birth rate, while many children with special needs remain at home and do not receive education. The
concept of disability in Kazakhstan, still heavily influenced by the traditional Soviet concept of
“defectology”, focuses on a person’s particular disability and trains practitioners as specialists in that
single disability’s care and correction. When it comes to the supply side, the existing network of
preschool organisations does not fully cover the needs of vulnerable children, there are ungraded
schools and shortage of qualified specialists in preschool education, which is related to the fact that
the number of children per teacher is big. This leads to systematic problems in early childhood
development and care and early intervention and prevention, while at the same time there is a
provision for gifted children and allocation of resources and overall governmental attention towards
them, instead of for “less gifted children”. Also, education for children with special needs and
disabilities are provided in separate “correctional schools”, in special groups and classes in general
education schools, and in the children’s homes. Furthermore, in terms of quality, there is an outdated
methodology and guidelines for selection of educational content, professionals and specialists are
often inadequately trained, therefore quality of services provided is still at an insufficient level and
there is an impact of language of instruction and gender, as well as regional differences in learning
outcomes (which could be seen through PISA results).
All these bottlenecks, identified in a number of analyses and studies, are addressed over the years
through governmental programs aiming to increase the quality of human capital and ensuring
inclusive and equitable quality education, while promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. This
is continuously repeated across the different programmes, which means that the process of change is
still ongoing. While the first two programs focus on preschool and secondary education coverage and
equal access, the third and fourth programs (National project in the latter) are rather concentrated on
inclusive learning environments and quality education. The inputs of different programs reviewed
through domains of determinants seem to be spread out quite evenly, but mostly in terms of quantity,
rather than quality and changing of approach and understanding, as well as development of a new
concept of inclusive education.
The assumptions identified in the ToC are related to ensuring access and accessibility as one of the
necessary conditions for inclusive education, which is connected with increasing state support and
stimulating labour of teachers, as well as enlarging the network of preschool organisations, which
could lead to higher quality in the education system. At the same time, the risks that are identified are
in regard to the focus on children with disabilities, instead of inclusion of all children, not enough in
changing the approach and not enough development of early intervention as a service. Furthermore,
a risk is not focusing enough on communication and raising awareness in order to change public
attitudes.
However, this ToC was based on preliminary findings, and it was empirically tested and updated into
a final ToC (annex 8) as a result of the process of data collection.
2.2. CONTEXT OF THE EVALUATION
2.2.1. SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONTEXT
The Republic of Kazakhstan, independent since 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, is the
largest country in Central Asia and the ninth largest by land surface globally. The country is
neighbouring Russia, China, and three other Central Asian states, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and
Turkmenistan. For its vast territory, the country is comparatively underpopulated, with a population
of over 19 million (as of 1.10.2022)9, while the Human Capital Index (HCI) (scale 0-1) is 0.6 (2020)10.
3
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
The population of the country is diverse in terms of ethnic and religious composition, but
discrimination or other violations of human rights based on ethnicity, language, and religion is
prohibited by the criminal code. Nevertheless, the country struggles to outline a clear and cohesive
strategy of inclusive identity politics. 11
The country occupies a strategic position in Central Asia. Given its location between China and the
Russian Federation, it is at the heart of trade and investment opportunities linked to Eurasian
connectivity. It has also forged extensive and growing links with the European Union (EU), which is its
premier trading and investment partner. The country plays a lead role in regional cooperation,
diplomacy, and security. Furthermore, Kazakhstan is part of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU or
EEU), which is an economic union of some post-Soviet states located in Eurasia. This union heavily
influences Kazakhstan’s economy and trade.
The country has been economically successful in Central Asia, transitioning from a lower to an upper-
middle-income status in less than two decades. Since 2002, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita
has risen sixfold and Kazakhstan currently accounts for nearly two-thirds of regional GDP (for the
region of Central Asia) while having only a quarter of the population. It is also important to mention
that Kazakhstan plays an important role in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) connecting China and the
West. As of today, two out of six economic corridors of BRI pass through Kazakhstan connecting China
with Europe, Iran, and Western Asia12.
Additionally, the country is aspiring to join the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) ranks and be among the top 30 economies of the world by 205013. The
Development Strategy Kazakhstan 2050 “One nation, one destiny” 14, adopted in 2012, provides a
vision for the country for the years to come and supersedes the Strategy Kazakhstan 2030, adopted in
1997. ‘The goal of this plan is to bring Kazakhstan into the ranks of the 30 most competitive countries
around the world through a focus on eliminating corruption and ensuring a healthy, well-educated
population. As part of this policy strategy, plans for improving the quality of the education system have
been developed and are being implemented.’15
When it comes to the political landscape, it is important to note that “2019 was a year of political
transition and conditions are in place for continuing stability in the country”16. The new leadership is
committed “to the overarching goal of sustaining socio-political stability…it also acknowledged the
need to comprehensively respond to the rising economic and social disparities among people in
Kazakhstan, focusing more on raising living standards, overcoming inequalities, and strengthening civil
society to complement the traditional prioritisation of growth and social expenditures”17.
Later, Kazakhstan was shaken by a rapidly unfolding series of dramatic and tragic events since protests
began in early January 202218. „The protests began in early January over a sharp increase in fuel prices
and rapidly escalated in the face of a harsh crackdown by authorities. By mid-month, 225 people were
dead and more than 12,000 were being detained, while the damage to businesses from fires, looting
and sabotage was estimated in the billions of dollars. People see increasing inequality, no meritocracy,
no way for educated people to prosper.”19
As a result, the rhetoric of Jana Kazakhstan (New Kazakhstan) has emerged with the nationwide
referendum on the proposed amendments to the Constitution held in June 2022. The President
Tokayev declared the following: "Together we will make New Kazakhstan a reality, in which social
justice will be the main value and carrier of a new social contract. The referendum will be a test of our
society's civic maturity and political awareness."20 Later the same year Tokayev was re-elected.
In summary, in terms of human development for all socio-economic aspects, Kazakhstan has a Human
Development Index (HDI) of 8.11, thus ranking in the position 56 (2021)21. “Kazakhstan showed growth
in all HDI indicators. In 2019, Kazakhstan increased life expectancy by 0.4 (73.6 years), the expected
duration of schooling by 0.2 (15.6 years) and the average duration of education by 0.1 years (11.9
years). Also, the gross national income rose to 22 857 (2018 – 22 172). In the period from 1990 to 2019,
Kazakhstan increased its HDI by 19.6%, increasing from 0.690 to 0.825”22. Furthermore, according to
the HCI and Human Capital Complementary Indicators (HCCI), learning-adjusted years of school,
4
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
meaning expected years of school, factoring in what children actually learn, are only 9.1, which is
higher in comparison with the average for Upper Middle-Income Countries, but lower than the
average for Europe and Central Asia. The pre-primary school gross enrolment ratio is 74% (2020),
lower than the regional average and higher than the income group average. Primary school
completion rate is 102% (2020), higher than both the regional (98%) and income group (97%)
averages. The secondary school gross enrolment rate is 104 percent (2020), lower than the regional
average (107%) and higher than the income group average (94%). What’s more, in terms of learning
poverty, 2% (2016) of 10-year-olds cannot read and understand a simple text by the end of primary
school, compared to 11 percent at the regional level and 40 percent at the income group level.
2.2.2. DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATION
The number of children in Kazakhstan (0-17) is more than 6 million (6 295 590) with a slight prevalence
of boys23. Data on children living below the poverty line shows that the numbers of children living in
poverty have fallen dramatically since 2000. Despite this, 15.6 % of children live in households in the
lowest income decile and inequality among regions in Kazakhstan in terms of child poverty is
significant 24. Furthermore, the number of children with disabilities has steadily increased in the past
10 years (probably in part since also the total number of children is increasing) and the data for 2021
shows that it is 98 254 25.
Kazakhstan has ratified the key international conventions on the rights of children, including children
with disabilities (Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1994; Convention on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities in 2015)26. The Law on the rights of the child (2002)27 lays down the equal right to
education, choice of profession and participation in creative and public activities, as well as to health
care and social assistance with the support of the state. According to the “Situational analysis of
children in Kazakhstan”28 the country “has created a solid enabling environment for realizing the rights
of children. It has ratified multiple international conventions, introduced policies and programmes
addressing children’s rights and established the function of the Ombudsperson for Children’s Rights. It
has maintained consistent levels of investment in the health, education, and social sectors but they are
lower than the averages for the OECD”.29 Additionally, in the constitution of Republic of Kazakhstan, it
is stated that no child should be discriminated against, “and all children, including children with
disabilities, have a fundamental right to education. Kazakhstan has achieved one of the millennium
goals to have universal access to primary education”30.
Education is a very important topic in Kazakhstan and therefore is the focus of strategies, policies, and
general development. “The right to education for every child is ensured by the Constitution (1995) as
Article 30 guarantees that all citizens will receive free compulsory secondary education and have
access to higher education. The Law on Education (2007) also states that all citizens have the right to
free preschool, elementary, general secondary, and vocational education, as well as free higher
education on a competitive basis, regardless of one’s gender, ethnicity, social and economic status,
language, religion, health status and other individual characteristics”31. The importance of education
in the national context could be confirmed by data showing that expenditures for education from the
total government expenditure of the country is around 18% for 2020 (and about 4% of GDP for 2020)
and has increased to around 20% in 2021.
The Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan (1995) and the National Law on Education (2007)32 lay
down the foundations of the education system. The Law on Education (2007) outlines the main
principles of the state policy in the field. It determines the national early childhood education and care
(ECEC) policies, the objectives and principles of early education, the administrative structure, and the
system of public and private provision. It ratifies the administrative and financial decentralisation of
institutions providing educational services. The legal framework also encompasses specific provisions
of other legislative acts, edicts of the president, decrees of the government, and orders of the Minister
of Education and Science. “The 2007 Law on Education defines inclusive education as the process that
provides equal access for students with special individual abilities to relevant education training. The
2015 Conceptual Approaches to the Development of Inclusive Education in the Republic of Kazakhstan,
5
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
a policy note adopted by the Ministry of Education, clarifies that inclusive education is a transformative
process of the education system based on the equal right of quality education for all”33. Access to
education for children with special educational needs (SEN) is also outlined in the law in terms of the
rights of parents to choose whether to send their child to a mainstream or a special school.34
In June 2021, Kazakhstan adopted an amendment in terms of inclusive education in laws and
regulations establishing a universal approach to children with disabilities by including them in the
educational environment through the implementation of programmes of psychological, medical, and
pedagogical assessment and consultation35. The amendment aims at improving the regulatory
framework for inclusive and special education, which will bring it into line with the principles of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities.36
In summary, the signed “UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2021-2025” sets
the strategic key principles and priorities of cooperation between the UN and Kazakhstan.37 One of
the main strategic priorities of this framework is related to empowering people, human capital, and
social services with an outcome. The aim is that, by 2025, all people in Kazakhstan, especially the most
vulnerable are empowered with knowledge and skills to equally contribute to sustainable
development of the country. It should be pointed out that according to the UNDP SDG global ranking,
Kazakhstan was in 65th place (out of 163 countries) in 20203839, while in 2021 “Kazakhstan ranked 59th
out of 165 countries in the Global Ranking of Countries on the Achievement of SDGs in 2021, gaining
71.6 out of 100 possible points, improving its positions by 6 points compared to last year (65 place and
71.1 points)”40.
Specifically, regarding SDG 4 on education, data for 2020 shows that significant challenges remain, in
terms of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning
opportunities for all, since the score is stagnating or increasing at less than 50% of the required rate.
3. EVALUATION PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE
The purpose of this FE is to assess to what extent the state education programmes in Kazakhstan
implemented within the period of 2011-2021 have been contributing to inclusion of children of
different levels of ability as well as to examine the enabling conditions and bottlenecks which will
require further improvement. The evaluation aims to produce evidence-based recommendations for
strengthening the education system, to contribute to increased knowledge on the national inclusive
education agenda, and to improve national capacity to advance attainment of the Sustainable
Development Goal 4 targets.
The evaluation has the following specific objectives:
- To examine relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of the state
education programmes with a focus on inclusivity;
- To document the evolution of government work on inclusion by analysing previous and
current laws, policies, programmatic documents that guide the development of the inclusive
education and construct the theory of change;
- To examine the extent to which the education sector priorities on inclusion have been
appropriately designed, efficiently, and effectively managed in relation to global priorities, including
the incorporation of equity, gender equality, and human rights considerations;
- To assess some of the immediate results and good practices of what is working, for whom,
and what is not working;
- To identify existing challenges, barriers and gaps in the education system and provide strategic
recommendations aimed at creating an inclusive and resilient learning environment for every child;
- To develop recommendations for future strategies in sustaining results and good practices
and addressing existing challenges and barriers.
The focus of the analysis is on inclusiveness. The intended uses and respective users of the FE are
presented in table 2.

(CSOs) implementation of education projects/ interventions. Strengthen capacity where it is
lacking.
Geographic Scope: The formative evaluation has a national scope. The data collection has been
conducted in Astana and five regions of the country.
The population groups that are covered by the evaluation are: national and local stakeholders;
children at risk of exclusion from quality and adapted education, due to family, social, economic,
and/or individual conditions – such as those living in vulnerable families, in families with low income,
in institutions, in remote areas, deprived of parental care (including orphans), with disabilities in
development, with risk behaviour, in conflict with the law, from linguistic and ethnical minorities, in
migration (including refugees); teachers of rural and urban schools, respective staff of local
government authorities (akimats); inclusion support rooms, regional, urban and district Psychological,
Medical and Pedagogical Consultations (PMPCs), psychological and pedagogical correction rooms
(PPCRs), rehabilitation centres (RCs), special schools, special kindergartens; parents/caregivers and
children, including NEET, academia, business, NGOs, international partners.
Period: This evaluation examines the state education programmes implemented between 2011-2021
with the focus on inclusivity, covering pre-COVID-19 (2011-2019) and COVID-19 (March 2020-2021)
contexts.
The evaluation focuses on equity, gender and human rights aspects and is appropriate for analysing
the gender equality and human rights issues including child rights issues identified in the scope.
In terms of the programmatic scope, it is related to specific objectives (and indicators) of national
programmes and project that are the object of the evaluation (table 6). These objectives relate to
levels of pre-school and secondary education, as well as inclusive, life-long education, equity, and
access to quality education. More information could be seen in annex 4.
4. EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
4.1. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND EVALUATION CRITERIA
7
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
The conceptual framework of this evaluation in annex 9.5.1. includes the basic concepts and
definitions, considered in the state education programmes, the course of the ET’s development of the
evaluation matrix, ToC, and conduction of the evaluation.
An FE is an evaluation which is intended to support programme actors, in order to help them improve
their decisions and activities. It mainly applies to public interventions during their implementation (on-
going, mid-term or intermediate evaluation). It focuses essentially on implementation procedures and
their effectiveness and relevance41. This evaluation is conducted after the end of two of the
programmes in its focus and at the beginning of implementation of the national project and responds
to the need to recommend directions for further education reform and development.
The evaluation criteria, which are used in this evaluation, are based on the updated OECD-DAC
standards42. The goal is to understand the extent to which the programmes are relevant and coherent
to the needs and policies, achieve the planned outcomes at a low cost and ensure sustainability. This
FE responds to the following research questions in the following areas:
● Relevance: How well are the state education programmes aligned with global priorities (The
World Declaration on Education for All, Policy and Guidelines on Inclusion in Education (UNESCO),
Inclusive Education Initiatives for Children with Disabilities (UNICEF), The United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals) in terms of inclusivity? How are the state education programmes aligned to
government priorities in Kazakhstan ("Kazakhstan-2050", Digital Kazakhstan, National Development
Plan of Kazakhstan -2025, etc.) and commitments on human rights, including child rights, equality,
non-discrimination, and inclusion? To what extent and how well have the state education programmes
adapted to the changing context within the education sector? How relevant are the state education
programmes in addressing inherent equity gaps, taking into consideration any disparities? To what
extent the education system was able to adapt its strategies to changes in needs and priorities caused
by COVID-19?
● Coherence: To what extent the state programmes as planned/implemented enabled
coordinated interventions/measures? How did the Implementing Agencies’ work fit with the work of
external partners (global partners, regional partners, other government bodies, partner programmes
/interventions)? Were the state education programmes priorities chosen based on comparative
strengths, capacities, and stakeholders’ expectations? To what extent did the Implementing Agencies
leverage their comparative advantage vis-à-vis other partners, efficiently? To what extent were the
Implementing Agencies able to effectively collaborate and coordinate with one another and externally
with key stakeholders, and leverage existing partnerships, to be as efficient as possible for
strengthening and improving service delivery? How did the state education programmes align with/fit
with other interventions being carried out in the country? Were the state Programmes interventions
coherent with the Implementing Agencies’ approach that is likely to have positive results, or are there
critical gaps?
● Effectiveness: To what extent were state education programmes activities delivered in a
timely and organised manner for the benefit of children at risk of exclusion? To what extent were the
state education programmes effective in achieving its intended results, both at national and regional
levels, in terms of inclusivity? To what extent have the state education programmes achieved the
overall expected outcomes or are likely to achieve? To what extent have the state education
programmes contributed to broader education goals? How effective have the state education
programmes been in addressing inherent equity gaps or taking into consideration the disparities? Did
the state education programmes actively contribute to the fulfilment of the right to education,
especially for the most vulnerable? In what ways and to what extent have the state education
programmes been gender responsive or transformative?
● Efficiency: To what extent have the activities and measures planned/implemented through
the State programmes enabled optimised use of resources? How efficiently did the State programmes
respond to equity-based challenges? To what extent, and in what ways, did the Implementing
Agencies proactively leverage key partners to ensure efficient use of existing platforms (service,
community, and media delivery platforms) and resources for educational activities? Were there any
8

Final Report
inefficiencies because Implementing Agencies did not work with certain partners (or if the
Implementing Agencies only worked with the same set of partners)? How efficiently did the
Implementing Agencies respond to equity-based challenges?
● Sustainability: To what extent the Implementing Agencies are committed to further support
inclusion in education and able to sustain? Are legal, institutional, and financial mechanisms
established to ensure sustainability of programme results? Are there conditions to ensure quality of
the services (curriculum, teacher training, supervision mechanisms, etc.)? What are the key barriers
and bottlenecks toward achieving sustainability in the education sector?
The key evaluation questions and sub-questions have been elaborated in an evaluation matrix (see
annex 7). The key questions are stated as per the Terms of Reference (ToR) (annex 1), but the sub-
questions have been elaborated by the ET in order to fine tune them and operationalise them in
questions for respondents. In the process of development of the evaluation matrix, the evaluation
team proposed some adjustments in the set of key questions and sub-questions.
The Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA)43 was explored by the ET and is focused on the conscious
and systematic enhancement of human rights in all aspects of project and programme development
and implementation. The HRBA principle is used as a cross-cutting approach to conduct the FE and
understand the main features of the programmes. Key questions related to the evaluation objectives
and scope address issues of gender and human rights. In addition, specific gender equality issues, child
rights-based approach, holistic approach, participatory approach, and results-based management are
central to this evaluation.
4.2. METHODS FOR DATA COLLECTION, SAMPLING APPROACH AND ANALYSIS
In order to address the evaluation questions, having in mind the preliminary ToC, the ET of Junction
Bulgaria has used both qualitative and quantitative data collection as per the TOR. Apart from
quantitative secondary data analysis, which serves for an overview of the degree of achievement of
the outcomes, the qualitative data allowed for an in-depth understanding of the barriers and factors
and reasons why state programmes have a certain design. More information about mixed method
approach and details about methodology could be seen in annex 9.5.2
4.2.1. DESK REVIEW AND SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS
The ET has reviewed documents related to Law on Education, amendments of the different legislative
acts related to inclusive education, as well National Annual Reports on Education from 2015 to 2021.
A lot of additional sources were identified in the whole process of evaluation, such as reports and
analysis, documents published in 2022, national and regional data on education. A detailed list of the
reviewed and analysed sources, as well as documents included in the desk review is presented in
annex 3.
The secondary data analysis takes into account all the data at the level of disaggregation at which it is
provided such as gender, age of children in the education system, geographical location, trends for
the years, etc. It is based on publicly available or provided data from the Bureau of National statistics,
World bank, Information Analytical Centre, MoE, etc. A detailed list could be seen in annex 3.
4.2.2. QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTION
The evaluation team used three qualitative data collection methods: key informant interviews (KIIs),
focus group discussions (FGDs) and observations. The data was collected on a national/international,
regional, and local/school level. The regions for data collection were selected by the contractor in
consultation with UNICEF and national stakeholders to reflect the diverse realities in the country,
based on the specific criteria. (annex 9.5.2). The geographic area(s) – Almaty, Almaty region, Astana,
Turkistan, Atyrau, Pavlodar
9
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
Key informant interviews: A total of 32 KIIs (annex 2), were conducted, some of which dual, with 38
participants. The sampling method for qualitative data collection was based on the different criteria
at the international/national/local and school level. (annex 9.5.2)
Focus group discussions: A total of 19 FGDs (annex 2) were conducted with 89 participants. The
sampling method for qualitative data collection was based on the different criteria for recruiting
respondents. (annex 9.5.2)
Observations: 5 observations were conducted at the schools, which were chosen based on the criteria
to be located in the five key regions, selected in the evaluation, to have activities related to
inclusiveness and work with different groups of children including vulnerable categories. (annex 9.5.2)
Methods for data analysis: The methods for data analysis include transcribing and coding the KIIs and
FGDs in the NVivo software for processing qualitative information. Both an inductive and deductive
approach were used, since primary codes were based on the main topics from the interview and FGD
guides, while inductive codes were added based on what was discussed with respondents and any
emerging additional topics from the data. The protocols from the observations were analysed
qualitatively. The secondary data analysis was conducted via SPSS using statistical methods – one-
sided and two-sided distributions and testing relationships between factors.
4.3. STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION
The nature and the design of this evaluation require a high level of involvement of stakeholders at
different stages of implementation of the evaluation process, including planning, data collection and
reporting phase. A key first step towards understanding the context for the evaluation team was the
reconstruction of the ToC at the inception phase. KIIs were conducted in order to reconstruct the logic
of the reform due to the 10-year period, the available policy documents, the socio-economic changes,
and changes in the understanding and thinking making it necessary to make the process of evaluation
participatory. These KIIs were conducted with participants in the planning process and with
representatives of international and national organisations, helping to understand the context of
educational reforms in the country. The reconstructed ToC at the end of the inception phase was
presented at an online meeting with ERG (Evaluation Reference Group) where the logic of the theory
and its reconstruction was validated, the methods and expected results were discussed.
At the data collection phase, key informants were included in interviews and FGDs in order to discuss
the understanding, development of the concept and concrete measures that had to be realised to
achieve the goals of the reform, as well as a debrief meeting with representatives or UNICEF and the
MoE. It is expected that ToC and recommendations will be discussed at different levels after the
submission of the report. The most important participants were children and parents and the lessons
learned and recommendations would reflect the opinions of right holders.
4.4. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The ET of Junction Bulgaria complies with ethical considerations, such as UNICEF's guidance on
children in research, to avoid any form of stigma, discrimination or harm to children and all
participants in research. We have a strong policy in this regard, following strictly the professional
research standards and ethical aspects of the Code on Market and Social Research of the European
Society for Opinion and Marketing research. We ensure that the research complies with the UNICEF
Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis as well as Norms
and Standards of the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG), integrating human rights, gender, and
equity in accordance with the relevant UNEG guidelines (by including girls and boys/men and women
equally in the research, as well as all vulnerable groups of children and their parents, following the
UNEG norms in data collection and analysis, etc.). The ERB Research Ethics Approval letter is available
in annex 9.11.
The ET members of Junction Bulgaria believe that the data collection process must be meaningful, not
harmful to the respondent and potentially beneficial for him/her through the results (therefore
10
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
protocols to ensure subjects’ safety, protect subjects’ identity and data have been developed and
could be seen in annex 9.5.5). Quality assurance is monitored at each phase of the research process
by implementing the following activities:
Data-collection phase
• In order to ensure the quality of the data collection, information on the background/country
context is collected.
• When making an appointment for an interview/FGD, the research team clearly explains the
goal of the research and motivates informants to participate, explaining the value of their
contribution.
• Before the start of the KIIs written consent and assent forms (annex 9.5.4) are provided to the
participants to inform them about the Study Purpose, Material Benefits, Types of Questions, Skipping
Questions or Ending Participation, Confidentiality. In case of online data collection, the respondents
receive the consent forms before the KIIs/FGDs and are asked to send them signed. In case of face-to-
face KIIs/FGDs the respondents are asked to sign the consent forms on site, prior to the KII/FGD. The
school authorities sent and received parental consent forms for children signed prior to the data
collection.
• The moderation of the FGDs with children is done by UNICEF certified moderators in “Ethics
in evidence generation” with long experience working with children and vulnerable groups.
Reporting phase
Quality assurance in the reporting phase is achieved by triangulating the information collected via
different instruments and sources. At each key question of the report, we are looking at the different
points of view of the participants and orienting towards answering it in the most clear and detailed
way. The report is purposeful, objective, appropriate, clear and follows the main goals.
The ET of Junction Bulgaria ensures that access to raw data is limited through password protection of
electronic data, physical locks and restricting staff who can access the data. Hard copies such as
interview notes and any other materials are kept securely locked away and are only be accessed by
members of the team. It is also important to point out that no payment of compensation has been
made to any participants in the research (see protocol for protection of data, annex 9.5.5).
In addition, when conducting research with children, we work according to the following principles:
● We always respect children’s views and feelings;
● We are sensitive to local concerns about children;
● We explain the process of collection and sharing the information and how the data might be
used;
● We explain anonymity and confidentiality;
● We take particular care not to raise expectations about the impact of the research. We learn
from the children, but we cannot promise to improve their lives;
● We explain to children/caregivers that they may not respond to certain questions in an
interview/FGD, only the ones they wish to;
● We emphasise that we are interested in children’s descriptions in their own words and that
there are no right or wrong answers;
● We are respectful that a child may be reluctant to share information about a sensitive topic;
● We always strive to be punctual, organised and take into consideration the opinions of our
respondents
It is important to point out that the questions are formulated in a way that is compliant with children’s
age and level of understanding. In addition, no conflicts of interest have been identified in this FE.
Furthermore, the methodology was subject to independent Ethical Review Board approval
(responsibility of UNICEF) according to certain criteria in a quality review checklist. All data generation
processes, and evaluation deliverables underwent UNICEF Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for
Quality Assurance and Ethical Standards in UNICEF-supported Research, Studies, and Evaluations
(RSEs). For this purpose, a Reference Group/Technical Working Group (RG) was established in order
11
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
to ensure full participation of the Government partners in the validation of the evaluation results.
Representatives of line ministries were engaged by the Evaluator in the data collection phase as key
informants. The final draft of the report was discussed and validated with the RG and reviewed
internally by the CO and externally by independent reviewers. The final report reflected to the extent
possible all the comments of stakeholders and of peer review.
4.5. METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS. RISKS AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES
Different issues and limitations were identified, which somewhat affected the implemented
methodology and used instruments for data collection and analysis. Firstly, this is related to availability
and reliability of data. Some limitations arose in terms of the fact that the indicators from state
programmes and national projects, as indicated in the TOR, include notions such as favourable
conditions for inclusive education. This means they require a clear understanding of the different
concepts related to inclusive education (e.g. accessibility, participation, vulnerability). Having in mind
that the FE is based on secondary data collection and analysis (in addition to the qualitative methods),
the conclusions mostly depend on the level of reliability and validity of indicators, tools and data
collection systems that are already created. Whenever data was not available on certain aspects, the
ET of Junction Bulgaria looked for more possible sources for secondary data collection or consulted
the different stakeholders during the fieldwork process. For some of the indicators, however, data is
not collected at the national level and the reasons for this were sought after. The level of efficiency
was the most challenging aspect in terms of availability of data, since until 2015, there isn’t publicly
available information on national budgets and financing, so the conclusions on efficiency were made
based on the available information.
Another limitation is related to the ToC development. The complexity of the ToC and challenges
related to its reconstruction are in terms of the fact that inclusive education needs to be extracted as
a key topic from four different state programmes and project with their own goals and objectives in a
longer time period. Therefore, the ET has conducted KIIs with key stakeholders, in order to understand
the complexity of the educational reform and inclusiveness as one of the key components.
The ET has considered that the programmes are implemented at the national level in a big country
such as Kazakhstan, which means they are very big in scope and related to a lot of children. This was
considered when choosing regions, in order to achieve a variety in terms of geographic location, socio-
economic development, vulnerable groups, particularities of the schools in the areas, etc. This allowed
an in-depth analysis of the situation across the whole country.
In view of the potential bias of the proposed data collection methods, there are mainly qualitative
methods that were used in this FE, which allowed for in-depth exploration of attitudes and opinions
and understanding the process. However, when it comes to large-scale quantitative data on the
country level, secondary data analysis and desk review were conducted, and all available sources were
explored to achieve data triangulation and reliability of information. Additionally, the different data is
at a different level of disaggregation. For some of the indicators, there is disaggregation by gender (for
instance regarding children in early childhood education, children with disabilities), while for other
indicators such as for children in special classes and special schools, data is not available or
inconsistent.
5. WORK PLAN AND TIMELINE
The detailed work plan is presented in the table below, including phases of the evaluation, activities
and deliverables, team members responsible and timeline. The evaluation was carried out in three
phases. The detailed timeline of the fieldwork is in annex 9.
The responsibilities of the team members depend on their preliminary determined roles in the
evaluation. The team leader is the primary point of contact with the client, responsible for the
organisation and coordination of the data collection, analysis, and reporting. The rest of the team
members were included in all the phases of the evaluation process, according to their specific
competence. The team leader was also responsible for ensuring coherence and continuity between
12
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
the elements of the evaluation like ToC, evaluation matrix and data collection process, as well as for
ensuring inclusion and coverage of all the areas of evaluation (like relevance, efficiency, effectiveness,
etc.).
The national and international evaluators were responsible for the data collection process and analysis
of the data. The national evaluators facilitated the understanding of the national context, as well as
were responsible for conducting KIIs and FGDs, depending on the language, in which interviews were
held. Among the national evaluators there is a division of roles/competences: inclusive education
specialist, early education and care specialist, secondary education specialist. All specialists were
responsible for validity and reliability of data collection, analysis, and findings, as well as quality
assurance and adherence to the ethical standards at all stages of this FE.
The Child Rights Monitoring Specialist of UNICEF Kazakhstan is the overall Evaluation Manager of the
evaluation. The Manager ensured compliance with UNICEF norms and standards as well as compliance
with quality standards and was the UNICEF focal point for the evaluation team, also responsible for
document validation. The ET reported to Evaluation Manager and conducted the evaluation by
fulfilling the contractual arrangements in line with the TOR, UNICEF standards for evaluation reports
and the Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS) Quality Assessment System; including
developing of an evaluation (implementation) plan as part of the IR, drafting and finalising the final
report and other deliverables, and briefing the commissioner on the progress and key findings and
recommendations, as needed.
The ERG includes UNICEF programme staff, implementing partners, government, and representatives
of right holders. ERG contributed to the relevance, impartiality and credibility of the evaluation being
carried out, providing a variety of points of view, and ensuring a transparent process. The participation
of key stakeholders in the ERG also contributed to increased cooperation with the Government, state
bodies, other institutions, and donors, as well as to increase the culture and capacity of the evaluation
approach among national partners. The objectives of the ERG are to facilitate regular exchange of
information and feedback during the evaluation process; ensure access to key informants during data
collection; take part in interviews with the research team; review and comment on the draft and the
final version of the report; develop an Evaluation Management Response (EMR) to the
recommendations. UNICEF Education Section ensured that all documents needed for the evaluation
are available and provided timely feedback to the evaluation manager. Evaluation Quality Control was
conducted through a review of terms of reference, methodology and draft and final reports and was
carried out by the Child Rights Monitoring Specialist in coordination with the Evaluation Reference
Group and the UNICEF Regional Evaluation Specialist.
6. EVALUATION FINDINGS
6.1. RELEVANCE
The relevance of the State programmes is analysed in view of the alignment with the global and
government priorities. The amendments, and changes in strategies for education in view of the
changing social, economic and health context were analysed. The relevance is also influenced by the
particularity of the object of the FE, including four state programmes with partially overlapping periods
of implementation and a time scope of 10 years. Priorities and activities related to vulnerable groups
of children are analysed in view of the extent to which state education programmes are relevant to
addressing inherent equity gaps, taking into consideration any disparities.
6.1.1. ALIGNMENT OF THE STATE EDUCATION PROGRAMMES WITH THE GLOBAL
PRIORITIES
The government of the Republic of Kazakhstan continuously invests in the modernization of its
educational sector in order to improve the country’s position as one of the most developed countries
in the world and to reach the OECD standards. Therefore, the MoE introduced state programmes with
the aim to build and reform the educational system to ensure human capital development through
13
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
internationalization of educational policy, improving the quality of education and updating the school
curriculum, among other factors. As an aspect of the efforts towards internationalization of education,
the Convention of the Rights of the Child is signed and ratified in 1994 and the CRPD is signed in 2008
and ratified in 2015. In view of this process of modernization of education, it is of key importance to
analyse the level of alignment of the state education programmes with the global priorities in terms
of inclusivity (The World Declaration on Education for All, Policy, and Guidelines on Inclusion in
Education (UNESCO), Inclusive Education Initiatives for Children with Disabilities (UNICEF), The United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals).
The World Declaration on Education for All44 puts an emphasis on the children excluded from the
school system and the need for more inclusive approaches to education to overcome barriers faced
by vulnerable groups whose needs in education are not satisfied. The main challenges and target
issues pointed out in the declaration are related to limited access to primary schooling; literacy and
functional literacy; limited access to printed knowledge, new skills and technologies that could
improve the quality of children’s lives and help them shape, and adapt to, social and cultural change;
failure of many children to complete basic education programmes; even when the attendance
requirements are satisfied, many children do not acquire essential knowledge and skills. In view of
these challenges, the vision in the World Declaration on Education for All is based on the following
elements: universalizing access and promoting equity; focusing on learning; broadening the means
and scope of basic education; enhancing the environment for learning; strengthening partnerships.
In 1994, UNESCO’s Salamanca Statement and Framework of Action45 made a call for inclusive
education based on the principle that ordinary schools should accommodate all children regardless of
their physical, intellectual, emotional, linguistic, or other requirements. In order to achieve this, the
following action steps are required: give the highest priority to improve the education systems to
enable them to include all children regardless of individual differences or difficulties; adopt as a matter
of law or policy the principle of inclusive education, enrolling all children in regular schools, unless
there are compelling reasons for doing otherwise; establish decentralized and participatory
mechanisms for planning, monitoring and evaluating educational provision for children and adults
with SEN; encourage and facilitate the participation of parents, communities, and organization of
persons with disabilities in the planning and decision-making processes concerning provision for SEN;
invest greater effort in early identification and intervention strategies; ensure that, in the context of
a systemic change, teacher education programmes, both preservice and in service, address the
provision of special needs education in inclusive schools. In table 11 (annex 9.10.1), the analysis shows
that most of the priorities of the programmes are in a high level of alignment with the principles of
the World Declaration on Education for All. In the Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on
Special Needs Education, which is focused on action framework towards achieving the same priorities
outlined in the World Declaration on Education for All, some of the aspects related towards
encouraging and facilitating the participation of parents, communities and organization of persons
with disabilities in the planning and decision-making processes concerning provision for SEN, are not
particularly outlined in the state education programmes. Parents and communities share in KIIs and
FGDs they do not feel involved and in some regions of the country they even don’t have enough
information on the available programmes and opportunities for inclusive education. Another key topic
not indicated in the programme is early identification and intervention strategies, as well as vocational
aspects of inclusive education. According to what stakeholders share, early identification and
intervention is still not developed in practice and such services do not exist. Vocational aspects have
started developing in recent years. Additionally, development of demonstration projects and
encouraging exchange with countries, as well as establishment of decentralised and participatory
mechanisms for planning, monitoring, and evaluating educational provision are not indicated in the
state programmes. However, in practice the stakeholders refer to exchanging experience and best
practices across countries using different examples. In view of planning, monitoring and evaluation, a
national database has been developed, which will be discussed in the efficiency part.
14
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
The Policy and Guidelines on Inclusion in Education (UNESCO)46 have the objectives to assist
countries in strengthening the focus on inclusion in their strategies and plans for education, to
introduce the broadened concept of inclusive education and to highlight the areas that need particular
attention to promote inclusive education and strengthen policy development. In 2008, UNESCO
argued that a broad concept of inclusive education “can be viewed as a general guiding principle to
strengthen education for sustainable development, lifelong learning for all and equal access of all
levels of society to learning opportunities so as to implement the principles of inclusive education”47
Education for All (EFA) represents an international commitment to ensure that every child and adult
receives basic education of good quality. EFA is based both on a human rights perspective and on the
generally held belief that education is central to individual well-being and national development48. In
table 12 in the annex 9.10.1 the analysis shows that in terms of attitudinal changes and policy
development the level of alignment is low since none of the state programmes directly address this
change. In terms of ensuring ECEC and inclusive curriculum, the level of alignment is medium, having
in mind that only some of the programmes outline the systematic problems in ECD, but there is no
action towards development of inclusive ECEC and the focus is on the coverage. Teachers and teacher
education, resources and legislation are with a high level of alignment.
UNICEF has a number of initiatives for children with disabilities in inclusive education, since the topic
is at the focus of the efforts and its importance is recognised. The Convention on the Rights of the
Child is the first instrument in international law to deal comprehensively with the human rights of
children and is notable for the inclusion of an article specifically concerned with the rights of children
with disability. Article 2 of the CRC introduces, for the first time in an international human rights treaty,
an explicit obligation on governments to assure the realisation of all rights to every child without
discrimination, including on grounds of disability49. The convention aims to protect the rights of people
with disabilities, including the right to education.
There have, traditionally, been three broad approaches to the education of children with disabilities:
segregation, in which children are classified according to their impairment and allocated a school
designed to respond to that particular impairment; integration, where children with disabilities are
placed in the mainstream system, often in special classes, as long as they can accommodate its
demands and fit in with its environment; and inclusion, where there is recognition of a need to
transform the cultures, policies and practices in schools to accommodate the differing needs of
individual students, and an obligation to remove the barriers that impede that possibility. It has been
argued that inclusive education is not only about addressing issues of input, such as access, and those
related to processes, such as teacher training, but also involves a shift in underlying values and beliefs
held across the system. It requires that all children, including children with disabilities, not only have
access to schooling within their own communities, but that they are provided with appropriate
learning opportunities to achieve their full potential. Its approach is underpinned by an understanding
that all children should have equivalent and systematic learning opportunities in a wide range of
school and additional educational settings, despite the differences that might exist. A Rights-Based
Approach to Inclusive Education proposes a conceptual framework on the very specific issues that
affect the inclusion of children with disabilities in Central Eastern Europe and Commonwealth of
Independent States (CEECIS). Rights-based tools for Inclusive Education for children with disabilities
are provided, meant to serve as a reference for advocacy and policy making to UNICEF’s government
counterparts and other partners in CEECIS. It provides clear strategy options for Inclusive Education
for children with disabilities, while keeping in mind the need for system-wide approaches designed to
address the needs of all children. The commitment to the right of every child with a disability to
inclusive education should be realised through legal reform; policy and guidance; service delivery;
attitudinal and cultural change; respect for human rights; training and support for teachers;
participatory engagement with children and families50.
To bridge the education divide for children with disabilities, UNICEF stands alongside governments in
their endeavours to cultivate and supervise inclusive education systems, centring on four essential
pillars: advocacy, raising awareness, building capacity, and providing implementation support.51. In
15
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
different policy reports, roundtables, and discussion there is an analysis and definitions of inclusive
education in terms of the rights of children with disabilities.5253 Additionally, the concept of child-
friendly schools (CFS), developed by UNICEF, was designed to get all children into school, while
guaranteeing both the quality of learning opportunities and results, and the protection of children’s
rights within school. It thus provides an effective operational model for taking forward the rights-
based approach to inclusive education for children with disabilities54.
The Rights-Based Approach to Education, developed by UNICEF, as described above, includes the
areas in table 13 in annex 9.10.1, as well as universal and targeted measures. In terms of the right of
access to education, the level of alignment is low to medium in the different aspects. In terms of
removing barriers, the analysis shows that in most of the state programmes, the topic of physical
access to education is in the focus, but informational access and work with attitudes have not been
identified. Working to support parents, as well as early identification and assessment are not included
sufficiently as priorities in the programmes, so the level of alignment is low. In terms of the right to
quality education, the level of alignment is medium to high since topics like improvement of education
systems in schools, investment, and support for teachers, as well as right-based learning and
assessment are included in the priorities of the programs.
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals55 in the area of education (SDG 4)56 by 2030,
related to inclusive education, are the following: to ensure that all girls and boys complete free,
equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning
outcomes; to ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care
and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education; to eliminate gender
disparities and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable,
including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations; to ensure
that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and
numeracy. The analysis of the visions and goals of the four state programmes, repeated throughout
all the programmes, oriented towards ensuring equitable access for all children to the teaching and
learning process, high-quality pre-school, and secondary education in a safe and comfortable inclusive
learning environment, shows that they are relevant to the main visions and targets of SDG4 in view of
inclusive education.
6.1.2. ALIGNMENT OF THE STATE EDUCATION PROGRAMMES WITH THE
GOVERNMENT PRIORITIES
Kazakhstan's government priorities are focused on modernising the country's economy and society,
promoting innovation and digitalization, and enhancing the quality of education. These priorities are
outlined in several key strategic documents, including "Kazakhstan-2050" which seeks to establish a
knowledge-based economy and society, and "Digital Kazakhstan" which focuses on promoting the
development of the country's digital economy. The National Development Plan of Kazakhstan-2025,
among other priorities, also emphasises the importance of education in promoting social cohesion
and inclusivity, and ensuring that education is accessible to all, regardless of their background. Overall,
the government's priorities are aimed at promoting economic and social development, while also
ensuring that the needs and rights of all citizens, including children, are protected, and promoted.
The National Strategy “Kazakhstan-2050” is considered one of the most important guiding policy
documents of Kazakhstan. It was established in 2012 and stipulates national priorities for
development until 2050. It focuses on creating opportunities for economic development and outlines
priorities for Kazakhstan to become one of the thirty most developed countries. The following key
ideas are mentioned: new economic policies focused on pragmatism, support of entrepreneurship as
a key economic driver, new social policies and guarantees, skills development and patriotism. In table
14, annex 9.10.2, there is an analysis of the alignment of the state programmes with this guiding state
policy document. The majority of the state education programs’ goals are coherent with the education
goals and priorities stipulated in the National Strategy “Kazakhstan-2050” and therefore are evaluated
as of “high” alignment.
16
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
The State Programme “Digital Kazakhstan” for 2018-2022 was adopted in 2017 and aims to develop
information and communication technologies (ICT) throughout all economic sectors of the country
and to improve the quality of lives of all citizens. It focuses on shifting Kazakhstan’s economy towards
a new development level through creating a digital economy in the long term. It stipulates
digitalization of such sectors of the economy as transport and logistics, agriculture, government
services, increased ICT coverage, and citizens’ digital skills and competencies and development of
startups and technological entrepreneurship. In table 15 in annex 9.10.2 is presented the level of
alignment of the state education programmes to the Digital Kazakhstan program. The majority of
stipulated goals and priorities of the State Programme “Digital Kazakhstan” related to development
of social field is in line with the goals in the state education programs, so the alignment is considered
as high.
The National Development Plan of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2025 (previously referred to as
the Strategic Development Plan of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2025) is a first-tier document in
the system of state planning and is developed in accordance with the long-term Development Strategy
of Kazakhstan until 2050. It forms the basis for the new economic course of the country in the medium
term, aimed at mitigating the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis and promoting factors that
accelerate economic growth for a more sustainable and inclusive economy. The Plan outlines 10 key
national priorities, but for the purpose of the evaluation, particular attention has been given to the
National Priority 3. Quality Education. Table 16 in annex 9.10.2 summarises the relevance of state
education programmes to the key priorities and objectives outlined in the National Development Plan
of Kazakhstan until 2025. It demonstrates that the priorities of the state education programmes are
in a high level of alignment with the principles of the National Development Plan 2025 in their
commitment to human-rights, DEI, and inclusiveness in education. Overall, the National Development
Plan of Kazakhstan until 2025, along with the State Programmes for Education and Science
Development, demonstrate a strong commitment to promoting human rights, children's rights,
equality, inclusion, and inclusive education. The government's prioritisation of social policies,
accessible healthcare, quality education, and a fair and efficient state system is aligned with its
commitment to these principles. There is a high relevance of state education programmes to the
National Plan’s objectives of ensuring access and equity in education as well as improving the quality
of education at all levels. Other key objectives and areas outlined in the National Plan find some
reflection and coherence in the state education programs, yet no areas of deficit were identified.
6.1.3. PRIORITIES AND ACTIVITIES RELATED TO VULNERABLE GROUPS OF
CHILDREN
The planning of policies for different vulnerable groups of children means to know which are these
groups, to firstly conduct a needs assessment to understand their needs and to plan policies in view
of these needs. This means that it is necessary to have a definition of what is understood by vulnerable
categories, children at risk of exclusion from quality and adapted education, due to family, social,
economic, and/or individual conditions in terms of health, income, gender, or behaviour. It is
necessary to conduct needs assessment, based on which could be set the activities related to different
topics and groups such as gender disparities, children with disabilities, low-income families, children
in institutionalised care, living in remote areas, with risk behaviour and in conflict with the law, from
linguistic and ethnic minorities.
The analysis of the legislation in Kazakhstan57 shows that in some laws there is a mention of different
categories of vulnerable groups of the population on the whole, which include: families with or raising
children with disabilities; orphans and children left without parental care, under the age of twenty-
nine, who lost their parents before adulthood; candace; mothers of many children; incomplete
families.
Additionally, in the Law on education58 inclusive education is defined as “a process that provides equal
access to education for all students, taking into account SEN and individual opportunities.” Different
17
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
groups of children are also indicated who are supported in view of their living expenses in the period
of obtainment of education.
In the Law on the Rights of the child59 is indicated that every child has the right to education. The
legislative document indicates two vulnerable categories of children: children with disabilities and
children in need of social protection. For those groups of children, the state budget allocates additional
funds to guarantee their education. There is a special article in the law, dedicated to children with
disabilities such as having equal rights with others, as well as the right to receive education, to choose
the type of activity/profession. Children with mental or physical disabilities have the right to receive
medical and social assistance in accordance with an individual child development plan under the
guidance of parents/guardians/ social workers and other specialists.
Another document, mentioning vulnerable groups of children is the 2015 Conceptual Approach,
according to which inclusive education can be realized through the implementation of a personalized
pedagogical approach intended to include persons with SEN, such as children with disabilities,
migrants, and refugees, kandas/oralmans (ethnic Kazakh returnees), national minorities and children
in vulnerable social situations 60.
In 2022, in the Order of the MoES of the Republic of Kazakhstan from the 12th of January 2022 № 6
are indicated children with SEN (лица (дети) с особыми образовательными потребностями) and
this group includes persons (children) who have permanent or temporary needs in special conditions
for receiving education of the appropriate level and additional education; children with disabilities
(ребенок (дети) с ограниченными возможностями) - children under eighteen years of age with
physical and (or) mental disabilities, having a disability due to congenital, hereditary, acquired diseases
or the consequences of injuries, confirmed in the prescribed manner.61
A cross-cutting issue addressing equity gaps taking into consideration any disparities in view of
implementation of the HRBA62 is focused on the conscious and systematic enhancement of human
rights in all aspects of project and programme development and implementation. This is a conceptual
framework for the process of human development, normatively based on international human rights
standards and operationally directed towards promoting and protecting human rights. The HRBA has
a two-fold objective: 1) to empower right-holders to claim and exercise their rights and 2) to
strengthen the capacity of duty-bearers who have a particular obligation or responsibility to respect,
protect, and fulfil rights of the poorest, weakest, most marginalized, and vulnerable. In order to
understand the implementation of the basic principles such as non-discrimination, equality, age, and
gender-appropriateness. This evaluation makes an analysis of the degree to which the interests and
rights of the right-holders, children at risk of exclusion from the educational system, are considered
and reflected in the state programmes. Different factors lead to identifying different groups of
children and their level of vulnerability, which allows to identify needs and the degree to which the
programmes, plans, measures, and priorities address these needs. These factors are related to age,
gender, health, physical, mental, emotional, and social development, place of living, ethnicity,
economic status, being in out-of-home care. In view of different groups of children and the degree to
which the programmes reflect their needs and address equity gaps, firstly it should be analysed how
many these children are and the tendencies in the change in this number over the years.
- Gender disparities
‘’To achieve universal basic education, children need equitable access to quality education. This must
include…all boys and girls regardless of their age and socioeconomic or socio-cultural background”63.
The data regarding the gender division among children in the country for the period 2011-2022 shows
that the share of boys and girls is quite similar without significant changes over the years and there is
a slight prevalence of boys in each year (graph 1). One of the indicators for the presence of challenges
related to education in terms of gender disparities is early drop out of school for the different groups
of children.

Additionally, other problems were identified in the concept of family and gender policies in the
Republic of Kazakhstan such as “early marriages, teenage pregnancies, abortions at a young age,
which is especially common in rural areas. More than two million teenage girls and girls under the age
of 18 live in Kazakhstan; this is one fifth of the total female population of the republic. Over the past 5
years, 33,051 cases of teenage pregnancy have been registered, including 9,906 abortions among girls
between 15 and 18 years of age. The number of abortions in the 15-18 age group remains quite high
and amounts to about 2 thousand abortions per year, or 0.1% of the total number of teenage girls and
girls under 18.”66
In none of the state education programmes there is analysis of the needs of the different groups of children
regarding gender, neither there is special attention paid or measures targeted towards gender disparities in
education.
- Children with disabilities

individual development.
In the State Programme 2011–2020 there isn’t an analysis of the needs of children, but rather of the degree to
which the system creates conditions for accessible education for children with SEN, including children with
disabilities. The conclusion that the system is underdeveloped is made and special activities for its development
are planned, among which are special and inclusive classrooms and created favourable conditions for inclusive
education, as well as improved access.
The State Programme 2016–2019 also doesn’t analyse the needs, but rather the system that needs to respond
to these needs and states that inclusion of children with SEN remains relevant (after the new Conceptual
approach is adopted in 2015, as pointed out above, the concept of special needs is in the focus, not only children
with disabilities), because the indicator for creating favourable conditions for their upbringing and education
has not been achieved since there is a shortage of qualified specialists.
The State Programme 2020–2025 again covers the ability of the system to respond to the needs of children with
SEN. The mentioned issues are similar to those in the previous programs, related to shortage of specialists and
low share of coverage of pre-school and school children with SEN. This programme puts an emphasis on the
transition from the medical to the pedagogical model of working with children with disabilities and
strengthening the activities of the PMPCs and PPCRs. The preparation of teachers to work with these children is
also commented.
In the National project 2021-2025 among the tasks are those related to coverage of children with disabilities,
special psychological and pedagogical support.

indirectly, influence the education of this group of students. The data for the period shows that there
is a decrease in the share of socially unprotected, poor and families in difficult situation (graph 3). This
decrease has become even faster in the last 5 years. The socio-economic development of the country
should be considered, since it is a factor influencing the share of such families.

In the State Programme2016–2019 is stated that there is a need to increase the coverage rate of preschool
education, including for children from families with low income. In addition, the availability of sports facilities
for mass sports as well as visits to cultural and sports organizations will be ensured through benefits (free
subscriptions) for children from such families as well. Also, free hot meals are provided for children from low-
income families.
In the State Programme2020–2025 the analysis shows that children from low-income families do not have access
to enough extracurricular activities and among the planned measures are indicated those related to additional
services for the parents of these children and the children themselves such as short-stay groups for children 1-
2 years old from low-income families, expand coverage of vocational education for children and summer camps.
- Children living in institutionalised care
According to an assessment of alternative care in Kazakhstan70 from 2010 to 2012 there was a
decrease in the number of orphan children and those deprived of parental care by more than 3000
cases. According to official data from the Children’s Rights Protection Committee of the MoES, in 2012
there were 19,500 children at risk of losing parental care, an increase of 2.2% from 2010. The main
reasons for children at risk include a growth in the number of children born out of wedlock, social
disorganisation of families, financial and housing difficulties, and unhealthy relationships between
parents and children due to issues such as alcohol and drug addiction and cases of child abuse and
neglect.

Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
Children with disabilities in care often have no access to education, rehabilitation, or other support.
“Children who leave the institutions at the age of 18 years are more likely to face stigmatization and
low levels of education, unemployed, and poverty… In facilities for children with disabilities, disabled
children often have no access to education, recreation, rehabilitation, or other programs.”71
In addition, it should be pointed out that children without parental care and orphans are at risk of
dropping out of school, so the family situation is one of the reasons for missing out education. For this
reason they are placed in institutions, but this is not related to a higher quality of education72.
Having in mind that the children placed in specialized institutions have specific needs of support to
overcome their family situation, skills development and education, the state policy needs to address
these issues.
In the State Programme 2016–2019 is stated that the availability of sports facilities for mass sports as well as
visits to cultural and sports organizations will be ensured through benefits (free subscriptions) for orphans and
children without parental care. In addition, it is indicated that the proportion of orphans and children left
without parental care in residential institutions will decrease due to a set of measures to transfer them in
families (under guardianship, patronage, and adoption).
In the State Programme2020–2025 it is stated that a network of centres and psychological services is developed
(transformation of orphanages) and will continue to provide social, legal, and psychological and pedagogical
support to families with children in difficult life situations. Furthermore, representatives of business and NGO
sectors will be involved in supporting the employment of graduates of organizations for orphans and children
left without parental care. As in the previous state programmes, there is still an emphasis on supporting and
cooperation with non-profit organisations for the placement of orphans and children left without parental care
in families. Also, work will continue on the development of schools for foster parents.
- Children living in remote areas
The data about poverty for the period 2014 to 2015 shows that poverty rose almost 6 percentage
points overall—8 percentage points in rural areas and 4 percentage points in urban areas73. Children
living in remote areas face a number of challenges such as not having Internet access, transportation,
buildings in bad conditions, lack of health specialists and resources and, notably, lack of access to
education. Additionally, PISA results indicate that students from rural schools have lower results than
those in urban school74. “For some families, particularly those living in rural areas, sending a child to a
special school means traveling long distances or leaving the child to live at school full time or during
the school week. As result, children are separated from their families and immediate communities.”75.
“Kazakhstan faces the challenge of further improving ECEC coverage and quality and raising the
performance of all students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, those attending
ungraded or rural schools and low performers”76.
The share of children living in rural areas is

Final Report
lower secondary school. In rural areas, the proportion of children who are out of school is 3.7 percent
and in urban areas it is 1.4 percent.”78
In the State Programme 2011–2020 it is pointed out that there is work being done on informatisation in terms
of decreasing the number of students per one computer, especially in rural areas, and also providing access to
Internet, which was already 97% for rural schools in 2011, raised from 70% in 2005. The need for more children
to attend kindergartens in rural areas is also commented, since only 5 out of 100 children attend them, while in
urban areas this is every third child. In rural areas 68,6% of schools are ungraded. Also, the number of profession-
oriented schools with dormitories is rising, especially in rural areas. Some of the aims in the programme are to
provide 100% of secondary schools in rural areas with canteens by 2020 and to ensure medical examinations for
all school children, including those in rural areas, by 2015. The problem of ungraded schools will be solved with
supporting schools, boarding schools, and transportation services.
In the State Programme 2016–2019 the analysis mentions the issues with qualification of teachers in rural areas
and ungraded schools.
In the State Programme 2020–2025, similarly to the previous program, key issues are: there are no effective
mechanisms for attracting and retaining qualified teachers to schools, especially schools in rural areas; there is
a huge gap in quality of school education, especially in rural areas, according to international studies like PISA;
there is insufficient coverage of extracurricular activities for schools in remote areas. It is indicated that as a
result of the implementation of measures to improve the quality of education and science, 100% of support
schools in rural areas will be provided with boarding schools. Also, it is envisaged to equip rural general
education and "vulnerable" schools with teaching materials, computer equipment and digital technology.
In the National project 2021-2025 one of the tasks is to improve the quality of secondary education: reducing
the gap in the quality of education between regions, urban and rural schools in Kazakhstan.
- Children with risk behaviour and children in conflict with the law
Children who have committed a crime and children who commit so-called "status offences", which
include acts that would be criminal in nature if committed by adults; child victims and child witnesses
of crimes are one of the most vulnerable social groups. “Minors can become at risk of coming into
conflict with law as a result of poverty, parental use of alcohol and drugs; parental separation; lack of
parental attention; and desire for independence, including financial independence”79. Children in
conflict with the law are also indicated as one of the groups at risk of missing out education and
becoming dropouts from school in view of past experiences80.

Only in the State Programme2020–2025, there is a mention that children committing crimes is an issue, there is
an increase in child and adolescent crime and there is a need to strengthen educational work, but there are no
specific measures related to children in conflict with the law.

(70%), roughly one-quarter of the
population is Christian (26%), and 3.5% of the population is designated “other” or has no religious

purpose of providing equal educational opportunities and access to educational services, there are
schools in Kazakhstan with various languages of instruction for organisation of the learning process in
these schools.84.
However, learning several languages could be stressful and challenging for students, especially from
vulnerable groups. Parents share that even if it’s important that the child firstly learns the maternal
language, they often don’t have enough opportunities to choose it, especially children at an early age
and with SEN.
In the State Programme 2011–2020 special attention is paid to teaching the Kazakh language, preparing
teachers, and training materials, therefore ensuring access to ethnic minorities to understand the language of
instruction. A new system of continuous learning of the Kazakh language “kindergarten – school, vocational
lyceum, college – higher educational institution” will be created which will allow every Kazakhstani citizen to
acquire the state language in full.
In the State Programme 2016–2019 it is stated that starting from 2017, elements of a multilingual education
programme with the study of Kazakh, Russian and English languages will be gradually introduced in all
organizations of preschool education and training. Domestic textbooks and teaching materials for language
disciplines will be developed in accordance with the Unified Language Standard for Teaching Three Languages,
which will ensure the achievement of a new quality of teaching technologies, the development of a modern
educational, methodological, and scientific and pedagogical base.
In the State Programme 2020–2025, again, there is an emphasis on developing communication skills in three
languages, but with a priority on the state language through methodological and scientific support for education,
including in-depth study of the Kazakh language and literature.
- Migration
Children affected by migration in Kazakhstan may be exposed to multiple threats to their rights, such
as forced labour, physical abuse, and even trafficking85. “Despite significant efforts in recent years,
including widening access to early childhood education, extending compulsory education to Grade 12
and stipulating that all permanent and temporary migrants and stateless children are eligible to
education while living in Kazakhstan, a small number of children are not enrolled in school, particularly
pre-school education and upper-secondary”86.

than 2010 (graph 8).
Only in the State Programme2011–2020 it is pointed out among the challenges: increase in the number of
children on the pre-school waiting list and shortage of school places caused by demographic processes
(increasing birth-rate) and migration. There are no specific measures to address the needs of those group of
children.
The analysis of the availability of priorities and activities related to different groups of children in the
three state programmes and national project shows that two groups are included in all the
programmes and the national project and these are children with SEN and children with disabilities,
as well as children living in remote areas (table 17, annex 9.10.3). Children migrants and children in
conflict with the law are only mentioned in one of the programs, while gender disparities are not
addressed in any programs. It should be noted that this division of groups is rather tentative, in order
to facilitate the analysis of the priorities, but in terms of needs, it is very significant that more often
children can belong to several groups at the same time. For example, children from rural areas often
also fall into the group from low-income families and when they also have a disability, it is more
difficult to meet their needs due to limited access to services, so there is a bigger need for additional
support in view of access to quality education and other aspects.
When it comes to presence of SEN, the 2007 Law on Education provides a definition of persons with
special education needs, referring to those who experience constant or temporary difficulties in
education due to health reasons.
As it was noted above, in the Conceptual Approach from 2015 a definition is introduced regarding
inclusive education and the inclusion of persons with SEN, including different vulnerable categories of
children, among which children with disabilities, ethnic minorities, children in vulnerable social
situations, etc. This means that the group of children with special needs includes different subgroups.

6.1.4. AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES IN STRATEGIES FOR EDUCATION IN VIEW OF
THE CHANGING CONTEXT
Education is a sector directly related to socio-economic development, so it has a significant
contribution to developing the economy. The educational system needs to boost development
through shaping children into citizens who are well-integrated into society and achieve social mobility,
but at the same time it needs to adapt to the ever-changing context in terms of socio-economic
development and other external factors (Covid-19, digitalisation).
Since 2000, Kazakhstan has made significant progress in reducing poverty and building a middle class
due to the market-oriented reforms. “Kazakhstan’s economy grew at an average annual rate of 6.8
percent between 2001 and 2016. Kazakhstan’s poverty rate dropped from 55 percent of the population
in 2006 to 20 percent in 2015, as the middle class grew from 10 percent to 25 percent. Sustained
economic growth has transformed the country into an upper middle-income economy,
commensurately raising living standards and reducing poverty. This progress, however, masks
vulnerabilities and unevenness in the country’s development model. Slowing economic growth,
growing inequality and elite capture, and weak institutions reflect the flaws of the resource-based and
state-led growth model and raise the risk that Kazakhstan could become stuck in the “middle-income
trap.”92 “In 2015, the poverty rate was 8 percent in Almaty and Astana cities (average for the two
cities), 15 percent in other urban areas, and 25 percent in rural areas. Similarly, close to half (45
percent) of the population in Almaty and Astana is estimated to have been in the middle class in 2015,
compared with 28 percent in other urban areas and 18 percent in rural areas”93.
All the state education programmes reflect the differences, as indicated in the previous part, target children
from rural areas, as well as the differences in the educational services across the areas, which means they reflect
the unequal socio-economic development in the regions. At the same time, for the period of 10 years in the
scope of the evaluation, this topic is still current and hasn’t found a solution, although it appears in each
programme.
2020 is a very challenging year for the whole world, including for Kazakhstan’s economy. The fallout
of the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the economy even more than the crises in 2008 and 2015. According
to the report from 2020 „Kazakhstan economic update: Navigating the crisis“, it is estimated that
“Kazakhstan’s poverty rate will increase to 12-14 percent in 2020. The pandemic has hit severely retail,
hospitality, wholesale, and transport sectors, which account for around 30 percent of employment,
and are mostly concentrated in cities. However, the most significant increase in the number of the poor
is expected to come from rural areas, which can increase inequality in Kazakhstan”.94 The negative
effect over the children is also significant: “According to the Ministry of Healthcare of the Republic of
Kazakhstan, in 2020, 7 291 children with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were registered in the
Republic of Kazakhstan.”95

Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
The COVID-19 pandemic impacts globally on the education concept revision. New educational trends
have emerged in the world due to the distance education experience. Education is moving towards
digital content. The special organisation "Education Week", recognising the cost and logistical
problems of the blended learning, suggests that in general students could attend only certain core
subjects in school; vulnerable student groups such as those with SEN or immigrants learning the
language of a country may attend the school offline; distance learning and traditional learning could
be combined using best practices and distance learning experiences during school closure.96
In order to address the new situation, computers were purchased, and teaching staff was trained for
working in the new conditions. However, the issue of education quality became significant. The
analysis from the Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 by UNICEF and UNDP
demonstrated that the education system of Kazakhstan was not ready to transfer all learning online
to distance learning in the context of the pandemic. The lack of necessary technical support was
among the main problems. Educational organizations often used different apps to organize training
instead of using educational platforms. Furthermore, some students did not have the necessary
technical equipment such
as computers, laptops or “We had online lessons, we had notebooks with everything. The teachers did
tablets and had to use very good, but students were not motivated like this, I had low grades, but

Digitalization of the education sector is a requirement of the modern world; this issue has acquired
particular relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the transition to a distance learning format.
the availability of modern computer technology is a basic condition for digitalization of the educational
process. “Over the past 13 years, there has been a positive growth in the number of computer
equipment used in the educational process. In addition, there is a reduction in the difference in the
availability of modern computer technology between urban and rural colleges”98.
According to the Law on education, the state provides conditions of creation of informational and
communication infrastructure of electronic tutoring with use of ICT99.
The topic of digitalisation appears in the State programme2011-2020 – “work is underway to develop
informatization of education. There are currently 18 students per computer. In 2005, this indicator was 41,
including 36 in rural areas. 98% of schools are connected to the Internet, rural schools - 97% (in 2005 - 75% and
70% respectively). 34% of schools have access to broadband Internet”.
According to the State Programme2016-2019, there will be an opportunity for students to access a wide range
of digital educational resources from anywhere with Internet access. Thus, it is stated that each student could
determine the pace of learning and not be tied to the lesson and the teacher. It is envisioned that at least two
subjects, starting from the basic school, will be taught using online resources.
In the State Programme2020-2025 it is stated that “as part of the implementation of the World Bank's project
"Modernization of Secondary Education", it is envisaged to equip rural general education and "vulnerable"
schools with teaching materials, computer equipment and digital technology”.
27
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
To address the challenges, “Kazakhstan developed and adopted the national project Educated Nation 2021-2025.
This includes ensuring the availability and quality of preschool education and training, reducing gaps in the
quality of education, and ensuring a safe and modern learning environment.”100
“The number of computers used in the educational process has increased 3 times. The number of
interactive whiteboards in full-time state schools has almost doubled. Over the past five years, 728,026
computers have been purchased for schools, including 343,449 units in rural schools. In order to update
the computer equipment fleet, as of 2021, more than 70 thousand computers have been written off.”101
According to the data from the National Report 2021 on the State and Development of the Education
System of the Republic of Kazakhstan, in recent years, there has been a development in terms of
digitalisation in education in Kazakhstan in view of an increase in the provision of ICT tools in
preschools. “These include personal computers, multimedia projectors, touch screen interactive
whiteboards, and developmental virtual games. The total number of computers used in preschools for
educational purposes is 2,979, with 1,687 in urban areas and 1,292 in rural areas, or 27.4% of the total
number of POs. Total ECEC centres, equipped with ICT equipment in 2021 increased by 216. The largest
share of POs equipped with ICT equipment is in Atyrau region (59.2%) and Astana (53.8%), and the
smallest share is in North Kazakhstan region (12.2% )…” Additionally, the data shows that the number
of computers used in the educational process in secondary schools has increased three times – over
the past five years, 728 026 have been purchased for schools, including 343 449 units in rural
schools”.102
The observations conducted in selected schools in the country show that digitalisation is an ongoing
process that has begun, but a lot of development is still needed. There are differences between
schools in rural and urban areas. In rural areas there aren’t whiteboards or technologies apart from
one classroom in the school and there is no adequate Internet connection. At the same time, in urban
schools there is Internet and better equipment but still in a limited number of classrooms and not
available for all students and all the schools.
In summary, the educational policy and programmes are in accordance with international documents,
orienting education towards equity for all, including children with different level of abilities and socio-
economic background. Inclusive education is not in a separate program, but rather an integral part of
current educational policy and reform. The early identification and early childhood development and
care for children with SEN are still not addressed in the programs, so the level of relevance with this
priority is lower. Not all state programmes and documents reflect the concept of disability in the
country and the transition from a medical to a pedagogical model and this transition appears towards
the end of the period at the scope of the evaluation. The work to support parents and ensure their
participation is also insufficiently addressed in the programs.
National policy on inclusiveness in education is oriented toward providing opportunities for children at
risk of exclusion from quality and adapted education, due to family, social, economic, and/or individual
conditions to be equally included in the educational process together with the rest of the children in
line with the Constitution and the Law “On Education”. During the period in the scope of the evaluation
the children with SEN are defined with permanent or temporary difficulties due to health reasons (2007
Law on education), in 2015 the concept includes additional groups such as children with disabilities,
migrants, and refugees, kandas (ethnic Kazakh returnees), national minorities and children in
vulnerable social situations, while in regulations in 2022, the concept outlines the needs of children in
terms of support by the educational system, instead of listing the different groups in need of support.
The State Education Programmes are developed and address the needs of the different groups of
children following the way in which the concept of special education needs develops. In terms of
different groups of children at risk of exclusion from quality and adapted education, the most
addressed in the programmes are the needs of children with disabilities and children in rural areas,
while the needs of children migrants and in conflict with the law are the least addressed.
Different external factors influence the level of relevance of the policies and the possibility to adapt to
the changing environment. In the period of assessment these are the pandemic and challenges due to
28

Final Report
the changing context, which have a significant effect on the participation of children with SEN in the
educational process, creating newly emerging obstacles and barriers towards their inclusion.
6.2. COHERENCE
The coherence is analysed in terms of internal coherence, horizontal and vertical integration, as well
as partnership and collaboration between the different stakeholders. The level of internal coherence
and logic of the state education programmes is influenced by the availability of needs analysis used as
a basis of planning; strengths/weaknesses; priorities, tasks, and relationships between them. The
horizontal and vertical integration are key points in the implementation process, relationships
between different sectors and executive bodies and outline the approach of implementation.
6.2.1. INTERNAL COHERENCE AND LOGIC OF THE STATE EDUCATION
PROGRAMMES
The State Programme2011-2020 introduces a key indicator related to inclusive education for the first
time, which has a serious significance in terms of boosting its development and is the first step of the
government in the process of creating a focused policy on this issue. According to what was shared

responsibilities”. (KII with national representative)
Each of the next State education
programmes and the National
project keep inclusiveness in their focus, but to a different extent. Every programme has its own logic,
including planning at different levels, which, although defined differently, are related to the overall
goal, specific goals, tasks/priorities, SWOT analysis, and indicators which are quantitative and
measurable. It is notable that the logic of planning of the State programme 2011-2020 follows the
priority areas like teacher qualification, financing, management and, at the same time, the levels of
education like pre-school and primary, secondary, vocational, higher. The State programme 2016-
2019 and the National project follow solely the logic of the educational levels. The State programme
2020-2025 is rather focused on priority areas, including different components of the educational
reform like modernization of pedagogical education, reducing the gaps between urban and rural
schools, implementation of quality assessment system, safe and comfortable learning environment,
etc.
Each of the State programmes has a short introductory part, indicating main issues and challenges, as
well as data regarding issues that have been identified. An in-depth targeted analysis has not been
identified in none of the State programmes or National project, although in different reports of
organisations such analyses could be found, but the programmes do not refer to them. Available data
shows that between 2015 and 2021 every year a National report on the State and Development of the
Education System of the Republic
of Kazakhstan is made and is

generation and lack of analysis leads to a number of challenges in the planning process such as
overlapping of the period of implementation and the main topics and priorities, as well as a lack of
upgrading and continuing based on the previous program.
Only in the State programme 2020-2025 there is analysis based on the results from the previous period
with the level of achievement of indicators so far, while the programme for 2016 mainly focused on
what has happened in educational development during the period 2011-2015, without mentioning
the previous State programme and its indicators. The National project also doesn’t contain such
analysis.
Due to the way priorities are identified and the main tasks are planned, the topic of inclusive education
could be seen as a cross-cutting point and in the different priority areas. Although the topic appears
in all of the programmes in certain parts, it is not subject to separate policy and planning but rather a
part of the planned tasks on the other issues. When it comes to the internal structure and logic of
different programmes and the place of inclusive education in them, the analysis shows that the topic
could be found in different levels, but not in the overall goal and it could be measured through
different indicators in the three programmes and the project.

and the objectives, it could be seen through access and coverage. As it is indicated above, the State
programme introduced an indicator related to creation of favourable conditions for inclusive
education and set a target of 70%, which had to be achieved until 2020. Most of the stakeholders
share that in the process of identification of the analysis, it was unclear what are the favourable
conditions for inclusive education, but they still believe that setting an indicator was a good starting
point. The State programme for 2016-2019 states that the issues with access of children with SEN to
the education system is still current in view of creation of appropriate conditions, as well as highlights
the need for teachers with special education.

goal of the programme is similar to the other programs, with more emphasis on the development of
science. The specific objectives include a specific mention of inclusive education and its components
and are in additional directions in comparison with the other programmes– addressing the gap
between urban and rural areas and the need for a safe and comfortable learning environment. The
connection between the programme goal and specific objectives could be seen more clearly in view
of universal values and targeting inequalities.
The analysis of the National Project for 2021-2025 shows that, again, the goal is oriented towards
improvement of the quality of education at all levels, while the specific programme aims are also
focused on access and equity and creation of favourable conditions. As in the previous program, the
objectives are related to reducing inequalities, safe environment and reducing the gap between rural
and urban schools. There is also an emphasis on modernization and amendments to state standards
for preschool education, as well as expansion of the PMPC network. In terms of inclusiveness and
equity in education, different activities are planned, directly oriented towards the achievement of the
aims.
6.2.2. HORIZONTAL INTEGRATION
Inclusive education is a complex and multifaceted concept and the needs of children in vulnerable
situations require integrated type of work between the different sectors in order to achieve quality
education and inclusion of all groups at school. The integrated approach is related to the coordination
and delivery of services across multiple sectors and agencies. The aim is to provide a more holistic and
effective response to the needs, especially for vulnerable and marginalized populations. Integrated
31
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
systems are of particular significance for the most disadvantaged groups, who often face complex
issues, requiring coordinated efforts and solutions across different sectors and systems.
The key institution that is focused on inclusive education is the MoE. The issues of children with SEN
are also in the scope of activities of the MH and the MLSP. In the country there is no single authorized
institution or structure, which should follow the development of the quality of inclusive education,
rather it is in the scope of work of the different ministries, sectors, NGO, and parent community, which
determines the need for them to work together.
The competence of each authorised body in the field of education, health, and social protection, as
well as local government bodies, is prescribed in the Law on Social and Medical-Pedagogical
Correctional Support for Children with Disabilities to organise education, healthcare, and social
protection of the population. The law requires concerted action on the part of authorised bodies of
education, health care, social protection103.
The MH is responsible for offering quality health care to all children. Health care institutions are also
responsible for identification and categorisation of health and developmental issues from early stages
of life. For this, the MH has developed early development screening, involving checks from the first
days. Health care centres that depend on the MH are also responsible for defining and determining
the disabilities (mental/physical) in adults and children older than 16 years. All the primary health
centres that are regulated by MH provide services and information to children with disabilities and
can be involved in the early development of the child. All these primary health centres have a separate
room to counsel parents of children with disabilities and persons with disabilities. Other institutions
involved directly in delivering care and rehabilitation programmes for children with disabilities are RCs
for children 0-18 years old104. In addition, home visiting programmes are also implemented in the
country in order to support families with newborns.
The MLSP is one of the main governmental bodies involved directly in social protection of persons
with disabilities, social assistance and social services, migration, labour, and employment. Some of the
functions related to children are identification of disabilities and the system of benefits. Considering
the social and economic conditions of a family (e.g. dependent on whether the parents are employed
or unemployed), the MLSP decides on the allowances and the type of help they need105.
The MoE is the governmental body responsible for providing all children with the proper education in
accordance with their needs106. Within the educational system of Kazakhstan there are different types
of schools: comprehensive school, ungraded school, gymnasium, lyceum, boarding schools,
specialized school (specialized - by profile: music school, sports school, etc.), special school
(differentiated by category - for children with hearing, vision, speech, musculoskeletal and intellectual
impairment)107.
The Committee for the Protection of Children's Rights under the MoE is a department that implements
state policy of protecting the rights and legitimate interests of children.108 It performs regulatory,
implementation and control functions, and also participates in the performance of strategic functions
of the central executive body within the competence of the Committee.109 To guarantee the rights and
legitimate interests of children and to restore their violated rights and freedoms, the President of the
Republic of Kazakhstan established the Institute of the Commissioner for the Rights of the Child (ICRC),
which operates on a voluntary basis and in cooperation with state and public institutions.110
According to some reports and analysis, there are rules for the coordination between the sectors. For
example, the certification rules for social workers are developed and approved by the authorised body
in social protection of the population (MLSPP) in agreement with the authorised body in education
(MES). The standards for the provision of special social services in healthcare are being developed by
MH in coordination with the authorised bodies in social protection of the population (MLSP) and
education (MES)111. The integration between the three sectors is manifested in the way in which the
identification of needs and referral of services is done.
The Law on the introduction of amendments and additions to some legislative acts of the Republic of
Kazakhstan on issues of inclusive education (2021)112 determines the procedure for organizing

of the social sector in terms of achievement of certain indicators by MLSP. The State Programme states
2016-2019 as a key issue in ECD the lack of focus on the age 0 to 3, where foundations are laid for the
cognitive and intellectual child development. “A comprehensive solution to the problems of early
childhood development will require coordination and concerted action in the areas of education, health
and social protection, as well as the broad inclusion of the parent community.”

6.2.3. VERTICAL INTEGRATION
The planning and implementation of educational policy with a focus on inclusivity is done through a
top-down approach, meaning that policy is planned at the national level and realised at the local level.
Central authorities have the responsibility to develop an inclusion policy in education, considering the
proposals and opinions of local authorities and other stakeholders such as parent community and
NGOs. According to the Law on Education, the local government implements the state policy in the
field, providing education for children in special curricula; material and technical support for state
educational organisations; it directs funds to provide financial and material assistance to children from
socially vulnerable groups, organises advanced professional training for employees, etc115.
At the national level, the research

The second national institution is the National Academy of Education named after Y. Altynsarin117. One
of the centres in its structure is the Inclusive Education centre with the goal to effectively manage the

actions on the inclusion of
children with SEN.
The main local structure engaged with inclusive education is PMPC. PMPCs have different specialists
with the task to assess the development level of children and provide recommendations to parents
on which is the best type of education for their children (special kindergartens, general schools, special
schools, correctional rooms). They also recommend the type of programme– general, adapted, or
individual. The PMPCs could advise on working with assistant teachers at general schools or consult
for using other services (psychological centres, RCs). The recommendations they give are for a certain
period of time and after that they could be changed. It should be noted, however, that according to
the last amendments of the legislation the final choice of school and educational service is of the
parents. During the years the number of PMPCs has been increasing and the standards for opening
them are changing (currently there should be 1 PMPC per 50 000 children, while before it was 1 PMPC
per 60 000 children). In 2019, there were 75 PMPCs across the different regions in the country and
currently there are 92.118119
The role and tasks of PMPCs are quite central to inclusive education in the country and discussed
differently by the different stakeholders. The national level stakeholders believe PMPCs have a key
role as entry to the system and
their recommendations are “PMPC is an establishment with old ladies doing assessments like in a

competence to assess the needs
of the child, as well as empathy
towards children. According to the parents, one of the serious issues is the long period they should
wait for the meeting at the PMPC (two or more months in some cases). They often do not agree that
they need to send their child to a special school, as well as with the decisions regarding using assistant
teachers. They believe the staff should be changed and younger and more competent people should
enter the system. It is also shared that the PMPCs are overcrowded and still not enough in number.
It should also be pointed out that national stakeholders share PMPCs should make recommendation

have a structure to fulfil such a function effectively.
According to the conclusion of the PMPC, a child can be referred to a correction room (PPCRs) or RC,
where examination and correctional and pedagogical activities are carried out. At the local level,
PPCRs are another structure providing psychological and pedagogical support to children with special
educational needs, but the stakeholders share that they work predominantly with children with
disabilities at an early age. Correctional and pedagogical support for children with SEN is provided by
209 PPCRs120 and their number has been increasing over the years. It is shared by professionals that
35

Final Report
PPCRs work directly with children, they have speech therapist, psychologist, defectologist, music
teacher, massage. Children go there 3 to 5 times a week for a period of 3-4 months. Correctional rooms
are mostly for children in pre-school age, but children who are home schooled could also go to
correctional rooms, if it is recommended by PMPC. At the same time, RCs are 13 in the country in the
education sector121. Additionally, in all the country resource centres were established at the school
level and their work is connected with support for professionals. These were established in the pilot
schools, which started implementing inclusive education in the period 2015-2016.
In terms of the participation of the different sectors in the process of planning and implementation it
should be noted that the state programmes do not contain information on the steps in the process of
implementation of the tasks, only some of the ministries or local authorities are mentioned as
responsible for the achievement of certain indicators, which means that the achievement of all goals
and activities are the task of all institutions at the different levels of the educational system.
6.2.4. PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION BETWEEN IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS
The achievement of the goals of the national policy implies a serious level of collaboration between
executive bodies, NGOs, and international organisations. The work of the national institutions on
inclusive education in Kazakhstan involves a range of activities that aim to promote inclusive education
practices and support the full participation of all learners in education. This work involves developing
policies and strategies for inclusive education, providing training and support to teachers and other
education professionals, developing, and implementing assessment tools and frameworks, and
promoting community engagement and awareness-raising activities. To achieve these goals, the
implementing agencies for inclusive education in Kazakhstan need to work closely with a range of
external partners, including global partners, regional partners, other government bodies
implementing partner programmes and interventions. These external partners can provide important
support and resources that can help to strengthen the implementation of inclusive education policies
and practices in Kazakhstan.
The role of global partners and international organisations is of key importance in the beginning to
start developing inclusive education and give a boost in the right direction at the start, especially after
the ratification of the Convention on the rights of the child. International organisations such as Open
Society, Soros Foundation, UNESCO, UNICEF, OECD provide guidance and technical support on best
practices in inclusive education and help to facilitate collaboration and knowledge-sharing across
different countries and regions through conducting research and making reports, as well as raising
awareness through organising conferences and events, etc.
Partner programmes and interventions, such as those ran by local NGOs also provide important
resources and expertise to support the implementation of inclusive education practices in Kazakhstan.
Local NGOs create pilot models of interventions, but they are mostly related to disabilities. “At the
legislative level, NGOs, associations and other public organizations cannot participate in governance
processes, but they make proposals to improve legislation in the field of protecting the rights of
children, including children with special educational needs, participate in joint meetings, round tables,
become members of national/regional working groups on issues of children with SEN. Associations,
parent organizations and NGOs also can participate in the processes of implementing of state policy,
different social, educational projects.”122 Some of the most important NGOs working in the field are
Bolashak Corporate Fund123, the Kenes Public Association of people with disabilities124 and Private Fund
Dara125. These organisations create models, which are after that scaled in the whole country and
become models of educational policy.
In addition, a number of private organisations and service providers such as private schools and
centres (some of which created by parents) exist, which work in the private sector in parallel with
governmental services. These are paid services, which are not affordable for all parents. They
introduce new models of working with children either in the field of education or integrated support.
36
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
In summary, the analysis of internal coherence and logic of planning of the programmes shows that
over the years, the overall goal in the different state programmes seems to remain the same and
sustainable. It is unclear what is the degree to which each State programme is based on the previous
one, complements and upgrades it. It seems that each programme has its own internal logic and is
planned differently. Although they have similar priorities, the success of the programmes is also
measured differently with different indicators.
The horizontal integration between the three sectors in the country in terms of inclusivity is not yet
developed and not a focus of the education programmes and efforts at the country level and there is
no integrated policy regarding inclusive education. Each sector has its own budget, structures, and
referral mechanisms. Although at different levels there are attempts towards coordination and
working together, there are no clear mechanisms for cooperation.
The national education policy with a focus on inclusivity is realised through all the national and local
educational bodies and agencies. It is centralised with a top-down approach. Different institutions and
services provide support for parents and children, but there is an issue with their professional capacity.
Private organisations and NGOs also take part in work groups and provide information, but the
decisions are made at the centralised level and implemented at the local level.
The work of national institutions, local NGOs, and private entities in terms of inclusive education is
aligned with the work of external global partners, which give an initial boost to its development,
provide guidance, conduct research, and raise awareness on the issues. NGOs participate in
roundtables and meetings and provide proposals for changing legislation. In this sense, their role is
related to advocacy activities in view of development of the regulatory framework. They also develop
pilot practices which could be implemented at the national level. Private centres exist in parallel to the
government system, filling the gaps in service provision that exist and the country doesn’t provide.
6.3. EFFECTIVENESS
The effectiveness is analysed in view of the achievement of the goals, set by the different programmes
and the indicators with a focus on inclusivity. In order to analyse this, a review is made of the
understanding of inclusive education that changed over time. The planning, as well as the period in
which the indicators should be achieved is considered. The outcomes are analysed in terms of their
contribution towards the right of all children to be included in the education system. On the other
hand, it is key which vulnerable groups have been reached by the intervention, how they have been
reached and how this contributed to the fulfilment of their rights.
6.3.1. GOALS AND UNDERSTANDING OF INCLUSIVE EDUCATION
As it was indicated in the relevance part, the State Education programme 2011-2020 sets out the first
indicator for creation of favourable conditions for inclusive education at schools. Before then, the
children with SEN were rather subjects of special education and they were mainly taught in special
schools. It should be noted that, although the topic of inclusive education is set out in it, the State
programme 2011-2020 focuses more on integration than on inclusiveness. In other words, in the
programme it is pointed out that the national policy, in terms of improvement of the inclusive
education system in school plans to develop until 2015 “modular programmes of integrated education
for children with disabilities will be developed; rules of integrated education for children with
disabilities in general education environment will be elaborated, and forms of integration for disabled
children will be defined; rules of organization of distance learning for disabled children will be
elaborated.”

After that, on the road to inclusiveness in the next periods and state programs, respectively, a change
in the understanding at the conceptual level could be seen, as well as efforts to integrate children in
special classes or in general classes. It was defined who these children are, what is needed and how
change should be achieved. While until 2011 children with SEN studied in separate special schools.
Later, around 2015 there was evidence of change in view of integrating some children at the general
school, but up to some degree still

they rather understand inclusive education through the rights of children instead of through
vulnerable groups.

● Percentage of schools that created favourable conditions for inclusive education - 70% (out
of their total number)
The first indicator related to creation of favourable conditions for inclusive education is introduced in
the State Programme 2011-2020. The creation of favourable conditions for inclusive education is
understood differently and developed across the years, primarily with a focus on physical access and
equipment and later including teacher qualification and pedagogical changes. In 2011, the Law on
education introduces the definition of the term “special conditions for education” – “conditions that
include educational, as well as special, individually developing and correctional-developing
programmes and teaching methods, technical, educational and other means, living environment,
psychological and pedagogical support, medical, social and other services without which it is
impossible to master educational programmes by persons (children) with SEN, as well as children with
disabilities"127.
The State Programmes introduce the indicator on favourable conditions for inclusive education, but
there are differences in the explanation what it means, the second being more comprehensive than
the first program. In the State Programme 2011-2020 there is a focus on “the availability of teachers,
defectologists, psychological-pedagogical accompaniment of children, and special individual technical
and compensatory facilities”, meaning on specialists and accessibility, while in the State Programme
2020-2025 the scope is enlarged, including technical materials and equipment, but specialists are only
mentioned as personnel – “equipping with special equipment, furniture, personnel, textbooks and
educational and methodological complexes, ramps, lifts, elevators, etc.”
The National Report on the State and Development of education 2016128 indicates lifting devices,
ramps, adapted hygiene rooms and special furniture as conditions for inclusive education, all related
to physical access. The following year the national report reflects a change – “due to the uncertainty
of the concept of ‘conditions for inclusive education’, the indicators of the regions for their creation do
not reflect an objective picture. When calculating the indicator of the share of schools that created the
conditions for inclusive education, one school considers physical barrier-free access, another considers
educational and methodological resources, the third considers the comprehensive provision of inclusive
education, etc.”129
The changes in the understanding of this indicator continue and are reflected in the National Report
from 2019 stating that the methodology for calculating the indicator has changed and is now more
comprehensive, including elements of physical access like ramps and handrails, personnel, and
methodological materials, but also special training programs130. In the National report from 2021131,
the availability of special equipment, teaching materials and special teachers are indicated.

In spite of the lack of clarity on how the indicator is calculated, the national data shows that the share
of schools that have created conditions for inclusive education has increased for the 10-year period
since 2011 and the target of 70% has been achieved (graph 10). When it comes to the regions,
although the indicator is achieved at the national level, there are differences between the regions,
(from 97% to 70% between the highest and lowest (graph 19, annex 9.10.4)). This could be due to
different factors like understanding of the concept, readiness of the stakeholders, pedagogical

principal, teacher)
Different articles and research confirm the five
key elements that are aspects of operational
culture change necessary to create the schools of the future: leadership, pedagogy, capacity building,
technology, and architecture132. The analysis of implementation of policy in terms of creating
favourable conditions for inclusive education in school shows that the focus in the beginning was on
architecture and physical access and it gradually included technology, pedagogy, and capacity
building, while there is scarce indication of leadership.
In terms of leadership, there isn’t data on the investment in development of this aspect in the state
programmes, but it is of importance for the motivation and boost that schools need towards changing
the environment. The path towards this change starts from leadership, which here is related to the
understanding of inclusiveness, motivation for change at the school level, as well as personal
motivation of the principals due to their life stories. Qualitative data shows that when the principal is
motivated, the change could happen since there is activeness in terms of looking for solutions. Parents
shared they were thankful to the leadership of schools, especially the principals (who have children or
relatives with disabilities), who are open minded and welcoming.
When it comes to pedagogy, it is the most discussed topic by all stakeholders, which is due to the fact
that in recent years, especially after 2016, a big number of children with SEN enter general schools
and the issue how to work with them, with what approaches and materials, is very significant,
particularly for teachers. According to the opinions of respondents there are three programs, on which
children with SEN work – general, adapted, and individual. The type of the programme is
recommended by PMPC, but specialists at the school could also make changes and recommendations
40
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
regarding this programme or change it if necessary. The general programme for all students is always
followed as a starting point if it is necessary to make another type of program. As a result, in the
individual programmes there are mainly tasks related to cognitive development and acquiring skills
regarding study results, rather than adaptation, motivation, social skills, etc. Additionally, the
adapted/individual programme includes difficulties, strengths and weaknesses, observation results,
and surveys. Training methods are described in the programme and planned together with the
teacher. The analysis does not give clear information about the difficulties for the child and the way
to continue forward on how to work with the parents, should they receive additional support, etc.
This is in itself not an individual program, related to the individual abilities of the child, but is rather
educational, subject to the educational development of children and learning oriented.
The main role in educating all children is of general schoolteachers. Teachers have to implement the

characteristics of the
educational systems in the country shared by stakeholders is the orientation towards learning and

skills.

improved.
Apart from teachers and assistant teachers, children with disabilities and learning difficulties work
with specialists in inclusive rooms at school. These specialists are speech therapists, defectologists,
psychologists, working individually with the children outside of the regular school classes for between
20 to 40 min. lessons several times a week, depending on their needs. This amount of time is
considered insufficient by parents. In terms of the used methodology, specialists share they use
different methodology such as ABA (Applied Behaviour Analysis) therapy, Numicon, Macathon, etc.
Additionally, the specialists also have an educational function for children who need specific additional
work on the general subjects. It should be noted that the development of capacity of specialists for
41
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
implementation of all these therapies requires a lot of different resources and is strictly related to the
individual needs of students. Although specialists declare they use an individual approach towards
students with SEN, a process of in-depth study of the individual needs has not been identified.
According to information provided by stakeholders, in the Kazakh education system, the role of
ensuring the protection of the interests and rights of children from socially vulnerable segments of
the population is performed by social pedagogues. According to legislation133, the main function of a
social pedagogue is the implementation of a set of measures for the upbringing, education,
development of students, pupils in educational organizations, ensuring the adaptation of the
individual to life in society. A social pedagogue works with difficult, problematic children from
dysfunctional families, with disabled people who are lagging behind in their studies. He/she represents
and protects the interests of children, controls their education in educational institutions, conducts
educational work, helps to understand, and accept the laws of a civilized society, identifies the
problems, personality and character traits, deviations in behaviour.
In general, the number and types of specialists working with children with disabilities and learning
difficulties is far bigger than that of specialists working with other vulnerable groups of children.
Specialists such as speech therapists and psychologists, as well as teachers and assistant teachers (for
some children with behavioural problems) work with children with disabilities or learning difficulties.
At the same time, only teachers and social pedagogues work with children at risk from other
vulnerable groups.
All of these specialists and teachers

In terms of the aspect of technology,
national data shows that the schools are more equipped with technological resources in view of
computers (graph 20 in annex 9.10.4 shows a sharp increase in the number of computer equipment
used in the educational process since 2020, perhaps due to the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic),
interactive boards, connection to the Internet, etc.

Final Report
At the same time, however, in the data collection process it was evident that computers are mostly in
the computer rooms for the respective subject, while in the rest of the classrooms there are only
computers for teachers. Observation data showed that there are still chalkboards and some
whiteboards in the rooms and Internet connection is not always available in the whole school. Having
in mind that using technology in the process of education could facilitate the learning process for
different groups of children through different ways and improve the inclusiveness of education, the
system in the country is still not equipped with sufficient resources, but the process has started.
The aspect of architecture in terms of physical access is discussed in the State Education programme
2011-2020, while the informational access is not commented on. Until 2019, when the indicator
becomes more comprehensive, the favourable conditions for inclusive education are mostly related
to physical access in terms of lifting devices, ramps, special fixtures in sanitary rooms, equipment with
handrails, special desks, tables. Although the physical environment is improving, access was indicated
as important by parents and other stakeholders in the qualitative study since some schools do not
have elevators, so if the children with physical needs were to come to school, they had to arrange all
the learning on the first floor only. Also, the data from observations confirms that efforts in terms of
physical access have mostly been made for the entrances and access to the first floors of the buildings.
It should be noted that school buildings are big, but in some schools more students study than the
capacity of the building and have to go in three shifts. The classrooms are equipped with desks in the
traditional way, which could make the physical access to them more difficult. It is also important that
there is no informational access at schools in terms of enough and easy to understand information
about the building, how to get where, different facilities and rooms, sanitary rooms, canteens, etc.
Additionally, inclusive classrooms are separated from the rest of the building and certain children only
go there for additional work with specialists. It could be stated that the environment in these rooms
seems more child-friendly with more materials and adapted to the needs of children with disabilities
and learning difficulties.
• Percentage of schools that transitioned to the new curriculum, in 2016 - 100%, in 2019 -
100%
The indicator related to quality school education and training is introduced in the State
Programme2016-2019. The description of the indicator includes some of the following specifics:
approved state education standards of basic secondary and general secondary education focused on
the best international experience in developing a wide range of skills, the totality of which ensures
functional literacy; STEM elements (science) included in the curriculum, aimed at the development of
new technologies, scientific innovations, and mathematical modelling; expected results as a basis for
education allowing to assess the work of the student and his achievements, in order to determine the
individual development trajectory of each student, as well as increase their motivation to develop
skills in learning; transition to a criteria-based assessment system for students, teachers and
educational organizations; reducing regional disparities; trilingual education; textbooks and teaching
materials for teaching children with special educational needs.
The constitutional right to general secondary education in Kazakhstan in 2017 was provided by 7,047
public day schools,13 125 private schools, 75 night schools, 100 special education establishments, 7
schools for children with deviant behaviour, 1 special treatment school, 8 international schools, 4
republican schools, 34 schools subordinated to other state authorities, 20 Nazarbayev Intellectual
Schools (NIS), and 1 international branch school of NIS. In total, the schools enrolled over 3 million
children.134 Over four years, the number of students increased by 14% (from 2 930 583 in 2016 to 3
337 783 in 2019)135.
In relation to the indicator, data is followed up regarding ensuring quality of secondary education and
transition to new educational standards, STEM elements, trilingual education, etc. In 2017, the first
year of the implementation of this program, the National report states that measures are being taken
to ensure the regulatory and methodological transition to the updated content. New State
Compulsory Education Standards (for primary, basic, and general secondary education), standardized

syllabi and curricula, textbooks. “In September 2017, 42% out of school students switched to the
updated educational content - grades 1, 2, 5 and 7 (grade 1 in 2016)”136. Additionally, educational
resources were developed, and a criteria-based assessment system was introduced. There are
coordinators of criteria-based assessment in each school. When assessing according to the new
system, teachers use a set of teaching materials that are designed not only to help them, but also to
assist parents and students137.
An additional area of improvement of the quality of education, apart from transition to a new
curriculum is also the update of the content of school education, in order to include functional literacy
of schoolchildren, skills of independent search, critical analysis, and evaluation. The updated content
is based on expected results, which are determined by educational areas138. In the National Report of
2019 it is stated that the transition to updated content aimed at developing functional literacy is being
completed and 96% of students (grades 1-10) moved to the new programmes. In the 2019-2020 school
year, 100% of grades 4, 9, and 10 moved to the updated programmes139.
The indicator also includes aspects of modernization of education such as the creation of modern
classrooms on the scientific subjects. In 2017, the share of the public day secondary schools with the
new-modification classrooms (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Multimedia Language Laboratories) in the
country amounted to 71.7% (70% in 2016)140. “As of the 2019-2020 school year, 3 252 schools teach
such subjects as "Biology", "Chemistry", "Physics", and "Computer science" in the upper school in
English. Of these, 251 schools with full immersion and 3 001 with partial immersion. They employ 7
728 subject teachers who teach four subjects in English, and 213 319 students study science and math
subjects in English from grades 8 to 11”141.
As it is evident, the data from national reports shows that for the period 2016-2019 a lot of activities
were implemented to update the content, modernize secondary education, and gradually transition
to the new curriculum. The results that would be achieved should have an impact on the whole system
in time. It is of key importance to understand the change through the point of view of students
themselves. As it was noted regarding the previous indicator, schools are located in buildings with a
lot of students and most of them study in triple shifts. Despite the measures taken, the share of triple
shift schools continues to persist. Totally in the country, every eighth school is a triple shift school (in
2018 – 128, 127 in 2016; 130 in
Figure 6 School in children’s views 2017). Only 29.4% of public

share that this makes it
necessary for them to get up
very early in order to get to
school, especially those that live further away in bigger cities. They describe their schools as a place
where they feel calm and safe, there is no bullying, and they accept the different children and have
friends. However, they are critical towards the degree to which the school prepares them for the
future, is practically oriented or allows them the freedom to pick out their own subjects. “The school
doesn’t prepare us for the future like math and history, we don’t know how to ask police, clinics and
hospitals, we would like to have such a subject to teach us about roles in society and to have
opportunity to pick the languages to study.” (FGD with students) They have to get up early and carry
heavy textbooks, since everything is paper based. The many tests mean they constantly have to worry
about their grades and results (figure 6).

The indicator related to quality pre-school education and training is introduced in the State
Programme2016-2019. The description of the indicator includes the following specifics: introduction
of state educational standards of preschool education and training; elements of a multilingual
education programme with the study of Kazakh, Russian and English; system of indicators for tracking
children’s development; implementation of educational and methodological materials for children
with SEN.

Republic of Kazakhstan, 2019, 2020, 2021 21 in annex 9.10.4).
The period 2016-2019 is characterised by
activities related to increasing the scope of children in pre-school, focus on decreasing the number of
mini centres and increasing the number of kindergartens in rural areas – “Over the past four years, the
number of kindergartens located in the cities has increased by almost 1 000 units, and by 752 units in
rural areas”143.
Another topic is related to the content of pre-school education. In 2017, it was updated including
cross-cutting issues and introduction of a system for monitoring the development level of children’s
abilities and skills. The Preschool Childhood Republican Centre of the MoES developed guidelines for
the monitoring system. The development is assessed at 3 levels: "reproduces certain actions,"
"understands what he/she does," "applies what he/she can." 144 In 2018, this monitoring was
conducted for a second consecutive year.
A key component is also an introduction of Standard rules for the activities of preschool organisations
in 2018. The focus is on the first five years of a child’s life as being crucial for individual development,
learning at a faster rate, developing basic cognitive and emotional skills, central to future
achievements in adulthood. The Standard rules include requirements for ECD, development of social
and self-learning skills. “The content of education and training of young children will be implemented
through the integration of education areas "Health", "Communication", "Knowledge", "Creativity",
"Society" and through various types of children's activities (play, motor, creative, cognitive, etc.). Also,
amendments and additions were made to the Standard curriculum in terms of adding special
educational programmes for children with SEN”145. Later on, in 2019, these education areas are
supplemented with content of education and care of early age children and the tasks of educating
children with SEN were expanded. “Concepts of "early development", "socialisation", "social skills",
"parenting skills", "care", "independent learning skills" were determined…Educational areas are
supplemented with the tasks of "Rukhani zhangyru" programme, 4C model (creativity, critical thinking,
communication, and collaboration.”146

achieved as well (it is 84.6% in 2021 with a target of 81.7%, graph 12). The data for the whole period
of evaluation from 2011 to 2021 show an increase in the coverage of attendance of preschool.
In the National Report for 2019 it is stated that in spite of this development there are still waiting lists
to get into kindergartens, although shorter than before and some regions have achieved the indicator
sooner than others.
These indicators are not related to specific outcomes in terms of creation of inclusive environment
and addressing gaps between rural and urban regions. However, since the programmes are analysed
in terms of inclusiveness, it should be reviewed what is the coverage of kindergartens having
conditions to respond to the needs of children with SEN.
The share of state kindergartens that have created conditions for inclusive education for children with
special educational needs of the total number of state kindergartens in 2021 varies across the regions

which is slightly increasing (in 2021 there are 4414 children in the special kindergartens, graph 13).
In view of usage of the services for children at an early age according to the information from PMPC
there are specialised and regular (inclusive) kindergartens, so kids with SEN can also go to those, but
there are not so many of them. For example, in one of the regions, there are only 3 kindergartens for
children with speech issues in the city, which could be far away, so parents can go to a regular
kindergarten, if there are available places. There is a website where parents can track available spots
in regular kindergartens from April to June, while previously it was on paper. As for PMPCs, they
appoint children to specialised kindergartens and determine the period of recommendation
depending on the condition of the child, otherwise parents choose regular kindergartens themselves
from the website.

Private centres, special kindergartens or home schooling are the most visible and often used options
for supporting early childhood development and learning of children with SEN.
● Child wellbeing index in Kazakhstan - 0.73
The indicator on child wellbeing is part of the State programme 2020-2025 and the reasoning for
including it is related to it being a comprehensive measurement of child well-being including objective
and subjective quality indicators. Although the data from the first measurement of the index is outside
of the scope of the evaluation, since the indicator is key and measured in 2022, it should be noted
here due to its importance in terms of child well-being and right of all children to learning and
development. “In 2018, considering the international and Kazakhstani experience, a system of
indicators and an index of children's well-being were developed for systematic monitoring of children's
safety, comfortable conditions and well-being, timely identification of problems and prompt decision-
making. This index covers material well-being, health, education, security and risks, socialization. A
scale of "0" to "1" is used to compare countries. According to the results of the 2018 pilot project in
Kazakhstan, the index of children's well-being was 0.68 points. At the same time, in the 10th month of
2019, positive dynamics and a tendency to improve the quality of life due to the measures taken by the
state are observed and it is assumed that the initial calculation of the index will be 0.70 points in 2022,
and 0.73 points by 2025.” There is no data available on the index for 2022 according to the pilot study
mentioned in the state programme. However, in 2021, UNICEF introduced a child wellbeing index and
the data, based on a study from the Economic Research Institute JSC147, could be seen in annex 9.10.4
(graph 23).

Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
● Percentage of children with disabilities receiving special psychological and pedagogical
support and early intervention: 2022 – 50%; 2023 – 65%; 2024 – 80%; 2025 – 100%.
The indicator is introduced in the National Project 2020-2025. The planned activities in order to
achieve the indicator are: expansion of the PMPC network, taking into account the needs of the region
and in accordance with modern requirements and standards (1 PMPC per 50 000 children); placement
of a state educational order for special psychological and pedagogical support for children with
developmental disabilities. In the National Report 2021, it is indicated that over the past 5 years, the
share of children with SEN studying in comprehensive classes has increased by 20.3%. In 2021, 43.6%
of children with SEN had the opportunity to study in secondary schools.
The norms of functioning of psychological, medical, and pedagogical consultations will be revised to
reduce the rate to 1 PMPC per 50 000 children (from previously 60 000 children), as it is set out in the
National Project. Rules will be developed for the activities of psychological services in general
secondary education organisations. It is planned to improve the system of early detection and
correction of children with disabilities and in all programs, teachers’ professional development will
include a module on working with children with SEN148. There is still no data for the level of
achievement of the indicator. The state educational order for assisting children with developmental
disabilities has been placed in 2022. 149
All the analysed indicators are from the state education programmes with some of the goals
addressing inclusiveness and indicators reflecting the expected results. The programmes are at
different stages of realisation and the first two are finished, while the last one is in the final phase,
while the national project was replaced by a new Concept for development of education 2023-2029
‘Концепции развития дошкольного, среднего, технического и профессионального образования
Республики Казахстан на 2023 – 2029 годы’.
All the indicators in regard to inclusive education and coverage are achieved, but there are
uncertainties about their way of defining, of collection of data and measurement. At the same time,
the data about implementation of policies of inclusive education pose a number of questions related
to the understanding of conditions of inclusive education, pedagogical methods, and work with these
children, used materials, access and quality.
In terms of unexpected results, it should be noted that since the period of evaluation is rather long
and the changes have been planned in several strategic documents, specific results (apart from those
planned) could not be identified. It should be taken into account that the COVID-19 pandemic was an
unexpected global event, which brought about changes and boosted the process of digitalisation and
distance education due to newly emerging challenges, instead of solely due to inclusive education
development. This was commented regarding the part dedicated to created conditions for inclusive
education.
6.3.3. CONTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAMMES TO THE FULFILMENT OF THE RIGHT
TO EDUCATION FOR ALL CHILDREN
Equity in access to education for all children, particularly different vulnerable groups
The state educational programmes which set goals for development of education, among which
ensuring access to quality education for all children, outline the development of the educational
system towards the fulfilment of the rights of all children. The key components of all programmes are
related to access and equity, learning environment and facilities, quality, and effectiveness of
education. The educational needs of children are satisfied by different types of institutions in
Kazakhstan, some of which are segregated and children from different vulnerable groups are still
outside of the community and others that are developing towards including vulnerable groups
together with the rest of the children. In table 18 in annex 9.10.5 is made an analysis of the degree of
access of learners from different groups to inclusive education, up to the degree to which data is
available. Since there isn’t an accessible comprehensive database, the data is compilated from
different sources.

Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
Children with SEN in preschool education, in special kindergartens and special groups in general
kindergartens are decreasing in share from the total number of children with SEN up to 6 years old
since 2016 in parallel with the increase in the number in inclusive kindergartens (reaching 41% in
2022). At the same time, even taking into account the share of children in inclusive kindergartens, the
rest of the children with SEN using other organisations of education, healthcare and social services
(private and public centres, which is 35% in 2022), in general outside of the preschool educational
system is quite big, which creates a barrier towards the access to education. They are supported in
PPCR, but this is for a short period a couple of times per week. Also, according to the information from
stakeholders, there are 50 daycare centres for children with SEN functioning in the country and
children from these centres don’t go to school.
Children at school age with SEN remain an almost equal share yearly in special schools since 2016
(around 14%)150. The share of children in inclusive schools is increasing, but there are also still children
in home-schooling, for whom the support is provided by PPCR. Among the group of children who are
home-schooled, there are children with severe disabilities, who also receive correctional support.
There are also children included in regular schools, who don’t visit them frequently. Their education
happens in the home and regular teachers visit them several times a week (specialists could also go).
They could also go to school for the
holidays. In addition, there are “We have a big territory, with many children across the country

country.
In Kazakhstan, for children and adolescents who are in conflict with the law and do not want to go to
school, there are special educational organizations where social and pedagogical work is carried out
with them, aimed at preventing delinquency and an asocial lifestyle. The special organizations for
children with deviant behaviour are an educational institution, in which are placed children who
systematically commit administrative offenses, maliciously evade education, systematically leave their
families, and commit other antisocial actions for a period of a month to a year151.
The language policy in the country is the observance of child rights of all ethnic groups and free choice
of language. According to the data from ‘Единая рамка мониторинга инклюзивного образования в
Республике Казахстан’, “all migrant students are enrolled at schools, psychological support and
additional classes are provided, work with their parents is done. Ensuring constitutional rights to
education and satisfaction of the educational needs of this category of children is under the constant
control of educational authorities”152. In order to meet the needs of these children, schools with
different languages are functioning in the country153.
The children from villages with no schools are provided with free-of-charge delivery or places in a
boarding school. As measures to support these children, local authorities arrange delivery to the
nearest schools. As pointed out in the table above, the number of rural schools has decreased since
2016, while the number of urban schools has increased.
The out-of-school problem has not been analysed in detail, but there is information on the “Vseobuch
Program”. Efforts are taken to find children who do not attend school, and measures are taken to
return them to schools. In 2017, there were 277 children who did not attend school for ten or more

approach is challenging due to the

they are similar to those of all other students, but since they work with special programs, they get
specific diplomas for finished education. Some of them study key subjects with specialists, instead of
in regular classes. The impression that children with SEN go to separate cabinets and have special
teachers is also shared by students.

awareness among the society and schools. It is apparent that this process has started since their kids
are accepted by their peers (which is also shared by students).
The perception of fulfilment of children’s rights to education is related to studying in an accepting
environment, ensuring equal access to education and real inclusion in the teaching and learning
process.
In summary, in the last 10 years secondary schools in Kazakhstan have started a process of
modernization, transition to a new curriculum, digitalisation, and updated content. This process goes
in parallel with the endeavours to make the school more inclusive and provide equal opportunities for
all children to study in safe schools oriented towards their needs and providing possibilities for them
to study and develop depending on their level of abilities. The concept of inclusive education is now
understood more broadly, there is a shift in the focus solely from children with SEN. Only in some
smaller towns it is still perceived in a narrow way. Some stakeholders discuss whether the goal was
correctly set in the beginning and there was too much focus on access, instead of actually educating
children in the general system.
National data shows that different planned outcomes in the different programmes are achieved in
terms of creating favourable conditions for inclusive education, as well as modernization,
digitalisation, and update of the curriculum. At the same time, the system addressing the needs of
children with SEN is more integrated than inclusive (in separated rooms, with separated teams and
program).
One of the main gaps in the system is the lack of early intervention and identification, as well as services
for early childhood development and care for children with SEN. In spite of the enlarged scope and high
share of enrolment of children between 3 and 6 years old, the most used forms of ECD services for
children are private centres, specialised kindergartens, and home schooling.
The educational system in the country is characterised with a number of possibilities to ensure equal
access to education for children with SEN. It is specific that the system keeps the special schools and
kindergartens in parallel with the creation of inclusive system in general education. This variety leads
to different opportunities, but some of them are still segregating and children are outside of the
community, which makes the system look rather heterogenous and creates a system within the system.
The process of inclusion has started, but is still at the level of integration, instead of inclusion in the
actual sense, so there is room for development.
6.4. EFFICIENCY
The efficiency is analysed in view of the level of optimized use of invested financial and time resources
for achievement of the outcomes. In addition, the management and coordination is analysed in terms
of its level of efficiency for addressing equity-based challenges. Also, the availability and proactive
usage of existing platforms for dissemination of resources for educational activities have been
reviewed.
6.4.1. EFFICIENT USE OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR ACHIEVEMENT OF THE
OUTCOMES
The educational policy is realised at different levels through investments of financial, human and time
resources. The financial investments and all kinds of resources in the educational system have a key
significance for the development of society since they are returned back into the economy of the
country.
The share of government expenditure on education out of the total expenditure has changed over the
years (graph 24 in annex 9.10.6 ). Between 2011 and 2014 it was around 17-18% and then between
2015 and 2019 there was a significant decrease to 11-14%, while more recently, in 2020 – 2021 it
increased again to 18-20, which is probably influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
All of the budgets of the programmes and project part of the object of the evaluation include national
and local financing and are shown on graph 25 in annex 9.9.6. There isn’t a separate part of the budget
dedicated to inclusive education.
Some of the stakeholders shared an opinion that a

representative) separate goal in the programs, but rather a cross-
cutting topic, although there are expected results
related to achievement of goals in the area. This means that there isn’t a separate budget item
dedicated to inclusive education. This gives reason to analyse the general structure of the budget and
separate budget items to understand the ratio between investment and the different areas of quality
of primary and secondary education. The budget for education is divided across the following list of
groups of expenditures, which the ET does not claim to be comprehensive, since it is based on
accessible online data, not for the whole period (since 2015) and maybe not for all areas of financing:
buildings and accessibility; teacher trainings; methodological support and materials; digitalisation,
innovation; additional activities (rehabilitation etc.). It should also be noted that the budgets of the
subprogrammes have a different structure.
There are different results in the different programs, related to primary and secondary education in
terms of inclusiveness. The level of their achievement is commented under the part Effectiveness of
this report. It should be reminded that the key indicator, related to inclusivity is related to the creation
of favourable conditions for inclusive education. Having in mind that there is a lack of clear criteria of
favourable conditions for inclusive education and the components included in it, the analysis could be
made in terms of creation of accessible buildings regarding architecture, support for persons who

dedicated to the area, which is related to the goals and the tasks of the program, in view of motivation,
modernisation of education and capacity building of teachers. From what was shared during FGDs and
KIIs, it is also evident that the dedicated money for methodological materials is of a far smaller share
throughout the years. The process of digitalisation has boosted in the last year, a lot of investments
are done for it (Digital Kazakhstan), which remains stable during the years. It is key to combine
digitalisation and presence of enough educational materials.
In terms of preschool education, data shows that smaller resources are dedicated to it. In some years
it is twice as smaller than secondary education investments and otherwise it is similar over the years
with the limitation that there isn’t clear information for the whole period (2011-2021). However, data
52
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
shows that there isn’t an increasing investment in the area of preschool education, in spite of the
planned results in all programmes, mostly after 2016, oriented towards increase in the scope and
modernisation of early childhood education and care.
The analysis of data in terms of efficiency shows that one of the biggest changes in investment related
to the period in the scope of the evaluation is the

teachers in secondary and primary education on average earned 269,1 thousand tenge, teachers in
higher education - 251,8 thousand tenge, and teachers in special education - 187,3 thousand tenge”156.
In relation to inclusive education, it should be noted that the salaries of teachers working with children
with special needs are higher, while for specialists they are rather lower in comparison with those of
teachers on the whole, which does not satisfy their needs. Teachers also share that they are not happy
with the additional payment they get for working with children with special needs, since the time they
dedicate is a lot more. They raise a concern about the financial limitations of the reform and though
the policies were designed to help the vulnerable children, schools did not receive adequate funding
to support these reforms. There had to be sufficient funding attached to the changes and
recommendations the schools have to address to make their environment more inclusive. Many
international studies confirm the need for investment in teachers and their capacity, but at the same
time, it is necessary not only to increase their salary, but to empower them to work flexibly157.
Schools are financed in accordance with the procedure established in the Budget Code of the Republic
of Kazakhstan and the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On the Republican Budget”. According to
the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Education”, public spending on education is composed of
the expenses of the Republican and Local budgets.158 The funding of the government in the country is
allocated to general education of gifted children, surcharge for the qualification category to teachers.
Funding for akimats comes through local budgets for maintenance of school, textbooks and teaching
materials and technical support. There is also funding from the cities of republican significance and
the capital budget for the same components. Additionally, there is funding from the district budget
for district primary, basic secondary and general secondary educational organizations, including
evening (shift) form of education, and boarding schools, which are also for the same components.

got the new form of funding, while some schools in
the smaller towns and regions still have not fully passed to the new form of financing. However, some
of the stakeholders discuss that the type of funding should depend on the needs of the school and for
some schools per capita financing might not be the best option, since they have a smaller number of
students.

determines the procedure for per capita
regulatory financing of preschool education and training, secondary, technical and vocational, post-

local executive body in the following order: organizations of secondary education monthly according
to individual financing plans; organizations of secondary education monthly within the limits of the
concluded agreement for the placement of a state educational order for secondary education in the
following volumes: from January to August - in proportion to the planned annual contingent; from
September to December - in proportion to the actual average annual contingent. In case of insufficient
funds from the local budget in the amount of per capita normative financing of secondary education,
in the event of a change in the per capita norm, compensation for losses that entail an increase in local
budget expenditures is compensated by targeted current transfers from the republican budget.159
The data for 2021, 2022 and 2023 show that there is a trend in the increase in educational resources

All of this means that per capita funding ensures more financing for children with SEN. However, the

It also causes a risk of over-identifying children with SEN due to the financial incentive and actually
hinder the process of inclusion. ‘’However, this system presents some disadvantages: it focuses on

as well as a national
project, which replaced the third state programme (figure 7). Now the project is replaced with a
Concept for development of education 2023-2025. From the point of view of time it is necessary to
point out that the time periods of realisation overlap. In view of the goals of the national policy, this
poses challenges towards its implementation, since several times new goals and indicators are set,
without previous analysis of what has been achieved so far. Also, the concept of inclusive education
changed and developed over this period of time and towards the end it became clearer.
It should also be noted that during the period in the scope of the evaluation the COVID-19 pandemic
had a significant influence on the process of reform towards inclusive education. It slowed down the
implementation of activities and impacted inclusivity since it could not be realised during the closure
of the schools and from a distance.
The acceptance of the concept of inclusion in education systems requires time, since it involves a
change of perspective and priorities in society, as well as the adjustment of financing mechanisms. It
is important that education systems, and governments develop and use accountability processes that
promote the goals they seek to attain since these processes can be powerful drivers influencing the
allocation of time, financial, professional and all types of resources.
Since any type of changes and reforms to the educational system require a lot of time and results
could be seen in a matter of years after the actual intervention, such a change and overlap of the
programmes could hinder the level of efficiency, due to the mentioned setting of new goals and
expected results and not following one clear plan from the beginning.
It should also be mentioned that, despite the declared beginning of the process towards inclusive
education in 2011, actually stakeholders perceived that the beginning happened in 2016. They share
that there were different stages in the implementation and pilot schools, which created the model,
were chosen.
Management and coordination
In table 18 in annex 9.9.7 are presented the areas and processes of management and coordination
and how these were realised. The education policy is planned at the national level with main
responsibility of MoE. In terms of referral mechanism towards services, the main entrance in the
educational system for children with developmental difficulties and disabilities is realised through
PMPC. The work with different groups is realised at general schools, special schools and special
kindergartens, special groups in kindergarten, special classes in schools or in home-schooling. The
individual programme for children is oriented towards the educational and learning goals instead of
towards child development. The process of monitoring and data collection is realised through the
National Education Database without integration of the data between different ministries. All this
information is summarised in the national reports but it is often presented in a different way, related
to the changing concepts and priorities over the years, so they are not consistent enough to monitor
all changes like for number of children for specialised groups in regular schools, number of home-
schooled children, etc.

6.4.3. EXISTING PLATFORMS FOR DISSEMINATION OF RESOURCES FOR
EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES
One of the key factors for developing any system is the capacity of the professional working in it. Apart
from trainings and qualification, databases with resources, which could help specialists increase their
knowledge, are an alternative way for capacity development.
In the country there are two main platforms for resources for inclusive education. These are the state
databases with resources and apart from them, there are many NGOs and private centre platforms
(most of them are with interactive learning materials for children such as www.opiq.kz,
www.BilimLand.kz, www.imektep.kz, www.twig-bilim.kz, while others contain analytical information
on the educational system in the country - https://iac.kz/?page_id=6135&lang=en), but there is no
information that the state education programmes put a focus on such existing platforms or support
their development.
The criteria according to which the existing platforms are selected for analysis, are the following:
groups of users; type of information; how user-friendly is the platform; is a feedback system available.
The platform special-edu.kz is

In general, the platform has
information on different topics for different stakeholders. Professionals (teachers and specialists), as
well as parents indicate the website as a place where they can find information, but it was less known
by teachers. Some of the menus in the platform are easier to access, while others are not immediately
available when entering the site, which could be confusing for the users. The platform doesn’t have a
feedback form and the way to obtain additional information or ask a question is through the published
email and also through the website itself. The publications are accessible in Kazakh and Russian
language. In addition, the platform has a Facebook page, which has 949 followers, which is one point
of dissemination of the resources. It also has an Instagram page, a Youtube channel and Google +
profile. The platform has existed since 2013 (the old page can still be accessed) and by estimations, it
has around 12800 visitors monthly (graph 17).

content of the platform is
related to experience in education, there is a link to the website for continuous development. It is
rather related to content on the whole on education, not so much to certain groups and is mostly
oriented towards supporting specialists, instead of the other stakeholders. There is also a Q&A section
and the possibility to contact the organisation to ask a question through the website. The platform is
newer than the other one and has existed since 2021. The National Academy also has a Facebook and
Instagram page. By estimations, there are around 5000 visits per month (graph 18).
In summary, the investments in education in the country are increasing during the last year, which
shows an understanding of the importance and return of these investments. When it comes to inclusive
education, it should be noted that it’s not a separate area of financing, but rather a part of the common
financial standards at the level of primary and secondary education. It seems that investments in
education in the last 10 years were related to different components of investment in the education
system. In terms of inclusivity this means that the investments in physical access and buildings were
prevalent until the middle of the period, after which bigger resources are allocated for digitalization,
salaries of teachers and their capacity development. An important step towards the individualizing of
expenses at the student level is the introduction of per capita financing. The analysis of per capita
funding mechanism shows that for the period of evaluation and until now, the allocated resources for
inclusive education in general schools are similar to those in special classes in general school but
significantly less than home-schooling. On one hand, this input-oriented funding seems rather oriented
towards children with disabilities and learning difficulties, instead of towards all groups of children at
risk. On the other hand, it creates a risk of over-identification of learners with SEN, which should be
analysed additionally.
6.5. SUSTAINABILITY
The level of sustainability is analysed through the degree up to which there is a national policy in plan
to support inclusive education, as well as at the level of schools. Additionally, it is important to
understand what the legal/ financial and institutional mechanisms in place are to ensure this level of
sustainability. Also, the conditions for capacity building of teachers, school curriculum are
preconditions for quality education.
6.5.1. MECHANISMS TO ENSURE SUSTAINABILITY
Commitment to support inclusive education at the different levels
Inclusive education is a central topic in the development of education going from special education to
inclusive education as a concept and practice of implementation. In 2021, the amendments of
legislation in view of inclusive education outline the professional understanding of the concept, while
in 2022 the methodological orders are related to the groups of children included. This process means
that there is a transition from the medical approach to disability to the socio-pedagogical one, on one
58
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
hand. On the other hand, a broader understanding is developing that inclusive education should
include all groups of vulnerable children.
In view of sustainability, it should be noted that the topic of inclusive education remains included in
the new Concept 2023-2029 through one of the seven fields, related to creation of equal starting
opportunities. The topic over the years is mostly in the area of secondary education, rather than
primary, and it seems this tendency has stayed the same. The new concept reconfirms the key
indicator for secondary schools with the main goal to create conditions for inclusive education, which
should be 100% in 2027. Meanwhile in 2021, this indicator was 81,7%, which leads to the assumption
that it can be achieved until 2027. Also, preschool, and vocational education are added, out of which
100% should create conditions for inclusive education until 2026. The inclusion of the indicator in the
new concept shows that policy is sustainably oriented towards inclusive education.
Several levels of understanding could be distinguished in terms of commitment to inclusive education.
At the national level, the stakeholders share that the national policy will continue to be oriented and
developed in terms of inclusive education. This is confirmed by the fact that the indicators have been
included in the new Concept and their scope has been enlarged.
At the school level and level of professionals, there are stakeholders dedicated to continuing working
in the direction of inclusive education and others who face challenges in the implementation and
believe some of the children with disabilities should study in special classes and this will be more
effective for them. They believe that the rest of the vulnerable groups of children have always been
included in the educational system of the country and a special effort is not required.
Parents and children are also rather satisfied and believe that the process of inclusiveness should be
continued. Parents in smaller villages are rather inclined towards boarding schools as a preferrable
place for their children to study, due to
“Today the stigma toward SEN kids has changed, more and
the big territory of the country and
more parents are not ashamed of the diagnosis (it was
challenges they face such as financial
considered a taboo before).” (FGD with teachers)
limitation for parents in terms of
bringing their children to the school in the region every day. One of the key factors for sustainability
is the attitude towards the children with SEN and the level of acceptance of the differences in the
community. There is a change in the level of stigmatization and discrimination both in the perceptions
of students and those of parents. Although these results can’t be generalized, the data shows that the
environment is changing gradually, and this is a step towards sustainability of inclusiveness of
education in general schools.
It is important that some teachers point out they do not need to explain to the other students that
their classmate has SEN, since they are tolerant and understanding. However, there are certain
discrepancies, because other teachers in elementary schools explain the diagnosis to the class (but
avoid telling the specific child with SEN), while some prefer to keep diagnoses secret out of fear of
bullying or discrimination, especially in terms of children 1st to 4th grade.
The representatives of NGOs are critical towards national policy and share the medical approach is
still prevalent, which means that correction is still used as a term, instead of rights, equality, and
support. Some of these NGOs have created their own models, some of which were disseminated at
the national level and others are still implemented only locally. The representatives of private centres
together with NGOs are innovative and would like to look for new models, which they desire to include
in practice and policy, so they are committed to this process.
Availability of legal/institutional/financial mechanisms to ensure sustainability
The main legal mechanisms ensuring sustainability of inclusive education are described in the Law on
education from 2007, the update from 2015, but mostly through the Amendments from 2021, when
a number of legislative acts are changed and developed in view of inclusive education.
59
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
It should also be noted that in 2022
“In 10 years, a lot has been done, the main result is that the
the Orders of the MoES of the
country is going in the right direction … 2015 (Updated Law on
education) the concept is broadened…this is important for the Republic of Kazakhstan from 2022
whole society, for the people, for the professionals, a connection is № 4 and 6 gave a description of the
made between inclusion and quality’’(KII with NGO representative) methodological approaches to
working with the groups of children
with SEN. In addition, there are other national legislative acts regulating inclusiveness of education in
some form161: Law on the Rights of the Child in the Republic of Kazakhstan; Law “On special social
services”; About approval of the state obligatory standards education at all levels of education; Order
On the approval of the Model Rules for activities of educational organizations, “System of criteria-
based assessment of educational achievements of students with special educational needs in
conditions of inclusive education”. Therefore, a big number of legislative and regulations define the
concept, details on provision, standards, etc. of inclusive education. In terms of legislative
mechanisms, this means that the preconditions for sustainability are ensured.
In terms of institutional mechanisms, there are institutions at the national level and education
departments at the local level in each region, as well as the MoE at the national level. They function
in a top-down way, through a centralized approach, from the national towards the local level. A key
role in the implementation of the activities are PMPCs, whose role is to provide recommendations to
parents regarding the educational trajectory of children with SEN. The available mechanisms appear
to be sustainable, and they have been implemented for a long period of time and some of them have
gone through transformation (from correctional to special to inclusive education). However, there is
a potential risk that this centralized approach does not consider the differences between regions,
which are present at different levels of the system. Also, the local authorities might not be involved
sufficiently, which could lead to discrepancies in the form of implementation of the policy. The lack of
intersectoral (rather vertical) coordination leads to a low level of sustainability in view of the
mechanisms for creation of a supporting environment for the children and meeting their complex
needs which need to be addressed by the different systems working collaboratively.
When it comes to financial mechanisms ensuring sustainability of inclusive policy, as it was noted in
the Efficiency part, the most important change that is happening is the per capita funding. This
mechanism ensures financing according to the number of children studying at the schools and
additional for those with SEN. This type of funding has been introduced in stages since 2013. Currently
(since 2020) all urban schools have transferred to the new type of financing (table 20 in annex 9.10.8).
In terms of sustainability, this model of financing ensures sustainable resources for inclusiveness in
education. However, per capita standards for children with SEN studying at home are higher than for
those in special and inclusive classes. This could cause certain challenges in the level of sustainability
of inclusiveness, since the system could focus more on children studying in special classes or at home,
rather than for those who study in inclusive classes.
Another aspect of financial mechanisms for sustainability is the increase in teacher salaries, which
could possibly decrease the turnover rate and help ensure sustainability in this way. At the same time,
the data shows differences between teacher salaries in the different educational levels and in the
separate regions. The differences in salaries between the regions might have reasoning related to
distinctions in the living standards across the country. “The average monthly nominal salary of
teachers varies considerably depending on the level of education they teach and the region they work
in. In 2021, teachers in secondary and primary education on average earned 269,1 thousand tenge,
teachers in higher education - 251,8 thousand tenge, and teachers in special education - 187,3
thousand tenge. As per minimal salaries, schoolteachers in comprehensive schools earn 245,2
thousand tenge, which is at least 142,6 thousand tenge and 145,5 thousand tenge more than teachers
at special and higher education levels.”162
It is also important to compare the budgets for personnel in preschool and secondary education (graph
26 in annex 9.10.8). The analysis of the financing of the programmes related to expenditures for the
60
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
two levels of education shows that the funding for secondary education is much higher, which means
that financial mechanisms for sustainability are ensured up to a higher degree.
The developed legislative framework, the available institutional and financial mechanisms ensure a
medium level of sustainability of educational policies with a focus on inclusivity. Per capita funding
guarantees higher level of financing for children with SEN. However, this financing is higher for those
studying at home. There is also a different level of commitment on behalf of all stakeholders in relation
to continuing the process of inclusive education. It should be kept into account, however, they have a
different type of understanding of inclusiveness, on one hand. On the other hand, some stakeholders
think that for the most severe cases of children with disabilities, (especially for rural areas) it is better
that they receive special education.
6.5.2. CONDITIONS TO ENSURE SUSTAINABILITY
School curriculums
The Law ‘’On education’’163 reinforces teaching within the State Compulsory Educational Standard on
individual curriculum, special educational programme according to the decision of the Board of
Educational Organization. According to the Order of the Minister of Education and Science of the
Republic of Kazakhstan ‘’On the approval of the Model Rules for activities of educational
organizations’’ 164 educational institutions provide for the training of students with special educational
needs, taking into account the interests of parents (legal representatives): in a general class (no more
than two children) according to a standard curriculum, including a shortened or individual curriculum;
and (or) in special classes by the types of developmental disorders according to special educational
plans and curricula. Children with educational needs who are in inclusive education classroom on the
basis of the recommendations of the PMPC are taught in accordance with the standard, individual or
adapted curriculum. ‘’An adapted curriculum is drawn up on the basis of the State Compulsory
Education Standard, considering the individual capabilities of the student. The same way an Individual
curriculum is tailored to the certain abilities of a student with impaired intelligence. The text of the
shortened/individual curriculum should contain the educational goals for all sections of the Typical
curriculum, formulated in the form of expected results (skills and abilities of the student) as well as an
indication of the teaching methods and techniques that are most effective for this particular
learner.’’165
When it comes to the guidance/procedures for schools to ensure that the curriculum content takes
account of all learners it has to be noted the instructional and methodical letter “On peculiarities of
organising the educational process in secondary schools of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the 2018-
2019 academic year," developed by the Ministry of Education and Science of the RK and NAE S.
Altynsarin. The guide provides recommendations for inclusive schools and teachers in building a
learning strategy for children with SEN, children from national minority families, migrants, etc.,
considering their psychophysical characteristics and special educational needs.166
The data shows that there is guidance and procedures available which could provide a clear way for
schools to make a curriculum for children with SEN in an adapted way and what to include in it.
However, as it is pointed out in other parts of the report, methodological materials are not always
enough, accessible or in the appropriate language to be used by teachers and specialists, which is an
additional challenge.
Many international studies confirm the need for investment in teachers and their capacity, but at the
same time, it is necessary to empower them to work flexibly.
Teachers’ motivation and understanding
When it comes to understanding of inclusive education and motivation of the teachers, it is important
to acknowledge that they share their difficulties and lack of clarity how to work with children with
SEN, what methods and techniques need to be used, even how to communicate with them when they
have intellectual disabilities. They understand what the concept of inclusive education means in
theory, but the practice turns out to be something different and more challenging. They did not have
61
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
the opportunity to get to know the concept in detail, since in their higher education the module had
been introduced only recently at universities and wasn’t part of the curriculum before that. Some
teachers share that having children with autism in their class is a challenge, since they had no prior
training or education in terms of working with children with SEN. In some cases, they sought out
solutions in view of looking for resources to learn something new (resources are mostly in Russian
language).
In terms of sustainability, teachers
“Some teachers are not prepared to work with SEN, they get understand the need to work with
scared of working with SEN kids, these teachers need a lot of
students with SEN, but they face
training and preparation.” (FGD with teachers)
different challenges and do not
always feel they have the necessary
skills to feel confident and secure in teaching classes with all students.
Continuous professional development
The sustainability of any educational reform mostly depends on the capacity of people who implement
it and the range of methodological materials and approaches with which they could apply it. The
support for teachers in the country in terms of increasing their salaries has been done, which is a good
starting point for decreasing turnover, but their motivation depends on many other factors, among
which is the prestige of the teacher profession, quality of higher education, continuous professional
development. When it comes to inclusive education, it is of key importance for all off these
components and areas of motivation to be combined with an understanding what the concept and
equality actually entails. This is even more valid for educational systems in transition, in which the
orientation towards receiving knowledge and learning is more prevalent instead of towards acquiring
skills.
According to the Order of the Minister of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated
January 28, 2016 No. 95 " Rules for organizing and conducting advanced training courses for teachers,
as well as post-course support for the activities of a teacher", definitions of the concepts and
procedure for conducting post-course support and monitoring the activities of a teacher are given.167
The advanced training department is a structural subdivision of National Scientific and Practical Center
for the Development of Special and Inclusive Education168, which carries out activities to improve the
skills of psychological and pedagogical staff of special and inclusive education. The purpose of the
training department is to organize and provide educational and methodological support for advanced
training courses for psychological and pedagogical personnel of special and inclusive education in
accordance with modern requirements and the need to master new methods of correctional and
pedagogical work with children with special educational needs based on the best modern
psychological and pedagogical approaches and educational and correctional practice. The activities of
the department to improve the skills of psychological and pedagogical staff of special and inclusive
education provide for the training of students on a paid and free (budgetary) basis. Education on a
free basis is carried out in accordance with the Budget program. Every year, the programme provides
for 13-14 advanced training courses in Kazakh and Russian on various topics according to general
areas, the topics of the courses are in demand and cover a wide range of topical problems of the
theory and practice of special and inclusive education.
Continuous professional development is related to university education, introduction training at the
workplace, upgrading professional trainings, and professional support in terms of supervision and
intervision. Also, the development of a professional society is important to exchange experience,
discuss best practices and solutions to issues, create innovative models, etc. As mentioned above, in
the country a module on inclusive education was introduced at the level of higher education in all the
specialists getting pedagogical qualifications. Stakeholders share this is not enough, but it serves as a
basis for subsequent development of their qualifications. However, a big share of teachers in the
system have not passed this module course, since it was still not introduced at the time of their
studies. This means that for them (and everyone), it is of key importance to provide a variety of
62

opportunities to pass training courses and be able to upgrade their skills in regard to inclusive
education.
Many participants in FGDs share

Resource centres at the school (the
pilot schools from 2016, which
turned into such centres) play a supporting role for development of inclusive education, created in
the last years, by providing methodological support and materials to schools from one region.
In the table 3 below are presented the key barriers and mitigation strategies towards sustainability of
the educational policy.

In summary, towards the end of the period in the scope of the evaluation in terms of sustainability,
activities have been implemented to ensure the changes happening will continue in the future having
in mind the long period of implementation. At the national and local level, there is commitment to
continue developing the process of inclusivity in education. Furthermore, the concept is clarified
through including new vulnerable groups of children among those who need support to ensure
education for all. In view of these efforts, the policy is supported by the professional community, parents
and children, although the process needs to be qualified further. National and international NGOs have
a serious role and are boosters for continuing the process in the right direction. The created mechanisms
(legal, institutional, and financial) support inclusive process and create a framework for
implementation, but at the same time the financial mechanism requires in-depth analysis in view of the
degree to which it ensures financing for special education as well. Teachers need additional
opportunities to upgrade their skills and knowledge on how to work with children with SEN in terms of
updating university education further and continuous professional education at the workplace such as
trainings and professional courses, supervision mechanisms, etc.
7. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.1. CONCLUSIONS
7.1.1. RELEVANCE
In conclusion, since 2011, the educational policy of Kazakhstan is oriented towards achievement of
inclusiveness of all children in education. Three programmes and one national project describe the
strategic national priorities in view of achieving equal access to quality education for all children. The
63
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
educational policies follow the international conventions and key documents on the topic, which put
an emphasis on the inclusion of all children and implementation of more inclusive approaches to
education to overcome barriers faced by those who are at risk to be excluded from the system. The
country hasn’t created a special policy for inclusive education. Rather, it is implemented in its whole
idea for development of education.
The analysis of the relevance of the different areas of change planned in the programmes with the
international policy shows that despite the main principles, goals and national priorities have a high
level of relevance, early identification, early interventions and ECD services are not the central focus
of national programmes. Additionally, work with parents and ensuring their participation is also not
addressed sufficiently in the programmes.
In the period of development of inclusive education and transition from the medical to the
biopsychosocial model of disability there is a need to create a learning environment and remove the
barriers towards the inclusion of the different groups of children. In spite of enlarging the scope of the
understanding of the groups of children at risk of exclusion, children with disabilities, learning
difficulties and in rural areas are mostly addressed by the programmes.
7.1.2. COHERENCE
In conclusion, the state education programmes have similar goals and priorities, oriented towards
equity and access to quality education. Each of them has its own internal logic of planning, but none
of them has an analysis of achievements so that the next programme can upgrade the results from
the previous one.
The planned activities for achieving the goals in all the programmes are realised in the educational
sector in partnership with all other sectors, related to the rights of education of all children. The
intersectoral integration is a challenge since a mechanism for its implementation has not been
developed and each separate sector has its own structures and resources through which to implement
policy. There is an effort for collaboration between the social, health and educational sectors, but still
such mechanisms have not been developed.
The approach of planning and implementing policy is centralised. It is planned at the central level and
realised at the local level (top-down approach). At the different levels, there are different institutions
and structures engaged with educational policy and, in particular, inclusivity, which have specific roles
and functions. Key stakeholders in implementing the policy are local and international NGOs and
organisations, as well as private entities. Their role is related to an initial boost to the development of
inclusive policy, of pilot practices and raising awareness on the issues.
7.1.3. EFFECTIVENESS
In conclusion, although the indicator from the State programme for 2011-2020 seems to be achieved
according to the national data (81.7% of schools in 2021 have created conditions for inclusive
education), there is indication that it is unclear what is understood by favourable conditions, or this
has changed over the years. The analysis regarding the main components shows that still, the
achievement of conditions for inclusiveness of education is a process that is not finished, and this is
also confirmed by stakeholders. The cycle of change from traditional to inclusive education goes
through different phases but should start with common understanding and clear management and
leadership of the process. The analysis of these programmes shows that the cycle has started from
physical access (architecture) and went gradually into the inclusion of the rest of the elements of
change.
In terms of preschool education and care, the data for the period of evaluation shows an increase in
the scope in terms of the number of kindergartens, a decrease in the number of mini-centres and
development of the content of curriculum. In 2019, 98.7% of children aged 3-6 attended preschool
education (and 100% in 2021). In 2021, 84.6% of children aged 1-6 attended preschool education,
while 67% of kindergartens created conditions for inclusive education. At the same time, the number
of special kindergartens remains similar between 2014 and 2020 (slightly increasing) with a bigger
64
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
increase in 2021 with 4414 children in them. On the other hand, the qualitative data shows that
according to parents the issues with early childhood education, early identification and intervention
are serious. The choices they have to meet the needs of their children at an early age are limited to
special kindergartens, private centres, or home- schooling.
In the period of 10 years the system of inclusiveness in education is developing in parallel with keeping
the system for special education. The number of children with SEN in secondary inclusive education is
increasing over the years (from 33% in 2018 to 52% in 2022). At the same time, it should be noted that
there are still 14% of children in special schools in 2022, 10% are in special classes and 12% are in
home-schooling. This shows that still, the system is in a process of development, although there is a
clear trend towards increasing the number of children with SEN in general schools. When it comes to
children with SEN in preschool, 41% are in inclusive kindergartens in 2022, but still 11% are in special
groups in general kindergartens and 13% are in special kindergartens. When it comes to other groups
of children at risk of exclusion, their right to education is ensured in general and boarding schools.
Although boarding schools satisfy needs regarding education, especially for children in rural and
remote areas, there is no data on their quality, and this should be analysed additionally.
7.1.4. EFFICIENCY
In conclusion, the investments in education are increasing for the period of evaluation and are related
to the different necessary resources and educational stages. There isn’t a separate financing dedicated
to inclusive education, so the investments in it are a part of all the investments in the system. In the
first years of the period of evaluation, the investments in physical access and buildings are prevalent,
while in 2015-2016 more resources are allocated for digitalisation and capacity development. The
least investments are in methodological materials.
There is an overlapping in the periods of realisation of the programmes, which means that sometimes
different goals and indicators for implementation are set for the educational system for the same
period. Since the cycle of change in the educational system requires a lot of time and the results are
seen in the more distant future, such an overlap could decrease the level of efficiency of their
implementation.
Two are the main changes in financing, influencing the efficiency of investments in terms of inclusivity:
the increase in the salaries of teachers, related to their motivation, which could affect the quality of
their work and the per capita financing introduced gradually across the country, after 2013. It provides
opportunities for individualising the resources for each child and that more money is allocated for
children with SEN. At the same time, these children receive similar financing when they study in the
special classes or in the inclusive classes.
7.1.5. SUSTAINABILITY
In conclusion, the sustainability of the policy for inclusiveness in education is ensured through making
the topic a priority not only in the educational programmes, but also in the new Concept for
development of education 2023 – 2029. This shows a sustainable national commitment to continue in
the direction of ensuring quality education for all children. This, together with changes in regulations,
creates sustainable preconditions for not only continuing policy, but also for making it more focused
and it is demonstrated by all stakeholders, although with a different level of influence on the changes
and different interest. Maybe most significant is the understanding of the children of inclusiveness as
the right for each child to study with others, which is a good precondition for raising awareness. In
addition, there are rather legal mechanisms for sustainability, but in view of financial ones, it is good
to analyse them further (regarding per capita funding, special education, and home-schooling).
It is necessary for the people implementing a policy to be motivated and to have capacity to implement
it. In all these years, different bottlenecks in view of the capacity of the system have been identified,
among which are the salaries and continuous professional development of teachers. Steps have been
65
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
taken towards ensuring sustainability, but they are still not enough, and more is needed to continue
in this direction.
7.2. LESSONS LEARNED
In summary, this formative evaluation concludes that the “road” to inclusivity goes through different
phases and the first steps in the right direction have been taken. Although the system is still keeping
special education, it manages to develop in a way that would create preconditions for change. The
outcomes in the scope of this evaluation, which are defined in the TOR as related to inclusivity from
three state programmes and one national project, have been achieved with the limitation of the way
they are understood, how data is collected and how they are reported on. At this stage of the policy
implementation, the evaluation has identified different challenges and some limitations, mostly in the
planning and implementation of interventions.
The main lesson learned is that, in order to create an inclusive system, it is of key importance to clearly
define the goal in view of equity for all children, right to quality education and focus on learning. This
goal needs to be decomposed to concrete tasks and activities, which would lead to its achievement.
This is done in partnership with all relevant stakeholders and, in particular, the parent community.
The ET identifies the following specific lessons learned:
• Importance of more focused strategic planning and communication in terms of inclusive
education with different stakeholders at the different stages of implementation of activities towards
achieving the common goals. Ensuring a high level of relevance and total achievement of the goals
depends on focused planning with specific tasks, expected outcomes and indicators, agreed between
all involved actors and sectors.
• The common understanding and agreement around a path to change at the planning phase
of realisation of policy is a key factor for identifying clear expected outcomes and impact, key
activities, assumptions and risk mitigation and description of the road to these results, including
planning at the local level.
• It is important to ensure participation of all stakeholders, at a multisectoral level. The road
is long and passes through a change in attitudes, motivations, and capacity development in all sectors
engaged with ensuring the rights of the children.
• It is necessary to ensure that the indicators for outcomes, related to inclusive education, are
clearly defined, reliable and measurable and that high quality data is collected and analysed in a
proper way. This is essential in order to set priorities, monitor and measure the achievement of the
outcome, as well as to identify the needs.
• Importance of development of early identification and early intervention integrated services
in order to implement the identification of developmental problems and support for parents at the
earliest stages.
• Development of integrated services for children at risk of exclusion from the educational
system and implementing a case management approach, which involves assessment and planning
according to the needs. The individual approach to the needs of each child is crucial to ensuring
inclusive and equitable quality education.
• There is a high level of importance of empowering principals, teachers, parents, and children
to develop their own ‘project of change’ for each school. The planning how to develop inclusiveness
in every school, having in mind the differences in the regions would guarantee a high level of
commitment and ownership on behalf of the schools, including parents, students, and teachers.
• A systemic change could be ensured by efficient investing of resources in inclusive
education, taking into consideration the main components of educational reform, the right – based
approach and all components of the change like pedagogy, leadership, school environment,
technology, and efficient investment.
• The continuous professional development of all teachers and ensuring flexibility of their
work will provide opportunities for implementing of innovative approaches for working with children
at risk of exclusion and create a supportive learning environment.

Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
8. RECOMMENDATIONS
All the analysis and conclusions in terms of policy development give reason to the ET to suggest and
formulate an updated ToC for the next period of implementation, which contains the main
bottlenecks, as well as suggestions for fields of intervention, expected changes in view of inclusive
education and the path to these changes.
The major bottlenecks are grouped into four domains: enabling environment, demand, supply, and
quality. In terms of enabling environment, it is indicated that the concept on inclusive education is
developed but is still in the beginning of implementation; public attitudes are changing, but still
discrimination and stigma exist, especially in certain regions; lack mechanism for coordination/
partnership in the education sector and at the multisectoral level; centralized and no participatory
mechanisms for planning, monitoring, and evaluating educational provision for children at risk of
exclusion from quality and adapted education, due to family, social, economic, and/or individual
conditions. In terms of the demand side the ToC stipulates that: many children with SEN at an early
age do not have access to inclusive preschool education; school/ECEC infrastructure does not fully
meet the existing needs; the scope of basic secondary education is oriented towards receiving
knowledge rather than skills; many families of children with SEN use private educational services while
those services are not affordable for all; systematic problems in early identification and early
intervention and prevention; no transition to ensure continuation of the curriculum between early
childhood, primary and secondary education. In terms of the supply side, it is indicated in the ToC
that: the existing network of preschool education organizations does not respond to the needs of
inclusive education; there is high work overload of PMPCs and lack of capacity for needs assessment
of children with SEN; teacher education programmes, both preservice and in service, do not fully
address the provision of inclusive education in schools/preschool; the school environment for
learning, material and technical base and digital infrastructure of educational organizations is not fully
developed to meet the needs of all learners. In terms of the quality side, the ToC states that: the
individual programmes for students with SEN are oriented towards knowledge development rather
than skills building; there are no tailor-made approaches for working with the other groups of
vulnerable children at risk of exclusion, apart from children with SEN; there are not enough materials
and methodological materials in Kazakh language; professionals and specialists are often inadequately
trained; there are strict methodological requirements for teachers on how to work with children with
SEN; low quality of screening, ICF is not implemented; there are regional differences in quality of
working with children with SEN.
Three key outcome areas could lead to overcoming the identified bottlenecks and barriers towards
inclusive education development in Kazakhstan. The first one is oriented towards strengthening
partnerships and multisectoral coordination. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to develop a
mechanism for coordination/partnership/planning at the horizontal and vertical level, as well as policy
in the direction of integration between services at the local level. In order to achieve inclusive
education, it is necessary to conduct the planning not only at the national, but also at the local level
to reflect regional specifics, on one hand, and on the other, to involve local authorities, as well as
parent communities and achieve a high level of participation. On the other hand, the integration
between the sectors could contribute to having common goals and meeting the needs of all children.
It is necessary to have a unified gatekeeping mechanism in order to ensure integrated needs
assessment and referral to different services appropriate for each case.
The second is oriented towards universalizing access and promoting equity and continuation of the
services for children at different ages. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to develop early
identification and early intervention services, pedagogy, leadership, and school environment for
learning, accessible for all children, as well as focus on ECD services in terms of pedagogy, capacity
development and leadership. All international studies confirm that investment in early learning and
development has the biggest social return and impact on the whole development of the individual and
of the system as well. This means that the focus on early intervention and prevention for children with

Final Report
SEN, as well as ECD services for all children would ensure support for development and learning at an
early age. The promotion of equity in education and the rights-based approach is related to the school
environment for learning, in which the pedagogical approaches and techniques and the type of
leadership guarantee quality of education for all children.
This leads to the third area, related to broadening the means and scope of basic education to support
children holistically. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to empower teachers to work flexibly,
ensure a system for continuous professional development at all levels of education, develop
methodological materials accessible in different languages for children at a different age with different
needs, implement integrated and multisectoral approach in assessment and planning of the school
programmes on the individual level. The rights-based approach to education means that all children
should have equivalent and systematic learning opportunities. To ensure this, it is necessary to have
teachers who would be flexible in using different approaches, materials which would help them to
implement the approaches and to plan their implementation according to the individual needs of
every child, regardless of their ability and background.
The path to change is made with the following assumptions: capacity development of teachers and
flexibility of their work will ensure implementation of the individual approach; if early intervention
and identification is developed, support for the children will start earlier and they will more easily be
included in educational activities and there will be a bigger return of investment; an integrated effort
of work between the three systems would ensure inclusion of all groups of children. The following
risks should be considered: rushing into preparation of teachers could make it difficult to know what
the next steps are to follow; too much focus on early intervention, instead of the other system
components (like secondary and vocational education); per capita financing could lead to an increase
in the number of children studying in “special classes”.
The recommendations derived from the ToC and are listed in the table below. Each recommendation
is assigned a responsibility, priority, and timeframe. General areas of recommendations are discussed
with UNICEF and MoE and will be validated at a final ERG workshop. It should be noted that all the
right holders (parents and children) have been asked specifically to provide their own
recommendations during the data collection process for future implementation of education policy in
terms of inclusivity. All relevant opinions were taken into account when developing the set of
evaluation recommendations below, especially those related to development and quality of education
services.
The recommendations presented in table 15 below were constructed from the evaluative evidence
and findings of the evaluation:
• Strategic recommendations (focused on the sectoral and intersectoral policy changes in terms
of inclusivity);
• Practical recommendations (focused on development of services and quality of services);
• Operational recommendations (focused on coordination, M&E, guidance).
In order to identify the responsibility, the ET has considered information on the key responsible
institutions for the planning and realisation of educational policy. Having in mind that this evaluation
does not have a specific focus on the contribution of UNICEF, the ET has made recommendations on
interventions and policies that UNICEF could support in view of their innovative type and the need to
pilot and model new services and policies. How these recommendations will be related to the planning
of the Country Programme Development is the decision of UNICEF.

Strategic recommendations (focused on policy challenges in terms of inclusivity)
Focused strategic planning to improve the education systems to enable inclusion of all children regardless of individual
background and abilities
• Enhance multisectoral coordination/partnership at both High In the frame of Line ministries in
horizontal and vertical levels. Establish a robust mechanism the new strategic the educational,
for coordination which should facilitate effective planning health and social
collaboration and information sharing among relevant sector
stakeholders, including government departments,
educational institutions, civil society organizations.
• Develop a mechanism for partnership and planning in the Medium In the frame of MoE
education sector, including resource allocation and capacity the new strategic
building. This support would address the needs to include planning
local authorities in the needs assessment and planning of
implementation of inclusive education, fostering
collaboration between schools, teachers, parents and
children to address specific challenges related to inclusivity.
• Policy oriented towards development of services on ECD, High In the frame of Line ministries in
early intervention and prevention. Implement the new strategic the educational,
comprehensive and evidence-based programmes that planning health and social
support the holistic development of children, including their sector with the
cognitive, social, emotional, and physical well-being. The support of
findings from the evaluation show that there is a lack of such UNICEF
services for children at an early age, so it is necessary to
enhance partnerships and build capacity in the education
and health sectors.
• Adopt a policy framework focused on the development of Medium In the frame of Line ministries in
integrated services, employing a multisectoral approach for the new strategic the educational,
needs assessment and tailored support for children at risk of planning health and social
exclusion. The findings of the evaluation indicate the lack of sector with the
services which effectively meet the needs of children, related support of
to social, health and educational inequalities. UNICEF
Practical recommendations (focused on development of services and quality of services)
Focused systematic planning aimed at strengthening the national and local institutional capacity in providing
educational quality services
• Creation of conditions for inclusive education in High In the frame of MoE and local
kindergartens in order to ensure the access and quality of the mid-term level institutions
work with all children at risk of exclusion (in view of planning
architecture, teacher capacity, pedagogical methods and
materials). This will meet the need identified by the
evaluation for increasing the access of children at an early
age to preschool education.
• Secondary schools should continue their path to Medium In the frame of Local educational
inclusiveness through rights-based planning on what is most mid-term institutions and
appropriate with the participation of all stakeholders, planning schools
including parents in particular. This will meet the need to
address the differences in the regions and reduce the
influence of the centralised methodological approach.
• Ensure a well-planned and realised professional High In the frame of MoE
development of teachers to become agents of change and mid-term
flexibility to use pedagogical approaches and innovative planning
techniques to guarantee quality of education for all children.
This will meet the needs for capacity development of
teachers identified in the evaluation.

• Ensure that the system is well-equipped, and Medium In the frame of National and local
beneficiaries are properly informed about methodological mid-term educational
materials in Kazakh language, digital resources, and tools for planning institutions and
working with children with different levels of abilities and schools
needs. The evaluation has identified the need for
methodological materials and low level of digitalisation in
some of the schools, especially in rural areas
• Conduct additional analysis focused on per capita High In the frame of MoE
financing on inclusive education in order to decide what is mid-term per
the most efficient way for spending the resources. The capita financing
evaluation identifies that per capita standards are bigger per implementation
child with SEN studying at home and similar for special and
inclusive classes.
• Ensure methodological support for implementation of High In the frame of MoE with the
case management approach in assessment and planning in mid-term support of
addressing the needs of children at risk of exclusion implementation UNICEF
holistically. The evaluation has identified that the individual
programmes used for students are related only to the
learning tasks instead of to development of soft skills.
• Plan an analysis and revision of the role of PMPCs in view Medium In the frame of MoE and line
of a gatekeeping mechanism ensuring integrated support as mid-term ministries, local
a main agency for giving recommendations to different implementation educational
social, educational and health services. This means that the departments
planning of the concrete programme and support for
children will be conducted at the service level. This will meet
the need for gatekeeping and reduce the workload since a
part of the activities will be transferred to other services.
Operational recommendations:
Coordination, M&E, guidance
• Define a clear and common goal and formulate High In the frame of MoE
measurable specific indicators for inclusive education, as operational
well as data collection mechanism with disaggregation (as planning
much as it is possible by gender, age of children in the
education system, geographical location, trends for the
years, etc.). The findings from the formative evaluation show
that the indicator on favourable conditions for inclusive
education need to be specified and clarified.
• Develop a mechanism for integrated planning of the High In the frame of MoE and the
implementation of the state education policy (in terms of operational other line
programmes and strategies) with clear division of tasks, planning ministries and
timeline, and responsibilities of the different line ministries agencies
and implementing agencies
• Review the suggested ToC to be considered in the process High In the frame of UNICEF
of development of new educational policies. Since a ToC has operational
not been developed for any of the programmes and now planning
there is a suggestion, it should be validated and/or updated
by stakeholders.

9.5.2. METHODOLOGY
Desk review
The desk review is an appropriate method for this evaluation, because it allows getting familiar with
the context in the country, regulatory framework, available studies, and reports, in order to collect
information and review the available evidence regarding the educational reform and the overall
situation in Kazakhstan.
At the initial phase of the FE the ET of Junction Bulgaria has reviewed the following documents
provided by the office of UNICEF Kazakhstan:
● Law on Education
● Law on Inclusive Education
● State Program for the Development of Education 2011-2020
● State program for the development of Education 2016 – 2019
● State Program for the Development of Education 2020-2025
● National Project "Quality Education "Educated Nation" 2021 – 2025
● National Annual Reports on Education from 2015 to 2020
Furthermore, the desk review in the whole process of evaluation was based on additional sources,
such as reports and documents published in 2022, national and regional data on education in annex
3.
Secondary data analysis
The secondary data analysis is chosen as a method for data collection in order to provide information
regarding contextual aspects related to the educational reform process in the country, as well as
baseline data regarding the different outputs, achieving results in view of effectiveness, efficiency,
and other areas of evaluation.
Qualitative data collection methods
The evaluation team used 3 qualitative data collection methods: Key informant interviews (KIIs), Focus
Group Discussions (FGDs) and observations. The data was collected on a national/international,
regional, and local/school level. As part of the assignment, travel to the capital and other five regions
of the country were realised to conduct the field work. The regions are selected by the contractor in
consultation with UNICEF and national stakeholders to reflect the diverse realities in the country. The
specific criteria for choosing the regions are: economic development, geographic location, area, ethnic
distribution, spoken language, urban/rural areas, level of child poverty, enrolment in early education
and care. Some of the KIIs and FGDs were conducted online and others face-to-face, in order to be
flexible and comply with the availability and location of the stakeholders, in some cases outside of the
selected regions. The majority of the FGDs, KIIs, meetings and observations at the schools were
conducted face-to-face.
The geographic area(s) – Almaty, Almaty region, Astana, Turkistan, Atyrau, Pavlodar
Selection of the participants – the detailed criteria of the selection is described in detail below for
each of the qualitative methods.
● Key informant interviews
The KII is a qualitative method, providing the opportunity to collect and analyse information on
opinions, perceptions, attitudes, points of view and reasons for the influence of certain factors. Using
KIIs, the evaluation gains the practices of the stakeholders, experts and decision-makers involved in
the field of education. The method provides possibilities to participants to share their knowledge
about programmes, implementation, strategies, and changes in the lives of beneficiaries as a result of
this implementation. In this particular FE, KIIs were appropriate in order to understand the main goal
and purpose of the programmes and reforms, the main assumptions and risk mitigations strategies,
as well as all relevant specifics. A guide for KIIs was developed (Annex 9.5.3), containing different
107
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
questions to the different stakeholders. KIIs were conducted face-to-face or online via the Zoom
platform. The respondents were chosen, having in mind the features of this method and they could
be seen in annex 2, but overall are ministry representatives, local level officials, other relevant
government institution representatives, key international partners, representatives of implementing
agencies, Ombudspersons, representatives of psychological, medical and pedagogical commissions,
representatives of psychological and pedagogical correction rooms, rehabilitation centres, NGO
representatives and UNICEF programme specialists, as well as school/kindergarten principals. A total
of 32 KIIs were conducted at each of the three levels. The sampling method for qualitative data
collection was based on the following criteria for recruiting respondents:
For the national/international level (a total of 13 KIIs):
● To have participated/currently participate in the planning of the programs, with a
focus on inclusiveness in education;
● To have participated/currently participate and have a (specific) role in the
implementation of the programs, with a focus on inclusivity;
● To have extensive experience in the respective position;
● To have participated/currently participate in different roles as a partnership
organisation.
For the local level (a total of 9 KIIs):
● To have participated/currently participate in the planning/implementation of the
programmes;
● To be aware of the design of the different thematic areas, such as inclusive education,
etc.;
● To have extensive experience in the respective position.
For the school level (a total of 10 KIIs):
● To be in a decision-making position.
● Focus group discussions
This qualitative method was chosen, because it provides the opportunity to research in-depth the
different aspects through motivations, attitudes and process of educational reforms, opinions, and
perceptions of the different stakeholders, etc. In addition, the bigger number of respondents in a
single conversation in comparison with KIIs allows for generation of new knowledge in the process of
discussion. A guide for FGDs was developed (Annex 9.5.3). The respondents were chosen, having in
mind the features of this method and they could be seen in annex 2, but overall are beneficiaries
including parents/caregivers, children/adolescents (incl. NEETs), teachers, health professionals, etc.
FGDs were conducted face-to-face or online. A total of 19 FGDs were conducted with 89 participants
at the school level, of them 12 decision makers at national/international level; 31 teachers/specialists
at school level; 25 parents at the school level; 21 students at the school level. The recruitment of
children in the schools was done by the school authorities. The sampling method for qualitative data
collection was based on preliminary criteria for recruiting respondents, including additional criteria
for parents and children participants in FGDs, which are the following:
For the school level for parents/caregivers:
● To have children 3-6 years old or 7 -12 years old;
● Both mothers and fathers;
● Some parents of children in vulnerable groups (children living in poverty and social
exclusion, in rural areas etc.);
● Some parents of children with disabilities.
For the school level for children/adolescents:
● To be between 14-17 years old;
108
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
● Both boys and girls;
● Some of them living in poverty, in social exclusion, in rural areas, etc.;
● Some of them to be NEETs or out of school.
For the school level for teachers/health professionals:
● To have experience with working with children with special educational
needs/children at risk in different vulnerable categories;
● To have extensive experience in the respective position.
For the different levels/types of participants screening questionnaires was developed and provided to
the selected schools in order to facilitate the recruitment process (Annex 2).
Observations
The qualitative method of observation is chosen to research in-depth the school environment and
general atmosphere in the classrooms and other premises in terms of accessibility (physical and
informational), availability of resources (materials, technical equipment, technologies, books, etc.) in
order to be able to see the level of inclusiveness of education and what effects the educational reform
has brought about. An observation protocol was developed (Annex 9.5.3). 5 observations were
conducted at the schools (face-to-face, if possible). Schools were chosen based on the criteria to be
located in the six key regions, selected in the evaluation, to have activities related to inclusiveness and
work with different groups of children including vulnerable categories.

Dear Sir/Madam,
Junction Bulgaria is a company which was selected by UNICEF Kazakhstan to conduct a ‘Formative
Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity’. The
objective of this assignment is to assess to what extent the state education programmes in Kazakhstan
have been contributing to the inclusion of children of different levels of ability, in order to produce
evidence-based recommendations for strengthening the education system.
There are no direct material benefits to individuals participating in the research. We will ask you
questions about the implementation of the state education programmes like planning, activities, and
results. The interview/focus group will take approximately 60 minutes and it will be held online/face-
to-face. You can decide not to participate in the discussion, or you can tell us that you prefer not to
answer a specific question, and we will skip it. There is no need to answer any questions that make
you feel uncomfortable. If you like, you can end the interview at any time, and this will not affect your
relationship with UNICEF.
All of your answers will be kept private and confidential, and the only people who will have access to
this information are the researchers of the study. When we write up the results of the study, we will
not connect your name to anything that you said.
Documentation and data such as consent forms, interview notes or reporting templates will be
collected by Junction Bulgaria which will retain them for a maximum period of 24 months from the
date of receipt. If you have any questions about the research, or if problems arise, you may contact
us.

objective of this assignment is to assess to what extent the state education programmes in Kazakhstan
have been contributing to the inclusion of children of different levels of ability, in order to produce
evidence-based recommendations for strengthening the education system.
Children will have a voice in this evaluation by participating in a focus group and sharing their
experiences and their views on what has changed in their schools and their participation in activities.
Therefore, we ask for your support in involving your child in a focus group discussion. There is no direct
benefit for children or parents/legal guardians/representatives in this research.
We will provide a short letter for children called an ‘assent form’ with explanation of their participation
in the research. While discussing with children about their participation, please provide them with this
assent form.
The focus group discussion will be conducted face-to-face/online with a group of other children of a
similar age, and it will take approximately one hour. The information will be treated anonymously.
There are no right or wrong answers, we are solely interested in children’s opinions. If they do not
wish to answer a question, they don’t have to and they can decide to leave the discussion. In this case,
we won’t be able to use the information they have provided.
Documentation and data such as consent/assent forms or data from the focus groups will be collected
by Junction Bulgaria which will retain it for a maximum period of 24 months from the date of receipt.
If you have any further questions regarding this evaluation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Assent form for children
Hello,
We would like to present to you a study we are carrying out if you might like to take part in it. School
is an important part of your lives and your opinion is key and necessary, whenever we are talking
about education. This study is about changes in your school, school life and activities. This study is a
part of a project of UNICEF Kazakhstan, aiming to understand the changes at schools and whether
they led to positive results and what is your participation in this process. Children are part of this study
and will have the chance to express their views and share their experiences.
We will make a report with all these opinions and send it to UNICEF, an international organisation
working for children’s rights, and national authorities. UNICEF will see what changes the educational
reform in the country has brought about in your school in order to improve educational quality.
1. We would like to invite you to take part in a focus group discussion, if you agree. Your name
will not be asked for or recorded, therefore it won’t be mentioned in the report.
2. The focus group will take no more than 60 minutes.
3. If you do not wish to answer a question, you don’t have to and you can decide to leave the
focus group. In this case, we won’t be able to use the information you have provided.
4. There are no right or wrong answers – we are interested solely in your opinion.
5. You can ask your parent/teacher or the contact persons Natalia Mihaylova/Nurlan
Imangaliyev (see contacts below) about anything that is not clear.
If you would like to participate, you should tell the adult who gave you this letter that you agree and
write your initials down on this form. If you have any further questions regarding this study, please
contact us.
Thank you very much!

9.5.5. PROTOCOLS TO ENSURE SUBJECT’S SAFETY, PROTECTION OF SUBJECT’S
IDENTITY AND PROTECTION OF DATA
Protocol to ensure subject’s safety
Junction Bulgaria is a company which was selected by UNICEF Kazakhstan to conduct a ‘Formative
Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity’. The
objective of this assignment is to assess to what extent the state education programmes in Kazakhstan
have been contributing to the inclusion of children of different levels of ability, in order to produce
evidence-based recommendations for strengthening the education system.
The research team, which is properly trained in human subjects’ protection, will ensure the safety of all
participants through providing informed consent detailing the potential benefits and mitigation strategies
for any possible risks, as well as protecting the autonomy of people. This means that the do-no-harm
principle will be followed by maximising benefits and minimising risks for the research participants. They
will be treated in an ethical manner by respecting their decisions and protecting them from harm. Efforts
will be made to secure the well-being of participants while being involved in the research. Reasonable,
non-exploitative and well-thought out and considered procedures will be strictly followed and
administered fairly to each participant.
This researcher protocol is developed in view of including children as participants in this research and
paying special attention to potential victims of child abuse. The interview guide for children does not
include per se sensitive or harmful questions. However, if there are any questions, which would potentially
cause the child to disclose information regarding abuse, violence, neglect or similar occurrence or if the
child decides to disclose such information him/herself, researchers will follow this protocol. The steps,
which will be taken, are the following:
● If a child shows in some way (face gestures, way of talking, blushing, etc.) that he/she experiences
discomfort to talk on a specific topic, the interview could be stopped or any further questions on
the topic could be avoided, depending on the child’s wishes
● If a child discloses information regarding abuse, violence, neglect or similar occurrence, there
could be potential limits to confidentiality, meaning that the case could be reported, depending
on what has been disclosed according to the national legislation in Kazakhstan. If such a reporting
is necessary, the child’s name and other personal data may be disclosed, but the child will be
informed prior to that. In addition to this, the researcher(s) will inform the child on where to
receive help from relevant authorities and services.
If you have any questions about the research, or if problems arise, you may contact us.

Final Report
Protocol for protection of subjects’ identities
Junction Bulgaria is a company which was selected by UNICEF Kazakhstan to conduct a ‘Formative
Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity’. The
objective of this assignment is to assess to what extent the state education programmes in Kazakhstan
have been contributing to the inclusion of children of different levels of ability, in order to produce
evidence-based recommendations for strengthening the education system.
The research team will ensure that the evaluation does not collect identifying information such as
addresses, email addresses, etc. Whenever names are used, the evaluation will not link individual
responses with participants’ identities. Confidentiality of information will be strictly maintained, since only
the research team collecting/analysing data will have access to responses of individuals that could be
identified. The evaluation team will make every effort to prevent anyone outside of the research from
connecting individual participants with their responses. This will be done through password-protection of
all documents containing data, which will be kept in a separate location and access to the documents will
be restricted. Identifiable data will be encrypted.
Documentation and data such as consent forms, interview notes or reporting templates will be collected
by Junction Bulgaria which will retain them for a maximum period of 24 months from the date of receipt.
After that, the team will thoroughly dispose, destroy or delete study data and documents in accordance
with predetermined timeframes for storage and enquiries. The team will also follow clear guidelines on
transporting or transferring data such as encrypting electronic data, prohibit team members from taking
it home from work and will ensure that if data is moved, the storage device such as USB or hard drive is
password protected. Security codes will be assigned to computerised records.
If you have any questions about the research, or if problems arise, you may contact us.

have been contributing to the inclusion of children of different levels of ability, in order to produce
evidence-based recommendations for strengthening the education system.
The research team will ensure that data protection is ensured, since it is a part of the plan for data storage.
Confidentiality and anonymity will be assured by replacing names and other information with encoded
identifiers, with the encoding key kept in a different secure location. Research data in electronic/written
form will be protected from tampering, loss, theft or physical damage by limiting access to it, in order to
maintain its integrity. The team leaders will decide which team members are authorised to access and
manage stored data and it will be kept together in a safe, secure location away from public access.
For electronic data, unique user IDs and passwords will be used that cannot be easily guessed. Passwords
will be changed often to ensure that only current project members can access data, which will also be
done through a centralised process. Administrator access rights will be evaluated and limited. Outside
wireless devices will not be able to access the system’s network. Anti-virus protection will be kept updated
on every computer. The team will maintain up-to-date versions of all software and media storage devices.
A firewall and intrusion detection software will be used to monitor access for internet connected storage.
Encryption, electronic signatures, or watermarking will also be used to keep track of authorship and
changes made to data files. There will be regular back-up of electronic data files (both on and offsite) and
creation of protected copies. It will be ensured that data is properly destroyed. The team of Junction
Bulgaria will retain data for a maximum period of 24 months.
If you have any questions about the research, or if problems arise, you may contact us.

PRIORITIES
Table 11 Level of alignment to the World Declaration on Education for All
World Declaration on State Programmes for Development of Education - priorities Level of
Education for All - alignment175
priorities
Universalizing access and In all four state programmes there are priorities related to ensuring High
promoting equity equal access to the educational process in view of educational
resources, technologies, programs, quality pre-school education and
training, high-quality secondary education, as well as addressing the
gap between urban and rural schools, between regions, educational
institutions, and among students in terms of inclusive education.
Focusing on learning In most of the state programmes, the quality of education is the High
focus of efforts, including creating conditions for an effective
learning process in order to ensure the intellectual, spiritual, moral
and physical development of students. The analysis of one of the
topics, related to learning, is updating of the content of preschool
and secondary education and upbringing, which is included in the
2011–2020 state programme, while the rest three state programmes
have a gradually increasing focus on learning.
Broadening the means In terms of broadening the scope of basic education to meet the High
and scope of basic newly emerging needs of children in the changing context, all state
education education programmes are oriented towards new standards of
education, based on competitive approaches, development of new
educational content, through creation of humane educational
environment. Furthermore, there is a focus on assessing the
individual needs and achievements of students, thus determining
the individual trajectory of each student and taking into account
his/her individual abilities and increase their motivation to develop
skills. The country extended secondary education to 12 years of
schooling, updating the curriculum in the areas: artistic and
aesthetic, scientific and technical, environmental and biological,
tourist and local history, military-patriotic, socio-pedagogical,
educational and recreational, etc. at all levels to move away from the
knowledge-based paradigm and memorization to critical thinking
and problem-solving
Enhancing the In terms of enhancing the environment for learning, the state High
environment for learning education programmes are oriented towards providing a safe and
comfortable inclusive and modern learning environment to improve
the quality of education. Ensuring infrastructural development of
secondary education is also among the priorities of the programmes,
including development of material and technical base and digital
infrastructure of educational organizations. It is envisaged to equip
rural general education and "vulnerable" schools with teaching
materials, computer equipment and digital technology.

Final Report
Strengthening When it comes to strengthening partnerships, in some of the state Medium
partnerships programmes there is information regarding increasing the
participation of partners in the training of personnel for the
requirements of the economy, creation of modern colleges in
partnership with the business environment. In order to improve the
efficiency of communications and management at all levels of the
education system, the vertical management of the programme 2020-
2025 include optimisation through direct subordination of district
and city education departments to regional education departments.

in Education - priorities
Attitudinal changes and In terms of attitudinal changes and policy development, policy documents Low
policy development and reports point out the fact that public attitudes remain extremely
negative, and discrimination frequently leads to social and economic
exclusion both for the child and his or her family177. Furthermore, the
concept of disability in Kazakhstan, still heavily influenced by the traditional
Soviet concept of “defectology”, which focuses on a person’s particular
disability and trains practitioners as specialists in that single disability’s care
and correction moves from the "medical" to the "pedagogical" model,
etc.178
None of the state education programmes directly address the change in this
model and public attitude, except for the State Programmefor 2020-2025,
in which it is stated that the provision of public services in the field of special
and inclusive education will be optimized and automated, within which
information systems for health care and social protection will be integrated.
This will allow psychological-medical-pedagogical consultations to move
from the "medical" to the "pedagogical" model. The activities of the PMPK
will be aimed at determining the educational needs of children.
In addition, in 2015 a conceptual Approach to inclusive education was
developed by the National Academy of Education, with proposed
amendments to the terminology used in relation to children with special
needs in order to de-stigmatize disability and accelerate the development
of inclusive education. Therefore, a new definition on inclusive education
was introduced enlarging the definition, meaning that children with SEN are
not only children with disabilities and there was a change in the medical
approach.
Ensuring inclusion When it comes to ensuring inclusion through early childhood care and Medium
through early childhood education, in the 2011-2020 and 2016-2019 state education programmes
care and education systematic problems in ECD and early intervention have been identified,
including an increase in the number of children on the pre-school waiting
list and shortage of school places caused by demographic processes. It is
highlighted that it is necessary to achieve full coverage of children with
preschool education and upbringing and ensure equal access of children to
various programmesto prepare them for school. Additionally, in the State
Programmefor 2020 - 2025 it is stated that only 20% of kindergartens, 60%
of schools, 30% of colleges have created conditions for inclusive education.
142
Formative Evaluation of the State Programmes for Development of Education with the Focus on Inclusivity
Final Report
Therefore, it is necessary to increase the network of preschool
organisation, place a state educational order for preschool education and
training of children.
Inclusive curricula State Programmefor 2011–2020 outlines the major bottlenecks and among Medium
them is: outdated methodology and guidelines for the selection of
educational content. The programme 2016 – 2019 confirms that the quality
of services provided by preschool organizations is still at an insufficient
level.
The updating of the content of curriculums is the focus of some of the state
programmes in view of learning, like in the 2011 and 2016 state education
programmes in view of updating of the content of preschool and secondary
education and upbringing. At the same time there is no actions towards
transition and articulation of the curriculum between early childhood,
primary and secondary education.
Teachers and teacher When it comes to teachers and teacher education, in 2011 a key aim is state High
education support for training highly qualified staff for education sector, stimulating
teacher development. In 2016 the State Programmesets forward aims for
an advanced training system, since it is stated that a qualitative update of
teacher professional development programmesis needed. Additionally, in
the same programme it is pointed out that Kazakh teachers will take part in
TALIS research, the results of which will develop recommendations for
improving the quality of the country's teaching. In the 2020 programme it
is also stated that the qualification requirements for teachers working in
the context of inclusive education (subject teachers, teachers, teaching
assistants and others) will be updated based on the professional standard
and conditions of teachers’ work would be improved.
Resources and legislation In 2007, the introduced Law on Education states that all citizens have the High
right to free preschool, elementary, general secondary, and vocational
education, as well as free higher education on a competitive basis,
regardless of one’s gender, ethnicity, social and economic status, language,
religion, health status and other individual characteristics. In 2015 the
conceptual approach to inclusive education was developed proposing
amendments to the terminology used in relation to children with special
needs in order to de-stigmatize disability and accelerate the development
of inclusive education. In 2021, an amendment to the legislation in view of
inclusive education was adopted establishing a universal approach to
children with disabilities by including them in the educational environment
through the implementation of programmesof PMPCs and consultation.
Each of the programmes has set forward resources for its implementation
and the analysis shows that these resources are increasing with each
programme. It should be noted that there is a focus on allocating resources
for teacher development as well as school environment and infrastructure.

infrastructural development of secondary education
will be ensured. Additionally, the increasing of the
network of preschool organizations is still an output set
forward to be achieved, taking into account the
demographic situation. In the national project set
forward in 2021 it is stated that there will be
interventions towards reducing the gap in the quality of
education between regions, urban and rural schools, as
well towards modernization of schools in small towns,
district centres and villages (major and current repairs,
libraries, canteens, furniture, security).
It should be noted that removing barriers should be
focused on information access and communication, as
well as work with attitudes, while such actions have not
been identified and there is a primary focus on physical
access.

will be increased in schools. In 2016, it is mentioned
that there is consulting support for parents, as well as a
mechanism for remote training of parents on the care
of children of preschool age. Additionally, in the 2020

transition.
This issue is commented in the State Programme of
2016-2019 in terms of the share of educational
organizations that have created conditions for their
upbringing and education being only 9.1%, which
means that the inclusion of preschool children with
special educational developmental needs in the
educational environment remains a relevant challenge.
Additionally, it is pointed out that there is a shortage of
qualified specialists - defectologists181, speech
therapists and psychologists. In the 2021 national
project it is pointed out that there will be an expansion
of the PMPC network, taking into account the needs of
the region and in accordance with modern
requirements and standards. However, the barriers
created by the PMPCs towards inclusion of children
with disabilities in mainstream education, are not
explicitly targeted with the expansion of the network of
such consultations.
Ensuring access to and In terms of ensuring access to and availability of Medium

be provided with a set of computer hardware and
software. In the 2016 programme, it is mentioned that
there are interdisciplinary and project activities, use of
information and communication technologies (ICT),
integration of students with special needs. Also,
textbooks and teaching materials in embossed font for
blind children (Braille) and large font for visually
impaired children have been introduced. Additionally,
in the 2020 programme, it is planned to gradually
introduce online learning with elements of proctoring
and distance technologies with the development of

mechanisms for their quality assurance, as well as to
develop a mechanism to support educational
organisations with low performance and socially
vulnerable categories of students. Educational
organizations will provide conditions for students with
SEN (equipping with special equipment, furniture,
personnel, textbooks and educational and
methodological complexes, ramps, lifts, elevators,
etc.). In the 2021 national project it is indicated that a
digital teacher project for children from socially
vulnerable families will be implemented and schools
will be equipped with subject rooms for physics,
chemistry, biology and STEM education. Comfortable
conditions for students in secondary education
institutions will be created, including the provision of
drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene. However,
there is no further specific indication regarding
introduction of resources for children with disabilities
at schools, apart from supporting their education at
home.
Creating inclusive learning In terms of creating inclusive learning environments, Low
environments in which children data shows that only a small percentage of school-aged
learn together, and which enable children with disabilities in Kazakhstan get a quality,
children with disabilities to inclusive education in a mainstream school. The
acquire the core academic majority of children with disabilities are educated at
curriculum and basic cognitive home, isolated from their peers with visits from
skills, together with essential life teachers only a few times a week or month; segregated
skills. in special classrooms in mainstream schools; or attend
special schools for children with disabilities, which can
be located far from their families and communities.
Children with disabilities living in psychiatric-
neurological institutions receive very little or no
education at all.182
In the State Programme2011-2020 it is stated that
special and inclusive education classrooms will be
created with favourable conditions for ensuring equal
access to teaching and upbringing of disabled children
(ensuring availability of teachers, defectologists,
psychological-pedagogical accompaniment of children,
and special individual technical and compensatory
facilities). Additionally, special kindergartens have been
envisioned in different regions in the country. In the
state programme from 2016 it is indicated that
accompanying children with SEN in an inclusive
environment will be provided, but it is unclear what are
the aspects of creation of an inclusive environment and
to what degree this would allow for children to work
together.

renewed in order to form competitive advantages of an
individual in creative activity, continuous education and
vocational self-determination. In the 2016 state
programme it is set out that the content of preschool
and secondary education will be updated. According to
the National project 2021-2025 there will be a
placement of a state educational order for special
psychological and pedagogical support for children with
developmental disabilities, as well as amendments to
the state compulsory standard for preschool education
and training, model curricula and programs. Schools
will be provided with a comfortable, safe, and modern
educational environment. At the same time, new
pedagogical approaches like the child-centred and
holistic approach have not been mentioned in the
programmes.

teachers organizers for related professions will be

stimulating labour of teachers, training of highly
qualified staff. In the 2016 programme it is stated that
there is a need for teachers with special education and
methodological support. It is also pointed out that in
the light of new approaches, the areas of professional
competence of teachers are expanding. These are
interdisciplinary and project activities, the use of ICT in
teaching and management, the integration of students
with SEN and consulting support for parents. In the
2020 state programme is also emphasized on the
improvement of working conditions of teachers to
strengthen their motivation to improve the quality of
education and upbringing, as well as modernization of
teacher education, the system of entry into the
profession and continuous professional development

2020 programme, it is pointed out that an updated

and educational organizations based on best practices
will be implemented.
In terms of sensitivity to the situation of children with
disabilities in view of their language and culture, it can
be seen in the programme of 2011 that a new system
of continuous learning of the Kazakh language
“kindergarten– school, vocational lyceum, college –
higher educational institution” will be created which
will allow every Kazakhstani citizen to acquire the state
language in full. Special attention is given to the
development of the Kazakh language through learning
centers, language courses.
In general, there are systems for monitoring and
assessment and focus on learning the Kazakh language,
but it is unclear whether these policies are targeted
toward children with disabilities in particular.

Ensuring access All state programmeshighlight their commitment to ensuring accessible and High
and equity in equitable education. Thus, one of the claimed goals of the Programme2011-
education 2020 is to ensure equal access of all participants in the educational process to
educational services, resources and technologies. The share of schools that
have created conditions for inclusive education should be 70% by 2020.
Among the objectives of the Programmeis also the provision of equal access
for children to preschool education programs.
The 2016-2019 Programmestipulated that the accessibility of quality and
equitable education for all is implemented at all levels of education. By 2019,
the Programmesets the goal of reaching 40% of TVET and 100% of universities
that would have created equal conditions and barrier-free access for teaching
students with special educational needs. The 2020-2025 programmefurther
reinforces reaching the target of 100% of schools that have created conditions
for inclusive education by 2025.
Furthermore, among the key objectives of the National Project 2025 are
ensuring the accessibility and quality of pre-school education and improving
the quality of secondary education, namely reducing the gap in the quality of
education between regions, urban and rural schools in Kazakhstan (PISA).
Creating The 2011-2020 programmeset the task of creating conditions for lifelong Medium
favourable learning by 2020, regardless of learners’ age, level of education and
conditions and professional qualifications. Also, the Programmesets the target to cover 70%
environment for of schools that have created conditions for inclusive education by 2020. The
learning 2020-2025 programmefurther reinforces the target of achieving 100% of
schools that have created conditions for inclusive education by 2025.
Objective 3 of the National Project 2025 is to provide schools with a
comfortable, safe and modern educational environment. Although most state
education programmesset the target of creating conditions for inclusive
education, there is no explanation of what these conditions are.

Improving the Enhancing the quality of education is one of the objectives of the High
quality of Programme2011-2020. This programmealso emphasises that the quality of
education education is primarily dependent on well-trained teachers. In this regard,
measures would be taken to raise the status of the teaching profession and
improve the professional training of teachers. Furthermore, the aim of the
2016-2019 Programmeis to ensure equal access to high-quality preschool
education. For this, a complete transition of schools at the level of secondary
education to the updated content of education based on the experience of NIS
schools is envisaged.
This discourse is continued in later programmesas well. One of the objectives
of the 2020-2025 Programmeis to reduce the gap in the quality of education
between urban and rural schools, regions, educational institutions, and
students. Improving the quality of education for students at all levels of
education is the main goal of the National Project 2025 as well. The objectives
are to improve the quality of secondary education by reducing the gap in the
quality of education between regions, urban and rural schools in Kazakhstan
(PISA), as well as providing affordable and high-quality technical and
vocational education.
Improving the In terms of education management and financing, there has been a major Medium
efficiency of course to transition to per capita funding. One of the goals of the 2011-2020
education Programmeis to improve the financing system, focused on ensuring equal
management and access to educational services. In particular, the Programmeindicates that in
financing 2011 a methodology for per capita normative financing will be developed,
which will improve the efficiency of budget expenditures and will help increase
the availability of quality education for different segments of the population.
The 2019-2019 programmestates that in 2019 the process of introducing per
capita funding in all city schools will be completed following a positive test.
Programme2020-2025 also continues to follow the course of improvement of
per capita financing.

human capital for competitive human capital for the economic well-being of the country. Among
the digital the tasks are the development of digital educational resources for
economy organisations of secondary, technical and vocational education. Similarly, the
key goal of the 2016-2019 Programmeis the development of human capital for
sustainable economic growth, however, the digital economy as such is not
mentioned. The 2020-2025 programmeforesees the continuation of work on
the development of the digital infrastructure of educational organisations. As
part of the World Bank's Secondary Education Modernization project, over
5,000 schools will be provided with laptops and printers. More than 2,500
schools with no internet connection or low connection speed will receive
1,200 data centres. Furthermore, the National Project 2025 has planned
activities for the period 2022-2025: Implementation of the Digital Teacher
project for children from socially vulnerable families. The state education
programmesoften do not directly link their desirable outcomes to digital
economy accommodation, yet they outline efforts to develop digital skills
among learners.

EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES
Table 19 Management and coordination
Area How are the processes managed and coordinated?
Policy The educational policy, incl. inclusive education, is planned at the national level. As it was
development mentioned in the Coherence part, the main responsibility is of the MoE, although the
programmes point out work in coordination with all other engaged ministries. Two are the
main institutions at the national level, related to inclusive education - National Scientific and
Practical Centre for the Development of Special and Inclusive Education and National
academy of education named after Y. Altynsarin. Their tasks are related to developing
methodologies, training specialists, developing programmesand support for the local level
where the implementation of the policy is realised.
Referral The main entrance towards inclusion in the educational system is PMPC. They are subordinate
mechanism of the MoES and local educational departments. PMPCs make the assessment of a child’s
towards development and provide recommendations to parents whether the child should be in an
services inclusive group in a general school, in a special group in a general school or in a special school,
home-schooled, in a PPCR, etc. The PMPCs collaborate with primary health centres, local
educational departments, schools, kindergartens, RCs. Children can be referred to from public
institutions, child protection, parents, GPs, etc. and PMPCs don’t have an outreach
mechanism. Only children with some learning difficulties and needs can be referred to the
PMPCs.
Work with The work with different groups is realised at general schools, special schools, special classes
different and groups, special kindergartens or in home-schooling. The first stage of working with
groups of children is the needs assessment and the approach is rather needs-oriented instead of rights-
children at risk oriented, since the system is interested rather in the share of those who created conditions
of exclusion for inclusive education and the number of included children, instead of those who still aren’t
from the included. There is an individual programmeonly for children with learning difficulties and
educational disabilities, while the social pedagogue works with the other groups additionally at the school.
system This programmeis based on the recommendations of PMPC, but additional analysis and
evaluation is made by correctional rooms and schools, as shared by stakeholders during the
KIIs. However, the individual programmeis rather based on educational and learning goals,
instead of the development of the child. The parents are not involved in the development of
the program. Different professionals work with the children – general teachers and
specialists, implementing the program. “Collaboration is essential to strengthen links between
PMPC, correctional rooms and schools in implementing and monitoring individual
development plans for children, supporting inclusion and early intervention.”188
Data collection At a national level data is collected in the National Education Database, which is not publicly
accessible. Stakeholders express the idea of integrated work between the sectors through the
introduction of a shared database between the different institutions in the educational,
health and social sector. Statistical data on children with SEN are kept at the same time by
the Ministry of Enlightenment, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labor and Social
Protection. ‘’The data provided by different departments varies significantly, which questions
their completeness and accuracy. Consequently, there are no unified approaches in the
measures taken to support people with SEN.’’189
Monitoring and The indicators set in the programmesare followed up in the national reports in terms of
evaluation education. They are public but can be found for the period after 2015. There is a lot of
information in the reports, but it is often presented in a different way, related to the changing

concepts and priorities over the years, so they are not consistent enough to monitor all
changes like for number of children for specialised groups in regular schools, number of
home-schooled children, etc. In view of monitoring, there aren’t institutions that follows up
on the data or certain mechanism for collaboration between the sectors or even within them.
Such a monitoring framework has been made, but is not reflected in the strategic documents,
since it’s not approved. In this framework it is indicated that there isn’t monitoring and
evaluation of the quality of inclusive education.
