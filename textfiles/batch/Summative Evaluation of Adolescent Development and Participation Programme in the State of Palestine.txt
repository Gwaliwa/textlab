Principles and institutions to be answerable for their decisions and actions, ensuring transparency in
decision-making, following established rules and procedures, being accountable to
stakeholders, monitoring and reporting performance, and taking corrective action when
necessary. Accountability is a vital component of good governance and promotes trust and
sustainable development.1
Adolescents Adolescents with disabilities, special needs, and those who have dropped out of school for
various reasons.
Child Protection UNICEF uses the term ‘child protection’ to refer to prevention and response to violence,
exploitation, and abuse of children in all contexts. This includes reaching children who are
especially vulnerable to these threats, such as those living without family care, on the
streets or in situations of conflict or natural disasters.2
Civil Society A CSO is any non-profit, voluntary citizens’ group which is organized on a local, national,
Organisation or international level.3

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) State of Palestine (SoP) office commissioned a Summative
Evaluation of the UNICEF-supported Adolescent Development and Participation (ADAP or the
Programme). ADAP is uniquely composed of 21 individual projects that focused on adolescent education, skills
development, and child protection (CP). The Programme’s goal was to provide Palestinian adolescents,
particularly the most vulnerable, with access to secure, high-quality, and inclusive learning opportunities and to
invest in their life skills and employability though the education sector.
Chapter 1 - Intervention Context and Object of
Evaluation: Adolescents (between 10-19 years) constitute
22.3 per cent17 of the population in the SoP and face
challenges related to education access and quality, as well
as protection risks that have been worsened by the prolonged
humanitarian crisis and COVID-19. Adolescents (aged 15-
24) face high unemployment rates (41 per cent),18 especially
girls, due to a volatile economy, decrease in public and
private capacity to provide job opportunities, and an outdated
education system. Additionally, around 90 per cent19 of
children aged 1-14 years faced violent discipline at home.
Consequently, 320,439 children reportedly required
protection and psychosocial support.
The object of this evaluation is the ADAP Programme which
was a part of UNICEF’s Area Programme Document (APD)
(2018-2022) and included 21 projects. The Programme
focused on training and creating awareness on life skills and
citizenship education (LSCE), non-violence and positive
discipline. The implementation included a hybrid approach where the key public sector partners, i.e., the Ministry
of Education (MoE) and Ministry of Social Development (MoSD) were supported by 11 implementing partners
(IP) in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. The total budget was 18.12 million shekels, including
53,200 shekels for supplies.
Chapter 2 - Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Scope: This is a Summative Evaluation with the primary
purpose of demonstrating accountability by objectively assessing the Programme’s achievements against
intended results. The secondary purpose was to identify challenges, lessons learnt, and recommendations for
future programming. The evaluation target audience included UNICEF, MoE and MoSD, IPs, UN agencies,
donors, and beneficiaries. The evaluation scope covered 21 projects implemented in six governorates (Gaza
City, Deir Al Balah, Khan Yunis, Hebron, Ramallah, and Nablus) of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank between
2018 and 2021. The evaluation excluded the assessment of UNICEF’s role in the Education Cluster
Coordination and other education and CP interventions.
Chapter 3 - Evaluation Criteria, Design, Methodology, and Limitations: The evaluation followed the
established Organisation of Economic Cooperation-Development Development Assistance Committee (OECD-
DAC)20 criteria, including relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability. The evaluation also
focused on humanitarian action criteria (coverage, coherence, and connectedness) and UNICEF’s cross-cutting
priorities, including gender equality, equity, child rights, and accountability.
In line with the evaluation purpose, the evaluation employed two approaches, theory-based and participatory.
The participatory approach ensured the engagement of all key stakeholders throughout the evaluation process,
from planning to dissemination. The theory-based approach was employed to assess the Theory of Change
(ToC) for its completeness and validity. The evaluation used a mixed-methods approach, utilising both
secondary (for quantitative data) and primary data collection methods (for qualitative data). Primary data was
collected by conducting 37 key informant interviews (KII), 31 focus group discussions (FGD) and a validation
workshop. Secondary data was collected through desk review of 189 documents. The evaluation team reached
out to 279 individuals, with over 50 per cent being females and girls (i.e., 153), including public sector officials,
UNICEF and IP staff, parents and caregivers, school staff, and adolescent boys and girls.

The evaluation team faced delays due to the absence of the beneficiary list and teacher strikes in the West
Bank. Therefore, the approach for FGD implementation was modified, and sessions were conducted both
virtually and in-person to obtain the perspectives of the most important stakeholder – adolescent boys and girls.
Additionally, there were gaps in the data, including limited secondary data to map the Programme's
achievements for CP interventions and the absence of an impact statement in the ToC and Results Framework,
which constrained effectiveness and impact assessment.
Chapter 4 - Evaluation Findings: Findings for each evaluation criteria are given below:
Relevance: The evaluation findings indicated that the ADAP Programme demonstrated relevance through its
inclusive design process, involving consultations with key stakeholders such as the MoE, MoSD, civil society
organizations (CSO), and UN agencies. These consultations enabled the identification of stakeholders’ priorities
and needs. Additionally, the Programme effectively utilised insights from secondary assessments to inform its
interventions and adapt to the national and local contexts. However, the evaluation findings also suggested a
notable gap in the direct engagement of adolescents during the design phase. The Programme missed the
opportunity to involve adolescents, which could have provided valuable perspectives for designing the
Programme interventions.
Efficiency: The evaluation team faced challenges in conducting an efficiency assessment due to limited
progress data for the CP component (Output 2.3).21 The available secondary data for the education component
(2018-2021) indicated that the Programme achieved 76 per cent of its outputs while utilising only 68 per cent of
the allocated funds which indicates cost efficiency. While the team acknowledges this achievement, they were
unable to identify the factors that contributed to the cost savings. It is possible that the savings were due to
over-budgeting or the shift from in-person to remote interventions during and after the pandemic. On time
efficiency, the Programme faced some delays due to various factors, including school closures resulting from
the COVID-19 pandemic, weak infrastructure to support remote teaching and learning, and teacher strikes.
The evaluation team found that UNICEF had financial tracking systems in place to monitor and report inter-
agency and donor investments, but the limited evidence prevented assessment of whether the system facilitated
timely course correction and adaptive management, resulting in cost and time savings.
Effectiveness: Based on the available secondary data (Result Assessment Module (RAM) Report 2018-2022),
the evaluation findings indicated that the Programme was largely effective for achieving outcome targets (only
for the education component). The Programme achieved all three outcome indicators, but progress information
for the CP component was not tracked in the RAM reports and therefore could not be assessed. Despite
significant challenges such as COVID-19, ongoing security concerns, and frequent teachers strikes, the
Programme achieved the education outcomes. Key factors contributing to this success included alignment of
the ADAP Programme with national priorities, the use of a hybrid implementation model (involving IPs and the
public sector), and the use of innovative and remote learning methods.
The monitoring system exhibited some gaps, such as: disconnect between the indicators and targets of the IPs
and the UNICEF ADAP results frameworks; lack of impact indicators; limitations of outcome indicators to assess
quality/changes in the lives of beneficiaries; and insufficient evidence to show that monitoring data informed
decision-making. A more focused approach will enable creating a usable and effective monitoring system for
future programmes.
Impact: Due to the absence of impact statements and indicators, the evaluation was limited in measuring the
Programme’s impact. As such, the evaluation team explored perceived changes in impact levels among
implementers and beneficiaries. Most of the beneficiaries perceived the interventions to have contributed
positively, including acquiring new skills and knowledge, increasing self-confidence, improving communication,
reducing violent behaviours, and experiencing a positive shift in disciplinary practices within communities and
schools. Nonetheless, it was unclear to what extent these improvements resulted in job opportunities or created
long-term behavioural changes in adolescents. The respondents also pointed out unintended impacts such as
overburdened students and teachers due to poor scheduling of school-based activities timed with exams and
adolescents becoming addicted to games due to the promotion of game-based learning.
Sustainability: The evaluation findings indicated that some of the ADAP results such as the integration of LSCE
into the Palestinian education system are expected to be fully sustained. Others, including the National Youth
Volunteer Services Programme (NYVSP), knowledge and skill development of adolescents, and the reduction
of violence in schools and homes, are only partially likely to be sustained. This is due to limited focus on
transitioning learning into earning and short-term nature of CP interventions, raising concerns about their
21 Output 2.3: More parents, teachers, adolescents, and other stakeholders have increased knowledge and skills to eliminate harmful practices and better protect children
(aged 0-18) from violence, exploitation, and grave violations.

sustainability. Additionally, limited community involvement and external challenges (such as the Israeli
occupation, Palestinians’ internal political divisions, and limited budgets for ministries) indicate continued
technical and financial support are likely to be needed to sustain the Programme results.
Coverage: The findings indicated that the Programme was largely successful in targeting most vulnerable
areas, however gaps were identified particularly in addressing gender-specific vulnerabilities of male
adolescents and those residing in Area C. The absence of consultations with adolescents during the design of
ADAP interventions underscored the need for increased engagement with the target group.
Coherence: The evaluation found that the ADAP Programme’s objectives and strategies were consistent with
national policies for adolescent education and CP. These policies included the Education Sector Strategic Plan
(2020), National Youth Strategy in State of Palestine (2020), National Policy Agenda (2017-2022), and National
Intersectoral Violence Against Children Strategy in the Context of COVID-19 (2021-2023). Moreover, the
Programme’s interventions were found to be in line with UNICEF’s Global Adolescent Programming Guidelines
(2018). The evaluation also found that both the design and implementation of the Programme are largely
consistent with the humanitarian principles – humanity, impartiality, and neutrality. However, due to Israeli
occupation, not all communities in Area C were accessible which may have compromised the principle of
independence.
There was insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of external coordination with other actors to avoid
duplication and gaps. This was attributed to the absence of a formal coordination mechanism and limited
attention to ADAP by relevant public institutions.
Connectedness: The evaluation findings indicated that the ADAP Programme effectively utilised internal
synergies within UNICEF, specifically in the areas of CP, Health, Nutrition, Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene
(WASH), and Social and Behaviour Change (SBC) interventions. The CP Programme played a critical role in
supporting education and adolescent outcomes, enabling the transfer of knowledge and skills to eliminate
harmful practices and enhance CP in schools. The Health and WASH Sections collaborated with the ADAP
Programme to address the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing hygiene kits, training, and
cleaning materials to schools. The SBC Section provided cross-cutting support by conducting awareness
sessions on non-violent discipline techniques and positive parenting. Furthermore, Programme interventions
contributed to multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG:4 (Quality Education), SDG:5
(Gender Equality), SDG:8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG:10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG:16
(Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).
UNICEF Cross Cutting
Gender Equality: The findings suggested that the ADAP Programme took into account gender and cultural
factors, evidenced by providing separate training sessions and gender-specific skills training. However, the
Programme design did not adequately address gender-specific determinants and conditions, such as higher
school dropout rates for boys and their increased vulnerability to violence compared than girls. Furthermore,
only one outcome indicator and one output indicator included gender-disaggregated targets. While the
Programme reached a balanced number of boys and girls, there was limited reporting on results. Therefore, the
evaluation found the ADAP Programme partially aligned with gender equality principles.
Alignment with UNICEF’s Equity Agenda: The evaluation findings suggested that the ADAP Programme was
partially aligned with UNICEF’s Equity Agenda. While the Programme prioritised identifying vulnerable groups
through the Common Country Analysis (CCA) (2016), the Results Framework did not include specific targets
for these groups and did not define a vulnerability criterion. The implementation focused on vulnerable groups,
including adolescents with disabilities and those who were out-of-school (OOS). However, reporting did not
include data on equity parameters, such as results achieved for vulnerable groups, disability status, or location.
Child Rights and Accountability: The evaluation findings indicated that the Programme was aligned with the
Convention on the Rights of the Children (CRC) principles of non-discrimination, best interests of the child, right
to life, survival, and development, and views of the child. However, there was little to no involvement of
adolescents in the Programme’s design. A dedicated feedback mechanism was implemented, but beneficiaries
were unaware of it, and there was no evidence of how the Programme addressed the complaints and feedback.
Chapter 5 – Conclusions, Lessons Learnt and Recommendations
Conclusion on Way Forward: Moving forward, the evaluation underlines the need for sustained focus on
adolescents by all stakeholders (public sector, private entities, development partners and others). Policy
interventions such as integration of LSCE and NYVSP are foundational and require continuous strategic and
operational support for sustainable outcomes. The hybrid implementation model (involving public, private and
CSO actors) has proven effective, particularly in facilitating the transition to remote teaching and learning, and
iii
thus merits continuity. Increased advocacy and engagement with the public sector should promote acceptance
of private and CSOs’ involvement for niche interventions, where these partners offer unique capacities and
advantages.
Future engagement with adolescents should underpin regular interaction with them to understand their
challenges, aspirations, and potential pathways. Education interventions should emphasize infrastructure
development and systemic capacities for remote/technology-based teaching and learning. This is critical to pre-
empt any future disruptions (like COVID-19 and security challenges) and for engaging learning experiences.
Skill-building interventions must strike a balance between focus on pre-training, during training and post-training
focus. The evaluation underscores the need for medium to long-term interventions for behaviour change, such
as violence reduction and positive parenting. These require sustained messaging and community engagement
for sustainability. Lastly, the next phase should prioritise an effective monitoring system for results tracking and
evidence-based decision-making.
Lessons Learnt: Key lessons and good practices are outlined below:
• The Programme’s design and implementation were underpinned by innovative approaches. One notable
innovation was the use of gamification for promoting learning, particularly in LSCE. This innovative
approach proved to be an effective practice, leading to tangible outcomes in increased critical thinking and
problem-solving skills among adolescents. The effectiveness of the gamification strategy also provides
valuable insights for its potential application across different sectors and contexts.
• The ADAP Programme (Education & Adolescents component) primarily focused on providing pre/during
training support to adolescents. However, the post-training support aimed at fostering and improving the
broader ecosystem for job creation and entrepreneurship was not addressed. Consequently, due to this
gap, there is insufficient evidence to showcase the transition from learning to earning. This learning points
out a potential design deficiency, underlining the need to balance pre/during training and post-training
support, including access to capital financing, job placements, market access, and self-employment. This
learning is applicable across all contexts, especially in regions where the infrastructure for job placements
and entrepreneurship is less developed.
• The ADAP Programme (CP component) support for behaviour change interventions (non-violent
behaviours and positive parenting) had a short lifespan (six months to a year) and lacked a consistent
approach to community engagement. Considering global evidence and feedback from participants, the
lesson learnt is to plan behaviour change interventions with a medium to long-term lifecycle approach (2
years or more). Moreover, these should be centred around community engagement interventions —
organising and mobilising local youth groups, religious and community leaders, to enable messaging
through such platforms for sustainable results. This lesson is applicable across sectors aiming for
behavioural and normative changes, and contexts, where local platforms or groups are either readily
available or could be mobilised for sustained messaging and localised accountabilities.
Recommendations: Find below evaluation recommendations drawn from findings and conclusions. The
recommendations have been improved based on the feedback received from the evaluation users:
Recommendation 1: Keeping in view the APD 2023-25 priorities for adolescent boys and girls, UNICEF
SoP is advised to draft an ADAP Results Framework and ToC for future guidance to develop
projects/interventions and tracking of results.
• Action # 1: Draft the ADAP Results Framework and ToC. The Results Framework must include impact
statement and indicators, segregated outcomes and outputs, dedicated strategies, and underline allocation
of resources for disadvantaged groups (adolescents in Area C, adolescent girls and boys, adolescents with
disabilities, and OOS adolescents). (Primary Responsibility: UNICEF)
• Action # 2: The Results Framework and ToC should be endorsed by the MoE in a high-level event. The
Results Framework and ToC can guide future engagement with relevant public sector partners. (Primary
Responsibility: UNICEF and MoE)
Recommendation 2: Based on the learning from the previous ADAP phase, the future ADAP strategies
and interventions merit a re-think and recalibration to offer better fit with the local context and achieve
improved results for the vulnerable groups.
• Action # 1: Within the Education & Adolescents component, the skills development interventions must
strike balance between pre/during training and post post-training support such as access to finance, market
linkages, access to employers, and business associations. (Primary Responsibility: UNICEF, Secondary
Responsibility: MoE)
• Action # 2: Establish clear vulnerability criteria to ensure the systematic inclusion of vulnerable groups in
its programming. This criterion should include various aspects, including location, age, gender, disability
status, etc. Specific strategies should be developed and implemented to address the unique needs of these
iv
vulnerable groups, such as providing tailored support and accommodations for disabled adolescents during
trainings. (Primary Responsibility: UNICEF)
Recommendation 3: The future ADAP implementation should focus on building public sector capacities
to deliver inclusive education and fostering opportunities for job promotion and skill development for
adolescents.
• Action # 1: Place added focus on building the capacity of the public sector in remote teaching and learning
to ensure uninterrupted education for adolescents. This is critical given the potential risk of future disruptions
in teaching and learning activities due to the unique security environment. (Primary Responsibility: MoE,
Secondary Responsibility: UNICEF)
• Action # 2: UNICEF should leverage its existing efforts by advocating with the MoE to integrate the
remaining elements of LSCE into the national education curriculum. This should also entail supporting the
MoE to train teachers to deliver the LSCE appropriately. (Primary Responsibility: UNICEF, Secondary
Responsibility: MoE)
• Action # 3: Advocate for and provide support to operationalise the NYVSP. This platform can play a crucial
role in promoting job creation by connecting adolescents with the private sector and CSO partners. (Primary
Responsibility: UNICEF, Secondary Responsibility: MoE)
Recommendation 4: For improved sustainability of ADAP interventions and results, the CP
interventions design and duration need a careful re-thinking and longer duration.
• Action # 1: Engage directly with the adolescent boys and girls, parents, school staff and community leaders
for future Programme design to understand and incorporate their opinions and aspirations (in terms of
differential needs, underlying causes, implications for adolescent boys and girls, and available local
strategies) into the design to make interventions and results more sustainable. (Primary Responsibility:
UNICEF, Secondary Responsibility: MoE)
• Action # 2: Advocate with key donors for longer-term interventions (three years or more) to support
behaviour change around positive parenting, non-violent behaviours, and other areas. Form longer-term
partnerships with public sector and IPs to implement and assess progress towards impact. (Primary
Responsibility: UNICEF)
• Action # 3: Emphasize community engagement in the implementation of behaviour change interventions
to foster community ownership and create platforms for sustained messaging and localized actions. This
may involve forming and supporting community groups, including adolescents, to implement and monitor
local actions. (Primary Responsibility: UNICEF, Secondary Responsibility: MoSD and MoE)
Recommendation 5: The ADAP monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system merits reconfiguration to
effectively track progress and use data/evidence for decision making and adaptive programming.
• Action # 1: The ADAP Results Framework should guide the formulation of ADAP M&E Plan. The M&E
indicators should be framed in a manner that enables tracking of both qualitative and quantitative changes
in the lives of adolescents, such as quality of education, adolescents' satisfaction, learning outcomes, and
changes in behaviour or attitudes. The findings should be used to inform programme planning,
implementation, and decision-making. (Primary Responsibility: UNICEF, Secondary Responsibility: IPs
and MoE)
• Action # 2: Regularly review and assess the logic of the Results Framework and ToC in consultation with
the MoE and IPs. Use monitoring data (received mid-year and annual reports) and other insights to re-
assess and recalibrate the Results Framework and ToC (if needed). (Primary Responsibility: UNICEF,
Secondary Responsibility: IPs and MoE)
• Action # 3: Undertake pre-implementation assessments and baselines, where appropriate, to inform design
improvements. Data collection must include regular interaction and seeking inputs from adolescents and
community groups to keep track of how interventions are affecting them and if/what design and
implementation recalibrations are needed. (Primary Responsibility: UNICEF, Secondary
Responsibility: IPs and MoE)
• Action # 4: Organise regular internal/external reviews to track progress (including financial data) and use
data and insights for adaptive programming/decision making. Drawing cost efficiency analysis and costs
comparisons can enable prioritizing strategies and interventions that are more time/cost efficient. (Primary
Responsibility: UNICEF, Secondary Responsibility: IPs and MoE)
• Action # 5: Collect and analyse data across programming priorities such as gender location, age,
adolescents with disabilities, and OOS adolescents. Utilise this data to inform the Programme re-design to
prioritise investments and interventions to meet the needs of these groups. (Primary Responsibility:
UNICEF, Secondary Responsibility: IPs and MoE)

CONTEXT AND
OBJECT OF THE
EVALUATION

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION, CONTEXT AND OBJECT OF THE EVALUATION
This is the summative evaluation report of the Adolescent Development and Participation
Programme (referred to as ADAP or the Programme in this report). ADAP was a part of UNICEF
SoP’s 2018-2022 APD, with a focus on education, skill development and promotion of non-violent
behaviour in Palestinian adolescents, particularly the most vulnerable. The Programme was
implemented in partnership with the MoE, MoSD, and 11 IPs in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
AAN Associates22 conducted the evaluation from September 2022 to July 2023, covering 21
projects implemented from 2018-2021. These projects primarily focused on providing adolescents
with LSCE, entrepreneurial skills and promoting non-violent behaviour. The evaluation complied
with the expectations and scope outlined in the Terms of Reference (ToR), attached as Appendix
1. The report includes five chapters (refer to Figure 1), with several appendices and adheres to
UNICEF’s Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS) guidelines.23
Figure 1: Structure of the Report
1.1 Intervention Context
This section offers a brief overview of the national context for education, unemployment, and CP,
highlighting the needs of the Palestinian adolescents. Refer to Appendix 2 for a more detailed
analysis, including the underlying causes of unemployment and violence in the SoP.

Country and Sectoral Context: The SoP, located Figure 2: Overview of Demographics
in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region,
has an estimated total population of 5.3 million (as
of 2022).24 The adolescent and youth cohort of 10-
19 years comprises 22.4 per cent25 of the
population, which amounts to 1.2 million (refer to
Figure 2 for more details on the demographics).26
This presents a demographic opportunity for an
increased working-age population and accelerated
economic growth in the country. However, the
protracted crisis in the SoP has left most
Palestinians struggling to live a life with dignity,
particularly women, children, and people with
disabilities. The situation is exacerbated by multiple
factors, including Israel’s occupation, the closure of
the Gaza Strip, a lack of respect for international
laws, unabated internal Palestinian political
divisions, economic crises, and recurrent
escalations of hostilities.27
The protracted humanitarian situation and impact of COVID-19 have had adverse effects on the
lives of Palestinian adolescents and youth.28 Education was one of the most affected sectors, with
intermittent school closures and significant decline in completion rates for secondary-level
education. Only 62 per cent of students attended secondary school to completion (as of 2021),29
with a sharp increase in the number of OOS children, with over one-fifth of children aged 16-17
OOS.30
In response to these challenges, schools transitioned to distance learning programmes and
implemented various measures to ensure inclusive and equitable education for all. However, in
the Gaza Strip, over 575,000 children and adolescents (more than 50 per cent of the school-age
population) lacked essential resources such as personal computers, reliable power supply, and
internet service. The lack of access these resources made it difficult for them to participate in
remote education, exacerbating the educational disparities, and hindering academic progress.
Relatedly, unemployment rates amongst youth remained critically high, with 40 per cent of
youth aged 15-24 years without a job. Female youth were disproportionately affected, where
69 per cent faced unemployment compared to 34 per cent of males (refer to Figure 3 for more
statistics).31 The patriarchal norms in Palestinian society tend to perpetuate expectations that
females should take primary responsibility for caring for the family. Given the fact that 24 per cent
of women aged 20- 49 years were married before reaching 18, this cultural expectation significantly
hampers women’s ability to enter the workforce.32
The high unemployment rates were due to a volatile economy and reduced capacity of public and
private sector to provide job opportunities for an increasing number of graduates.33 Moreover, the
gap between educational skills acquired by young people and job market requirements affected
their motivation to continue learning. In 2018, only 3 per cent of adolescents in grade 10-12 chose
a vocational education.34 This required more focused investment on technical skill building and
creating employment opportunities for adolescents.

Figure 3: Employment, Education, Training
On the other hand, violence against children continued to pose a serious concern where 23 per
cent of children (31 per cent in the Gaza Strip and 17 per cent in the West Bank) were
exposed to severe corporal punishment.35 Adolescents were generally exposed to high levels
of violence, at homes, schools and public places, where nearly half of the adolescents aged 12-17
experienced any form of violence, with boys more likely to be the victims than girls. At home, about
90 per cent of children aged 1-14 years experienced violent discipline, and 20 per cent of children
experienced severe physical punishment.36 Moreover, conflict-related violence significantly
impacted physical and mental well-being of children. As a result, 320,439 children (25,246 in the
West Bank and 295,193 in the Gaza Strip) reportedly required protection programmes, including
psychosocial support.37 Thus, emphasizing the need for holistic CP and violence reduction
measures at community, home, and school level.
Policy Framework on Adolescents Education, Employment, and CP: Several policy
frameworks guide the sector. The National Youth Strategy in the State of Palestine 2017-2022
aims to integrate the priorities of youth issues within the sectorial development plans for the years
in partnership with the relevant government agencies. The Social Development Sector Strategy
2021-2023 aims to combat multidimensional poverty; implement social protection measures that
protect the poor and vulnerable groups; and strengthen the standards of governance, integrity, and
transparency. The National Inter-Sectoral Violence Against Children Strategy in the Context
of COVID-19 (2021-2023) is structured around three outcomes; i) CP system is well-resourced,
evidence-based and coordinated across all relevant stakeholders in accordance with national and
international standards; ii) access to, coverage and quality of CP services related to violence
against children; iii) children and families (mothers, fathers and/ or other caregivers) have built
healthy positive relationships, claim children rights, and act as agents of change in social and
gender norms. Additionally, the SoP has also ratified several international conventions, the
relevant ones are mentioned below:

Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive
employment and decent work for all.
Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide
access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.
Overlapping deprivations in the areas of child rights, protection, and education severely compromise
the ability of adolescents to reach their full potential and become productive members of society and
the economy.41 To support the SoP, the UNICEF SoP initiated the ADAP Programme with a focus on
improving access to and quality of early childhood and basic education and other learning opportunities.
1.2 Programme Overview (Object of Evaluation)
This section describes the intervention or object of evaluation. The description includes
intervention purpose, objectives, timeline, geographic coverage, stakeholders and their roles,
participants/beneficiaries, and resources. It is important that the ADAP Programme is not a
standalone intervention, but includes 21 projects, managed by two UNICEF Sections: Education
& Adolescents and CP.
1.2.1 Programme Overview
The ADAP Programme was part of UNICEF’s Area Programme for 2018 to 2022, which aimed to
promote children’s rights and improve access to basic services, protective environment, and social
inclusion for Palestinian children and women. ADAP specifically focuses on life-skills training and
citizenship education to enhance employment/entrepreneurship opportunities for adolescents and
encourage their civic engagement. To achieve its goals, the Programme established partnerships
with schools, communities, civil society organisations (CSOs), and the private sector to provide
trainings in skills-building, entrepreneurship, and to promote non-violent behaviour among
adolescents. The 21 projects within the larger ADAP portfolio were implemented through 11 IPs –
names to the IPs have been redacted on UNICEF’s request:

1.2.2 Programme Goals and Objectives
The Programme covered two thematic areas, education, and CP, whereas each of the 21 projects
has its own specific results. However, the evaluation focuses on the higher-level thematic results
as agreed with UNICEF SoP, which are outlined below (refer to Appendix 3 for selected outcomes
and outputs):
Education: By 2022, more Palestinian children and adolescents, especially the most vulnerable,
benefit from improved access to quality and inclusive learning opportunities in safe and protected
environments and are enabled to contribute to their community and national development.
• Policymakers and key stakeholders have coordinated and developed evidence-based,
gender-responsive education and youth reform policies.
• Service providers have increased capacity to deliver quality, inclusive education and provide
opportunities to adolescents to develop and practice life-skills and citizenship education,
including in humanitarian settings.
CP: By 2022, more children, especially the most vulnerable, are better protected from violence,
exploitation, and grave violations.
• More parents, teachers, adolescents, and other stakeholders have increased knowledge and
skills to eliminate harmful practices and better protect children (aged 0-18) from violence,
exploitation, and grave violations.
1.2.3 Programme Strategies
The ADAP Programme employed the following strategies to achieve its objectives:42

CHAPTER 2: EVALUATION PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES, USERS, AND SCOPE
This chapter describes the evaluation purpose, objectives, and scope (including thematic,
chronological, geographic). Moreover, it delves into the ToC that has been assessed in this
evaluation.
2.1 Evaluation Purpose
This Summative Evaluation is the first external evaluation of the ADAP Programme, and it is
meant to serve two purposes: for accountability and to generate insights for future learning. As
part of the accountability objective, the evaluation team was responsible for conducting a
systematic assessment and collecting evidence of the Programme's achievements against
intended results. Additionally, it aimed to identify any gaps or operational issues in the
Programme's design and implementation and draw out useful lessons and best practices for a
range of stakeholders in the youth sector. These stakeholders included UNICEF SoP, relevant
ministries (such as the MoE and MoSD), UN agencies, donors, beneficiaries, and other
stakeholders in SoP. For additional details on the stakeholders and potential uses of the
evaluation, please refer to Section 2.3.
2.2 Evaluation Objectives
The evaluation objectives were reviewed and rephrased for additional clarity and precision during
the inception phase. The rephrased objectives are:
1. To generate evidence for UNICEF’s advocacy efforts in the adolescent sector and highlight
Programme achievements (vis-à-vis planned results) using the OECD-DAC48 criteria, i.e.,
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability, including humanitarian action
criteria comprising connectedness, coherence, and coverage, as well as UNICEF’s cross-
cutting programming priorities, i.e., gender equality, equity, child rights, and accountability
principles.
2. To assess the level of alignment and identify gaps between UNICEF’s Adolescent and Youth
Strategy and SoP’s National Youth Strategy.
3. To identify key lessons learnt, challenges and recommendations for ADAP projects to help
improve future programming by UNICEF and other youth sector stakeholders.
2.3 Evaluation Stakeholders’ Role and Uses of Evaluation

2.5 ToC
The ADAP Programme does not have its own explicit ToC but is informed by the broader ToC for
the UNICEF Education & Adolescents Section. As agreed during the inception phase, the
evaluation team focused on assessing the validity of a portion of the ToC that cover the ADAP
Programme’s interventions and results, i.e., children and adolescents benefit from improved quality
and relevance of the education system.
The UNICEF Education & Adolescents ToC articulates the overall goal and outcome level result:
“By 2022, more Palestinian children and adolescents, especially the most vulnerable,
benefit from improved access to quality and inclusive learning opportunities in safe and
protected environments and are enabled to contribute to their community and national
development.” The desired outcome/goal is dependent on meeting three critical preconditions:
children are ready for school; children and adolescents benefit from improved quality and
relevance of the education system; and children attend school without interruption. The ToC also
includes relevant assumptions and risks. Overall, the ToC appears to be completed except for the
absence of an impact statement, which also constrained the impact assessment of ADAP
Programme.
The evaluation findings indicate that the ADAP interventions have effectively contributed towards
achieving the intended education-specific results. For Outcome 1, the Programme fully achieved
two of the three indicators49,50 and mostly achieved the third indicator.51 The results are also
supported by primary data indicating an improvement in the teaching and learning environment for
adolescents, as well as an improved relevance of the education system. Both school staff and
adolescents expressed appreciation for the Programme’s focus on life skills and skills
development, recognising the potential value of ADAP interventions in helping adolescents secure
employment opportunities. The commitment and support from the public sector and IPs have
played a significant role in the achievement of these results and validated the relevant
assumptions. Pre-set risks, such as disruptions in activities due to the unique security environment
in the Gaza Strip, have been realized. The Programme did not account for disruptions caused by
the COVID-19 related restrictions but managed to implement innovative solutions, such as
developing remote learning tools and applications to continue learning. Nevertheless, the strikes
by MoE staff, including teachers, adversely affected the activities and represented an unforeseen
risk that was unaccounted for in advance.
However, the evaluation team identified a significant gap in Programme design and implementation
where it did not have a specific focus on generating long-term impact on adolescent employment.
As a result, there was a lack of adequate data and indicators to assess the sustained effects of the
interventions on creating employment opportunities for adolescents. By defining clear objectives,
implementing relevant activities, and establishing monitoring mechanisms to capture employment-
related outcomes, the Programme can enable a more thorough examination of its impact on
adolescent employment in the long run.

CHAPTER 3: EVALUATION CRITERIA, KEY QUESTIONS, DESIGN, AND
METHODOLOGY
This chapter presents an overview of the evaluation criteria, questions, design, and methodology,
including the data collection approaches and analysis methods, used by the evaluation team. It
also explains the quality assurance measures implemented to comply with UNICEF’s cross cutting
programming priorities and the United Nation’s Evaluation Group’s (UNEG)52 Norms and
Standards for Evaluations. Additionally, the section outlines evaluation limitations and the steps
taken to mitigate them. Finally, it covers the management and implementation arrangements for
evaluation.
3.1 Evaluation Criteria and Key Questions
The evaluation was carried out in accordance with the OECD-DAC criteria specified in the ToR.
Additionally, due to the fragile security situation in SoP, the evaluation also considered additional
criteria for evaluating humanitarian action such as connectedness, coherence, and coverage.
Furthermore, the evaluation focused on UNICEF’s cross-cutting priorities, including gender
equality, equity, child rights, and accountability principles.
The key evaluation and sub-questions are listed in Table 5 (see Evaluation Matrix – Appendix 7,
for indicators, methods, tools & analysis, and sources). However, some of the evaluation questions
were rephrased by the evaluation team for additional clarity and precision, and these revisions
were approved by UNICEF SoP during the inception phase.

3.2 Evaluation Design
The evaluation was guided by the two approaches informed by the purpose and objectives of the
evaluation and the availability of secondary data: participatory53 and theory-based54 approach.
The participatory approach involved engaging key stakeholders throughout the evaluation
process, from planning to dissemination. The opinions, experiences, and suggestions of duty
bearers (MoE, MoSD); rights holders (adolescents/youth and their parents); and technical and
financial partners (UNICEF SoP and IPs) informed the evaluation findings and recommendations.
UNICEF SoP also constituted the Evaluation Steering Committee (ESC), which included
representatives from UNICEF, key government agencies, IPs, and external evaluators. The ESC
contributed to the ToR, reviewed deliverables, and facilitated coordination during fieldwork. More
details on the roles and responsibilities of the ESC can be found in Appendix 13.
The theory-based approach was utilised to examine the Programme’s ToC and assess its
reliability and validity. The evaluation employed a sub-design, i.e., contribution analysis55 which
facilitated the measurement of planned outcomes and outputs and enabled the tracking of these
results to the Programme interventions to establish the causal linkages. For measuring results
(outcomes and outputs), the evaluation team used secondary data (primarily RAM reports 2018 –
2022) which provided a rich source of data, reflecting the actual progress made against the
planned results. While secondary data provided essential information about the results, primary
data (collected through KIIs, FGDs, and a validation workshop) proved crucial to substantiate these
results and establish causality. Relevant outcomes and outputs related to Education and CP
thematic areas, as agreed with UNICEF SoPCO during the inception phase, are included in
Appendix 3.
53 Participatory Evaluation is an approach that involves the stakeholders of a programme or policy in the evaluation process. This involvement can occur at
any stage of the evaluation process, from the evaluation design to the data collection and analysis and the reporting of the study.

3.3 Evaluation Methods
The evaluation team employed a Figure 9: Evaluation Methods
Mixed-Methods approach56 that
utilized both primary and secondary
data collection methods. For
secondary data collection method, the
evaluation team conducted desk
review of Programme documents
which included quantitative analysis of
Programme’s achievements and
budget. The primary data was
conducted using qualitative methods
such as KIIs, FGDs, and a validation
workshop. This approach effectively
mitigated the limitations inherent to
single-method studies, enabling a
holistic view through the
complementarity of various applied
methods. Furthermore, it facilitated
data cross-verification and validation
from different sources, thereby
ensuring the reliability and authenticity
of findings and recommendations.
The approach also enabled triangulation, adding depth and validity to the evaluation findings and
recommendations. The evaluation methods are described in the subsequent sections.
3.3.1 Secondary Data Collection - Desk Review
The desk review played a vital role in the evaluation process by providing the evaluation team with
critical knowledge and insights into the ADAP projects. Around 189 documents (partner progress
reports, annual and RAM reports, budget, and national policies and strategies) were reviewed,
which informed the analysis, findings, and recommendations of the final report. The evaluation
team employed a systematic approach during desk review, including initial screening and
classification, organizing and cataloguing documents according to their type, identifying broader
themes while keeping the evaluation questions and indicators in view, and extracting relevant
information through general reading. The extracted information was used to respond to evaluation
questions either on its own or with the support of the primary data collected through field research.
A complete list of the reviewed documents is included in Appendix 15.
3.3.2 Primary Data Collection – Qualitative Methods
The evaluation team collected primary data through multiple qualitative data collection methods
including KIIs, FGDs and a validation workshop. The sampling approach used to select
governorates for qualitative research is described below:
Sampling for Qualitative Methods: The following sampling approach was utilized for qualitative
methods:
KIIs: The evaluation team used purposive sampling57 to select KII respondents, primarily selecting
stakeholders directly involved in the design, planning, and implementation of the ADAP
Programme. In collaboration with UNICEF SoP, key officials from all pertinent public and private
stakeholders such as the MoE, MoSD, Youth Councils, IPs, community-based organizations
(CBO), UNICEF, private sector, Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutes,
donors, and other UN agencies were selected considering their direct or indirect roles in the

Programme. A balanced gender representation was also prioritized. As shown in Table 6,
approximately 50 per cent of the KII respondents were female. This balanced distribution was
integral to ensuring that the evaluation findings and recommendations were informed by a wide
spectrum of perspectives and experiences, reflecting the diversity of the Programme’s
stakeholders.
FGDs
The following steps were followed for the selection of FGD participants:
• Six governorates were sampled (Gaza City, Deir Al Balah, Khan Younis, Ramallah, Hebron,
and Nablus), with three each from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The selection of the
governorates was based on several criteria, including the number of projects implemented, the
number of Programme beneficiaries (including the most vulnerable, such as out of school and
adolescents with disabilities) and the location (preference was given to remote governorates).
• Within each selected governorate, a mix of education and CP projects was randomly selected.
In total, six projects for the education component and three projects for the CP component
were sampled. The evaluation team placed a stronger emphasis on selecting more projects
under the education component, as the majority of the projects (14 out of the 21) focused on
education and skill development.
• From the selected projects, five schools for boys, six schools for girls, three combined schools
and four OOSC adolescent groups were identified for both components. This facilitated
reaching out to both male and female adolescents to obtain their gender-specific experiences
and feedback.
• After the selection of schools, 6-10 respondents were randomly picked from the projects where
the list of beneficiaries was available. However, for those projects where the list of beneficiaries
was unavailable (mostly in the West Bank), a combination of purposive and convenience58
sampling approaches was adopted. This entailed coordinating with the school administration
to select the adolescents who benefitted from the ADAP interventions. For a detailed
breakdown of the number and distribution of FGDs, please refer to Figure 10.
KIIs: The evaluation team conducted 37 KIIs59 (19 males and 18 females) with key stakeholders
including public sector officials, IPs, CBOs, UNICEF, private sector (National Task Force and TVET
institutes), donor (European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO)), and other
UN agencies (United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)).
Semi-structured interview guides (refer to Appendix 8 for the KII tools and consent forms) were
used to collect data, taking into account stakeholders’ role in the Programme design and
implementation. The KII questions focused on stakeholder participation in ADAP design and
implementation, alignment with national priorities and humanitarian principles, achievement
against intended results, and additional measures needed to improve implementation. The
evaluation team utilised both Arabic and English versions to conduct interviews with stakeholders,
ensuring clarity and understanding of the respondents. Table 6 presents a distribution of the
Programme’s stakeholders interviewed for this evaluation. The complete list of interviewed
stakeholders is available in Appendix 9.

59 The evaluation team conducted 37 KIIs against 45 planned interviews as the remaining respondents did not respond to our request for an interview. These
interviews were therefore dropped after consultation with UNICEF.
17
FGDs: The evaluation team conducted 31 FGDs (107 male and 135 female) to obtain opinions
and perceptions of the beneficiaries at the community level, including in-school and OOS
adolescents, school staff (teachers, principals, and counsellors) and parents. The field teams
collaborated with school administrators and IPs to identify eligible respondents in the West Bank
for projects where the list of beneficiaries was not available. Additionally, due to ongoing teacher
strikes in the West Bank, only 9 (virtually administered) out of the originally planned 24 FGDs were
conducted. The FGDs were conducted utilising a structured set of questions, as detailed in
Appendix 10 which includes FGD guides and consent forms. The distribution of FGDs by sampled
governorate along with male and female distribution is presented in Figure 10 below, while
Appendix 11 provides further insight into the distribution of FGDs in each governorate
Figure 10: Distribution of FGDs
Validation Workshop: The evaluation team conducted a virtual validation workshop on May 30,
2023, with key stakeholders, including UNICEF, MoE (representatives from both the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip), and IPs. The validation workshop offered a platform to the key evaluation
users to reflect and provide their insights on key evaluation findings. Most importantly, this
workshop was used to gather stakeholders’ feedback on the proposed recommendations.
Suggestions and feedback shared during the validation workshop have been used to revise the
draft evaluation report.
3.4 Data Processing and Analysis
The evaluation team employed the following approach for data processing and analysis to draw
findings, conclusions and recommendations.
Qualitative Data Analysis: The evaluation employed a systematic and structured content and
thematic analysis, using tools such as MAXQDA and ATLAS.ti. KIIs and FGDs transcriptions were
coded in line with the evaluation questions and indicators, including indicators to gender, equity,
and child rights. Once analysed, the data was systematically arranged into matrices to enable the
identification of emerging patterns across various programmatic aspects and stakeholder
perspectives. The use of matrices also facilitated a clearer comparison of gender and equity
parameters (like those respondents located in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, or those adolescents
who were OOS), making it easier to spot any disparities in experiences or outcomes. All key
findings were cross verified with secondary information sources. This triangulation process
ensured the validity and reliability of the conclusions drawn from the evaluation, including those
related to cross-cutting priorities.
18
Quantitative Data Analysis: The evaluation team used MS-Excel for consolidation, sorting, and
analysis of data extracted from ADAP’s progress reports, budgets, financial reports, RAM reports,
IP report, and other secondary sources. The team ensured triangulation of these analyses with
qualitative data to strengthen overall validity of the findings.
3.5 Quality Assurance Measures
The evaluation team implemented comprehensive quality assurance measures to enable the
project management team to oversee and manage every aspect of the evaluation. The following
approaches and processes were employed by the evaluation team during each phase of the
evaluation:
Table 7: Quality Assurance Measures in Evaluation
Evaluation Phase Quality Assurance Measures
Inception • Incorporated feedback from various evaluation stakeholders (including SoP
MoE) to improve the inception report (IR) and data collection tools.
• Deployed gender-balanced staff to promote inclusiveness in the evaluation process
and accurately reflect the experiences of different groups.
Data Collection • Engaged experienced staff for field data collection to ensure high-quality data.
• Implemented a cascade training approach where the international team trained a
group of master trainers who then trained other field members.
• Pre-tested data collection tools before initiating fieldwork.
• Provided continuous support and supervision to local team members during
fieldwork to ensure smooth and effective data collection.
Data Analysis and • Reviewed collected data to ensure its accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
Reporting • Cross-checked data from multiple sources to ensure its validity and reliability.
• Triangulated evaluation findings and results using available quantitative
secondary data and primary qualitative data.
• Incorporated multiple rounds of feedback on evaluation report to ensure the
accuracy of evaluation findings and utility of recommendations.
3.6 Integration of Cross-Cutting Programming Priorities in Evaluation
Design and Methodology
The evaluation took into account UNICEF’s cross-cutting programming priorities, including gender
equality, equity, and child rights principles. The details of how each priority was incorporated in
the evaluation design, implementation, and results are provided below:
• Gender equality: The evaluative matrix and data collection methodologies included
specifically designed indicators and questions that served to map and understand the extent
to which the ADAP Programme’s design and implementation were cognizant of the distinct
needs of different genders and the results achieved for both genders. Furthermore, the
evaluation team made a conscious effort to engage a proportionate number of stakeholders
and beneficiaries from both genders, with 54 per cent being male and 56 per cent being female.
This diversity in the participant base enabled the team to capture the opinions of both genders.
In the report, the findings have been disaggregated to highlight any significant differences in
the experiences or outcomes of both genders. Finally, a separate section (4.9.1) is included in
the report to indicate the findings on Programme’s integration of gender equality principles.
• Equity: The evaluation matrix and instruments were designed with a clear focus on the
assessment of interventions, their targets, and the ensuing outcomes as they pertained to
adolescents considered vulnerable. This category includes those with disabilities, those
residing in regions exposed to conflict such as Area C, as well as those who are OOS. For
instance, the evaluation team reached out to OOS adolescents, comprising 16 males and 18
females and their feedback was sought on changes they had noticed in their own knowledge,
behaviour, as well as improvements, if any, in their employment opportunities as a result of
participating in the Programme. The evaluation team encountered limitations in reaching out
to adolescents with disabilities as the selection of students for FGDs was primarily conducted
by the school staff (refer to section 3.8 of the report, which identifies this as a notable limitation
19
in the evaluation process). Detailed findings related to the equity considerations within the
ADAP Programme are included under section 4.9.2 of the report.
• Child Rights: The evaluation matrix and data collection instruments incorporated specific
queries aimed at assessing the integration of the four guiding principles of the CRC – non-
discrimination, the child’s best interests, the right to life, survival and development, and the
views of the child – within the ADAP Programme. In addition, the evaluation team engaged
with adolescents (including OOS adolescents), both male (86) and female (113), to collect their
perspectives on the ADAP interventions through a structured FGD guide. The evaluation
findings and recommendations were enriched by their insights and, where relevant, their
perspectives were highlighted to represent their standpoints concerning various evaluation
criteria. Moreover, a separate section (4.9.3) has been included in the evaluation report to
present findings on the integration of child rights within the ADAP Programme.
3.7 Compliance to Evaluation Norms and Ethical Standards
The evaluation team followed all relevant UNEG and UNICEF ethical norms and standards
throughout the evaluation process. The description below outlines the key measures taken for
each dimension, for more details refer to Appendix 22:
• Ethical clearance: The evaluation team obtained ethical clearance from the HML Ethics
Independent Review Board to protect the rights of respondents and comply with ethical
standards. Refer to Appendix 12 for the copy of ethical clearance.
• Anonymity and confidentiality: The evaluation team ensured anonymity and confidentiality
of primary data by encrypting it, while physical records and documents were kept with
authorized team members. Additionally, the opinions and feedback of respondents have been
kept anonymous.
• Responsibility: No difference of opinions among the evaluation team members or the
commissioning organisation occurred. However, the evaluation team remained responsible in
the event this happened.
• Independence and impartiality: The evaluation team has maintained independence and
impartiality throughout the evaluation, and no team member had any conflict of interest or were
involved in the implementation of ADAP projects.
• Engagement with adolescents: Engagement with adolescents followed the International
Charter for Ethical Research Involving Children,60 where informed consent was obtained from
parents/caregivers of adolescents. The FGDs were also moderated in the presence of the
teachers and separate sessions were conducted for male and female adolescents.61
• Incidents: The evaluation team reported any incidents or challenges that arose during
fieldwork to UNICEF’s evaluation manager, such as Israeli escalation, non-responsiveness of
some respondents, and unavailability of beneficiary data for FGDs.
• Intellectual property: The evaluation team respects the intellectual property rights of
institutions and communities under review and understands that materials generated during
the evaluation are UNICEF’s property and can only be used with prior permission.
• Utility: The evaluation’s intended users, their roles, and potential uses are listed in section 2.3,
of this report. A validation workshop was also organised with ESC members to enhance the
utility and application of the evaluation.
• Credibility and validation of information: The evaluation team used inclusive and
participatory data collection methodology involving a range of relevant stakeholders for
feedback, and triangulated reported findings with evidence from both secondary and primary
data sources.
• Professionalism: The evaluation team comprises professionals with extensive knowledge,
skills, and experience working with multiple clients on local and international evaluation
projects.

• Delivery of reports: The evaluation has delivered a high-quality evaluation report, with
changes made to the evaluation timeline after due consultations with UNICEF.
3.8 Limitations, Challenges, and Mitigation Measures
During the evaluation of the ADAP Programme, a number of challenges and limitations were
encountered. These are detailed in Table 8 along with the mitigation measures that were taken to
address them:
Table 8: Limitations, Challenges, and Mitigation Measures
Limitations and Challenges Mitigation Measures
The intricate and cross To address this limitation and ensure a meaningful evaluation, the team
cutting design of the ADAP engaged in thorough consultations with UNICEF during the inception phase to
Programme made it difficult clarify the focus and direction of the evaluation. As a result of these
to conduct in-depth discussions, it was decided that the evaluation would primarily target the
analysis of each of the 21 overarching results of the ADAP Programme. This broader approach allowed
projects the team to provide an overview of the Programme’s performance against the
different evaluation criteria, while acknowledging the complex interplay
between the various projects and interventions within the Programme.
Unavailability of secondary The evaluation team used secondary data to map Programme achievements.

achievements including unable to conclusively assess the Programme’s effectiveness, especially for
disaggregated data for the CP component. The evaluation team has used primary data to fill the gaps
vulnerable adolescents to the extent possible.
Unavailability of beneficiary UNICEF and IPs could not provide complete list of beneficiaries for projects
data for selected projects selected for FGDs, which impeded random selection of respondents, especially
especially in the West Bank for the projects selected in the West Bank. As a mitigation measure, the
evaluation team in consultation with UNICEF, contacted the selected schools’
administrations who nominated students, parents and school staff, who had
benefitted from the sampled projects to participate in the FGDs.
Strikes in West Bank During the data collection phase for FGDs in the West Bank, the field team
encountered a challenge where all schools were closed due to strikes. To
overcome this challenge, the evaluation team collaborated with UNICEF to
define an alternative approach, which involved conducting the FGDs virtually
and at IP offices. However, despite these measures, the total number of FGDs
in West Bank were reduced from 24 to 9.
No impact statement in Neither the Results Framework nor the ToC contains an impact statements and
Programme’s ToC and indicators. Therefore, the impact measurement primarily relied on perceived
Results Framework impact, as reported by various stakeholders including direct beneficiaries.
However, it is important to acknowledge that many of these perceived changes
cannot be empirically verified by the evaluation team.
Delay in securing Despite follow-up with the MoE by the evaluation team and UNICEF, the overall
administrative approval timeline of the assignment was delayed by two months due to delayed receipt
from MoE of administrative approval from the MoE, which resulted in a no-cost extension.
3.9 Evaluation Team, Implementation Phases, and Deliverables
This section provides details on the evaluation team, implementation phases, and associated
deliverables for each evaluation phase.
3.9.1 Evaluation Team and Roles
For this evaluation, AAN Associates collaborated with a local research firm in SoP, RAI Consult
and enlisted the expertise of national evaluation experts from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
The evaluation team comprised an evaluation advisor and sector experts, as well as an evaluation
project manager, evaluation officer, evaluation associate, and data analysts. Together, the team
was responsible for leading the design, analysis, and reporting. For further information on the
evaluation team members, please refer to Appendix 14.

CHAPTER 4: EVALUATION FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS
In this chapter, the evaluation findings are presented that have been drawn from both primary and
secondary sources. The findings are organised by the evaluation criteria: relevance, efficiency,
effectiveness, impact, sustainability, coverage, coherence, connectedness as well as UNICEF’s
cross-cutting programming priorities: gender equality, equity, and child rights. A summary of the
findings is provided for each key evaluation question and supporting details, when needed, are
included in appendices to substantiate the evaluation findings.
4.1 Relevance
The relevance section assesses the processes utilised in designing the ADAP Programme. It
includes an assessment of the degree to which the Programme engaged relevant stakeholders in
the design process. Furthermore, it examines the extent to which the Programme was informed by
the local and national context, including local knowledge, beliefs, gender considerations, and
cultural differences. The findings on the alignment of the ADAP Programme with the national
priorities are included under the coherence section, 4.7.
EQ1 – To what extent is ADAP design informed by national and local context and involved
relevant stakeholders?
Based on the evaluation findings, the ADAP Programme is deemed relevant due to its extensive
consultations with relevant stakeholders (MoE MoSD, non-governmental organisations (NGOs),
and UN Agencies) during the design stage, allowing for the identification of their priorities and
needs. Furthermore, the Programme successfully incorporated insights from secondary
assessments to inform its interventions and processes, thereby acknowledging the underlying
causes and contextual realities. Nonetheless, a significant gap was identified in terms of direct
engagement with adolescents during the design phase.
4.1.1 Processes for Stakeholder Involvement in ADAP Design

review past achievements, and learn from challenges and bottlenecks encountered in the
previous programme cycle.63 These consultations informed the Programme objectives and
interventions which were converted into the Rolling Work Plans. These Plans were shared with
line ministries and partners for endorsement in March 2017, along with the ToC and the Results
Framework.64
3. While most of the relevant stakeholders were involved, secondary data suggested that
adolescent boys and girls were not engaged in the design process. However, UNICEF
addressed this gap by involving adolescents and seeking their views to develop the new APD
(2023-25).65
4. Discussions with UNICEF and IPs suggested that ADAP design was perceived as collaborative
as relevant stakeholders were consulted regarding the intended goals, activities, budgets,

timelines, roles, and responsibilities. The public sector representatives who were interviewed
had limited knowledge about the processes used to engage relevant stakeholders in the ADAP
design. According to respondents from the MoE, they did not receive enough information about
the planned activities. As the secondary evidence suggested joint planning and coordination
between UNICEF and the relevant ministries during the design phase, it is plausible that this
feedback could be attributed to the frequent personnel changes within the public sector.

encountered challenges in obtaining the most up-to-date data for each project. Nonetheless, the
analysis indicated that the Programme achieved 76 per cent of its output targets while utilising only
68 per cent of its allocated resources, indicating cost efficiency. This achievement is remarkable
considering the challenges posed by COVID-19-related closures, restrictions, and security issues.
However, the evaluation team could not determine the specific factors that contributed to the cost
savings. It is possible that the savings were due to over-budgeting or the shift from in-person to
remote interventions during the pandemic.
The evaluation team found that UNICEF had financial tracking systems in place to monitor and
report inter-agency and donor investments, but the evaluation team did not have sufficient
information / data to assess the extent to which this tracking system facilitated timely adjustments
and adaptive management to save time and costs.
4.2.1 Time Efficiency
8. The evaluation team conducted an Figure 12: ADAP Output Achievements
efficiency analysis of two education
outputs, i.e., 1.1 and 1.2. Performance
tracking showed that of three
indicators under Output 1.1, one was
fully achieved, one was mostly
achieved, and one was slightly
achieved.70 As for Output 1.2, there
were nine indicators, and among
them, four were fully achieved, four
were mostly achieved, and one was
not achieved.71 A detailed analysis of
targets and achievements can be
found in Appendix 17.
9. The analysis of secondary data showed that by the end of 2021, the Programme had achieved
an average of 76 per cent of the education outputs (with 74 per cent for Output 1.1 and 77 per
cent for Output 1.2, respectively). It should be noted that the targets were originally set for the
end of 2022, but due to the evaluation’s time frame, the analysis only covers progress made
until the end of 2021.
10. Secondary data72 and stakeholder feedback indicated that the allocated time for the
Programme was considered sufficient, but some challenges caused delays in implementation.
These challenges included:
o The COVID-19 pandemic and
consequent school closures, which “As any other country, the State of Palestine was also

o Working in a conflict affected area like the Gaza Strip where frequent escalations disrupted
the implementation of activities.
o Frequent and unpredictable teachers’ strikes, which delayed the implementation of in-
school interventions.
4.2.2 Cost Efficiency
11. The secondary data Figure 13: ADAP Achievements vs Budget Utilisation
indicated that the
Programme achieved 76 per
cent of its output targets (1.1
and 1.2) while utilising only
68 per cent of the allocated
budget for these outputs.
Specifically, for Output 1.1,
74 per cent of the output
targets were achieved using
only 55 per cent of the
allocated budget. Visual
representation of this data
can be found in Figure 13,
and calculations are provided
in Appendix 17. However,
due to limited access to
financial information, it
remained unclear why the budget utilisation remained lower. To the evaluation team, possible
reasons for this included cost savings resulting from the shift to virtual implementation during
the COVID-19 pandemic or overbudgeting.
12. During discussions with stakeholders, the
evaluation team received mixed feedback “There was no problem with financing these activities. To

in some activities from in-person to virtual
settings. The fact that the Programme achieved 76 per cent of the results with only 68 per cent
of the budget points to adequacy of funds.
4.2.3 Operational Efficiency
13. Primary and secondary data suggested that UNICEF did not create a separate financial
tracking system for the ADAP Programme. Instead, it was integrated into the Education and
CP Sections. Each section created a financial tracking sheet containing details of the total
funds, expiry dates, committed amounts, utilised amounts, and remaining amounts to be
utilised before the expiry date. The financial tracking system used by the Education &
Adolescents Section tracked expenses between UNICEF and IPs on a quarterly basis, using
a template called the “Funding Authorization and Certification of Expenditures (FACE) Form”.73
14. Interviews with UNICEF respondents emphasized the usefulness of tracking and reporting
financial investments or allocations for timely course corrections and cost savings during ADAP
implementation. One respondent shared an example from a project in the Gaza Strip where
they had planned an activity with a budget of Israeli shekels 500,000 but ended up spending

management to save time and costs.
4.3 Effectiveness
The effectiveness section assesses the ADAP Programme’s achievements against its intended
outcomes. The evaluation team utilised the Programme’s Results Framework to assess the
outcomes for education and adolescents (Outcome 1) as well as CP (Outcome 2) components
through a comparison of planned and achieved outcomes. The section also examines the factors
that have either facilitated or hindered these achievements, including deviations from the workplan.
Additionally, an assessment of the Programme’s monitoring system is included to determine its
effectiveness in generating adequate data to inform implementation and support ADAP
Programme achievements.
EQ3 – To what extent did the ADAP Programme achieve (or is likely to achieve) the planned
results (selected outcomes for education and CP), and was the monitoring system
successful in generating adequate data to inform Programme delivery?
The Programme was largely effective in achieving the intended outcome indicators for the
education component. Two outcome indicators74 were fully achieved (Indicator 2 and 3) while one
outcome indicator (Indicator 5)75 was mostly achieved. However, the outcome indicator for the CP
component was not tracked. Despite facing significant challenges such as the impact of COVID-
19, the security situation, and frequent teachers strikes, the Programme successfully managed to
achieve its intended results. Several key factors contributed to this success, including aligning the
ADAP Programme with national priorities, implementing a hybrid model involving IPs and the public
sector, and employing innovative and remote learning methods.
The monitoring system provided comprehensive guidance and data collection methodologies.
However, the evaluation identified gaps in the monitoring system, including limited data collection
for the CP component, insufficient focus on assessing the impact, and inadequate focus on
measuring quality of interventions. The extent to which the monitoring system contributed to
adaptative management could not be determined due to limited evidence.
4.3.1 ADAP Effectiveness: Planned vs Achieved Outcomes
Table 9 below displays the achievements of ADAP, which has indicators for two outcomes.
Outcome 1 focuses on adolescent education, with three indicators, while Outcome 2 pertains to
CP with one indicator. To maintain objectivity, the evaluation team used a rating scale to measure
effectiveness. The findings were based on secondary data reported by UNICEF SoP in the RAM
Reports.
74 Indicator 2: Percentage of adolescents in areas involved in civic and economic engagement initiatives and Indicator 3: Transition rate between basic and
secondary education.
75 Indicator 5: Number of children who have participated in skills development Programmes for learning, personal empowerment, active citizenship and/or
employability through UNICEF supported Programmes.

16. Secondary data suggested that the Programme was mostly effective as it fully achieved two
indicators and mostly achieved one indicator for Outcome 1. However, information was not
available to assess the achievements for Outcome 2 (CP).
17. Respondents from UNICEF were mostly satisfied with the Programme’s achievements. One
respondent noted that the CP component was relatively less effective as it did not achieve the
planned outcome targets. The respondent identified various factors that hindered progress on
addressing violence against children, including weak enforcement of legislation, low political
awareness, lack of safe and inclusive spaces for adolescents to participate, and a lack of
guidance and interest to motivate young people to participate. The evaluation team is unable
to validate this finding due to lack of secondary data on the CP outcome.
18. Responses from public sector stakeholders were mixed regarding the effectiveness of the
ADAP Programme. One respondent from the MoE highlighted that the trainings provided by
the Programme were insufficient to change the behaviour and/or transfer life skills to

30
4.3.3 Deviations from Work Plan
20. During interviews, both UNICEF and IP stakeholders reported that there were no major
deviations in activities and work plans, except for changes in approach due to COVID-19-
related restrictions on mobility and gatherings. This had a negative impact on activities that
required physical interaction between groups, such as face-to-face trainings and workshops
for teachers and caregivers. Both primary and secondary data indicated that the ADAP
Programme improvised its programming in response to COVID-19 (schools were closed as a
precautionary measure), which involved shifting to remote trainings.
4.3.4 ADAP’s Monitoring System
21. Secondary and primary data indicated that
“The work that’s been done has been a bit more project

against outcomes and outputs were shared
in the RAM reports on a bi-annual basis. These reports included the results of education and
CP interventions and did not categorize specific results related to the ADAP Programme.
22. The RAM Reports for the 2018-2022 period indicated that the Education component (Outcome
1) had three indicators, all tracked and reported. One indicator for the CP component (Outcome
2), was not tracked.78 At the output level, Output 1.1 had three indicators, all of which were
tracked. Output 1.2 had nine indicators, one79 was not tracked after 2020. For Output 2.3 (CP),
only one indicator was tracked.80 As such the monitoring system generated limited data for the
CP component.
23. A review of ADAP results indicated that there is no impact indicator. Half of the outcome
indicators81 focused on numbers rather than quality of interventions and/or intended change in
the lives of beneficiaries. The evaluation team also found that the projects (21) monitoring
indicators were not fully aligned with ADAP results (outcome/outputs). As such it was
challenging for the evaluation team to determine which project specifically contributed to which
intended result. Additionally, there was no consolidated list available that captured all the
beneficiaries who benefited from the 21 projects, a challenge that has been identified as a
limitation of this evaluation.
24. The evaluation team did not find any primary or secondary evidence that indicated the
monitoring system contributed to adaptation of the Programme intervention and timelines.
According to a UNICEF respondent, internal monitoring reports suggested improvements, but
these were usually not considered. This was primarily because UNICEF collaborated with MoE

to agree on interventions during the design phase, which left little opportunity for planning and
implementation-level modifications in Programme interventions.
4.4 Impact
The impact assessment primarily focused on assessing the long-term intended and unintended
changes in the lives of adolescents. However, it is important to note that the Results Framework
and ToC lacked impact statements and indicators. The Programme’s monitoring system was more
focused on monitoring outputs and outcomes rather than tracking higher-level results such as skills
development, job creation, and entrepreneurship. As a result, the impact assessment relied on
perceived changes reported by various stakeholders, including direct beneficiaries. These
perceived changes included improved knowledge and life skills, improved career prospects, and
behavioural changes resulting from CP interventions.
EQ4 - To what extent did ADAP interventions impact lives of adolescents/ youth?
The evaluation team was unable to track impact on behaviour change, increased employability, or
enterprise development, highlighting a significant gap. Nevertheless, the majority of beneficiaries
reported experiencing a positive impact, specifically in terms of gaining new skills and knowledge,
increased self-confidence, and improved communication. There was also perceived positive
change in violent behaviours and a positive shift in disciplinary practices within communities and
schools. Due to lack of secondary evidence, it is important to acknowledge that none of these
perceived changes were empirically verified by the evaluation team.
4.4.1 Perceived Intended Impact of Education Interventions on Adolescents Boys and Girls
The findings are categorized into two sections: (i) improved knowledge and life skills; and (ii)
improved career prospects resulting from increased knowledge and life skills.
Improved knowledge and life skills

27. Adolescents reported improved communication and problem-solving skills, and increased
confidence. Similarly, teachers noted improvement in students related to teamwork,
cooperation, communication, and programming skills. To improve the implementation of such
interventions in the future, teachers suggested selecting an appropriate time and allocating
sufficient time for the activities, following a specific work plan, and considering exam’s
schedules and holidays. They also recommended joint training for teachers and students, with
IT teachers receiving more focus due to their scientific knowledge, along with technical
guidance provided during the training period. Additionally, they emphasized the importance of
more practical exercises during training, using participatory and interactive methods.
Better career prospects through improved knowledge and life skills
28. UNICEF respondents confirmed that there is no evidence indicating whether the skills
development interventions aided adolescents in obtaining jobs. While they mentioned taking
82 DEAL – Digital Entrepreneurship Adolescence Leaders - ML: Machine Learning Report for Tracking Life Skills Progress – January 2022
32
steps to connect adolescents with relevant industries/markets, the extent to which this resulted
in job creation and trainee-led enterprises remained unclear.
29. Adolescent boys and girls who participated in the trainings reported learning new skills;
however, they also identified the need for post-training support to secure jobs. This is evident

parents also reported developing crucial
parenting skills, such as providing psychosocial support to their children. In particular, mothers
mentioned an improved ability to build trust w ith adolescents and cultivate patience and
calmness.
33. However, some parents and teachers pointed out that these improvements appear to be
temporary or dependent on the school and family environment and may need continuous
follow-up to address these behavioural issues.
4.4.3 Perceived Unintended Impact
34. While most stakeholders did not mention any positive or negative unintended impacts, a few
findings were noted, as mentioned below:
o Some adolescents shared feeling overburdened due to the timing of ADAP school-based
activities. In certain cases, these activities coincided with school exams, resulting in a
negative impact on their academic performance.
o A few respondents highlighted that ADAP interventions related to game-based learning
resulted in some adolescents developing addiction to games and spending excessive time
on screens.
o Some adolescent boys and girls who benefited from ADAP interventions faced challenges
in leveraging their acquired skills (i.e., employment opportunities) due to insufficient
support from the public sector, UN agencies, and donors. This lack of support led to
feelings of frustration among these adolescents.

4.5 Sustainability
The sustainability section focuses on evaluating the key results that are likely to sustain beyond
the completion of the Programme. It also includes an assessment of the role of stakeholders, such
as the SoP and local communities, in sustaining the achieved results.
EQ5: To what extent ADAP results (for adolescents and youth) are likely to continue after
its completion by government and communities?
The evaluation findings suggested that while some results of the ADAP Programme, such as the
integration of LSCE into the education system, are sustainable, others, including the NYVSP,
knowledge and skill development of adolescents, and the reduction of violence in schools and
homes, are only partially sustainable. This is attributed to the lack of long-term support for
adolescents in obtaining employment and insufficient duration of CP interventions to change
behaviour. Additionally, limited community involvement and external challenges, such as the Israeli
occupation, Palestinians’ internal political divisions, and limited budgets for ministries, have been
identified as factors that have influenced the sustainability of the Programme’s results. Therefore,
continued technical and financial support are likely to be needed to sustain the achieved results.

37. The evaluation team has assessed the likelihood of sustainability for ADAP results after
completion, using primary and secondary data. The assessment is divided into two categories:
results that are fully likely to be sustained and results that are partially likely to be sustained.
Table 11: Sustainability of ADAP Results
Results Sustainability Rating and Analysis
Integration of Rating: Likely to be fully sustained
LSCE into • The evaluation team found that UNICEF provided technical support to the MoE to integrate
Palestinian LSCE skills into the national education system. As part of this effort, a national assessment
education tool for LSCE skills was developed and eight out of the 12 core skills have been approved
system by the MoE. The full national instrument will be launched in 2023, pending MoE approval.
• Based on discussions with stakeholders, the evaluation found that the Programme has
effectively contributed to integrating the LSCE into the education system. UNICEF played
a crucial role in this process by actively collaborating with the MoE and co-leading the life
skills thematic working group. The MoE representatives also recognized the importance
of institutionalisation and shared that the Ministry has shifted its focus towards prioritising
life skills.
• Considering these findings, the evaluation team rated this result as likely to be fully
sustained. The demonstrated commitment from the MoE, coupled with the ongoing
collaboration and efforts to integrate the Programme’s interventions into the education
system, provided a positive outlook for the long-term sustainability of the achieved results.

Results Sustainability Rating and Analysis
The NYVSP Rating: Likely to be partially sustained
developed • UNICEF collaborated with UNFPA and UNDP to support the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO)
and launched in developing the NYVSP (also called Fursa) under ADAP. The objective is to connect
young volunteers with opportunities to contribute meaningfully to their communities while
gaining experience and skills for employment. The NYVSP was officially launched by the
PMO in 2022.84
• Discussions with UNICEF indicated that the NYVSP has not yet been operationalised.
While the platform holds significant potential, it still requires institutionalisation and
integration within a national institution to ensure its functionality and effective
management. The evaluation team noted that the lack of clear plans and steps towards
operationalisation poses a challenge to the sustainability of this result. Consequently, the
team has rated this result as partially sustainable.
Reduced Rating: Likely to be partially sustained
incidence of • Although UNICEF has taken initial measures to integrate violence reduction initiatives into
violence in the national policy framework, it is important to note that an updated or extended National
schools and Inter-sectoral Violence against Children Strategy (NIVACS) is still required. This is crucial

discipline continuous and long-term engagement may be necessary to effectively address
behavioural issues. Furthermore, it was noted that the underlying causes of these
behavioural issues were not adequately addressed. This may hinder the sustained impact
of the interventions and therefore, the team has rated this result as partially sustainable.

4.5 Coverage
The coverage section assesses how the ADAP Programme identified and prioritised the most
vulnerable and deserving adolescents. It further assesses the appropriateness of ADAP
interventions in addressing the specific needs of these identified vulnerable adolescents.
EQ6 – To what extent did ADAP target and reach out to the most deserving population and
provided appropriate assistance?
The Programme was largely successful in reaching several marginalised groups. However, there
were identified gaps, particularly in addressing the unique needs of male adolescents and those
residing in Area C. The absence of consultations with adolescents during the design phase of
ADAP was noted, emphasizing the need for their perspectives to be considered in order to better
tailor interventions to their specific needs and circumstances.
4.6.1 Identification of Vulnerable Groups
40. The findings indicated that UNICEF SoP identified vulnerable groups and their needs through
various assessment and consultation processes. It is important to note that none of these
processes were exclusively developed for the ADAP Programme. The key processes included:
o Assessments: The SoP CO utilised
various assessments to identify Most Vulnerable and Disadvantaged Groups

socio-cultural factors. The approximate
number of Palestinians identified with vulnerable groups and the reasons for their
vulnerability are listed in Appendix 18.
o Consultations with Relevant Stakeholders: The UNICEF team indicated that they
consulted with several local organisations and public sector actors to map out the
vulnerable groups, particularly adolescents. These consultations were used to identify the
priority needs of these groups.
41. Discussions with UNICEF indicated that consultations were not conducted with adolescents to
identify their needs to design the ADAP interventions. However, this gap has been addressed
in the new APD being developed for 2023-2025.
42. Discussions with public sector stakeholders indicated their lack of knowledge regarding the
processes used to identify the most vulnerable groups and their specific needs. While some
respondents acknowledged that the Programme was successful in targeting the marginalized
groups, others highlighted limitations in the design and coverage of the interventions,
particularly for adolescents in Area C, who were not reached through the Programme
interventions.
“When addressing the needs of young people and adolescents, it's crucial to consider not just the specific geographical
location, but also the differing needs of various regions within State of Palestine. We hope that future efforts in this area
will lead to improved planning processes following the evaluation and implementation of current projects.” - KIIs with
MoSD
“UNICEF selected the schools, but the Ministry is not involved in choosing schools or regions. We are not aware of the
selection criteria.” - KII with MoE
85 Other key assessment and analysis include Every Child Counts: Understanding the needs and perspectives of children with disabilities, Palestinian Central
Bureau of Statistics, Situation analysis of Children living in the State of State of Palestine 2016/17, Palestinian Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2014, National
Intersectoral Violence against Children Strategy (2019). and COVID-19 protection needs identification and analysis in the State of State of Palestine.

4.6.2 Appropriateness of ADAP Interventions Vis-à-vis Needs of Vulnerable Adolescents
Below are the findings from primary and secondary data that outline the vulnerable groups, their needs, and the extent to which ADAP interventions
were suitable for addressing their needs:

4.7 Coherence
The coherence criterion assesses the alignment of ADAP interventions with national policies,
UNICEF’s global guidelines, and humanitarian principles92 such as humanity, impartiality,
neutrality, and independence. Additionally, it focuses on evaluating ADAP’s coordination with
external partners to avoid duplication and address gaps.
EQ 7 - To what extent were ADAP interventions and implementation consistent with national
guidelines and UNICEF’s global guidelines for adolescent programming and with relevant
humanitarian principles and standards? How well was assistance coordinated (externally)
to avoid duplications and address gaps?
The evaluation found the Programme coherent with national policies and plans such as the
Education Sector Strategic Plan (2020), National Youth Strategy in the State of Palestine (2020),
National Policy Agenda (2017-2022), and National Intersectoral Violence Against Children
Strategy in the Context of COVID-19 (2021-2023). Furthermore, it is consistent with UNICEF’s
Global Adolescent Programming Guidelines (2018). Both the design and implementation of the
Programme were also found largely consistent with the principles of humanitarian principles –
humanity, impartiality, and neutrality. However, the absence of interventions in Area C indicates
limited compliance with the principle of independence.
The findings suggested weak external coherence, with limited substantive evidence supporting the
level of coordination with external actors to prevent duplication and address gaps. This lack of
coordination can be attributed to the absence of a formal coordination mechanism and a limited
focus from relevant public institutions.
4.7.1 ADAP’s Coherence with National Policies and UNICEF’s Global Adolescent
Programming Guidelines
43. Multiple national policies as well as UNICEF’s global guidelines were used to assess
coherence of ADAP strategies and interventions. The key guidelines used for this purpose
include: i) Education Sector Strategic Plan (2020); ii) National Youth Strategy in the State of
Palestine (2020); iii) National Policy Agenda (2017-2022); iv) National Intersectoral Violence
Against Children Strategy in the Context of COVID-19 (2021-2023); and v) UNICEF’s global
guidelines for adolescent programming.93 The evaluation team did not have access to
UNICEF’s Adolescent and Youth Strategy to assess its alignment with National Youth Strategy.
44. The findings from primary and secondary data indicated that the Programme was coherent
with the national policies related to adolescent education and CP. These findings are
summarized in Table 13, with detailed information provided in Appendix 19.

4.7.2 ADAP’s Consistency with Humanitarian Principles
45. Below are the key findings on ADAP’s coherence with established humanitarian principles,
drawn from both primary and secondary data. A summary of these findings is provided below,
while a more detailed description can be found in Appendix 19.
o Humanity:109 The findings suggested that the Programme is aligned with the principle of
humanity, aimed at providing access to fundamental human rights, such as the right to
education, decent living, protection of dignity and respect, and children’s rights. The
Programme prioritised reaching out to the most vulnerable groups, including adolescents
living in remote and marginalized areas, those with disabilities, OOS youth, and those
affected by conflict and displacement. By contributing to the protection of human dignity
and alleviation of suffering among vulnerable adolescents, it can be inferred that the ADAP
is consistent with the principle of humanity.
o Impartiality:110 The findings indicated that the Programme provided equal access and
opportunities to all eligible adolescents, regardless of their nationality, race, gender,
religious belief, class, or political opinions.

109 Human suffering must be addressed wherever it is found. The purpose of humanitarian action is to protect life and health and ensure respect for human
beings.
110 Humanitarian actors must not take sides in hostilities or engage in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.
39
o Neutrality:111 The Programme was found neutral in its approach and implementation as it
did not show any political or ideological bias. It provided services and assistance to all
eligible adolescents, without taking sides in the conflict or hostilities between SoP and
Israel.
o Independence:112 The findings

relief/recovery/development interventions and relate to transition strategies (or SDGs)?
The ADAP Programme effectively leveraged internal complementarities within UNICEF,
specifically in the areas of CP, health and nutrition, WASH, and SBC interventions. The CP
Programme played a pivotal role in strengthening education and adolescent outcomes by
facilitating the transfer of knowledge and skills to eliminate harmful practices and improve CP
measures within schools. Collaborative efforts with the Health and WASH sections allowed the
Programme to address the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing vital hygiene
kits, conducting training sessions, and supplying cleaning materials to schools. Additionally, the
SBC Section provided cross-cutting support by conducting awareness sessions on non-violent
discipline techniques and positive parenting, contributing to the overarching objectives of ADAP.
Furthermore, the evaluation findings indicate that the Programme interventions align with multiple
SDGs, including SDG 4, 5, 8, 10, and 16. This alignment underscores the Programme’s
commitment to addressing critical global development priorities. However, it is important to note
that the evaluation did not identify any specific national or regional transition plans, which limited
the assessment of the Programme’s connectedness in this context.
4.8.1 ADAP Interventions Benefitting from other UNICEF Interventions
Findings were primarily drawn from interviews with UNICEF staff and by reviewing relevant
documents such as the Strategy Note (2018-2022), the Country Programme Action Plan (CPAP)
(2018-2022), and the RAM reports (2018-2022).
Connectedness with CP Interventions:
52. Secondary data indicated that CP
“Both child protection and adolescent education focus on

Programme and ADAP interventions.
Examples of this complementarity were provided, such as Projec t 10 that focused on
vulnerable youth and adolescents in East Jerusalem by supporting parents, raising awareness,
and providing prevention and support during and after arrest, as well as digital security through
recreational and sporting activities. ADAP Project 9 referred students to family centres for case
management and psychosocial support services from partner family centres under the regular
CP Programme. Another example was the BRAVE Project, which included multi-sectoral
interventions on life skills, CP, and non-violence, complementing ADAP interventions.
Connectedness with Health and Nutrition Interventions:
54. The Health Section’s interventions targeting schools in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
also benefited the ADAP Programme. For example, training was provided to school health
focal points on COVID-19 school health protocols and how to establish and support school
health committees to develop and implement action plans aimed at preventing COVID-19
infections.115
55. The desk review indicated that there were similarities between the interventions of ADAP and
the Nutrition Friendly School Initiative (NFSI). In 2021, UNICEF implemented a school-based
multi-sectoral intervention to address malnutrition among adolescent girls in the West Bank

and the Gaza Strip. This intervention provided benefits to school-age children across 44
schools and 9 districts. Additionally, UNICEF conducted capacity-building activities and trained
more than 150 teachers on NFSI. They also developed and distributed information, education,
and communication (IEC) materials to promote awareness of healthy lifestyle practices,
nutritious foods, diet diversity, and physical activities in all schools of the West Bank. These
activities indirectly benefitted schools covered under ADAP.116
Connectedness with WASH Interventions:
56. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Education & Adolescents Section collaborated
with the WASH Section to address its adverse effects. The WASH Section provided hygiene
kits, cleaning materials, masks, and sanitizers to schools for post-COVID-19 preparedness.
ADAP Programme organized trainings for teachers, guards, and canteen staff on the use of
cleaning materials and implementation of COVID-19 health prevention protocols in schools.
For instance, Project 13 under ADAP focused on enhancing the capacity of school health
committee members and training MoE officials and school staff in government schools on
COVID-19 prevention and control measures, ensuring a safe return to schools and
continuation of school-based teaching and learning activities during and after the pandemic.
Connectedness with Social Behaviour Change (SBC) Interventions:
57. Based on the desk review and discussions with UNICEF, the ADAP interventions were also
supported by the SBC interventions. The SBC Section offered cross-cutting assistance to
ADAP by helping to conduct awareness sessions that focused on non-violent discipline
techniques and promoting positive parenting.117

4.9 Gender Equality, Equity and Child Rights
The evaluation framework included an additional criterion to assess how effectively the ADAP
Programme integrated UNICEF’s cross-cutting priorities, including gender equality, equity, and
child rights (including accountability). The evaluation examined the extent to which the
Programme, in its design, implementation, and results, addressed the specific needs of target
groups based on gender, age, adolescents with disabilities, and child rights considerations.
Furthermore, the evaluation assessed whether appropriate accountability measures were
established to gather feedback from beneficiaries and address their complaints.
EQ9 – To what extent did ADAP design, implementation and monitoring integrate
programming priorities of gender equality, equity, and child rights (including
accountability)?
The ADAP Programme was found to be partially aligned with gender equality principles. However,
the Programme design did not include interventions to address gender-specific determinants and
conditions of adolescent boys and girls. Some considerations were taken into account to align with
the cultural context where separate trainings were conducted for boys and girls. Additionally, the
Programme achieved equal participation of boys and girls, however, there was limited gender-
specific reporting on the evaluated results.
The evaluation found the Programme partially aligned with UNICEF’s Equity Agenda. Although the
Programme prioritised identification of vulnerable groups, the Results Framework did not include
specific targets for these groups. The Programme implementation did emphasize serving
vulnerable groups, particularly OOS and adolescents with disabilities. However, the evaluated
results lacked disaggregated data on equity indicators, such as the results achieved for vulnerable
groups, adolescents with disabilities, or those in remote locations.
The evaluation found the Programme was aligned with the CRC principles of non-discrimination,
best interests of the child, right to life, survival and development, and views of the child. Although
a feedback mechanism was established, beneficiaries were not adequately aware of it, and there
was insufficient evidence to determine how complaints and feedback were addressed by the
Programme.
4.9.1 Integration of Gender Equality in ADAP Programme
This sub-section presents key findings and analysis around the integration of gender equality in
the ADAP Programme. It also includes a brief analysis of how well the Programme is aligned with
the United Nations System-Wide Action Plan (UN-SWAP).122
Design:
59. The secondary and primary data indicated that several assessments123 were carried out to
identify gender-related needs, particularly after the COVID-19 outbreak. However, none of
these assessments were specifically intended or conducted for the ADAP Programme to
assess the gender needs of adolescent boys and girls.
60. The review of the Results Framework suggested a limited focus on gender disaggregated
targets. Only one outcome indicator124 and one output indicator125 have gender-disaggregated
targets. The agreements with IPs indicated a deliberate focus on outreach targets for both boys
and girls for different outputs.
Implementation:
61. The implementation of the ADAP Programme demonstrated a gender-sensitive approach, as
evidenced by the provision of separate training sessions for boys and girls, along with gender-

remaining three. The evaluation team’s assessment of the ADAP Programme’s compliance
and non-compliance with these gender equality indicators can be found in Appendix 21.
4.9.2 Alignment with UNICEF’s Equity Agenda
UNICEF’s Equity Agenda primarily focuses on providing a fair chance in life to every child,
everywhere – especially the most disadvantaged in hope of breaking intergenerational cycles of
inequity and poverty in every society.127 The following sub-sections provide findings on ADAP’s
alignment with the Equity Agenda at design, implementation and results levels.

70. The feedback obtained from discussions with OOS adolescents indicated appreciation for the
trainings. However, female respondents raised concerns about limited acceptance of their
acquired skills by their parents. This highlights the need for awareness-raising efforts to
improve parental acceptance and support for the skills learned by these adolescents.
71. Despite being identified as a priority or vulnerable group, no specific interventions were carried
out for adolescents in Area C, which is considered some of the most deprived and vulnerable
areas in the SoP.
Results:
72. The RAM Reports lacked information on equity indicators, such as outcomes attained for
vulnerable groups, disability, or location. Therefore, the evaluation team was unable to assess
the extent to which the ADAP Programme benefitted vulnerable adolescents.
4.9.3 Integration of Child Rights in ADAP Programme
73. The Programme design and implementation indicated integration of four guiding principles of
the CRC.128 Details are mentioned below:
o Non-discrimination:129 Both secondary and primary data suggested that the Programme
reached out to adolescents regardless of their ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, or
gender.
o Best interests of the child:130 The Programme’s objectives, strategies, and interventions
were planned and implemented with the best interests of the children in mind by all

stakeholders, including UN agencies, the public sector, and IPs. The main goal was to
empower children to reach their full potential and to take necessary measures to prevent
harm.
o Right to life, survival, and development:131 The Programme is aligned with the right to
development. Through vocational training and the promotion of non-violence and positive
discipline, the Programme provided opportunities for the personal growth and development
of adolescents.
o Views of the child:132 The findings suggested that there was little to no involvement of
adolescents in the design of the ADAP Programme. However, the field data reveals that
efforts were made to prioritize the views and participation of children and adolescents in
the implementation process, including monitoring.
4.9.4 Accountability in ADAP Programme
74. UNICEF SoP collaborated with the IPs on Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP)133
framework during the planning, implementing, and M&E of the ADAP Programme.134 The
framework ensured accountability and leveraged beneficiary feedback to inform redesign. IPs
reported the implementation of a dedicated feedback to collect inputs, experiences, and
suggestions from beneficiaries. This was facilitated through brochures or introductory sessions
in schools, as well as by providing a dedicated phone line and email for adolescents and
caregivers to register their complaints. The IPs were responsible for managing the system and
taking necessary actions based on the feedback received. However, the evaluation team did
not come across any complaint logs or documentary evidence of how the complaints and
feedback were addressed.
75. On the contrary, discussions with adolescents, parents, and school staff indicated that most of
them were not aware of any feedback system. Some adolescents mentioned seeing complaint
boxes in their communities, but they were unsure how they worked.
131 State parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child.

CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSION, LESSONS LEARNT, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This chapter presents the conclusions, lessons learnt, and recommendations of the evaluation. It
is primarily based on the evaluation findings and have been framed keeping in view the evaluation
objectives (including intended uses) and GEROS guidelines. Where appropriate, references are
made to the relevant evaluation findings for evidential substantiation.
5.1 Conclusions
The evaluation conclusions are presented with respect to the purpose and objectives of the
evaluation, taking into account both the strengths and limitations of the ADAP Programme. They
offer analysis and insights to inform UNICEF SoPCO’s future adolescent programming. It is
important for readers to note that the Programme being evaluated comprises 21 projects, each
with varying duration and focus.
Given the summative purpose of the evaluation and its focus on the achievement of planned
results, the evaluation concludes that the ADAP Programme was largely effective (particularly
the education component). This is demonstrated by the successful achievement of two out of three
outcome targets. The results were achieved despite the challenges posed by COVID-19 related
school closures and security issues in the SoP. The transition to remote teaching and learning,
and the successful integration of technology despite infrastructure and technical capacity
constraints, stands as a success factor and key strength of the Programme. The use of a hybrid
implementation model, involving both the public sector and IPs, also contributed to the
achievement of these outcomes. However, the skill-building component lacked a clear focus on
post-training support, which may have hindered the transition from learning to employment.
The evaluation team could not conclude the effectiveness of the CP component due to the
unavailability of relevant outcome data. This can partly be attributed to incomplete data and
tracking by the monitoring system. Additionally, the violence reduction interventions were of a
shorter duration and lacked a clear focus on community engagement, which could potentially
undermine the sustained results.
The Programme successfully prioritised challenges faced by adolescents (particularly
employment, entrepreneurship, civic participation, and violence reduction) in the SoP and among
development partners. The Programme contributed to the integration of LSCE into the national
education curriculum. It also fostered support from the public sector and UN agencies, leading to
the creation of the NYVSP under the aegis of the Prime Minister’s Office. Despite this success, the
NYVSP is not yet operational and needs further advocacy, as well as technical support, to fully
realise its potential. Once active, it is expected to facilitate opportunities that enable adolescents
to find networking and employment opportunities. For the above, it can be concluded that the
Programme has been instrumental in highlighting challenges faced by adolescents, fostering multi-
stakeholder partnerships, and promoting intersectoral collaboration.
Assessing against cross cutting evaluation criteria (OECD-DAC, humanitarian and UNICEF), the
evaluation concludes that the Programme is relevant for using available data to inform its design,
reflecting local and national contextual realities, and involving relevant public stakeholders.
However, there is room for improvement in engaging with adolescents, as they were not consulted
during the Programme design. The Programme is found to be largely effective in fully achieving
two out of three outcome results (education component only). Despite data limitations, the
evaluation deems the Programme cost efficient (for the education component only) as it achieved
76 per cent of its outputs using 68 per cent of allocated budget. The Programme’s design lacked
a defined impact statement, constraining impact assessment and conclusions. However, perceived
impact on adolescents has been observed, including skill and knowledge transfer, increased self-
confidence improved communication, and reduced violence. The policy-level results such as
integration of LSCE in national education curriculum are likely to be sustainable, however others
are less likely to be sustained (such as NYVSP, knowledge and skill development, and the
reduction of violence in schools and homes). The Programme’s coverage was largely effective,
but gaps were identified in addressing the unique needs of male adolescents and those living in
Area C. While the Programme aligns with national policies and plans, more focus is needed on
48
external coherence with other development actors to avoid duplication and address gaps. The
Programme exhibits connectedness with other UNICEF sections and the relevance SGDs. It
partially integrated and complied with UNICEF’s cross-cutting priorities, gender equality and
UNICEF’s equity agenda, but fully integrates child rights. Accountability was embedded in the
Programme’s design but merits more focus on implementation.
The evaluation includes lessons learnt and recommendations (refer to subsequent sections), thus
meets the evaluation objective in that respect.
Moving forward, the evaluation underlines the need for sustained focus on adolescents by all
stakeholders (public sector, private entities, development partners and others). Policy interventions
such as integration of LSCE and NYVSP are foundational and require continuous strategic and
operational support for sustainable outcomes. The hybrid implementation model (involving public,
private and CSO actors) has proven effective, particularly in facilitating the transition to remote
teaching and learning, and thus merits continuity. Increased advocacy and engagement with the
public sector should promote acceptance of private and CSOs’ involvement for niche interventions,
where these partners offer unique capacities and advantages.
Future engagement with adolescents should underpin regular interaction with them to understand
their challenges, frustrations, aspirations, and potential pathways. Education interventions should
emphasize infrastructure development and systemic capacities for remote/technology-based
teaching and learning. This is critical to pre-empt any future disruptions (like COVID-19 and
security challenges) and for engaging learning experiences. Skill building interventions must strike
a balance between pre/during training and post training focus. The evaluation underscores the
need for medium to long-term interventions for behaviour change, such as violence reduction,
positive parenting. These require sustained messaging and community engagement for
sustainability. Lastly, the next phase should prioritise an effective monitoring system for results
tracking and evidence-based decision-making.
5.2 Lessons Learnt
Given the evaluation’s focus on learning, this section presents key lessons learnt drawn from the
evaluation findings. These lessons capture both good practices and gaps that can guide future
programming. Each lesson has been articulated to underscore its wider relevance and applicability
in other contexts and sectors. Lastly, these learnings have been refined, taking into account
feedback from stakeholders.
• The Programme’s design and implementation were underpinned by innovative approaches.
One notable innovation was the use of gamification for promoting learning, particularly in
LSCE. This innovative approach proved to be an effective practice, leading to tangible
outcomes in increased critical thinking and problem-solving skills among adolescents. The
effectiveness of this gamification strategy not only suggests the potential for its replication and
scale-up within this Programme, but it also provides valuable insights for its potential
application across different sectors and contexts. It stands as a promising strategy to boost
adolescents’ engagement and participation, making learning more interactive and stimulating.
• The ADAP Programme (Education & Adolescent component) primarily focused on providing
pre/during training support to adolescents. However, the post-training support aimed at
fostering and improving the broader ecosystem for job creation and entrepreneurship was not
addressed. Consequently, due to this gap, there is insufficient evidence to showcase the
transition from learning to earning. This learning points out a potential design deficiency,
underlining the need to balance pre/during training and post-training support, including access
to capital financing, job placements, market access, and self-employment. This lesson learnt
is applicable across all contexts, especially in regions where the infrastructure for job
placements and entrepreneurship is less developed.
• The ADAP Programme (CP component) support for behaviour change interventions (non-
violent behaviours and positive parenting) had a short lifespan (six months to a year) and
lacked a consistent approach to community engagement. This undermined the sustainability
of these actions. Considering global evidence and feedback from participants, the lesson
learned is to plan behaviour change interventions with a medium to long-term lifecycle
49
approach (two years or more). Moreover, these should be centred around community
engagement interventions – organising and mobilising local youth groups, religious and
community leaders, to enable messaging through such platforms for sustainable results. This
lesson is applicable across sectors aiming for behavioural and normative changes, and
contexts, where local platforms or groups (usually existing in urban and rural communities)
are either readily available or could be mobilised for sustained messaging and localised
accountabilities.
5.3 Recommendations
The recommendations presented below are drawn from the evaluation findings and conclusions.
Stakeholders have expressed a keen interest in continuing support for adolescents’ skill
development and CP, as echoed during fieldwork discussions and validation workshop with the
ESC members. This intention has been appropriately factored into the framing of the
recommendations.
The process of developing these recommendations started during the data collection stage.
Stakeholders, including UNICEF, public sector partners, IPs, and communities, were invited to
propose measures for improving future design and implementation for adolescent boys and girls.
Additionally, feedback received on the draft evaluation report, a validation workshop (conducted
on May 30, 2023, and a meeting with the Programme team (July 10, 2023) has been considered
to refine these recommendations.
The recommendations are structured on two levels: the broader recommendation, which set outs
what needs to be done, followed by specific actions which expand on the ‘what’ and ‘how’. Each
action item has been purposefully linked to key findings and the relevant stakeholders (primary or
secondary) who are considered responsible to implement it. Moreover, the evaluation team has
assigned teach action a timeline135 and classified its priority status as high, medium, or low.
135 Immediate: 3-6 months, Short-term: 6-12 months and Medium-term: 1 to 2 years.

DESIGN-LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 1: Keeping in view the APD 2023-25 priorities for adolescent boys and girls, UNICEF SoP is advised to draft an ADAP Results Framework and
ToC (covering both components such as education & skill building and CP) for future guidance to develop projects/interventions and tracking of results.
Action # 1: Draft the ADAP Results Framework and ToC. The Results Framework must include impact statement and indicators, High/Short-term Primary: UNICEF
segregated outcomes and outputs, dedicated strategies, and underline allocation of resources for disadvantaged groups
(adolescents in Area C, adolescent girls and boys, adolescent with disabilities, OOS adolescents). [Effectiveness – Finding 22,
23, 24; Efficiency – Finding 15; Impact – Finding 28; Gender Equality – Findings 60, 64; Equity – Findings 67, 72]
Action # 2: The Results Framework and ToC should be endorsed by the MoE in a high-level event. The Results Framework and High/Short-term Primary: UNICEF
ToC can guide future engagement with relevant public sector partners. [Relevance – Finding 4, Effectiveness – Finding 18] and MoE
Recommendation 2: Based on the learning from the previous ADAP phase, the future ADAP strategies and interventions merit a re-think and recalibration to offer
better fit with the local context and achieve improved results for the vulnerable groups (adolescent boys and girls, adolescents with disabilities, and OOS
adolescents)
Action # 1: Within the Education & Adolescents component, the skills development interventions must strike balance between High/Medium-term Primary: UNICEF
pre/during training and post post-training support such as access to finance, market linkages, access to employers, and business Secondary: MoE
associations. If other players (public and private sectors) are involved, engage with them to provide support to trainees for the
above-listed interventions. [Impact – Finding 28, 29, Sustainability – Finding 37]
Action # 2: Establish a clear vulnerability criterion to ensure the systematic inclusion of vulnerable groups in its programming. This Medium/Immediate Primary: UNICEF
criterion should include various aspects, including location, age, gender, disability status, etc. Specific strategies should be
developed and implemented to address the unique needs of these vulnerable groups, such as providing tailored support and
accommodations for disabled adolescents during trainings. [Gender Equality – Finding 62; Equity – Finding 67 and 69]
IMPLEMENTATION-LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 3: The future ADAP implementation should focus on building public sector capacities to deliver inclusive education and fostering opportunities
for job promotion and skill development for adolescents.
Action # 1: Place added focus on building the capacity of the public sector in remote teaching and learning to ensure uninterrupted High/Immediate Primary: MoE
education for adolescents. This is critical given the potential risk of future disruptions in teaching and learning activities due to the Secondary:
unique security environment. (Primary Responsibility: MoE, Secondary Responsibility UNICEF) [Effectiveness - Section 4.3.2 UNICEF
Enabling Factors]
Action # 2: UNICEF should leverage its existing efforts by advocating with the MoE to integrate the remaining elements of LSCE High/Short-term Primary: UNICEF
into the national education curriculum. This should also entail supporting the MoE to train teachers to deliver LSCE appropriately. Secondary: MoE
[Sustainability – Finding 37]
Action # 3: Advocate for and provide support to operationalise the NYVSP. This platform can play a crucial role in promoting job Medium/Immediate Primary: UNICEF
creation by connecting adolescents with the private sector and CSO partners. [Sustainability – Finding 37] Secondary: MoE
SUSTAINABILITY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 4: For improved sustainability of ADAP interventions and results, the CP interventions design and duration need a careful re-thinking and longer
duration.
Action # 1: Engage directly with the adolescent boys and girls, parents, school staff and community leaders for future High/Immediate Primary: UNICEF
Programme design (including sustainability interventions) to understand and incorporate their opinions and aspirations (in terms Secondary: MoE
of differential needs, underlying causes, implications for adolescent boys and girls, available local strategies and solutions, and
others) into the design to make interventions and results more sustainable. [Relevance – Findings 3, 4 and Coverage –
Finding 41]
51
Recommendations Priority/Timeframe Responsibility
Action # 2: Advocate with key donors for longer-term interventions (3 years or more) to support behaviour change around positive High/Short-term Primary: UNICEF
parenting, non-violent behaviours, and other areas. Form longer-term partnerships with public sector and CSO partners to
implement CP interventions and assess progress towards impact. [Impact – Finding 33]
Action # 3: Emphasize community engagement in the implementation of behaviour change interventions to foster community High/Short-term Primary: UNICEF
ownership and create platforms for sustained messaging and localized actions. This may involve forming and supporting Secondary:
community groups, including adolescents, to implement and monitor local actions. [Sustainability – Finding 39] MoSD, MoE
M&E SYSTEM RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 5: The ADAP M&E system merits reconfiguration to effectively track progress and use data/evidence for decision making and adaptive
programming.
Action # 1: The ADAP Results Framework should guide the formulation of ADAP M&E Plan. The M&E indicators should be framed High/Immediate Primary: UNICEF
in a manner that enables tracking of both qualitative and quantitative changes in the lives of adolescents, such as quality of Secondary: IPs
education, adolescents' satisfaction, learning outcomes, and changes in behaviour or attitudes. The findings should be used to and MoE
inform programme planning, implementation, and decision-making. [Effectiveness – Finding 23]
Action # 2: Regularly review and assess the logic of the Results Framework and ToC in consultation with the MoE and IPs. Use Low/Medium-term Primary: UNICEF
monitoring data (received mid-year and annual reports) and other insights to re-assess and recalibrate the Results Framework and Secondary: IPs
ToC (if needed). [Effectiveness – Finding 24] and MoE
Action # 3: Undertake pre-implementation assessments and baselines, where appropriate, to inform design improvements. Data High/Immediate Primary: UNICEF
collection must include regular interaction and seeking inputs from adolescents and community groups to keep track of how Secondary: IPs
interventions are affecting them and if/what design and implementation recalibrations are needed. [Gender Equality – Finding and MoE
59, 60, 62, Effectiveness – Finding 24]
Action # 4: Organise regular internal/external reviews to track progress (including financial data) and use data and insights for High/Short-term Primary: UNICEF
adaptive programming/decision making. Drawing cost efficiency analysis and costs comparisons can enable prioritising strategies Secondary: IPs
and interventions that are more time/cost efficient. [Efficiency – Finding 15, Effectiveness – Finding 24] and MoE
Action # 5: Collect and analyse data across programming priorities such as gender, location, age, adolescents with disabilities, High/Short-term Primary: UNICEF
and OOS adolescents. Utilise this data to inform the Programme re-design to prioritise investments and interventions to meet the Secondary: IPs
needs of these groups. [Gender Equality – Finding 64, Equity – Finding 72] and MoE

Reporting to Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist
Duration Six months (working 50 per cent to allow periods for UNICEF and partner review,
and to allow periods for spacing of data collection)1
Start and end Date 12th September 2022 – 30 April 2022
I. PART ONE – External
I. 1. BPAACRKT GORNOEU –N EDx ternal
The State of Palestine (SoP) has a population of approximately 4.8 million, of which an estimated
2I. .9 milliPonA R(6T0 OpNerE c –e nEtx) teprenoapl le live in the West Bank and 1.9 million (40 per cent) in the Gaza
Strip. A continuous protracted protection crisis in the State of Palestine has left many Palestinians
struggling to live a life with dignity particularly women, children and people with disability. The
pI. rotractePdA RsiTtu OatNioEn –is E exxtaecrnearbl ated due to multiple factors; Israel’s military occupation, including
the closure of the Gaza Strip, lack of respect to international law, continuous internal Palestinian
political divisions, economic crises, and recurrent escalations of hostilities. Consequently, the lives
of 2.3 million Palestinian children and youth living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have been
significantly affected, making them vulnerable in a country where 45 per cent of the total population
is made up of children2.
Furthermore, 29.2 per cent of the State of Palestine’s population (53 per cent in the Gaza Strip
and 13.9 per cent in the West Bank) live below the national poverty line. The poor households are
projected to increase to 64 per cent in the Gaza Strip and 30 per cent in the West Bank according
to the estimates because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent Government
lockdown measures. The protracted humanitarian situation, coupled with the constrained
development environment have contributed to persistently high unemployment rates, particularly
for young people with 41 per cent of youth aged 15 to 24 years unemployed (29 per cent in the
West Bank and 61 per cent in the Gaza Strip). Girls have been affected the most as 61 per cent
of female youth are unemployed compared to 36 per cent of male youth. Due to the COVID-19
pandemic, the Palestinian economy has recorded a sharp decline, with the economy contracting
by 12 per cent during 2020, as the majority of the economic activities experienced setbacks.
Consequently, there is a decrease in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and a rise in
unemployment rates with new segments of the population entering the poverty cycle.
Additionally, children with the disabilities have limited access to health, education, and social
services according to a research study done in 2016. The spread of COVID-19 further aggravated
existing vulnerabilities, affecting the children’s well-being, and limiting boys’ and girls’ access to
essential services such as education and protection. As of 20 August 2021, since the COVID-19
outbreak in March 2020, there were 353,741 confirmed cases of COVID-19.
1 This period has been defined for the evaluation timeframe as per the current scope of the
evaluation.

2021-2023

1.1 INTRODUCTION OF THE SECTOR
There is a high enrollment rate for basic education in the SoP as according to the Multi-Indicator
Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019/20, with a total of 96.9 per cent children attending basic school.
However, there are persistent challenges in the education sector such as the drop out of adolescent
boys from basic education and low enrollment in Early Childhood Education (ECE). 2.8 per cent of
basic school aged children are out of school, and 21.5 per cent of secondary school aged children
are not in school. Furthermore, only 34.2 per cent of children aged 36-59 months are enrolled in
ECE and only 26 per cent of children in the poorest wealth quintile attend ECE (MICS 2019/20).
The education sector has been particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting over 1.4
million children specifically due to the intermittent closure of schools. The pandemic added burdens
onto an already strained education system where the operationalization of protocols for the safe
access to education and provision of quality learning remotely remains a significant challenge,
including paying teachers’ salaries in a timely manner. Addressing these challenges required a
large-scale systems approach. Responding to the pandemic to limit the disruption, schools moved
to distance learning programmes. However, in the Gaza Strip, the digital disadvantage facing
students is profound, with more than 575,000 (over 50 per cent of the school-aged population)
children and teenagers lacking access to computer equipment, reliable power supply and internet
service. Additionally, only 30 per cent of households in the Gaza Strip are estimated to have
access to the internet, although not often reliable.
There are multi-faceted concerns related to youth and adolescents. By age 15, nearly 25 per cent
of boys and 7 per cent of girls are reported to have dropped out of school, and similarly 22.5 per
cent of boys and 30 per cent of girls aged 6- 15 years with a disability have never enrolled in
school. The youth unemployment rates currently reach to 30 per cent in the West Bank and 64 per
cent in the Gaza Strip. Furthermore, there is a gap between educational skills currently acquired by
many young people and requirements in today’s job market, which in-turn affects their motivation
to continue learning.
In the SOP, children are exposed to violence, exploitation, and violations within the context of the
protracted humanitarian situation. 90.1 per cent of children aged between 1 to 14 years
experienced violent discipline at home and 20 per cent of children experienced severe physical
punishment (MICS 2019/20). Additionally, 44 per cent of children aged 12 to 17 years had been
exposed to violence by a member of the household during the previous 12 months (36 per cent in
the West Bank and 56 per cent in the Gaza Strip) as per the preliminary results of a study by
PCBS, 2019. Furthermore, nearly two thirds (63 per cent) of children were exposed to
psychological violence, 26 per cent were exposed to physical violence from their fathers, and 24.8
per cent were exposed to physical violence from their mothers. Moreover, 13.4 per cent of women
aged 20-24 years were married before reaching the age of 18 years (16.5 per cent in the Gaza
Strip and 11.4 per cent in the West Bank). This percentage has decreased compared to 2014 as
24 per cent of women aged 20-24 years were married before reaching the age of 18 years in 2014.
The socio-economic impact of the pandemic has further increased pressure on families, increasing
the chances that vulnerable children resort to negative coping mechanisms, and in some cases
exposing children to increased risk of violence at home.
1.2 PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The expected outcome of the education Programme, under which the UNICEF Youth and
Adolescents Programme falls, is “By 2022, more Palestinian children and adolescents, especially
the most vulnerable, benefit from improved access to quality and inclusive learning opportunities
in safe and protected environments and are enabled to contribute to their community and national
development”. Similarly, the education Programme has two outputs contributing to the above
outcome: (i) Policy makers and key stakeholders have coordinated and developed evidence-
based, gender-responsive education and youth reform policies; and (ii) Service providers have
increased capacity to deliver quality, inclusive education and provide opportunities to adolescents
to develop and practice life-skills and citizenship education, including in humanitarian settings.
1.3 PROGRAM THEORY OF CHANGE
56
There are three key preconditions (outcomes) identified to contribute towards the goal of Education
and Adolescent Programme as illustrated in Theory of Change of Education and Adolescent
Programme of SOP in below Figure 1.
Figure 1. Theory of Change of Education and Adolescent programme
The UNICEF Education and Adolescents Programme in SoP has a strategic approach to reach
out to the most vulnerable children, from early childhood through to adolescence, focusing on
access to and the quality of early childhood and basic education and other learning opportunities.
For the adolescents and youth age group, the life skills and citizenship education initiative has
been supported to promote a knowledge society for improved education outcomes and
economic and social development and improved employment and entrepreneurship.
Recognizing the inequities within society, and disparities of opportunity within the State of
Palestine, the strategy maintained a particular focus on children who are the most vulnerable. In
relation to adolescents,
UNICEF SOP has also promoted the participation and civic engagement of adolescents, under
social inclusion and communication initiatives managed by the Social Protection and
Communication teams. A systematic procedure was followed to recruit the adolescents in the
entrepreneurship and civic engagement skill related activities. Under the life-skills and citizenship
education framework and in collaboration with schools, communities, non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) and the private sector, the skills of adolescents for entrepreneurship have
been developed alongside opportunities to practice.
Likewise, technical support has been continuously provided to the Ministry of Education136 and
other partners to develop the national framework for life-skills education and institutionalize
humanitarian response coordination. Moreover, another strategy is establishing a strong cross-
sectoral linkage with the Child Protection and Communications sectors for the reduction of violence
against children and adolescents in and out of schools.

2. RESULTS TO DATE
UNICEF has been working with the Ministry of Education, the Youth Council, CSOs and other
partners to support in improvements of adolescents’ skills, knowledge and capacity in the State of
Palestine. UNICEF worked with UN agencies and the private sector to leverage support from the
Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to lead the Generation Unlimited (GenU) initiatives. An MoU
between UNICEF, UNFPA, and UNDP has been established to support the development of a
national youth volunteering programme under the PMO.
UNICEF supports national efforts to improve the quality of education in the State of Palestine while
supporting the development of skills that children and young people need for employment and to
cope with life challenges and promoting citizenship education (LSCE). UNICEF works to ensure
that children grow-up and learn in violence-free environments and are protected when accessing
school in sensitive areas of the West Bank. To combat and reduce violence in and out of schools,
UNICEF uses a behavioral change approach to challenge the acceptance of violence and social
disruption in society. Changes are achieved by working with parents, teachers and children to
raise awareness of the impact of regular exposure to violence and the negative effect on children
who are exposed to harsh emotional and physical discipline. UNICEF is also implementing
Communication for Development (C4D) campaigns using social media and communication tools
to promote the importance of non-violence and create behavioral change. To advance LSCE in
schools, UNICEF works closely with the Palestinian Ministry of Education. Furthermore, UNICEF
and its partners are developing innovative programs using gamification of learning and offering
internships and career counseling with companies in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including
East Jerusalem.
As co-lead of the Education cluster, UNICEF helps to provide children at-risk areas of the West
Bank with safe access to schools. Children who suffer the effects of trauma and stress are also
more at risk of falling behind in their education, so UNICEF provides critical remedial education
opportunities and school supplies in the Gaza Strip to help children catch up on their education
and to stay in school. Through its partner, UNICEF enabled 12,632 grades 7-9 children to continue
learning during the first few months of COVID-19 by integrating its DEAL platform with the MoE
portal to support learning through gamification. DEAL is an innovation that uses gamification of
learning and developing coding skills for students in grades 7-9. It is a platform for interactive peer-
to-peer learning and exchanges that allows students to interact and learn in groups and teachers
to both deliver continuous guidance to students and monitor progress. To reach the most vulnerable
children, including girls, children in marginalized areas such as Area C, H2 in Hebron, East
Jerusalem, and most of the Gaza Strip, UNICEF has procured 3,496 tablets to enable children
access remote learning. The children targeted faced challenges in accessing distance learning
opportunities due to a lack of access to the internet and their inability to afford computers or tablets
for distance learning.
Similarly, in partnership with UNESCO, UNICEF is technically engaged and seeking to use this
opportunity to develop long-term comprehensive distance learning solutions. A weak life-skills
focus, and predominance of remote-learning and teaching are some of the factors that drive high
drop-out rates among adolescent boys (25 per cent) and difficult school-to-work transitions. The
need for mainstreaming life skills and citizenship education into the national education system is
recognized in the 2020 revision to the Educational Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) for 2017-2022 of
the MOE. A partnership to support youth and adolescents has been leveraged under the prime
minister’s leadership to support the national youth service programme. An MoU with the PMO,
Higher Council for Youth and Sports, UNFPA, UNDP, and UNICEF has been established for the
National Volunteer Service Programme (NYVSP) pilot phase. UNICEF has provided national UNVs
(one each) based at the PMO and UNFPA offices to enhance the capacity to coordinate these
initiatives.
UNICEF continued its partnership with local partners and provided 1,585 adolescents aged 10-18
(982 female) with entrepreneurial and civic engagement skills. Of these, 100 (30 Females) were
Out of School Adolescents from the Gaza Strip aged 15-18 and were integrated in a one-year
professional vocational diploma in six different TVET topics (smartphone repair, photography and
montage, solar energy, plumbing, domestic electricity) including a two-month internship in local
58
companies and workshops to support their employment. UNICEF with UNFPA, UNDP, Ministry of
Entrepreneurship & Empowerment, private sector and academia mentored and empowered five
teams of young people to develop and implement innovative ideas to contribute to their community
as part of the global Youth Challenge initiative. Initially, ten teams of young people were supported
to design solutions to improve education and civic engagement, and the five best ideas were
supported and mentored to develop their ideas, with the two best teams selected to compete
globally with 80 other teams from 40 countries.
Due to COVID-19, teacher trainings related to COVID were prioritized. With UNICEF support, all
44,712 teachers in all 2259 PA schools (26739 Females) were trained on how to operationalize
COVID-19 prevention and control in schools. This number includes 703 teachers trained to integrate
life skills in their classroom teaching. The UNICEF target for 2020 was to train 4,000 teachers,
and this target was over- achieved mainly due to the emerging needs with the necessary systems
approach to train all teachers in the country on COVID-19 prevention and control in schools as
part of the school re-opening strategy.

3. PURPOSE OF THE ASSIGNMENT
This evaluation aims to assess the contribution of the Adolescent and Youth Programme on the
priorities of the government, evaluate relevancy of Adolescent and Youth Programme and identify
promising practices and lessons learnt from the ADAP and cross-sectoral partnerships in the State
of Palestine (SoP).
The specific objectives of the evaluation include:
Specific Objectives:
i. Assess the project’s performance using standard OECD evaluation criteria (relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, and impact and sustainability) and humanitarian action criteria
(connectedness, coherence, coverage) in assessing Adolescent and Youth Programme
and how cross-cutting issues such as a human rights-based approach to programming
(HRBAP), gender equality and equity and disability has been addressed or
recommendations of mainstreaming the cross-cutting issues mentioned.
ii. Assess and identify the gaps between the UNICEF Adolescent and Youth strategy and the
National Youth Strategy in their implementation to provide evidence and recommendations
for making the UNICEF Adolescent and Youth strategy more effective, efficient and result
oriented. This will include how well the programme is: aligned and integrated with the
UNICEF Adolescent and Youth Strategy; and embedded within national/ local policies and
service delivery mechanisms.
iii. Determine the achievement of UNICEF’s accountability objectives in ensuring relevance,
performance and quality of the various projects to the key stakeholders.
iv. Provide evidence for UNICEF to advance its advocacy efforts in the Adolescent sector
basing upon the findings around the OECD criteria of relevance, efficiency, effectiveness,
impact and sustainability.
137 NOTE: Internal discussions have identified this as a difficult indicator to measure and may need to be suspended.
60
v. Identify key lessons learnt of the ADAP project, extrapolate the scalability in light of
partners’ similar projects, document the issues/challenges encountered by the project and
provide recommendations for such ADAP projects implemented by UNICEF and the wider
youth sector stakeholders in SoP.
3.2 USE AND AUDIENCE OF EVALUATION
The findings, recommendations and lessons learned from this evaluation will be used to identify
and implement strategies for enhancing the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability
and impact of the Adolescent and Youth Programme. The evaluation’s target audience will be
UNICEF, the relevant Ministries, other UN agencies, donors, beneficiaries and partners.
The findings and lessons learned will be shared with local community members, actors involved in
the Adolescent and Youth sector, stakeholders, implementing partners and relevant likeminded
institutions. The actors and other stakeholders not directly involved or concerned with this
evaluation will be the secondary audiences and users of the evaluation report such as UNICEF
Regional Offices and UNICEF HQ as the lessons learnt, good/best practices would contribute to
strategic thinking around integrated approaches to Adolescent and Youth programmes in the
region.
4. SCOPE OF EVALUATION
This summative evaluation will focus on the Adolescent and Youth projects implemented by
UNICEF in the State of Palestine. It will cover the 21 projects mentioned under the section 2 “result
to date section”. The evaluation will cover UNICEF projects covering the implementation period
from 2018-2021 and will incorporate all related data, information, and documentation available.
The61ctober61cen scope will assess the Adolescents projects implemented by UNICEF (as laid
out in UNICEF State of Palestine Strategy Note for 2018-2022) in terms of alignment to the
National Youth Strategy, other sectoral Adolescents plans and related policies, such as the
National Adolescents Strategy, and the youth Sectoral Policies. The evaluation will focus on
lessons learned, promising practices, areas of improvement and future strategies to broaden the
Adolescents sector.
The evaluation will cover all target groups of the project and specifically direct and indirect
beneficiaries of the projects, including households, stakeholders, contractors, management
committees, NGOs, and ministries.
This evaluation does not cover UNICEF functions in Education cluster coordination in the State
of Palestine.
Geographically, the evaluation will cover the selected locations in the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank. The evaluation will cover all Adolescents implementing partners and donors.
In every stage of the summative evaluation, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD)- Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria will be used (relevance,
efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability, impact, coverage, coherence, and connectedness).
Because of the protracted and complex situation, additional criteria for evaluating humanitarian
action including connectedness, coherence, and coverage will also be considered. The evaluation
will present lessons learned, promising practices and recommendations for future Adolescent’s
programing, while also adopting an approach that integrates the cross-cutting themes gender,
human rights, disability and equity throughout the evaluation and applied across the analysis of
the programmes.
5. EVALUATION QUESTIONS
The evaluation will be aligned but not limited to all six criteria recommended by the Development
Assistance Committee (DAC), of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD). Below are indicative questions for each criteria and the evaluation team for this evaluation
are recommended to elaborate on the list of questions during the submission of their inception
report. The evaluation questions will be discussed and finalized with UNICEF and the technical
61
committee during the inception phase. Furthermore, the evaluation will include an additional
criterion for evaluating humanitarian action, focusing on connectedness, coherence, and coverage.

138 Measure, the extent to which the intervention has generated or is expected to generate significant positive or negative, intended or unintended, higher-
level effects (e.g., holistic and enduring changes in the systems or norms, and potential effects on well-being of Adolescents and Youth, human rights, gender
equality and the environment).

interventions in relief/recovery/development?
• To what extent did the ADAP programme link to any transition strategies in the context or
sustainable development goals?
Cross-sectoral questions (HRBAP, Equity, and Disability)
The evaluation team should approach its work and guided by human rights conventions, equity-
based approach, human rights-based approach in programming (HRBAP), AAP, PSEA, disability
and gender equality focusing on the following questions which should be taken into consideration
across the range of criteria above:
• Was the project aligned with UNICEF’s equity agenda in addressing the needs of the target
groups, ages, genders and differently abled people (i.e. to what extent has the initiative
reached or engaged different groups including the most marginalized)?
• To what extent has UNICEF Adolescent and Youth Programme reduced gender-based,
geographical, disability-based or economic-based inequalities?
• What measures were put in place to incorporate cross-cutting themes like gender,
children’s rights, disability, and accountability?
The evaluation team can propose additional sub-questions as relevant.
6. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
This evaluation intends to deploy a mix of a qualitative and quantitative approaches; however, the
evaluation team should take account within the evaluation methodology to consider the COVID-19
pandemic. In addition, ethical approval needs to be obtained before moving to the field level
activities in the evaluation. Both data generated through qualitative and quantitative data will be
disaggregated by gender in order to appropriately compare to baselines and targets values. The
most relevant and appropriate probability sampling should be considered for the quantitative data
collection that will enable statistical inferences while purposive sampling can be used for the
qualitative data collection. Additionally, the analysis should be gender sensitive by disaggregating
the evaluation data by sex, age and disability to determine the benefits of the program on different
gender and social categories.
An indicative methodology that can be deployed for both the quantitative and qualitative data
collections are detailed below, but not restricted only to this list:
• Secondary data: This will include a desk review of documents which will provide empirical
evidence as well as to be used in assessing the project across governorates in SoP
• Primary data collection through quantitative and qualitative methods. A balance of
quantitative and qualitative data collection should be used for the evaluation.
▪ Quantitative methods may include:
o Survey of beneficiary adolescents (e.g., perception or satisfaction surveys with
representative sample of the beneficiaries (adolescents) into consideration total number
of beneficiaries benefited from different types of ADAP intervention per district).
o The evaluation will use available routine monitoring data from the project database
disaggregated by sex and age.
▪ Qualitative data collection methods should be balanced based on the type of
information and evaluation questions; these could include:
o Focus group discussion (FGD) with local partners, beneficiaries, relevant Ministries,
other key stakeholders.
o Key informant interviews (KII) with key stakeholders’ including national
representativeness which will be a challenge during primary data collection. However,
the sample design must include at least one district from each of the seven provinces.
o Structured and semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholders.
o Participant observation in field visits to implementing partners, youth clubs, etc.
63
This evaluation will also take into consideration a rights-based approach and participatory
methodology to ensure children and youth are engaged and are part of the evaluation to enhance
ownership of the findings. In line with the Standards for UN Evaluation in the UN System
(developed by the UN Evaluation Group), all of those engaged in designing, conducting and
managing evaluation activities must aspire to conduct high quality and ethical work guided by
professional standards and ethical and moral principles. The consultancy firm will follow the
UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research and Evaluation, Data Collection and
Analysis. It must identify actual or potential ethical issues, as well as measures and methods
adopted to mitigate these issues. The evaluation should also ensure adequate adherence to
UNICEF evaluation’s quality assurance criteria and processes and proper coverage of limitations.
The evaluation process will be guided by the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)
which spells out the rights to protection and education from all forms of child abuse, neglect,
exploitation and cruelty, including the right to special protection in times of war and protection from
abuse in the criminal justice system. In addition to the CRC, the evaluation process will be guided
by other important treaties reinforcing rights that concern children. At the international level, these
include the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
(CEDAW), which is particularly pertinent to the rights of girls, and the 2006 Convention on the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), which the European Union ratified in 2010.
RESOURCES FOR DESK REVIEW
UNICEF will work closely with the Evaluation Consulting Firms(s) in providing primary and
secondary data. This will include (but not limited) the following resources:
• Conducting a desk review of UNICEF project documents and work plans, monitoring
reports including three-monthly and yearly reports, workshop reports, strategies, etc.
• All relevant project related documents disaggregated data and results.
• Reviewing UNICEF’s relevant Work Plans, strategy notes and Theory of Change of
Adolescents programme
• Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) studies conducted by partners.
• Programme Cooperation Agreements and Programme Documents between UNICEF and
local partners
• Contribution Agreements extensions
• Mid-term reviews and relevant formative/ summative evaluations Results-Oriented
Monitoring documentation done by independent consultants.
• Project progress reports in 2018, 2019,2020 and 2021.
• All relevant project related documents, disaggregated data and results for all projects
listed in the ToR. Note that the evaluation will cover the ADAP prorgramme from 2018 till
end of 2021
• Programmatic records of implementing partners.
• Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) latest collected in 2019/20
• Socio-Economic and Food Security Survey (SEFSec) Survey (PCBS)
• UNICEF’s relevant Work Plans, strategy notes and Theory of Change of ADAP
programme. I will include these documents.
• Youth National Strategy.
• National Intersectoral strategy to end violence against children.
• Previous evaluation reports, including the evaluation of the non-violence projects.
6.2 EVALUABILITY AND POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS TO EVALUATION
There are several limitations to the evaluability of this project
a) The COVID1-19 pandemic posing travel restrictions, restrictions on gathering and physical
contact will greatly influence on evaluability of the Adolescent and Youth Programme
related projects or approaches to be designed for the evaluation.
b) The protracted crisis may constrain or restrict access during the data collection and might
affect the evaluation exercise.
64
c) Benefits and costs that can be covered are within a certain limited range; not capturing
all possible social benefits and costs either numerically or qualitatively. This evaluation
recognizes that there might be a limit to the cost analysis that can be conducted on such
an Adolescents’ project, particularly given the long-term impacts of Adolescents projects
on systems, and communities.
d) The response rate may be low in certain areas owing to the fact that some communities
are conservative and may not openly participate in the evaluation questions.
e) The sensitivity of talking directly to children and households who have benefited from the
various activities due to the confidentiality principle. It is suggested that the evaluation
team overcome these challenges by signing non-disclosure agreements; and seeking the
agreement of the implementing partners. Also, when interviewing children (minors)
consent should be taken from the parents or guardians.
f) There is no database of partners’ monitoring data and each partner will have their own
reports. To undertake this evaluation the firm should access monitoring data from the
Ministries and partners, but this may not always be available.
g) There is no reference to disaggregated baseline data.
h) Availability of staff and partners for the evaluation exercise might lead to some limitations
due to heavy workloads and commitments elsewhere. Ad hoc problems caused due to
difficult working conditions.
Evaluability assessments will be conducted before undertaking an intensive evaluation to assess
whether reliable and credible answers can be given to the initially prioritized evaluation questions
based on an assessment of information requirements and available knowledge. To conduct the
evaluability assessment, the consultant team will reference country’s COVID-19 situation,
government rules and regulations on travel, gathering and physical contact, the logical framework,
assess the availability of disaggregated baseline data, indicator, targets, output, and outcome data
available through Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) information. UNICEF SoP and the
implementing partners will make available the relevant information to conduct an evaluability
assessment to the consultant team members before the actual commencement of the evaluation.
In the event evaluability will not be established in certain areas, the evaluator must take measures
to address the problem, such as reconstructing the theory of change, readjusting the evaluation
scope or timing or consulting the evaluation commissioner in order to revise the expectations.
7. DISSEMINATION STRATEGIES
The findings of this evaluation will be disseminated, made available and usable to various
audiences through a wide variety of channels or formats to influence change in programs, policies,
or practices. The dissemination strategies channels and formats should take into account the needs
of different audiences, the type of information to be distributed and its purpose. UNICEF SoP is
proposing the use of print formats, such as brochures, one-page descriptions, newsletters,
executive summaries, or technical reports for the public, conference and workshop participants, or
policymakers, other actors and the donor.
The company will ensure that the final draft is edited for external circulation.

Appendix 2: Country and Sector Contexts
The State of Palestine (SoP) is located in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The
SoP consists of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. The total population
is approximately 4.9 million (2021),142 of which an estimated 2.9 million people are located in the
West Bank while 1.6 million143 are located in the Gaza Strip. Almost three quarters of the population
live in urban areas, compared to 17 per cent in rural areas and 9 per cent in refugee camps.144
The population is predominantly young (39 per cent are under the age of 15 years and 30 per cent
are aged 15 to 29 years), and is likely to remain so in the coming decades, given high fertility rates
(3.7 in the West Bank and 4.5 in the Gaza Strip).145 The population has almost doubled over the
past 50 years and is projected to double again to roughly 9.8 million by 2050.146 Furthermore, 29.2
per cent of Palestinian population (13.9 per cent in the West Bank and 53 per cent in the Gaza
Strip), live below the national poverty line which has further estimated to increase to 64 per cent in
the Gaza Strip and 30 per cent in the West Bank due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated
government lockdown measures.147 The overall socioeconomic conditions in the Palestinian
territories (West Bank and the Gaza Strip) deteriorated throughout the early months in 2021, driven
by the COVID-19 pandemic, political instability, increasing tensions, and a dire development
situation further worsened the situation for the habitants of the region.148 The protracted situation
in the region further exacerbated the condition due to multiple factors; Israel’s military occupation,
including the closure of the Gaza Strip, lack of respect to international law, continuous internal
Palestinian political divisions, economic crises, and recurrent escalations of hostilities.
Consequently, the lives of 2.3 million Palestinian children and youth living in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip have been significantly affected, making them vulnerable in a country where 45 per cent
of the total population is made up of children.149 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Palestinian
economy has recorded a sharp decline, with the economy contracting by 12 per cent during 2020,
as the majority of the economic activities experienced setbacks. Consequently, there is a decrease
in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and a rise in unemployment rates with new
segments of the population entering the poverty cycle.150
The SoP has witnessed a mixture
of successes and challenges with
respect to its state of
development.151 The State of
Palestine has achieved the
Education for all goals, with a net
attendance rate of 97 per cent at
basic level and 72 per cent in
secondary level. Completion
rates are overall good in the State
of Palestine, especially in lower grades, but decline significantly for secondary education, with only
62 per cent attending secondary school to completion. Disparities along sex, region, and socio-
economic status are clearly reflected in the share of children from different groups completing each
level of education.152 There is a sharp increase in out-of-school children at the secondary level,
with overall more than one fifth of children aged 16 to 17 out of school. This increase is most
marked among rural children and children from the poorest quintile, who present out-of-school
rates at the secondary level of 28 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. Out-of-school rates are

higher across the board. Adolescents from the poorest wealth quintile of the population are twice
as likely to be out of school than children from the richest quintile.153
The conflict has further contributed to creating barriers that prevent children from realizing their
right to quality education with lack of schools and classrooms, psychosocial impacts of the conflict
on children, attacks, and threats of attacks on schools, students and teachers, and other
interferences with education
(expanded further in the adjacent
visual).154 In addition, some groups
in the State of Palestine are more
vulnerable than others. Children
with disabilities are one such
group, with little access to health,
education, social welfare, and
other basic services. Research
conducted in 2016 found that
nearly 38 per cent of children with
disabilities are out of school
entirely and less than 45 per cent
are enrolled in regular
education.155 Adolescent girls and
boys are yet another group with
high vulnerability, driven by factors
such as patriarchal social norms,
early marriage, and exposure to
violence. There are many factors
that prevent persons with
disabilities from attending school,
including inadequate
infrastructure, lack of appropriate
staff at schools, stereotypes, and
other socio-cultural norms and
practices. Accessibility to and
availability of formal education for
persons with disabilities is
paramount.156
Israel’s military occupation is
another important factor
exacerbating the overall human
rights situation is the occupied
Palestinian territory. Due to
intermittent military operations in
the Gaza Strip and West bank, the
Palestinian population particularly
the children have been suffering on many fronts. According to recent news from Save the Children
in occupied Palestinian territory, the number of children killed by Israeli security forces and settlers
in the West Bank has doubled to 34 in 2022 as compared to 17 in 2021.157 Year 2022 has become
the deadliest year for children in the West Bank in over 15 years.158 Recent reports from the
OHCHR revealed that 261 Palestinians were killed, including 67 children during the 11-day
escalation in the Gaza Strip in May 2021.159 In August 2022, Israeli forces conducted targeted

airstrikes in multiple locations in the Gaza Strip and retaliation from Palestinian armed groups. The
escalation of hostilities resulted in the death of 49 Palestinians, including 17 children and four
women, 360 injured, including at least 151 children and 58 women, and damage to approximately
2,000 housing units, among others. Structured and specialized MHPSS services for 10,500 people
(50 per cent children) directly impacted by the escalation.160
About 19 per cent of the children attending school in the West Bank dropped out of school during
the current school year (2021-2022), with 19.8 per cent of all school-aged boys and 13.6 per cent
of school-aged girls reportedly dropping out. The main reasons why children reportedly dropped
out were protection risks of a political character while traveling to and from school, including
violence or harassment from Israeli soldiers, forces, or settlers, and school closures. Schools being
demolished or under threat of demolition was provided as a reason for children to drop out of
school.161 More than half of the adolescents reported lack of interest in education as the main
reason for dropping out of school. Interestingly, maltreatment by teachers is the last cited reason;
however, consultations with adolescents and youth that took place for this analysis revealed that
the theme of violence in school is very much present, both between students and by teachers on
students.162
On the other hand, violence
against children is also of serious
concern where 23 per cent of
children (31 per cent in the Gaza
Strip and 17 per cent in the West
Bank) are exposed to severe
corporal punishment.163
Adolescents are generally
exposed to high levels of violence.
Nearly half of the adolescents
aged 12-17 have experienced any
form of violence, with boys more
likely to be the victims than girls.
Violence in school is also
widespread, with boys being more
frequently the victims.164 In the
last 20 years, an estimated 10,000
Palestinian children have been
held in the Israeli military
detention system. The most
common charge brought against
children is stone throwing, for
which the maximum sentence is
20 years. A majority reported they
had endured a distressing or
violent arrest or detention, in most
cases at night; a coercive
interrogation environment;
physical and emotional abuse in
detention; and a denial of
essential services including an
adequate education – all of which constitute a breach of their rights enshrined in international law
(expanded further in the adjacent visual).165

Repeated and prolonged exposure to such high levels of stress resulting from the cycles of conflict
and deprivation can be detrimental, particularly to children, as it has far-reaching ramifications on
their physiological and emotional well-being, as well as their behavioural and neurological
development. These negative effects, in turn, reduce children’s ability to learn in school and
become future productive individuals. In fact, the education sector already suffers from a lack of
sufficient school buildings, leading to the practice of double shifts, with total of 422 public schools
operating in 299 buildings, 278 UNRWA schools operating in 179 buildings, and 64 private schools.
In other words, any damage to the school building accommodating two shifts would potentially
impede the education of a significant number of students.166
The protracted humanitarian situation, coupled with the constrained development environment
have contributed to persistently high unemployment rates, particularly for young people with 41
per cent of youth aged 15 to 24 years unemployed (29 per cent in the West Bank and 61 per cent
in the Gaza Strip). Girls have been affected the most as 61 per cent of female youth are
unemployed compared to 36 per cent of male youth.167 Technical and vocational educational
training is not a fancied choice. In 2018, only 3 per cent of adolescents in grade 10-12 chose a
vocational education.168 The preferred specialisations are industrial for boys and home economics
for girls. The industrial specialisation is by far the most popular choice. The absolute number of
students with disabilities in vocational education is very low, but the exact proportion is not
known.169
Opportunities for adolescents to actively participate and take responsibility in their communities
remain limited, especially for girls who have very limited access to suitable services and safe
recreational spaces, due to an environment marked by economic hardship, violence, conflict, and
a lack of career prospects.170

and implement strategies for enhancing the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability and
impact of the Adolescent and Youth Programme. The evaluation’s target audience will be UNICEF,
the relevant Ministries, other UN agencies, donors, beneficiaries and partners. The findings and
lessons learned will be shared with local community members, actors involved in the Adolescent and
Youth sector, stakeholders, implementing partners and relevant likeminded institutions. The actors
and other stakeholders not directly involved or concerned with this evaluation will be the secondary
audiences and users of the evaluation report such as UNICEF Regional Offices and UNICEF HQ as
the lessons learnt, good/best practices would contribute to strategic thinking around integrated
approaches to Adolescent and Youth programmes in the region.
This summative evaluation will focus on the Adolescent and Youth projects implemented by UNICEF
in the State of Palestine. It will cover the 21 projects mentioned under the section 2 “result to date
section” in the ToR. The evaluation will cover UNICEF projects covering the implementation period
from 2018-2021 and will incorporate all related data, information, and documentation available. The
evaluation scope will not be limited to the National Youth Strategy but will confirm the alignment of
Adolescents projects implemented by UNICEF with the Theory of Change for the Adolescents
Programme as laid out in the UNICEF State of Palestine Strategy Note for 2018-2022, other sectoral
Adolescents plans and related policies, such as the National Adolescents Strategy, and the youth
Sectoral Policies. The evaluation will focus on lessons learned, best practices, areas of improvement
and future strategies to broaden the Adolescents sector.
The evaluation will cover all target groups of the project and specifically direct and indirect beneficiaries
of the projects, including households, stakeholders, contractors, management committees, NGOs, and
ministries. This evaluation does not cover UNICEF functions in cluster coordination in the State of
Palestine.
Geographically, the evaluation will cover the selected locations in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
The evaluation will cover all Adolescents implementing partners and donors. In every stage of the
summative evaluation, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)-
Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria will be used (relevance, efficiency, effectiveness,
sustainability, impact, equity and human rights issues). Because of the protracted and complex
situation, additional criteria for evaluating humanitarian action including connectedness, coherence,
and coverage will also be considered. The evaluation will present lessons learned, best practices
and recommendations for future Adolescent’s programing, while also adopting an approach that
integrates the aspects of gender, human rights and equity throughout the evaluation and applied
across the analysis of the programmes.
The specific objectives of the evaluation:
1. Assess the project’s performance using standard OECD evaluation criteria (relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, and impact and sustainability) and humanitarian action criteria
(connectedness, coherence, coverage) in assessing Adolescent and Youth Programme and
how cross-cutting issues such as a human rights-based approach to programming (HRBAP),
gender equality and equity has been addressed or recommendations of mainstreaming the
cross- cutting issues mentioned
112
2. Assess and identify the gaps between the UNICEF Adolescent and Youth strategy and the
National Youth Strategy in their implementation to provide evidence and recommendations for
making the UNICEF Adolescent and Youth strategy more effective, efficient and result oriented.
This will include how well the programme is: aligned and integrated with the UNICEF Adolescent
and Youth Strategy; and embedded within national/ local policies and service delivery
mechanisms.
3. Determine the achievement of UNICEF’s accountability objectives in ensuring relevance,
4. performance and quality of the various projects to the key stakeholders.
5. Provide evidence for UNICEF to advance its advocacy efforts in the Adolescent sector basing
upon the findings around the OECD criteria of relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and
sustainability.
6. Identify key lessons learnt of the ADAP project, extrapolate the scalability in light of partners’
similar projects, document the issues/challenges encountered by the project and provide
recommendations for such ADAP projects implemented by UNICEF and the wider youth sector
stakeholders in SoP.
2. Purpose of the Evaluation Steering Committee

Appendix 17: Efficiency Analysis
Methodology:
• A Likert scale was developed to measure the achievement of each indicator, ranging from 1 (not achieved) to 5 (fully achieved), with
corresponding per centage ranges:
Fully Achieved (5) Mostly Achieved (4) Slightly Achieved (3) Least Achieved (2) Not Achieved (1)
81 - 100 per cent 61 - 80 per cent 41 - 60 per cent 21 - 40 per cent 0 - 20 per cent
• Progress against each indicator was rated on the Likert scale based on the level of achievement. For examples, if an indicator was
fully achieved, it was rated 5. The average Likert score was calculated for each output, as multiple indicators contribute to it. The final
per centage achieved for an output was determined by adding the average scores of each indicator and dividing by the total number
of indicators. For example, if an output had two indicators, the final per centage achieved would be calculated as (95.5 + 75.5) / 2 =
85.5.
• The evaluation assumed that the budget allocation for each year remained the same. Therefore, the budget for one year was
subtracted to bring it within the evaluation scope of 2018-2021. The total budget utilization from 2018-2021 was provided, and the
per centage of the budget utilized to achieve the set targets was calculated by dividing the total utilization by the total budget for 2018-
2021.

Impartiality • In response to the May escalation in the Gaza Strip, UNICEF and partners provided recreational activities to support the well-being and Mental Health
Independence and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) for over 55,000 children and adolescents. With UNICEF support, over 74,000 (50 per cent girls) vulnerable
children were provided with essential stationery kits and 3,019 children were provided with tablets to enable them access remote learning, while 20
schools damaged during the the Gaza Strip escalation were rehabilitated providing safe learning environment for 46,200 children.223
• UNICEF provided a consultant to the MoE to enhance the MoE’s capacity in planning and responding to education in emergencies. In response to
COVID-19 the consultant supported the development of the Recovery and Protection Priorities (2021-2022) plan for the MoE which was launched in
September 2021. Access to education is also impacted by the hostilities between Israel and State of Palestine. Establishment of a protection thematic
working group has been prioritized in the Recovery and Protection plan.224

• 51 laptops and 51 computers have been provided to marginalized schools in the West Bank to support teachers in providing distance learning.225
• 4,610 children from Area C, Hebron H2, and East Jerusalem, facing violence during their daily school commutes were supported with comprehensive
safe access interventions including psycho-social and recreational activities in the targeted areas serving as safe hubs.226
• UNICEF, as cluster lead coordinated the Gaza Strip escalation response into three key thematic groups of (i) Rehabilitation, (ii) Data and assessments
(iii) Summer activities and MHPSS. UNICEF coordinated the rehabilitation group and successfully mobilized resources from partners for all the
rehabilitation of all the damaged public schools.227
• As Education Cluster lead, UNICEF successfully coordinated the Gaza Strip escalation response plan, education component of MSNA, HNO/HRP.
Through the education cluster, UNICEF also advocated for children’s safety and facilitated safe access to schools through protective presence partners
in the H2 area of Hebron.228
• UNICEF provided technical and financial support to the development and roll out of the NIVACS which was launched in 2021. The NIVACS offers a
framework for comprehensive, inter-sectoral and coordinated procedures to prevent and address violence against children.229
• The UNICEF target for 2021 was to train 4,000 teachers. However, this target was over-achieved mainly due to an emerging need because of the 11
days of hostilities in May 2021 and necessitated training all teachers in The Gaza Strip on PFA (psychological first aid) to identify and support children
requiring PFA.230
• With UNICEF technical and financial support, at least 18,664 adolescents aged 12-30 years (57 per cent females) from marginalized communities
were equipped with digital (2,334 adolescents), entrepreneurial, and civic engagement skills.231
Child Protection Component:
• In the Gaza Strip, 2,280 teachers and supervisors (2088) principals (96) and counsellors (96) were trained on positive discipline and non-violence; and
1,331 teachers (1,210) and school counsellors (121) were trained on rights of children with disabilities including preventing violence against children
with disabilities. Additionally, UNICEF strengthened the capacity of families to prevent violence against children at home, reaching 3,175 caregivers
(78 per cent female) in the Gaza Strip with parental awareness sessions on positive discipline and non-violence plus 928 parents of young children (84
per cent female); and 103 mothers of children with disabilities in the West Bank.232
• UNICEF continued to improve protection of children from grave violations and continued to coordinate un-vetted documentation and verification of
grave violations against children, manage the CAAC database and lead drafting of high quality CAAC reports. In 2021, 1,735 incidents including grave
violations were verified, affecting 6,534 children (as of Q3), compared to 2,334 incidents affecting 3,102 children in the same period in 2020. This
included the verified killing of 85 Palestinian and 2 Israeli children and injury of a further 320 Palestinian and seven Israeli children in conflict-related
incidents. Data on grave violations informed the Humanitarian Needs Overview and UNICEF programming and was used in briefings and advocacy to
improve the situation of children.233
