Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In order to make some meaningful contribution in addressing the challenges related to girls’ education,
their school completion, early marriage and effective contribution to Zambia’s economy, UNICEF in
partnership with the Ministry of General Education has provided financial support to implement the
Zambian Girls 2030: Realising My Potential Programme (2016–2018). The programme has been
implemented in Northern and Southern Provinces targeting four districts in each province: Mungwi,
Luwingu, Mbala and Mpulungu in the Northern Province and Pemba, Sinazongwe, Namwala and
Monze in the Southern province. The programme aims to support the Government of Zambia to
achieve its Vision 2030, which is to be “A prosperous Middle-income Nation by 2030”. The focus of
the programme is to empower girls through career and skills mentoring, guidance, entrepreneurship
skills development, financial literacy education and an internship opportunity, and to provide girls with
the professional training and networks to succeed. Restless Development was the implementing
partner, and financial and technical assistance and guidance were provided by Ministry of General
Education and UNICEF.
The Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) was contracted by UNICEF to conduct an
end line evaluation of the Zambian Girls 2030 Programme. The specific objectives of the evaluation,
as specified in the ToR (See Annex 8.1) were to:
1. assess the programme’s effectiveness and evaluate the extent to which the programme achieved
its intended results at output and outcome level;
2. assess the programme’s efficiency, and evaluate how well have programme resources (financial,
human and technical) been used to achieve the results;
3. assess the programme’s relevance and evaluate to what extent the programme design and
intervention responded to the needs and priorities of the beneficiaries as well as the strategic
priorities of the Ministry of General Education;
4. assess the programme’s sustainability, and evaluate whether, without external support, key
conditions and factors are in place for the programme to continue to exist and be effective/efficient;
and
5. finally, assess the programme’s equity focus, and evaluate the extent to which the programme
addressed inequalities in gender barriers to stay in school, gain interest in Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects, and successfully integrate into the labour market.
The evaluation relied on secondary literature review and qualitative data collection from 30 schools
across 4 districts. This included 1,368 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) at the school, district and
provincial level with pupils, school leaders, Guidance and Counselling Teachers, Provincial Education
Officers (PEOs), District Education Officers (DEOs), and other stakeholders. In addition, the
evaluation team conducted 30 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with parents and caregivers at the
school level. In total around 300 parents and caregivers were included in the discussions.
The findings under each objective are as follows:
Effectiveness
The project has made significant strides in improving girl’s transition rates, in reducing pregnancy
rates and in increasing re-admissions in both Northern and Southern provinces.
Among the three components of the programme, career and skills clubs were reported to be the most
effective. The clubs were effective because majority of the girls had access to clubs, which were a
regular affair at the school level. The project established a shift in the pupils thought process regarding
Page 8 of 136
ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence
Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
the choice of careers and higher education after the children attended the career clubs and after
hearing about the career camps and internships from fellow pupils who had attended them.
The project targeted three outputs, which were covered under the programme components:
1. by 2018, 11,200 girls between Grades 5 to 12 are to be trained or sensitised on: career
guidance, reproductive health and re-entry policy through participation in school clubs to
facilitate girls being retained in school or to transition girls to tertiary education;
2. by 2018, 1,200 adolescent girls are to acquire knowledge and skills on leadership,
employability and career options, entrepreneurship (to make informed decisions about staying
in school), transitioning to higher education and future career paths; and
3. the Ministry of General Education is to increase capacity to implement and monitor the national
Career Guidance standards at School level.
While the project met 10 out of the 11 indicators at the output level, the performance against the
following indicator fell short of the target:
• girls receiving the integrated package on Career Guidance and Sexual Reproductive Health,
life skills (financial literacy and entrepreneurship skills through clubs) [Target: 11,200;
Achievement: 9,811]
The project has seen significant improvements from baseline to end line in the number of pupils
actively participating in clubs (2,489 to 14,846), establishing personal savings plans (11 per cent to
54 per cent), transitioning from Grade 9 to 10 (47.2 per cent to 57.1 per cent), re-admissions after
delivery (9 per cent to 82.1 per cent), enrolment in the internship programme (from 0 girls to 423).
Efficiency
Managerial and coordination efficiency was observed at the school level. The evaluation findings
showed the project sufficiently financed its school activities, such as career clubs and training of
Guidance and Counselling Teachers, and the schools are using the resources efficiently to the best
of their capability. According to some stakeholders there is a need for strengthening the training of
teachers on reporting and on exploring the option of digital reporting to minimise travel of teachers for
reporting purposes. Integrating the reporting on programme components within the routine school
reports may also help in sustaining the reporting, without burdening the school system. Also, the
stakeholders suggested decentralising career camps and internships to bring cost efficiencies in the
programme.
Relevance
The end line evaluation found that the objectives of the programme were consistent with its goals and
the implementation strategy was relevant to the programme targets. The project was initiated in
August 2016 when several indicators at school level in Zambia related to dropouts, retention of girls
and early pregnancies, in Northern and Southern provinces in particular, were unsatisfactory. The
project objectives planned outputs and outcomes were all aligned within the priorities of the Ministry
of General Education in relation to improving transition rates and to overall improve gender parity.
The project was in line with the Seventh National Development and Zambia 2030 goals of becoming
middle-income economy.
The relevance of the project was also seen from the implementation aspect. The project
implementation was widely accepted and praised by the stakeholders at the provincial and district
level, as well as by the targeted beneficiaries. The stakeholders reported decline in the rate of girls’
absenteeism, reduction in the dropout rates, improvement in the transition rates across grades,
Page 9 of 136

Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
decline in the incidence of teenage pregnancies and increase in the numbers for re-admissions after
pregnancy.
Sustainability
The project model was sustainable and scalable across all three components, although in varying
degrees. The career clubs were successful in establishing processes as they were being run by the
Guidance and Counselling Teachers, who were a part of the education system. One key constraining
factor for sustainability of the career camps and internships was their resource intensive nature and
the level of coordination and communication that was needed to be maintained with all the
stakeholders. Therefore, these two components needed to be more decentralised.
Equity
The programme approach included equity as one of its defining criteria. Poverty, accessibility of
school, gender, and children with special education needs and disabilities were some of the key
aspects of vulnerability that the programme design targeted to address under its equitable approach.
In the absence of credible data on children with special education needs, a focused approach for such
children within the project was not possible. However, the default position at the school level career
and skills clubs as well as at career camps and internships was to include vulnerable children and
those with special education needs. Gender equality and equity was practiced in the programme
activities as reported by an overwhelming majority of pupils.
Conclusion
The Zambian Girls 2030 programme has been found to be relevant, efficient, effective and equitable
in its approach. The school level career clubs are sustainable, although it cannot be said with the
same level of authority about the career camps and internships which require sustained coordination
and investments. The programme has made successful inroads into the community, which has played
an important role in the success of the programme, particularly around the issue of dropouts,
progression from Grade 7 to higher grades, absenteeism, early marriage, teenage pregnancies and
re-entry into school. The Ministry of General Education along with the provincial and district level staff
and school leaders and Guidance and Counselling Teachers have been fully involved in the
programme. The boys have been active participants of the school level career clubs, but reportedly
felt left out when it came to career camps and internships. The Ministry of General Education may
therefore like to consider boys’ demand for the next phases keeping in mind that it may lead to the
requirement of additional funds. The schools need to manage the records of children who have
graduated, and of those with special education needs in the community. The end line evaluation
yielded four lessons: (1) Periodic monitoring is critical, (2) funds are required, (3) reporting by teachers
is tedious, and (4) internships are to be held within the province. Overall, the programme has
performed well and by addressing some of the issues outlined in the recommendations and lessons
learned, it is expected to achieve its goals in the future phases as well.
Recommendations
Key recommendations emerged from discussions with various stakeholders involved in the designing
and implementation of the Zambian Girls 2030 programme. The stakeholders were school leaders,
Guidance and Counselling Teachers, Directorate of Teacher Education and Specialized Services
(TESS), District and Provincial Education Officials, Restless Development and UNICEF.
Recommendations are also drawn from analysing parents and caregivers’ perceptions and by
reviewing relevant programme documents. Detailed recommendations are provided in Chapter 6:

Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
• Landscape analysis and decentralised programme activities—The project would be easier to
implement and would be more cost effective if career camps and internships were decentralised
at district level. However, prior to the decentralisation, a thorough landscape analysis, in line with
international best practices, is important to accurately assess the capacity and appetite of
corporates and Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) to participate in the programme.
• Written communication plan and record keeping—The communication across UNICEF,
Restless Development and Ministry of General Education was cited as satisfactory by all three
groups, as the progress meetings happened quarterly. It can be further streamlined by having a
clear written system and protocol of communication, which is established at the very beginning of
the programme. Records of meeting and discussions across all levels, right up to the schools,
should be maintained to serve the twin purpose of accountability and reference for action.
• Costing exercise for a sustainable scale up plan—Prior to the scale up of the programme, it
would be useful to conduct a review of the budget allocation to aid the programme planners in
rationalising the costs against each component.
• National framework for engagement with corporates—Programmes of greater public good like
the Zambian Girls 2030 could benefit immensely from a continued engagement with corporates
and PSEs. To sustain the initiative, a national framework for engaging with corporates should be
developed to institutionalise the process and provide guidance to the corporates for continued
support to such programmes.
• Rationalise the timeframe of internships—The corporate respondents who hosted the
internships reported the period of internship to be short and suggested increasing it to a minimum
of one month.
• Age-appropriate curriculum for financial literacy and entrepreneurship training—Simplified
age and education level appropriate curriculum content for financial literacy and entrepreneurship
trainings for the upper primary grades (Grade 5–7) should be developed to ensure that these
concepts are appropriately understood by the pupils.
• Gender equity needs to continue as the central focus of programmes—The programme has
been successful in maintaining the gender equity focus. The efforts at the school level career
clubs have been useful in breaking gender stereotypes, both among boys and girls. There is
greater acceptance of girls in leadership roles at the clubs, their financial independence, career
choices, etc. Gender equity needs to continue as the central focus of all future programmes in the
education sector.

Chapter 1. Background and programme description
1.1. Introduction to the report
This report presents the end line evaluation of the Zambian Girls 2030 Programme Phase I,
implemented from August 2016 to December 2018. The end line evaluation was conducted in the
period September 2019–December 2020 by an independent international team1 led by the Australian
Council for Educational Research (ACER). It would be pertinent to mention here that the original end
date of the evaluation was December 2019. However, owing to factors beyond the control of the
evaluation team and later due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation got delayed resulting in data
collection during July–September 2020. The team would like to reassure the readers and stakeholders
that the delay did not in any manner impact the findings of the evaluation.
The evaluation was managed by an evaluation management team of UNICEF and the Ministry of
General Education (MoGE) with technical support provided by a reference group comprising of
members from UNICEF, MoGE and Restless Development. The evaluation focuses on outcomes
obtained by the programme interventions after 28 months of its implementation.
This report consists of nine chapters including annexes. This first chapter provides the background to
the evaluation and is followed by chapters 2 and 3 that present the evaluation purpose, objectives
and scope. Chapter 4 explains the evaluation approach and methodology. Chapter 5 presents an
analysis of the main outcomes that were obtained under the different outcome areas of the Zambian
Girls 2030 programme and presents the main findings on the evaluation criteria specified in the terms
of reference (ToR, see Annex i)). Chapter 6 presents the main evaluation conclusions and chapter 7
presents the evaluation recommendations. The final section, chapter 8 includes all annexes.
1.2. Social and economic situation in Zambia
Zambia is a landlocked country located in the interior plateau of Southern Africa, with an estimated
population of 18.4 million in 2020 covering 752,614 square kilometres.2 It is a member of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) regional grouping. Zambia has enjoyed a period of stable
political environment and good internal security since its independence in 1964 in contrast to most of
the countries it borders.3
Following a successful economy growth of about 6.8 per cent GDP between 2000 and 2014, the
country achieved middle income status in 2011. However, Zambia’s economic performance has
stalled in the recent years, due to falling copper prices and declines in agricultural output and hydro-
electric power generation due to insufficient rains. This resulted in the decline of the GDP growth rate
to 3.1 per cent per annum between 2015 and 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the
macroeconomic vulnerabilities in Zambia. In 2019, economic growth declined significantly, from 4 per
cent (2018) to 1.4 per cent.4 The level of poverty remains high with 54.4 per cent of the population
living below the national poverty line (76.6 per cent in rural areas and 23.4 per cent in urban areas)
and 40.8 per cent living in extreme poverty (60.8 per cent in rural areas and 12.8 per cent in urban
areas).5 The Human Development Index is 143 out of 189 countries.6

Extreme poverty is prevalent in Zambia, particularly in rural areas. Children, adolescents, young
persons and women comprise the most vulnerable groups who experience greater burdens from
inequalities. The strategic focus of the Government is to address low levels of employment, invest in
rural development and reduce widening inequalities. In its national planning, the Government utilises
several strategies to achieve socioeconomic transformation for a “prosperous middle-income”
Zambia. For example, the Public Service Transformation Programme aims to make the public service
more responsive, service-oriented and accountable in the delivery of timely quality services. The
Government’s plan to operationalise the Industrial Development Commission aims to accelerate the
process of the transformation of the economy through optimal use of resources. In the context of
sustainable development, socioeconomic transformation means not only achieving social change and
a strong economy, but also building resilient and empowered human capital: a prerequisite for
effective democracy. Inclusive economic growth requires a healthy and educated population with the
requisite skills to take advantage of opportunities in an ever more interconnected global economic

environment. Furthermore, an educated and empowered population is the backbone of any
democratic system.8
1.3. Education sector planning
In 2006, the Government of the Republic of Zambia developed its first long term plan: the National
Long Term Vision 2030 (Vision 2030) articulating Zambia’s goals by the year 2030.9 The vision is to
become “A Prosperous Middle Income Nation by 2030”. Attaining education for all is one of the key
development goals of the Vision.
The importance of education is also strongly stated in the current Seventh National Development Plan
(7NDP) for the period 2017–2021. The 7NDP provides a detailed strategy for the achievement of the
long-term goals outlined in the Vision 2030. The Ministry of Education formulated the National
Implementation Framework (NIF III) as the main strategic tool for the operational implementation of
the Sixth National Development Plan (SNDP) for 2011–2015 which was later extended to 2016.10
In 2018, the MoGE conducted a comprehensive Education Sector Analysis (ESA) that highlighted the
context and trends in the general education sector in Zambia, sector performance, achievements and
constraints.11 The ESA also provided recommendations for Education & Skills Sector Plan (ESSP) for
the period of 2017–2021, which replaced NIF III 2011–2016.
1.4. Education policy context
At international level, Zambia is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child (UNCRC), Education for All (EFA) goals, United Nations Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) and more recently the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
At country level, in addition to the planning of the education sector, the development of the education
policies in Zambia has also been central to the improvement of the education system since
independence in 1964.
Figure 1: Initiatives by Government of the Republic of Zambia in Education sector
In addition to the above, three educational policies have been put in place specifically related to
supporting girls’ education. In 1997, Zambia launched the School Re-entry Policy that aimed at
improving access and retention for girls and allowed girls who dropped out of school due to pregnancy
to be re-admitted in school after giving birth.12 In 2011, the 50-50 Enrolment Policy introduced to
address the issue of gender parity in primary and secondary education and enhance equity between

Also, the Gender Equity and Equality Act was passed in 2015 which established the Gender Equity
and Equality Commission and expounded its functions, as well as outlined principles of achieving
gender equity and equality.14
1.5. Education system
Zambia has achieved remarkable progress in expanding access and improving equity in education at
primary and secondary education levels. Overall, according to the Educational Statistical Bulletin
2018, the total number of pupils enrolled in primary and secondary education increased from
4,139,390 in 2017 to 4,200,597 in 2018 with the annual growth of 1.8 per cent and percentage change
of 1.5 per cent between 2017 and 2018.15 Although at primary level (Grades 1–7) the total gross
enrolment rate (GER) in 2018 was 102.4 per cent, the net enrolment rate (NER) was only 83.6 per
cent (see Table 2). However, the total GER and NER at secondary level (Grades 8–12) were much
lower than at the primary level, with GER at 47.6 per cent and NER at 20.2 per cent (see Error!
Reference source not found.). Although the NER of girls at primary level is higher by 4.4 per cent
than NER of boys, at the secondary level it is 2.4 per cent lower (see Error! Reference source not
found. and Table 2).

As highlighted by the 2018 ESA, the education system has required capacity to enrol all primary
school aged children of ages 7–13 years but fails to do so on account of varied factors. About one
third of places in primary schools are taken by children repeating years and those either under- or
over-aged, which delays the enrolment of appropriately aged children: less than 50 per cent of seven-
year-olds enrolled in Grade 1.16 Whereas the junior secondary level (Grades 8 and 9) can provide
access only to two-thirds of children finishing primary school, and senior secondary education can
accommodate only 50 per cent of children who complete junior secondary level.
Gender disparities in enrolment at the secondary school level are largely due to high dropout
rates of girls.
In addition to these limitations in the
Table 3: Out-of-school Children
education system, some families
cannot afford sending their children to
secondary school because the
education at that level is not free.
Although education at primary level is
free, there are some additional
associated costs.17
Source: Educational Statistical Bulletin 2018, MoGE, Zambia
Based on the data from Educational Statistical Bulletin 2018, the number of out-of-school children
aged 7–13 years decreased by 10.8 per cent between 2016 (249,586) and 2018 (222,436), but the
number remains large: 5.3 per cent of the total primary school enrolment in 2018. The number of boys
out of school exceeds that of girls by about 7 per cent; indicating a large gender gap. However, the
situation is opposite among secondary school age children where the number of out-of-school girls is
significantly higher than boys (see Table 3), indicating that secondary school aged girls are more
likely to be out of school than boys of the same age and this difference increases with age.
The number of out-of-school children also includes those who have once attended school but have
dropped out.

In all grades (except Grades 1 and 2 where the dropout rate among boys and girls is equal) the
dropout rate of girls is much higher than boys, and in higher grades (7, 9, 10 and 11) it is either two
or three times larger (see Error! Reference source not found.). Overall, girls are about three to four
times more likely to drop out than boys.18
As part of the global initiative on out-of-school children, UNICEF conducted a study on out-of-school
children in Zambia in 2014 and identified the following gender-related sociocultural factors that cause
drop out (girls at a higher rate than boys): early sexual debut and intergenerational sex, teenage
pregnancies, sexual abuse, early marriages, opportunity cost associated with girls’ school
attendance, unfriendly school infrastructures for girls, gendered roles and responsibilities, and child
labour (boys at a higher rate than girls).19
Table 4 shows that the implementation of the School Re-entry Policy has made good progress in
bringing girls back to school. While nearly 51 per cent girls were readmitted in primary school, the
proportion of readmissions in secondary schools was even better at nearly 69 per cent.
School closures due to COVID-19 has resulted in disruption of learning for more than 4.2 million
children and adolescents. As children are out of school, the risk is higher that vulnerable children will
not return. The children, especially girls, being out of school will increase the risk of teenaged
pregnancy, sexual abuse, child marriage and other dangers. To mitigate the impact of this situation,
the MoGE has developed an education contingency plan for COVID-19, which will ensure pupils
are engaged in learning in their homes.20

A very small increase of 1.6 per cent is observed in the transition rate from Grade 7 to 8, and 2 per
cent from Grade 9 and 10 between 2017 and 2018 (see Figures 4 and 5). The Grades 7 to 8 transition
rate of girls is higher than that of boys by 1.8 per cent, but the situation is reversed in the transition
from Grade 9 to 10, where girls’ transition rate is 1.5 per cent lower than for boys.

According to UNESCO, the factors that limit girls’ progression at secondary level are early marriages
or early pregnancies, low appreciation for girl child education, gender-based violence, inadequate
sanitation facilities in schools, and the burden of care caused by the HIV and AIDS epidemic.21

In 2018 the completion rates for Grades 7, 9 and 12 were 97.3 per cent, 77.0 per cent and 36.0 per
cent respectively (see Table 5). Between 2017 and 2018, it was observed that the completion rates
for Grades 7, 9, and 12 increased, however in Grade 12 the completion rate of girls was much lower
than the completion rate of boys.
Although at the primary level, the education system is very close to achieving gender parity (see Table
6), at secondary school level there is still gender disparity favouring boys’ education with gender parity
index decreasing to 0.85. The main reason for this is that the girls are exposed to the gendered nature
of society with gender-based sociocultural practices establishing roles for certain work, for example
household work, and the resulting opportunity costs of education. 22

Analysing the Education Sector Public Expenditure in Zambia, the World Bank found that while the
quantitative indicators of education sector have improved, the learning outcomes have been
persistently low.23
Despite successful expansion of access to education, Zambia has some of the lowest academic
achievements as measured by standardised national and regional testing.24 Previous national
assessments (2012 Grade Five National Assessment) showed that pupils’ scores are below the 40th
percentile (35.3 per cent in reading in English and 39.4 per cent in mathematics), which was
established by the Ministry of Education as the minimum performance standard at that time.25
SACMEQ II and III assessments show that the performance of Zambian learners is unsatisfactory
and much lower than that of most of the other countries in this region. In SACMEQ II, Zambia was
13th out of 14 countries in reading and 12th in mathematics26. These results were even worse in the

subsequent round of assessment SACMEQ III, when Zambia was 14th out of 15 countries in reading
and 15th in mathematics.27
Zambia’s learners demonstrated an average score of 440.1 in reading and 435.2 in mathematics
in the SACMEQ II assessment, which is below the regional mean of 500 of all countries that
participated in this assessment in that region.28 The same trend is observed in SACMEQ III
assessment results.
The reading mean score for boys in SACMEQ III was 437.1 and is lower than the score 439.8 in
SACMEQ II. The reading mean score for girls in SACMEQ III was 431.5 and 440.7 score reported in
SACMEQ II. Both boys and girls had mean scores lower than the overall SACMEQ II mean score of
500and the SACMEQ III mean score of 512 for reading and 509.7 for mathematics.29
Both in SACMEQ II and III mathematics assessment there is a gap in performance by gender, boys
performed better than girls. In the reading assessment, although girls achieved a slightly higher mean
score than boys in SACMEQ II. This is reversed with substantial difference in SACMEQ III where the
mean score of girls is much lower than the mean score of boys.
The above analyses of the key education indicators in Zambia demonstrate that while girls enrol into
primary school at a slightly higher rate than boys, girls have lower rates of enrolment in secondary
education, transition into upper secondary education, higher dropout rate both in primary and
secondary education, and lower completion rates. The low participation of girls in education in Zambia
may pose a threat not only to the achievement of SDG 4, but also in other SDGs, and therefore create
wide gender disparities in all sectors.
As per a 2016 report by a Parliamentary Committee on Science, Technology and Education, learning
areas of Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics (STEM) education was a challenge in
Zambia due to shortage of teachers, particularly at the secondary level.30
Furthermore, the female-to-male ratio in tertiary education is 0.75:1, and the literacy rates among 15-
to 24-year-old females are much lower than their male counterparts. The proportion of females
employed in Zambia is only 34.1 per cent.31 These low education and employment indicators take
Zambia to a very low rank in the Gender Inequality Index: 143 of the 189 countries and territories in
2017.32 One of the main reasons of low employment rates is the lack of availability of sufficient number
of technical and vocational education and training facilities in Zambia. As per 7NDP, in 2015, there
were a total of 24,636 candidates that were assessed and certified under Technical Education &
Vocational Training Authority (TEVETA). This is against a total of about 6.9 million people in the 2014
Labour Force Survey reported to have never received any skill training.33 The number of candidates
who took TEVETA increased to 33,274 in 2017,34 however, despite the increase, an overwhelming
majority of people in the labour force are out of the TEVET system.
As per a study conducted by the International Youth Foundation in 2014, even though only 10 per
cent of jobs in Zambia are in the formal sector, young people generally wanted to work in the formal
sector for the prestige, higher wages and consistent income compared to the informal sector. Both
nursing and teaching were popular and desirable forms of employment in both urban and rural areas,
particularly for women. Other popular sectors for young job seekers were the telecommunications

industry and mining. Other popular jobs for women were trading, retail, hairdressing and beauty.
Young women were also interested in working in the tourism industry, as well as catering, tailoring
and administrative services. Trading was also common for men, though men and women tended to
trade in different goods. Women were more likely to sell food and clothing, while men were more likely
to sell airtime, electrical goods, newspapers and DVDs. Other jobs, such as taxi and bus driving, those
in the construction and engineering fields, and car mechanics, were almost exclusively male
dominated.35
1.6. UNICEF’s support to the Ministry of General Education
UNICEF Zambia has been providing focused support to the MoGE in delivering education services
from early childhood to secondary schooling. At secondary level, UNICEF has been involved in
helping girls stay in school given the proven benefits of additional years of education for girls, such
as stronger career prospects, lower chances of teenage pregnancy and child marriage. Through the
Zambian Girls 2030 project, help is being provided on financial literacy, life skills, career guidance
and internships to adolescent girls. Under technical assistance to the Ministry, UNICEF has been
working on better collection and use of education data, including through school-level profiles
developed for every primary school in the country. Furthermore, based on global evidence and
findings from an on-going Zambia-based pilot, UNICEF has been supporting MoGE to scale
“Teaching at the Right Level” from Grade 3 through to Grade 5.36
1.7. Programme description
In continuation of its ongoing support to MoGE, UNICEF in partnership with the Ministry provided
financial and technical support to implement a pilot project—Zambian Girls 2030: Realizing my
potential programme (August 2016–December 2018). The programme was implemented in Northern
and Southern Provinces targeting four districts in each province namely: Mungwi, Luwingu, Mbala &
Mpulungu in the Northern Province and Pemba, Sinazongwe, Namwala and Monze in the Southern
province. Twenty-five schools were covered in each of these districts. The provinces and districts
were selected based on poverty, gender and education indicators and consultations with the MoGE.37
As per World Bank data, 50.2 per cent households in the Northern Province and 42 per cent
households in the Southern Province were afflicted with extreme poverty.38 These provinces also
have high incidence of child marriage and the Northern Province had the highest incidence in 2017
and the highest school dropout rates among girls.39
The programme aimed to support the Government of Zambia to achieve Vision 2030 “A prosperous
Middle-income Nation by 2030”. The focus of the programme was girls’ empowerment through career
and skills mentoring and guidance, entrepreneurship and financial literacy education, and an
internship opportunity, and providing girls with the professional training, skills, mentoring and networks
to succeed.40

Additionally, the programme also improved transition rates for girls from primary to secondary
education and increased secondary school completion, increased number of girls entering tertiary
education, as well as supported girls in employability and entrepreneurial skills, thereby increasing
gender equality in the formal labour market in Zambia.41
The programme included school level career and skills clubs, district level career and skills camps
and career internship programme. The details of each component are depicted in Figure 7 below:

Figure 7: Programme Design
Key results of the programme included:
• 11,200 girls participated in school-level Career and Skills Clubs;
• 800 girls participated in annual district-level Career and Skills Camps; and
• 300 girls enrolled in Career Internship Programme.
The programme was also expected to contribute to higher-level outcomes over time and achieve the
following:
1. an improvement in transition rates for girls from primary to secondary education;
2. an increase in secondary school completion;
3. an increase in the number of girls entering tertiary education;
4. an increase in the number of girls acquiring employability skills;
5. an increase in the number of girls acquiring entrepreneurial skills to enter the formal labour
market; and
6. an increase in gender equality in the formal labour market in Zambia.
In addition, to leverage these interventions and complement the outcomes, UNICEF’s core work in
education during this programme has been to support girls to stay in school and complete Grade 12,
address issues affecting girls transition and retention in the education system including early marriage
and early pregnancy, and support MoGE in implementing the revised learner-centred curriculum that
incorporates Creative and Technology Studies (CTS) from Grade 1 and Financial Literacy from Grade
8 onwards.42 In addition to these efforts, a communications campaign to support girls’ empowerment,
promote quality learning outcomes and to ensure an educated, productive citizenry have been
undertaken. This layered support has provided a more holistic approach to empowering girls in
42 Zambia Education Curriculum Framework 2013.

relation to personal growth, education attainment, financial literacy, career choices and
entrepreneurship opportunity.
To achieve these outcomes, MoGE, UNICEF and Restless Development along with the Directorate
of Teacher Education and Specialized Services (TESS), Provincial Education Officials and District
Education Officials continue to provide the technical assistance to the programme.
1.8. Project resourcing
The total programme budget is 1,062,000 GBP, of which 814,983.08 GBP was fixed for programme
implementation.
1.9. Roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders
The programme has been led by the Ministry of General Education through its team of Guidance and
Counselling officers and teachers who have been responsible for running the guidance and
counselling sessions under the programme through school-based career clubs. In this endeavour,
they have been supported by National Provincial and District level staff. UNICEF has provided
technical and financial assistance to the Ministry. In addition to this, UNICEF has been monitoring
and providing supportive supervision to the implementing partner. Restless Development has been
the implementing partner responsible for providing training, hand holding and monitoring support to
the programme. Besides this, Restless Development has also been responsible for organising the
district level career camps and internships for the selected girls. The learners, community members
and leaders have been the rights holders of the programme. While the learners have been the key
recipients of services under the programme and leaders of change, the community has played the
role of an equal stakeholder by ensuring that the initiatives like completion of school, readmission,
absenteeism, teenage pregnancy, etc. were effectively addressed.

2.1 Purpose
The primary purpose of the end line evaluation (as specified in the ToR) was to assess the
effectiveness, efficiency, relevance and sustainability of phase I (2016 – 2018) of the programme
implementation. Based on the findings and conclusions from the assessment of the programme’s
achievements, the evaluation provides the lessons learned and recommendations from the
implementation of the programme activities and the outcomes achieved, which will be useful to the
MoGE, UNICEF and other stakeholders to improve the design and delivery of phase II as well as
scaling up of the programme, and to inform policies and strategies on girls’ education and skills
development.
In addition, the evaluation also responded to the accountability requirements of the Zambian Girls
2030 programme funder, other agencies within the consortium, programme participants and the
placements in which the programme was delivered.
2.2 Objective
The overall objective of the evaluation was to conduct a detailed review and analysis of the three
components of Zambian Girls 2030 programme to inform the Government of Republic of Zambia,
UNICEF and Restless Development regarding the performance of the programme, the challenges
faced in its implementation and the aspects of its sustainability. The results of the evaluation aimed
to assist the key stakeholders in decisions regarding the scalability of the programme and related
policy spinoffs in girls’ education and skills development. The main objective of the evaluation
therefore was to measure the achievement of the targeted programme outcome and outputs, vis-a-
vis the results framework.
The specific objectives of the evaluation, as specified in the ToR were to:
1. assess the programme’s effectiveness and evaluate the extent to which the programme
achieved its intended results at output and outcome level;
2. assess the programme’s efficiency, and evaluate how well have programme resources
(financial, human, technical) been used to achieve the results;
3. assess the programme’s relevance and evaluate to what extent the programme design and
intervention responded to the needs and priorities of the beneficiaries as well as the strategic
priorities of the Ministry of General Education;
4. assess the programme’s sustainability, and evaluate whether, without external support, key
conditions and factors are in place for the programme to continue to exist and be
effective/efficient; and
5. finally, assess the programme’s equity focus, and evaluate the extent to which the programme
addressed gender unequal barriers to stay in school, gain interest in Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects, and successfully integrate into the labour
market.
2.3 Scope
The evaluation scope included three components of the programme, namely: 1) school level career
clubs, 2) career camps and 3) internship placements.
The evaluation team has further elaborated and extended these components (with relevant initial
evaluation questions) in the inception phase and has structured the evaluation questions and

Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
reorganised them as per the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/Development
Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC) criteria into a comprehensive Evaluation Matrix (EM) (see
section 3.2.1).
This evaluation covered Phase I of the programme implementation period of August 2016 to
December 2018. The geographical focus of the evaluation was targeted at eight districts of Northern
and Southern provinces namely Mbala, Mpulungu, Luwingu, Mungwi Sinazongwe, Namwala, Pemba
and Monze. The evaluation built on a process-focused review of Phase I and looked at improving the
design and delivery of Phase II, as well as scaling up of the programme and to inform policies and
strategies on girls’ education and skills development.
A comprehensive desk review of existing documents was conducted, focus group discussions and
key informant interviews were held at the national and subnational levels, covering four districts within
the two provinces. This enabled verification and analysis of outcomes in the entire education delivery
structure at the national level.

Chapter 3. Evaluation methodology
3.1 Approach
The evaluation followed a three pronged approach (see Annex iii)b for key evaluation questions) to
meet the objectives. The overall approach was as follows:
a. Exploratory—The project team deep dived into the available secondary information as well as
the information derived through key informant interviews to unravel findings that will answer the
key research questions related to effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, sustainability and equity.
b. Mixed Methods—While conducting the evaluation, the team followed a mixed methods approach
comprising quantitative and qualitative information collection to address the evaluation questions.
c. Participatory & Consultative—The evaluators followed a participatory approach in preparing
and implementing evaluation activities, field visits, focus group meetings and key informant
interviews. A presentation of preliminary findings was organised in which UNICEF staff, MoGE
staff at national, provincial and district levels, Restless Development and private sector
organisations from two selected provinces could provide inputs for the suggestions about the
findings. The team regularly consulted UNICEF to meet the evaluation objectives. Furthermore,
the team maintained close contact with the province and district level implementation agencies,
officials, community members, etc. to develop a deeper understanding of the programme. This
consultative process helped in meeting the expectation of the implementing stakeholders. In
addition, the stakeholders played a critical role in the design and implementation of the evaluation.
The design of evaluation tools was guided by the UNICEF evaluation team. The implementation
of the evaluation was supported by Ministry of General Education and Restless Development,
who assisted the evaluation team to reach remote schools in the rural regions of Zambia.
3.2 Methodology
The evaluation methodology followed a logical sequence of inter-related steps:
a. Secondary literature review
The evaluation team reviewed available literature, reports and other data sources to understand
the context of the programme. Baseline and mid line values of outputs were referred to from the
annual report of the implementing partner to compare them with the end line findings. A full list of
documents consulted is provided in Annex iii)c.
b. Initial consultations
The evaluation team conducted an initial virtual meeting with the Education Specialist at the
UNICEF office. The evaluation team further conducted virtual meetings with the Principal
Education Officer-School Guidance Services (SGS) at the MoGE and the Country Director of
Restless Development. This exercise enabled the evaluation team to better understand the
programme and helped in finalising the tools.
c. Sampling
To execute this assignment, multistage sampling design was followed in identifying the
respondents. At the first stage, the districts were identified purposively keeping in mind the factors
of time, cost and accessibility to assist the evaluation team in optimally utilising their time in
reaching the project locations. Next, systematic random sampling was used to identify the schools.
For the purpose of identifying the respondents, both at the school level and among the officials
Page 27 of 136
ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence
Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
and stakeholders, purposive sampling was used. The objective of sampling on purpose was to
ensure that only those respondents are included who have been involved in the programme either
as beneficiaries or as service providers/stakeholders.
Selection of Schools
The final sample schools were selected using systematic random sampling. Fifteen schools were
originally proposed to be selected from each province: one district accounting for eight schools
while the other represented by seven schools. However, due to the non-availability of the desired
sample of pupils in the Mbala and Luwingu, the team had to visit additional schools in these
districts: six in Mbala and five in Luwingu.

The total sample size finalised during the inception phase of the evaluation was 1,363. However, the
situation emerging from COVID19 pandemic led to non-availability of sufficient number of pupil
respondents in the two districts of Northern Province. Therefore, the research team visited additional
schools to meet the required sample size of pupils, resulting an increase in the sample size by 35
respondents. The non-availability of respondents was not encountered in districts of the Southern
Province.
d. Designing of evaluation tools
Based on insights from the initial consultations, the team developed draft evaluation tools for
qualitative and quantitative data collection. Furthermore, the key evaluation questions given in the
ToR were also referred to while designing the KII tools and FGDs questionnaires. In addition, the
United Nations Evaluations Guidelines (UNEG) document was referred to draft the evaluation tools.
The KII tools included a combination of open- and closed-ended questions—the open-ended ones
being used to elaborate on the closed responses. The FGD guides were discussion guides to keep
the discussion structured and responsive to the evaluation requirement. Pre-loaded KII tools on
handheld devices and recorders were used to conduct KIIs and FGDs, and responses were also
physically recorded. The voice recordings were used later to check and add to the responses as
required.
e. Approval of evaluation protocol and tools by UNICEF and ethical clearance from UNZAREC
and NHRA
The evaluation design and the evaluation tools were reviewed and approved by UNICEF, the
Evaluation Reference Group (ERG). The ethical approval was obtained from UNZA Research and
Ethics Committee (UNZAREC), and the study was approved by National Health Research Authority
(NHRA).
f. Piloting evaluation tools
The evaluation tools were piloted in a district that was not part of the final sample. The process
ensured that there were no redundancies in the questions and the language and flow of questions
were appropriate. Based on the piloting, the tools were modified and finalised.
g. Training of evaluation team
The Team Leader trained the team members, including the enumerators and supervisors, on the
process of administering the evaluation tools. The three-day training was organised virtually via MS
Teams and included the following sessions:
Page 29 of 136
ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence
Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
• introduction to the Zambian Girls 2030 Programme and objectives of the end line evaluation;
• training on Qualitative research methodology and ethics;
• training on Qualitative instruments: Focus Group Discussion (FGD) Guidelines and Key
Informant Interview (KII) Questionnaires;
• orientation on the field protocols to be followed during fieldwork;
• practice of the tools through role playing;
• training on the special COVID-19 guidelines to follow while conducting interviews, surveys and
FGDs; and
• division of roles and responsibilities during the fieldwork process.
h. Fieldwork
Following the training of enumerators, the evaluation team including the Project Manager and Social
and Gender Specialist from the research team initiated the fieldwork in July 2020. The team was split
into two sub-teams and each team was responsible to undertake the FGDs and KIIs in respective
sample districts. The team of experts, supervisors, enumerators and quality control assistant
completed all the data collection at the district level in August 2020. The core experts undertook the
KIIs with the supply side respondents online via Microsoft Teams platform. The interviews were
completed by September 2020.
i. Ethical considerations
At every stage, the evaluation was guided by the United Nations Evaluation Guidelines (UNEG) and
Ethical Research Involving Children (ERIC) guidelines. The design of the evaluation incorporated a
clear human rights, equity and gender perspective. Care was taken to include these dimensions while
conducting the fieldwork. To ensure impartiality, the evaluation team considered the views of all
stakeholders. The team ensured the confidentiality and security of sensitive information derived from
the KIIs and FGDs and prior consent was taken from each stakeholder before interacting with them.
The team strictly followed the obligation of evaluations, that is, independence, impartiality, credibility,
no conflict of interest, honesty and integrity, and accountability. The evaluators observed the
obligations towards the participants including respect for Dignity and Diversity, Rights, Confidentiality,
and Avoidance of Harm.
j. Analysis
Quantitative data analysis
The quantitative analysis of clean and merged data set involved computation of standard descriptive
statistics (range, frequency, percentage and mean). The results are presented through the charts and
infographics.
Qualitative data analysis
The qualitative data analysis began with intensive reading and re-reading of FGD and KII transcripts.
The qualitative data was cleaned, coded, validated and analysed against the parameters of
effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, sustainability and equity using excel spreadsheet.

3.3 Data analysis
3.3.1 Quantitative data analysis
The baseline data was analysed using mixed method approach. The quantitative analysis of clean
and merged data set involved computation of standard descriptive statistics and application of
univariate and bivariate analysis. The results—disaggregated by grades, gender and locations—was
presented in tabular form along with data visualisation through charts and infographics.
3.3.2 Qualitative data analysis
Thematic content analysis of qualitative data gathered from FGDs was done. The content analysis
involved coding, categorisation, tagging and thematic analysis of qualitative data.
Coding, recoding and developing codebooks: The process of content analysis began with
intensive reading and re-reading of FGD transcripts and notes for coding according to the
themes/issues (subject matter) that emerged from FGD data. The analysis relied on deductive coding
(i.e., concept or research driven coding) based on available empirical evidence and the research
topics/issues.
Categorisation and summarising themes: Following the coding process, the FGD data was
organised into similar categories, ultimately leading to identification and summarisation of key themes
based on contextual data (e.g., socioeconomic data) and other information that would help understand
better the study findings.
Qualitative data analysis was done in Excel spreadsheet, using its various built-in features including
sorting menu and pivot table.
3.4 Limitations
Some of the limitations experienced during the evaluation were as follows:
1. While sampling at the schools, the study team faced a challenge in segregating the respondent
pupils into component-wise groups due to the limited availability of pupils at the schools. One
of the key factors behind this was the situation emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic and
the significant passage of time.
2. Another factor that affected the sample size was difficulty in tracking the pupils, since all
schools were preparing for the end of term test, which made access to the schools and
learners challenging.
3. The findings based on pupils’ responses are limited to the pupils who were available for the
KIIs, as most of the schools had lost their records of the attendees of the skills camp,
mentorship and internship programmes.
4. Some schools had a lower number of beneficiary pupils available for the interview on the date
of the field visit, due to which the research team had to visit additional schools to meet the
required sample size of pupils.
5. The first phase of the programme began in August 2016 and ended in December 2018. The
end line evaluation was planned between October–December 2019. However, due to reasons
beyond the control of the project, the fieldwork got delayed to March 2020. In March, the
schools were closed due to COVID-19 pandemic thereby resulting in the data collection being
further delayed until September 2020. The time lapse between the end of the programme and
Page 35 of 136
ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence
Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
data collection posed a challenge in some instances in finding the number of sampled pupils
for interviews. This has been mentioned in the above note as well.
6. A number of findings are based on the responses received from participants. In the absence
of records to corroborate each finding, in some of these cases the team had to rely on the
anecdotal evidence provided. The findings were further triangulated with the information
generated through FGDs with the community.

Chapter 4. Findings and analysis
In this section, we discuss the key findings by each of the five evaluation criteria: (i) effectiveness; (ii)
efficiency; (iii) relevance; (iv) sustainability; and (v) equity.
4.1. Effectiveness
The evaluation sought to answer the extent to which the project objectives and intended results have
been achieved, what are the factors that facilitate or inhibit the achievement of the project objectives
and expected results, and which project activities had more significance to contribute to the key
outcomes. We draw on the quantitative, qualitative and secondary data to address these evaluation
questions for each outcome in this section.
4.1.1. Achievement of results by outputs
Programme Output 1: By 2018, 11,200 girls between Grades 5 to 12 are trained or sensitised
on career guidance, reproductive health and re-entry policy through participation in school
clubs to facilitate girls being retained in school or transitioned to tertiary education.
The table below presents a summary of the baseline, midline and end line achievements for the
Output 1 indicators against targets set by the project. The project has achieved the targets for four
out of the five indicators under Output 1.

There were multiple factors behind the shortfall in the number of girls receiving the integrated package
on Career Guidance and Sexual Reproductive Health, life skills (financial literacy and
entrepreneurship skills through clubs) as reported by the implementing partner. Prime among the
reasons was the frequent transfer of Guidance and Counselling Teachers at the school level. This
often led to the loss in momentum of activities, as the new teacher would require training before
initiating the guidance and counselling activities. There was the issue of delayed funding of the
programme in years 2 and 3 which also to an extent resulted in deceleration of the programme
momentum.

Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
It is encouraging to note that out of the 418 girls who fell pregnant in 2016/ 2017 in the 200 schools
of the Zambian Girls 2030 project, a total of 343 girls enrolled back in the school system. This number
represents about 82.1 per cent of girls returning to schools after delivery compared to 50.1 per cent
of the average girls in the two provinces who returned to school following delivery according to the
2016 Education Statistical Bulletin.43
Programme Output 2: 1,200 adolescent girls have acquired knowledge and skills on
leadership; employability and career options and entrepreneurship to make informed
decisions about staying in school, transitioning to higher education and future career paths
by 2018.

Among the pupils who attended the clubs, one of the key attractions reportedly was the opportunity
to learn new skills. The pupils stated having learnt about several skills, primary among them being,
entrepreneurship, career counselling, farming, studying, behavioural (represented by communication,
negotiation, personal hygiene, sexual
Figure 9: Skills resulting from career clubs
health), etc. The proportion of pupils
reporting the skills is presented in the
Figure 9.
Studying skills 14%
It would be apt to mention here that the
responses presented in Figure 9 are
Personal savings 15%
among the top six. There were several
other skills that the pupils reported
Agriculture 18%
since it was an open-ended question.
The effectiveness of the career clubs
was also corroborated by several Behavioural 21%
parents during the FGDs. One of the
parents whose ward studied at Mbala
Career guidance 27%
Boarding, stated:
“…it (Career Club) is a club that helps Entrepreneurship 28%
children to know what they can do in
future. For instance, the courses that
they can take in future they help them for them to decide which course they can do. If they choose
the wrong one maybe the careers teacher can help them and explain to them about certain careers
that are suitable for them to do or courses...”
The school leaders too reported the school clubs to be the most effective among the three
interventions. They considered the district level camps and internships effective too, but the
implementation model of the two components entailed it being restricted to only a few girls who were
selected for these programmes. Majority of the girls only had access to clubs which were a more
regular affair at the school level.
Similar opinion was echoed by the Guidance and Counselling Teachers. While the teachers stated
that the career and skills club was the most effective among the three components, some expressed
the need for more funds and materials, such as, stationery, guidance and counselling handbooks for
the clubs, etc.
The PEOs and DEOs considered school clubs effective, but for the officers the district camps and
internship opportunities were more effective in terms of exposing the girls to the different career
options available. They emphasised the importance of the two interventions and suggested the need
for including more girls into the same. Similar thoughts were expressed by the girls and their mentors
regarding the internships. They believed it was a useful exposure for the girls. However, the officers
also felt, the two weeks’ time period of internship was too short and should be increased. The
respondent from Zamtel referred to a paid internship programme which their organisation offered for
a period of 1–6 months, and about which they were open to discussing with the education officers.
With respect to the areas of interest for higher education, nursing (43 per cent), teaching (36 per cent)
and pharmacy (19 per cent) reportedly occupied the most prominent position among the pupils. Armed
forces, law, accounting, agriculture and engineering were some of the other areas that were reported
to be of interest among the pupils. It is to be noted here that several pupils reported a shift in their
thought process regarding the choice of careers and higher education after attending the career clubs
and hearing about the career camps and internships from fellow pupils who had attended them.

One of the key learnings reportedly acquired by the pupils at the clubs was related to financial literacy
and management of savings—67 per cent of the learners reported that they found the discussions on
financial literacy useful, and 49 per cent of the pupils stated that they had a savings plan. An almost
equal proportion reportedly denied having any savings plan. Upon being probed, they mentioned not
having enough spare money to save.

Another important area of interest for the pupils was entrepreneurship—95 per cent of the pupils
interviewed stated that they found the discussions on entrepreneurship helpful. They reportedly had
greater awareness about the aspects related to entrepreneurship, setting up a business, managing
it, opening a bank account, maintaining transaction records, etc.
In addition to career counselling and sessions on financial literacy, the pupils also found the sessions
of life skills very useful. Discussions on sexual and reproductive health were reportedly effective as
almost all girls knew about sexually transmitted diseases and ways to practice safe sex and
contraception.

4.1.3. Reasons behind the achievement of programme outcomes
The programme outcomes pertaining to participation of pupils in career clubs, transition rates,
readmission into schools after pregnancy as reported by the school leaders, District Education Board
Secretary (DEBS), PEOs, etc. have been achieved owing to various factors. There has been
concerted effort on part of the MoGE, UNICEF and implementation partner to guide, train and monitor
the progress of the programme routinely. Among the key factors contributing to the achievement of
outcomes is the training provided to conduct guidance and counselling sessions at schools—75 per
cent of the school leaders and Guidance and Counselling Teachers reported having received training
to conduct sessions in career clubs. Trainings to conduct guidance and counselling sessions in
schools were provided by the following:
• Ministry of General Education • District Education Standards Officer
(DESO)
• UNICEF
• District Resource Centre Coordinators
• Restless development
(DRCC)
• District Education Board Secretary
• National Guidance and Counselling
• Provincial Resource Centre Coordinator Association of Zambia (NAGCAZ)
(PRCC)
The training was provided on organising and running career clubs, providing guidance and career
counselling sessions to the participants of the clubs, and developing and implementing guidance and
counselling career club management toolkit. The teachers were provided with training material and
age-appropriate training approaches keeping in mind the assimilation capacities of young pupils.

Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
It is evident that an overwhelming majority of the pupils have reportedly received the various guidance
and counselling services envisaged within the programme. Professional workspace skills are the only
area where about one third of the respondents have stated that they did not receive any guidance.
4.1.4. Challenges faced in achievement of some outcomes
While the programme has reportedly achieved most of the outcomes, there were some areas where
challenges were faced. Fifty-seven per cent Guidance and Counselling Teachers reportedly faced
challenges in explaining concepts on financial literacy to younger pupils from Grades 5 to 7. Similarly,
61 per cent teachers reportedly faced challenges while explaining concepts on entrepreneurship to
the same cohort. In order to overcome the challenges, the teachers resorted to different methods,
such as, the use of simpler terms, seeking the help of fellow teachers, etc.
The implementing partner faced some challenges in organising the career camps and internships,
which were primarily due to the occasional delay in the release of funds and lack of coordination and
communication between the partner, MoGE and the organisations offering the internship.
In the absence of a mechanism to allocate funds to the schools for monitoring activities, often it fell
upon the teachers themselves to shoulder the financial burden of travelling to the district education
offices for monthly submission of reports. The challenge became more pronounced in case of schools
that were far from the district headquarters, at times, as far as 200 kilometers. One of the officials
from the education department echoed these sentiments:
“…you have been to Mulala, sorry it’s Mulala which is 200 km away. For example, now reports need
to be submitted. So again, the mobility, how do those people submit the reports, you’re talking of
Mulala which is almost the distance from here to Kasama. Then the other challenge that was there
was, when these people came here, it was out of their own pocket. So, imagine you tell a teacher to
come here and submit a report and go back.”

4.2. Efficiency
4.2.1. Efficiency in the use of resources
In terms of optimal utilisation of resources, most respondents at the school, district and provincial
level stated that the resources were indeed used efficiently. Similar thoughts were echoed by staff of
UNICEF and the implementation partner. An analysis of the funds allocated to the programme
resulted in the following findings:
The ratio between funds allocated to implement the programme and manage it is approximately 3:1.
The implementation costs include the allocation towards school level clubs, career camps and
internships. The management costs include monitoring and evaluation costs, UNICEF office and staff
costs, and UNICEF Headquarters (HQ) recovery costs charged at 8 per cent.44
When further broken down, the implementation costs at the level of schools and per pupil annually
are as follows:
Activity 1: School level career and skills clubs for Grades 5 to 12 is ZMW 142.00.
Activity 2: District level career and skill camps for Grades 8 and 9 is ZMW 2,391.00.
Activity 3: Career Internship Programme for Grades 10, 11 and 12 is ZMW 3,140.00.
The proportion of allocation across the three components is presented in Figure 14.
Figure 14: Component-wise distribution of funds
28.09%

37.69%
Activity 1: School level career and skills clubs for Grades 5 to 12
Activity 2: District level career and skill camps for Grades 8 & 9
Activity 3: Career Internship Program for Grades 10, 11, 12
At the level of implementation, school level activities such as career clubs, training of Guidance and
Counselling Teachers, supply of material related to career clubs etc. are reportedly sufficiently
financed and the schools are using the resources efficiently to the best of their capability. However,
there was a demand for additional funds, especially for transportation of teachers for reporting
activities, both at the level of teachers as well as DEBs. The district level career and skills camps and
internships received 72 per cent of the total allocation. However, given the fact that the largest
participation in the programme happens at the school level clubs, it would be prudent to review the
44 Zambian Girls 2030: Realizing My Potential Concept Note for proposal to UK NATCOM.

Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
allocation and explore means of rationalising it to reflect optimisation of costs vis-à-vis the number of
pupils benefitting from the programme.
The ratio between programme
Figure 15: Ratio between programme implementation
implementation and management cost is
and management costs
approximately 3:1 as depicted in Figure
15. The programme management costs
as mentioned above account for
monitoring and evaluation activities,
office and staff costs, and UNICEF HQ 23%
recovery costs. Upon further analysis it
was found that the office and staff costs
along with UNICEF HQ recovery costs
account for 83 per cent of the programme
management costs, leaving 17 per cent
77%
for monitoring and evaluation activities
(see Figure 16). This indicates a
possibility of having a review at the
financing of programme management
Sub-total: programme implementation
activities and exploring avenues of
greater allocation to monitoring and Sub-total programme management and HQ recovery costs
evaluation of the programme. It is
imperative for programmes with vast geographical coverage and grassroots based activities that a
robust monitoring system be in place for continued supportive supervision and prompt corrective
actions. Additional resource allocation to monitoring would be an affirmative step in this direction.

4.2.2. Timeliness of activities and expected results
As reported by most stakeholders, the activities and outcomes of the programme managed to follow
timelines broadly. However, as reported by the implementing partner, delayed funding in years two
and three resulted in less time being available for planning of activities. This in turn resulted in the
programme implementation teams getting lesser time to implement activities. Also, this led to an
adjustment of work plans and some activities of 2017, for example, internships had to be postponed
to 2018 alongside the activities of that year.45

4.2.3. Sufficiency of resources
Figure 17: Sufficiency of resources
When asked about the sufficiency of resources
available to implement the programme, varied
responses were received. While majority of the 7% 11%
stakeholders felt sufficient resources were available,
it was the teachers and school leaders who held a
different opinion on the issue: 82 per cent of the
teachers felt that the resources for the programme
were not sufficient (see Figure 17). They mentioned
the need for additional funds for transportation and
fuel, data packs, etc. A similar opinion was also 82%
echoed by some of the officials at the district and
provincial levels who felt that additional funds for
monitoring activities needed to be allocated.
Yes No Don't know/Refused
4.2.4. Management of activities
Overall, the pupils and stakeholders felt that the activities of the programme had been managed well.
Guidance and Counselling Teachers had been provided with programme manuals and monitoring
formats to conduct activities of the career clubs. They had also been trained by the implementing
partner. However, there were suggestions related to improved communication among stakeholders
for better planning and implementation of activities. Some stakeholders also expressed the need for
better training of teachers on reporting. Decentralising of components like career camps and
internships was suggested as a measure to bring cost efficiencies in the programme. To bring about
efficiencies in the training costs of teachers, a cascaded training approach was suggested. Some of
the MoGE officials pointed out the need to decentralise programme planning and allocating funds
directly to schools to manage the career clubs. It would result in schools taking up activities that would
be more responsive to local aspirations and make funds available for monitoring and reporting
activities. UNICEF staff suggested adherence to the career club manuals to efficiently run them. Staff
also suggested a greater role of MoGE in activities, such as career camps and internships to sustain
them beyond the programme life cycle.

4.3. Relevance
4.3.1. Relevance of the programme
The Zambian Girls 2030 programme was envisaged to support the MoGE in improving transition rates
for girls from primary to secondary education and increased secondary school completion, increased
number of girls entering tertiary education as well as to support girls in acquiring employability and
entrepreneurial skills, thereby increasing gender equality in the formal labour market in Zambia.
When asked about the need for a programme like
Zambian Girls 2030, most of the respondents stated that Figure 18: Need for the programme
there was indeed a need for it. As many as 97 per cent of
girls reported that they felt the programme was useful and 0% 3%
that there was a need for it (see Figure 18). The parents
and caregivers were also of the opinion that there was a
need for the programme as they had faced situations of
early child marriage, teenage pregnancies, absenteeism
and low post-pregnancy re-entry rates into school. With
the programme, they felt a number of these issues were
being addressed at the school. The pupils participating in
the career clubs were being made aware of the benefits of
delaying the age of marriage, sexual health and hygiene,
97%
re-entry policy, different career choices available to girls,
etc. As stated by a parent whose child studied at a school
in Masamba (Mbala):
Yes No Don't know/ Refused
“…I have seen a lot of benefits (of the programme), when
my child came back from Lusaka, she was very happy and told me she had learnt a lot. She even told
me that she wouldn’t get married until she finished school because we saw a lot of things in Lusaka,
we even went to the National Assembly. She wants to study and pursue the career she wants so; she
reads the books she was given she even teaches her younger siblings about what they learnt at the
National Assembly. I saw that she learnt the value of school...”
The school leaders and Guidance and Counselling Figure 19: Zambian Girls 2030 Programme
Teachers were also of the opinion that the programme has equipped the girls with life skills
had helped improve transition rates and re-entry of girls
into school after pregnancy. The career camps and 5%
internships offered girls the opportunity to meet role 12%
models and consider career choices in science and
technology, which was not the case earlier. Besides
these, the programme had equipped girls with life skills
that were important for them to handle challenges in life
and meet career aspirations. There was agreement
84%
among girls that the programme had been important
from the perspective of life skills. Reportedly, 84 per
cent of the girls agreed that the programme had helped
Yes No Don't know/ Refused
them in cultivating skills important for managing their
health, hygiene and general wellbeing (see Figure 19). Besides, it had also equipped them with social
emotional skills such as communication, negotiation, problem-solving etc.

ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence
Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
An overwhelming majority of the teachers
Figure 20: Change in transition rates after the
interviewed reported that the transition rates had
implementation of the programme
improved in the programme schools (see Figure
20). A similar thought was echoed by some of the
2%
DEBs who said that they had witnessed an
improvement in the transition rate. DEBs also said
that there was a reduction in dropout rates of girls
following incidents of pregnancy. Some teachers
also reported a decrease in the incidence of
teenage pregnancies in their schools.
Similarly, most of the respondents reported a
decrease in dropout rates in the programme
schools. The school leaders and Guidance and
98%
Counselling Teachers attributed this to the
concerted efforts made in engaging with the pupils
in general, and girls in particular, and the
engagement with community members. Through Yes No
regular meetings with the community, the
importance of education, delaying marriage of girls, and economic and financial independence of girls
was emphasised. Seventy-two per cent of the teachers interviewed reportedly stated that the dropout
of female pupils had reduced in their schools (see Figure 21).
Figure 21: Reduction in dropping out of girls from Grade 5

Yes No Does not apply
It is to be noted here that these results need to be interpreted with caution. While there is a positive
change in several indicators at the school level, the changes in indicators related to decreased
dropout numbers, increased transition of girls and re-entry of pregnant girls into school after delivery
may not entirely be attributable to the programme as there are several initiatives being implemented
by the MoGE and development partners in the region. However, based on interviews and discussions
with stakeholders, it can be definitely stated that the Zambian Girls 2030 Programme has catalysed
the process of change and has been instrumental in orienting girls towards life skills, financial literacy,
career choices, etc.
Page 49 of 136
ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence
Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
A similar opinion was stated by one of the education department officials:
“…yes, in the schools that were part of the programme, we have seen that kind of picture, but what
cannot completely allude to is that it that programme that contributed to that. We cannot 100 per cent
attribute the changes to the programme because these learners are participating in many other
programmes that are happening within the school, so it is very difficult to tease out to say this is as
the result of the programme interventions, but generally, this programme has contributed a lot into the
changes that we are now seeing but we cannot attribute those changes to girls 2030 alone.”
4.3.2. Consistency of the objectives with the overall goals of the programme
An analysis of the findings from the evaluation reveals that the objectives of the programme are
consistent with its goals. As reported by the stakeholders, in the programme schools, there has been
a decline in the rate of girls’ absenteeism. Dropout rates have reduced. Transition rates across grades
have shown improvement. There has been a decline in the incidence of teenage pregnancies and the
number of re-admissions after pregnancy has also increased. The increase in re-entry has happened
because of the concerted efforts by Guidance and Counselling Teachers and school leaders to raise
awareness among the parents regarding the re-entry policy. A mother whose child was a pupil at
Naakasangwe (Monze) stated:
“…when a child falls pregnant, they are counselled by the guidance (teacher) to say this is not the
end of the road, the journey is still there, they will be encouraged to come to school until that time
when they see that she can’t manage because she is now tired, they will be guided and counselled
and once they accept and they deliver, they will come back to school…”
The pupils as well as the Guidance and Counselling Teachers, school leaders, DEBs and PEOs
reported that the programme had led to the pupils becoming aware of the various career choices
available to them. Although, it cannot be definitively stated how many girls chose STEM as the subject
of higher education due to the lack of information available at the schools, the girls were certainly
aware that for careers in medicine, engineering, nursing, etc. they needed to opt for STEM as the
stream of study.
4.3.3. Consistency of the implemented activities with the intended impacts
Interactions with the stakeholders at the school level, among the community and at the level of MoGE,
UNICEF and implementation partner highlight one point—a commonality of purpose evident across
the three components of the programme. At the school level career and skills club, the Guidance and
Counselling Teachers have engaged with the pupils on issues around the importance of education,
continuing schooling after pregnancy, sexual reproductive health, financial literacy, career choices,
etc. These efforts have resulted in the schools reporting several changes. There is a decreased
incidence of teenage pregnancies, number of pupils re-entering school after pregnancy has
increased, the incidents of drop-out have decreased and transition from Grades 7 to 8 and above has
increased. Among the top three reasons cited for these changes by the teachers are:
• increased commitment among teachers, pupils, parents/caregivers;
• training of the teachers; and
• effective implementation of the re-entry policy.

Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
4.4. Sustainability
One of the critical aspects covered under the evaluation was the sustainability of the programme once
the external support from UNICEF was withdrawn. The programme was reviewed vis-à-vis
sustainability of the results, strengthening of the implementation mechanism to ensure sustainability
and factors that influenced the achievement and/or non-achievement of results.
4.4.1. Sustainability of results and targets
As per the respondents at the school level, community and supply side:
• the model was sustainable and scalable, albeit in varying degrees across the three
components;
• the career clubs were most sustainable as they were being run by the Guidance and
Counselling Teachers, who were a part of the education system;
• hosting provincial level camps and internships were not resource-efficient and sustainable.
Therefore, these initiatives needed to be more decentralised; and
• to sustain the camps and internships in future, a plan to support and fund these initiatives
would be needed and to be led by MoGE.
4.4.2. Sustainable approaches of the programme
Deliberate attempts were made to inculcate a sense of ownership among the school management
and the Guidance and Counselling Teachers with a view to ensure the sustainability of the
programme. Throughout the three years, the implementing partner continued engaging with the
Guidance and Counselling Teachers and the community to impinge upon them the importance of the
programme and its activities. The school and community level activities were complemented by
regular follow ups with the MoGE, PEOs and DEBs, and UNICEF. The investments made in the
programme through training, monitoring and provisioning of material were reported as some of the
most useful initiatives that would help in sustaining the career clubs (see Figure 22: Measures to
ensure sustainability
).

The linkages with the district and provincial guidance and counselling offices were strengthened to
ensure the continuity of activities. Several measures were undertaken to strengthen these linkages
as reported by the respondents. The most stated measures are presented in Figure 23.

The career camps and internships, owing to being resource intensive and requiring focused and
sustained coordination between the implementing partner, MOGE, UNICEF and corporate entities
were reported to be less sustainable in the event of external support being withdrawn. In the words
of one of the stakeholders:
“…The school-based components may continue on their own. The career camps and internships
would be difficult to sustain unless the partners have the possibility of supporting the programme. But
it's very difficult now even to request for commitment from the Ministry in terms of financial
commitment because the budget allocation…it keeps on falling from year to year.”
Similar thoughts were echoed by one of the education department officials:
Page 52 of 136
ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence
Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
“…It can but not as it would because this programme involves a lot of expenditure, especially when it
comes to expose the learners. On that part, I don’t know if the Government would be able to manage
but in some of the areas we can manage. For example, in career clubs, that we can manage and to
some extent, career camps but internship would be difficult. It can be difficult because some learners
must spend some good 10 days and some engagement with the companies which wouldn’t be that
easy.”
Upon being asked about sustainability measures, the implementing partner mentioned that efforts
were made under the programme to arrange for MoUs between MoGE and corporates to support
internships, skills development and utilisation etc. However, the effectiveness of these measures can
only be proven with the passage of time.
To summarise, among the three components, the career clubs were reported to be the most
sustainable by all respondents. The main reasons cited for this were that they were being run by the
Guidance and Counselling Teachers who were a part of the education system, and because there
had been sustained efforts by the implementation partner, MoGE and UNICEF at training and
monitoring of activities at the school level. On the other hand, sustaining career camps and internships
would be a challenge owing to their resource intensive nature and because of the level of coordination
and communication that is needed to be maintained with all the stakeholders to organise these
activities.

4.5. Equity
4.5.1. Representativeness of coverage by the activities and interventions
Ensuring an equitable approach in programme delivery was one of the key areas of emphasis in the
Zambian Girls 2030 programme. Based on the discussions with key stakeholders it can be concluded
that the programme has an equitable approach. Initially, the programme focused on girls in line with
the programme approach and design. However, it was soon realised that including boys, at least in
the career clubs, was equally important to sensitise boys towards issues of gender equality and break
the gender stereotypes prevalent at the community level. One of the objectives of the programme
was to expose girls to professions that required STEM as subjects of study, at the school level.
Evidence shows that girls lag in the leadership, school system and labour market. The idea of
organising career camps and internships was to expose girls to women achievers and leaders in a
variety of professions, thereby motivating them to consider a variety of career choices.
During the interviews with UNICEF, it was indicated that one area which required greater effort in
terms of equities was to reach children with special education needs. A key challenge in doing so was
the lack of credible data on such children as reported by a school leader as well as by the
implementing partner. In the absence of data, identifying children with special education needs and
designing strategies for them became an uphill task. However, special efforts were being made in
phase-II, with targets for the implementing partner to address the issue.
Career and skills camps aim at bringing together unique characteristics and diversity of the local girls
and share principles that promote gender equality. The career and skills clubs at the school level on
the other hand, by including boys, promoted gender equality and sensitivity towards breaking gender
stereotypes. Some of the key factors indicating gender equality in the programme as reported by the
pupils are as follows:
Figure 24: Indicators that promoted gender equality
Inclusion of boys 36%
Involvement of both girls and boys in all activities 23%
Equality in leadership 14%
Integration of the girl child in an activity that the boy can do 7%
There is no discrimination 7%
Exposure visits 5%
Sensitization 4%
Teach every pupil his/ her role 4%
Continuity with the program after it finished 2%
Page 54 of 136
ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence
Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
As in evident from Figure 24, inclusion of boys in the activities of the career club was one of the
greatest game changers when it came to promoting gender equality. As reported by several boys, it
changed their perception about the skills, capabilities and leadership potential of girls. However,
several boys also demanded that they be included in the career camps and internships as well. Upon
being asked the reasons behind the demand, they said it would be a good opportunity for them to
learn about the different career choices, meet potential role models and experience the corporate life.
Several teachers, school leaders as well as education department officials also pointed out at the
growing demand from boys to be also considered for the career camps and internships. They believed
this would further enhance the programme’s reach and effectiveness in addressing gender equality
and breaking gender stereotypes.
4.5.2. Exposure to vulnerable children and girls
Qualitative findings revealed that there was an

exposure of vulnerable children and girls to the
programme. However, it was more by default
rather than design. In the absence of data on
socioeconomic condition of households, Don't know/ Refused 1%
children with special education needs,
survivors of violence, etc., all children who
were enrolled at the school were included in No 7%

made every effort in ensuring that they
completed school and entered the job market.
Members of the community, headmen, school leaders and Guidance and Counselling Teachers
played an active role in identifying vulnerable children and in ensuring that their education needs were
suitably addressed and that they were treated fairly at school. They were actively supported in this by
the implementing partner.

Chapter 5. Conclusions
Based on the analysis of information gathered from the various stakeholders several facts emerge.
Some of the key conclusions that can be drawn about the programme are as follows:
a) Zambian Girls 2030 is an effective engine of change
The programme through its participatory approach has been able to engage with girls, boys and
community alike. Several community members reported an increased understanding of the different
career choices available to girls and the qualification required for the same. The boys displayed an
understanding of the importance of careers and financial independence of girls, and also the
significance of girls completing school. The school leaders, Guidance and Counselling teachers and
the MoGE officials acknowledged the role of the programme in contributing to the reduced instances
of early marriage, teenage pregnancy, dropout rates etc.
b) Demand from boys to be included in other components of the programme
The initial design of the Girls 2030 programme included only girls. However, soon it was realised that
the boys needed to be included too in the career and skills clubs to effectively address the issues
around gender and the stereotypes around it. As a result, boys were also included and have been
active participants in the clubs ever since. With the passage of time, there has been a growing demand
from the boys that they also be included in the career camps and internships. It is for MoGE and
UNICEF to decide whether this demand needs to be fulfilled. It certainly would require additional
resources.
c) Active participation from the community contributing to positive attitudinal change towards the
value of girls’ education
The community members, parents/caregivers, village headmen etc. were actively involved in the
programme. The parents/caregivers reportedly regularly participated in PTA meetings and discussed
their child’s progress with the Guidance and Counselling Teachers, which developed within them an
attitude towards valuing the education of girls. It also delayed the early marriage of girls, reduced their
dropout rates from schools and highlighted the importance of girls’ economic and financial
independence. The involvement of community and help from the schools also resulted in
destigmatising teenage-pregnancies and paved the way for re-entry of girls into school.
d) Continued involvement of the Ministry of General Education
One of the major factors which has contributed to the success of the programme is a strong buy-in
from the MoGE at all levels from headquarters up to the School Guidance Services Unit and then
from the Provincial Educational Officials up to the district and school level. Officials at DEBs and PEO
levels as well as the coordinators at the ministry have been continuously involved in the programme
providing leadership and guidance to UNICEF as well as the implementing partner.
e) Important role of village chief/head
The village leader/head has played a key role in addressing the issue of early marriage, absenteeism
and re-entry into schools. The village head wields significant power on the community and her/his
decisions are respected and followed. Penalties are imposed by the village head on families erring
on early marriage. The village head’s advice on delaying the age of marriage and its advantages is
regarded in the right spirit by the community and has resulted in stemming the prevalence of early
marriage in the programme area. Similarly, the village head’s involvement in tracking absentee
children has helped in lowering the incidence of absenteeism.

f) Parents realise the importance of communicating with children
The parents realise the importance of communicating with children. Several parents reported a clear
understanding of the activities taking place at the career clubs, career camps and internships. They
are aware about the career opportunities available to girls, the re-entry policy, the advantages of
delaying the age of marriage and financial independence of girls. Several parents reported how the
performance of their girls had improved and how several of them were either pursuing higher
education or aspiring for it and studying accordingly.
g) Parents Teacher Associations (PTAs) are quite active
The PTAs are quite active as reported by parent groups. These are used as a forum to discuss the
issues pertaining to children’s education, absenteeism from school, pregnancies, early marriages,
career to pursue, etc. The PTAs are actively involved in resolving the issues with mutual support and
contribution of parents, and guidance from teachers.
h) Absenteeism from school has reduced
Sometimes absenteeism happens because parents engage their children in farming, fishing, picking
caterpillars, etc. However, with the implementation of the programme, the parents/caregivers have
been sensitised to discourage them from involving children in such activities during school time. The
implementing partner has also worked with the schools to keep a record of children who are either
frequently absent or have been absent for more than three days in continuation. A teacher or
Guidance and Counselling Teacher follows up with parents of all such pupils to identify the reasons
behind the absenteeism and to take remedial action wherever possible. As a result of these efforts,
absenteeism has reduced in the programme schools. In some instances, absenteeism has also
reduced due to the feeding programme in the schools, because it was noticed that several children
were absent on account of acute poverty of the households. The assurance of at least one meal at
school helped children from poor households to be present in school.
i) Low transition rate to Grades above 7
It has been reported by some respondents that the transition rate in higher Grades is low. The issue
is more pronounced in the case of transition from Grade 7 to higher Grades. Among the most common
reasons behind the low transition in these cases were the absence of schools with higher Grades
near the pupils’ residence and poverty which made education unaffordable for such pupils when
school fees are introduced from Grade 8 onwards.
j) The timeframe of internship is short
All the corporate respondents as well as some girls too reported that the time frame of internship was
short at two weeks. By the time the girls settled down in the new environment, it was time for them to
leave.

Chapter 6. Recommendations
The following recommendations are based on (i) discussions with various stakeholders involved in
the designing and implementation of the Zambian Girls 2030 programme, such as School Leaders,
Guidance and Counselling Teachers, Directorate of Teacher Education and Specialised Services
(TESS), District and Provincial Education Officials, Restless Development and UNICEF; (ii) the
analysis of parents/caregivers’ perceptions; and (iii) the review of relevant programme documents.
The recommendations have incorporated views and perspectives of these stakeholders to provide
practical suggestions which support and improve future programming and implementation.
• Landscape analysis and decentralised programme activities
Programmes like Zambian Girls 2030, which involve corporates and public sector enterprises (PSE)
would be easier to implement and would be more cost effective, if activities like career camps and
internships were decentralised to district level. However, prior to the decentralisation, a thorough
landscape analysis, in line with international best practices, is very important for informed decision
making. It would help in accurately assessing the capacity and appetite of corporates/PSEs to
participate in the programme and contribute to it effectively.
• Written communication plan and record keeping
The communication across UNICEF, Restless Development and Ministry of General Education was
cited as satisfactory by respondents from across these organisations, as the progress meetings
happened quarterly. However, a challenge was reconciliation between the members who were placed
at the different offices and there were instances of communication breakdown and language barrier
with the girls who were brought for internships from the rural parts of Zambia. Going forward, it would
be useful to have a clear written system and protocol of communication, which is established at the
very beginning of the programme. The chain of command with alternatives in case of absence/staff
turnover should be clearly indicated in the communication plan. Records of meeting and discussions
across all levels right up to the schools should be maintained to serve the twin purpose of
accountability and reference for action. Records also need to be maintained of children with special
education needs. This is important from the point of view of their inclusion in all programme plans.
• Costing exercise for a sustainable scale up plan
Prior to the scale up of any programme, it would be useful to conduct a detailed costing exercise to
review budget allocation to the various components, such as programme implementation,
management, and monitoring and evaluation. The review would aid the programme planners in
rationalising the costs against each component and help in achieving economies of scale when the
programme is expanded to cover a larger geographical area. Further, it would aid decentralisation of
funding to the grassroots and effectively address any implementation delays due to delayed
disbursement of funds.
• National framework for engagement with corporates and public sector enterprises
Programmes of greater public good like the Zambian Girls 2030 could benefit immensely from a
continued engagement with corporates and PSEs. To sustain the initiative, a national framework for
engaging with corporates should be developed. This will, on the one hand, institutionalise the process
of public-private partnership agreements with the MoGE, while on the other it will provide guidance to
the corporates to open their doors for continued support to programmes through funds from their
corporate social responsibility corpus.

Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
• Rationalise the timeframe of internships
Internships are a great method of introducing young students to the corporate world. However, for the
method to be effective, sufficient time needs to be given to the student as well as to corporates. The
corporate respondents who hosted the internships reported the period of internship to be short and
suggested increasing it to a minimum of one month. The representative of one of the agencies also
referred to an in-house paid internship programme, which they were open to discussing with the
stakeholders. This and similar other opportunities exist with the corporates and need to be explored
while conducting the landscape analysis mentioned in one of the recommendations above.
• Age-appropriate curriculum and learner centric programme methodology
Programmes implemented at the school level should focus on the learning needs and capacities of
learners. The methodology of implementation should accordingly be attuned to the capacity of
learners rather than being top down in approach. Also, it should be different from the usual lecture-
based approach followed for delivering lessons in the classroom. One way of ensuring this could be
through the training and refresher courses for teachers on the implementation methodology. In the
context of Zambian Girls 2030, simplified, age and education level appropriate curriculum for financial
literacy and entrepreneurship trainings for the upper primary grades (Grades 5 to 7) should be
developed to ensure that these concepts are appropriately understood by the learners.
• Gender equity needs to continue as the central focus of programmes
The programme has been successful in maintaining the gender equity focus. The efforts at the school
level career clubs have been useful in breaking gender stereotypes, both among boys as well as girls.
There is greater acceptance of girls in leadership roles at the clubs, their financial independence,
career choices, etc. Gender equity needs to continue as the central focus of all future programmes in
the education sector. Additionally, efforts also need to be made to include children with special
education needs in all programmes. The first step in this direction should be to develop a database
of all such children, as mentioned in an earlier recommendation.

Chapter 7. Lessons learned
The evaluation highlights several learnings that will inform the scaling up of the programme model in
other provinces and designing similar programmes.
Lesson 1 Periodic monitoring is critical
One of the challenges is the ongoing monitoring by the MoGE and Restless
Development in schools, especially in remote areas. In some instances, it takes around
two hours to reach the schools from the main tarmac roads, which makes day to day
monitoring of activities challenging. Another challenge as reported by some teachers
is the difficulty in submitting the monitoring registers at the district/provincial level owing
to the great distance, which in some instances is over 200 km. The career and skill club
activities are monitored by UNICEF, however its periodic monitoring by the MoGE and
Restless Development for tracking progress in the remote schools is important. This
will ensure that both the province and district administrations understand and contribute
towards the programme requirements along with providing the necessary support.
Online reporting through mobile phones or computers (wherever possible) could be
explored as a cost-effective way of monitoring. Additionally, incorporating the school
reporting system to the DEBs reporting system would help in streamlining the
monitoring process and aid decision making.
Lesson 2 Funds required
The funds allocated to implement and manage the programme were not decentralised.
The analysis concluded that additional funds were required for monitoring the activities
and funds for resources including for transportation, fuel, data packs, and stationery,
and more guidance and counselling handbooks for the clubs.
Lesson 3 Reporting by teachers is tedious
The reporting of teachers becomes tedious particularly for those coming from far off
schools in the remote areas. Teachers may need transportation costs to visit district
education offices for monthly submission of reports.
Lesson 4 Internships to be held within the province
In the initial phase, the internships were conducted in the Lusaka and Copperbelt
provinces due to which the girls had to travel long distances for reaching the
organisations where they were interning. This approach was also more cost intensive
for the implementing partner as the travel and accommodation requirements of girls
coming from far off places had to be managed. In order to make the internships more
cost effective and efficient, it is advisable to organise them to the extent possible in a
decentralised manner at district headquarters, which are relatively closer to the
residence of girls.
Lesson 5 Continued engagement with the community
The discussions with the parents/caregivers revealed the important role played by the
community, village headmen/leaders in the effectiveness of the programme. The
implementing partner as well as the school leadership has been continuously engaged
with the community to ensure its participation which has resulted in developing a sense
of ownership in the community about the programme. It is advisable that the efforts of
community engagement should continue to ensure that the future phases of the
programme are equally effective.

Annexures
i) Terms of reference
Title: End-line Evaluation of the Zambian Girls 2030 programme Programme
Purpose: The purpose of this consultancy is to conduct an end-line evaluation of the Zambian Girls
2030 Programme phase I (2016-2018) implemented by Ministry of General Education
(MoGE), in partnership with United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and Restless
Development
Background
Zambia has a population of about 16.8 million people. The population growth is around 2.3% per
annum and is expected to reach 20.5 million by 2025 (CSO, April 2018). Census data estimates the
child population (18 and younger) at 52.5% of the overall country population. Life expectancy is 58.2
years for men and 62.0 years for women. At the start of the current decennium Zambia achieved the
status of lower-middle income country (WB/IMF). However, based on the WB GINI-index Zambia
remains one of the most unequal countries in the world in terms of income distribution and the majority
of the population still lives in poverty. According to the 2015 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey
(LCMS), around 54.4% of the population in Zambia could be considered poor, subdivided into
extremely poor (40.8%) and moderately poor (13.6%). Despite the GDP growth, Zambia still ranks
poorly in equality and human development, including the education sector.
Zambia signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which is the most widely ratified
human rights treaty in history, on September 30, 1990 and ratified it on December 6, 1991 without
any reservations. The country has also developed and put in place several policies and strategies
that support girls’ enrolment, retention and completion of school, including the Re-entry Policy and
the Free Primary Education policies. In 2015, the Gender Equity and Equality Act was passed,
establishing the Gender Equity and Equality Commission and reinforcing the 2011 Anti-Gender Based
Violence Act.46
Zambia has made remarkable progress in expanding access to education, especially at primary level,
in part through the above mentioned supportive policies which are, pro-equity in nature. However,
high enrolment in the primary years and the pyramidal structure of school infrastructure provision
contributes to stubbornly low transition rates: 67.5 per cent transition from grade 7 to 8 and 48 per
cent from grades 9 to 10. Grade 12 completion remains very low at 31.8 per cent (34.2 per cent for
males, 29.8 per cent for females).47 The disparities in school enrolment between boys and girls widen
throughout adolescence. While gender parity has been attained at the primary level, the gender parity
index drops to 0.89 in grade 12. There is also marked geographical disparity in gender inequities
among the 10 Provinces for instance, Northern Province records the highest level of disparity with its
gender parity index at grade 12 standing at only 0.67. Furthermore, only 5.1% of Zambian women
have more than a secondary level education compared with 8.0% of men.48 One reason for this low
rate of educational attainment for girls is the country’s high levels of child marriage and teenage
pregnancy. Young girls and women with low knowledge and skills are left with few options for
professional advancement or for independent economic empowerment.
The Government of Zambia has been implementing several programmes to support the enrolment,
retention and completion of girls in school with the support of several donors, cooperating partners
(including UN agencies) and civil society organizations. Most notably, the Keeping Girls in School

(KGS) programme under the Girls Education and Women’s Empowerment and Livelihood (GEWEL)
programme, both supported by the World Bank, UNESCO has supported implementation of the
Comprehensive Sexuality Education in schools while UNFPA continues to support sexual and
reproductive rights and health for girls in Zambia.
The Zambian Girls 2030 Programme
In 2016, UNICEF in partnership with the Ministry of General Education (MoGE) has initiated the
Zambian Girls 2030: Realizing my potential programme. The purpose of this programme is to support
the government of Zambia to achieve Vision 2030, “A prosperous Middle-income Nation by 2030”, by
focusing on girls’ empowerment through career and skills mentoring and guidance, entrepreneurship
and financial literacy education, and an internship opportunity. This programme provides adolescent
girls with the professional training, skills, mentoring and networks to succeed. The programme is also
expected to contribute to higher-level outcomes over time, particularly in target districts in terms of
improved transition rates for girls from primary to secondary school and increased secondary school
completion for girls. Moreover, there is an expectation for an increase in number of girls entering
tertiary level education, acquiring employability skills acquiring entrepreneurial skills to enter the
formal labour market, and increased gender equality in the formal labour market.
The Zambian Girls 2030 programme phase I has been coordinated and led by the Guidance and
Counselling Unit under the Directorate of Teacher Education and Specialised Services (TESS) from
the MoGE which has been providing an overall coordination and leadership. UNICEF has provided
financial and technical support while Restless Development, an international NGO, was selected as
the partner to implement the programme and manage the collection of baseline and midline evaluation
data and has also contributed financially.
Phase I of the programme focused on an integrated capacity building of Guidance and Counselling
Teachers in the formation, management and facilitation of career clubs. The 3-year programme (2016-
2018) has been implemented in 200 schools from Southern and Northern Provinces targeting 4
districts in each province namely; Sinazongwe, Namwala, Pemba, Monze in Southern Province and
Mbala, Mpulungu, Luwingu and Mungwi in Northern Province. The Zambian Girls 2030 programme
is aimed at increasing the retention and transition rates of adolescent girls in the school system
through career guidance.
The programme has a three-tier approach focusing on school level career and skills clubs, district
level career and skills camps and career internship programme.
1. School level career and skills clubs: The career and skills clubs target girls in grades 5 to
12 since the dropout rate among girls starts to rise from grade 5 onwards. The career club
meetings are held once every week and are facilitated by Guidance and Counselling
Teachers. Through the career club sessions, the adolescent girls are exposed to information
on basic financial literacy and entrepreneurship skills, leadership and communication skills,
life skills, as well as sexual and reproductive health knowledge. A total of 9,811 girls49 out of
the target 12,800 girls have actively participated in the school level career and skills clubs of
the 200 target schools from Northern and Southern Provinces.
2. District level Career and Skills Camps: The camps create linkages between school and the
world of work. Girls in grade 8 and 9 participate in district-level career and skills camps during
school holidays. Camps engage corporate, academic, and government leadership figures and
specialists with focus on successful female leaders to come and present the workplace
realities and requirements of various fields of employment as well as opportunities for post-
primary education and skills development. The camps also introduce the girls to potential role
49 About 5,035 adolescent boys have also participated the school level career clubs.

models and mentors, who might guide them beyond this intervention. Camp presentations are
designed to stimulate interest in a variety of fields, particularly those with skills shortages and
low female participation. It also includes a one-day, career fair and exhibition by local
businesses to introduce the girls to the realities of doing business in their area. Since the
beginning of the programme about 1,213 girls out of the target 800 girls have attended the
one-week career camps organized at provincial level.
3. Career Internship Programme: Girls in grades 10, 11, and 12 participate in a career
internship programme that matches girls with short-term corporate opportunities with relation
to market needs, the girls’ areas of interest and skills, and the availability of positions. The
internships take place during the school holiday period and is a full-time placement of two
weeks each year and as at end of December 2018, 423 girls out of the target 300 girls have
completed at least a two-weeks internship placement. The placements target fields that
currently need skilled staff or in fields that traditionally have had low female participation and
of expected growth in the job market share.
The implementation of the Zambian Girls 2030 phase I has ended 31st December 2018. As part of
the monitoring and evaluation plan of the programme, in 2016 at the initial stage of the programme
implementation Restless development had conducted a baseline study. Further, a mid-line evaluation
had also been commissioned in the first quarter of 2018.
Justification
UNICEF in partnership with MoGE and Restless Development is commissioning an end-line
evaluation of the Zambian Girls 2030 Programme to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance
and sustainability of phase I (2016 – 2018) of the programme implementation.
Based on the findings and conclusions from the assessment of the programme’s achievements, the
evaluation is expected to provide lessons learned and recommendations from the implementation of
the programme activities and the outcomes achieved, which will be useful to the MoGE, UNICEF and
other stakeholders to improve the design and delivery of phase II (2019 – 2020) as well as scaling up
of the programme and to inform policies and strategies on girls’ education and skills development.
In addition, the evaluation will serve for accountability purposes towards the programme funder, other
agencies within the consortium, programme participants, and the placements in which the programme
was delivered.
Objectives
The purpose of the evaluation is to conduct an in-depth appraisal of the Zambian Girls 2030
programme to enable MoGE, UNICEF, Restless Development and other stakeholders to learn from
evidence-based information about the programme and ensure accountability. The key findings will
also inform the design for future programming, the potential for nationwide scalability and
development of policies and strategies on girls’ education and skills development.
The main objective is to evaluate the achievement of the targeted programme outcome and outputs,
which are further detailed in the results framework that is attached in Annex ii). Specifically, the
proposed evaluation to assess the performance of the programme including:
1. Assess the programme’s effectiveness and evaluate the extent to which the programme
achieved its intended results at output and outcome level.
2. Assess the programme’s efficiency, and evaluate how well have programme resources
(financial, human, technical) been used to achieve the results.
Page 63 of 136
ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence
Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
3. Assess the programme’s relevance and evaluate to what extent the programme design and
intervention responded to the needs and priorities of the beneficiaries as well as the strategic
priorities of the Ministry of General Education.
4. Assess the programme’s sustainability, and evaluate whether, without external support, key
conditions and factors are in place for the programme to continue to exist and be
effective/efficient.
5. Finally, assess the programme’s equity focus, and evaluate the extent to which the
programme addressed gender unequal barriers to stay in school, gain interest in Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects, and successfully integrate into
the labour market.
Apart from these key objectives / research questions, the evaluation also intends to identify strategic
lessons learned, good practices and recommendations which can guide decision making in policy
formulation and programme scalability.
Description of the assignment
Evaluation scope
The evaluation is expected to cover the three components of the programme namely school level
career clubs, career camps and internship placements. The geographical focus of the evaluation is
the target eight districts of Northern and Southern provinces namely Mbala, Mpulungu, Luwingu,
Mungwi Sinazongwe, Namwala, Pemba, and Monze covering the programme implementation period
of August 2016 to December 2018. However, for cost-effectiveness, it is suggested that the evaluation
collects information in a representative sample of intervention schools in these geographical areas.

Proposed methodology
The organization is suggested to propose a team of researchers who will conduct the end-line
evaluation independently under the guidance of a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). Ideally, the
research team is gender balanced and culturally diverse, and includes international and national
researchers with relevant experience in the relevant fields, and in Zambia. The TAC will be led by the
MoGE and UNICEF, and will include members of relevant line Ministries, UNICEF Zambia, Restless
Page 65 of 136
ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence
Final Evaluation Report || End-line Evaluation of Zambian Girls 2030 programme
Development, as well as Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) working in the space (such as FAWEZA
or Camfed). The TAC will be established by UNICEF and its participants list shared with the research
organization, before the start of the evaluation study. Any potential conflict of interest should be
avoided at all times.
The end-line evaluation will rely on the logical framework (see Annex I) and available data, including
programme documents, relevant research, and the base- and midline evaluation reports. All data will
be disaggregated for boys and girls, as well as geographically, and has a special focus on children
with disabilities.
It is proposed that the evaluation will include a literature review of relevant documents (which will be
shared by the MoGE and UNICEF as much as possible) and instruments will be developed to collect
quantitative as well as qualitative data of a representative sample of schools or beneficiaries. The
evaluation is suggested to be participatory in nature, and include data directly collected from the
beneficiaries. Research organizations can propose the data collection methods that best fit the
objectives described in these terms of reference, but the inclusion of high quality and innovative
research methods is highly encouraged. Research proposals are recommended to include detailed
information on the proposed data analysis, quality assurance and risk management. Previous work
samples, preferably of similar evaluations, should be shared with UNICEF as part of the application
process.
It is suggested that an inception report is first developed by the consulting firm, as the first deliverable
after the contract is signed. This report will include the selected research strategy in detail, as well as
(a first version of) the data collection instruments. These documents will then be used to obtain ethical
approval. Meetings with UNICEF focal point will take place at regular intervals, to ensure good
coordination, debrief throughout the evaluation and particularly to discuss and validate preliminary

Ethical consideration
Ethical aspects of the research, which include, among others, data collection from human subjects
and their consent should be covered in detail in technical proposals.
UNICEF is committed to ensuring that all research, evaluation and data collection processes
undertaken by UNICEF and its partners are ethical. To this end, procedures and guidelines have been
created to embed ethical principles and practices in all our evidence generation programmes.
UNICEF recognizes the critical importance of children’s voice in evidence generation and is
developing tools to support and advocate for ethical evidence generation involving children.
Guidelines are available here: https://www.unicef-irc.org/research/ethical-research-and-children/.
The evaluation should also follow the United Nations Evaluation Group Norms and Standards. These
will be shared with the selected contractor.
The research team will come into contact with school-aged children and should take precautions to
protect the rights and well-being of any children. Gender roles and expectations will need to be
considered, both with respect to the ability of community members to participate and group dynamics
of any focus groups, trainings, or interviews. The research will be required to rely on an equity-
sensitive and child rights-based approach. Ethical approval of the UNZA Research and Ethics
Committee (UNZAREC) will need to be obtained, and all data needs to be collected and processed
in a confidential manner. UNICEF will provide guidance on how to obtain ethical approval.

Purpose of the Study
Greetings! My name is ___________________________. I am a part of the survey team working with ACER India.
We are here to study the implementation of Zambian Girls 2030 Programme. This study is being administered to
assess the progress of the programme against its intended objective, which are:
1. Assess the programme’s effectiveness and evaluate to what extent has the programme achieved its intended
results at output and outcome level
2. Assess the programme’s efficiency, and evaluate how well have programme resources (financial, human,
technical) been used to achieve the results.
3. Assess the programme’s relevance and evaluate to what extent the programme design and intervention
responded to the needs and priorities of the beneficiaries as well as the strategic priorities of the Ministry of
General Education.
4. Assess the programme’s sustainability, and evaluate whether, without external support, key conditions and
factors are in place for the programme to continue to exist and be effective/efficient.
5. Finally, assess the programme’s equity focus, and evaluate to what extent has the programme addressed gender
unequal barriers to stay in school, gain interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
subjects, and successfully integrate into the labour market
