MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 7
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
Executive Summary
Evaluation purpose, objectives, and scope
Evaluation purpose: The evaluation’s overarching purpose was to provide UNICEF Country Offices
(COs), UNICEF Europe and Central Asia Regional Office (ECARO), and national governments and
partners with a critical assessment of the key adaptations made in UNICEF’s Early Childhood
Development (ECD) programmes in the region to meet the needs of young children and families in
the context of COVID-19. The secondary purpose was two-fold. First, it was to generate insight to
inform further development of the evaluated ECD activities. Second, it was to provide evidence to
inform future ECD efforts in similar emergencies. The evaluation was carried out in Croatia, Georgia,
Moldova, and Ukraine.
Evaluation scope: The evaluation focused on interventions that: ● were introduced directly in
response to COVID-19 or adapted to the context; ● entailed capacity building or information support
for frontline workers; ● and were viewed by a given UNICEF CO as useful to have feedback on for future
programming. These entailed both newly started interventions and those adapted to COVID-19 that
have already been part of ECD programmes. The evaluation concerned interventions implemented
between March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, and August 2021.
All selected interventions were assessed in terms of their relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability.
They were assessed in the context of broader UNICEF ECD and COVID-19 programming.
Evaluation methodology
Evaluation approach: The evaluation process was based on a developmental evaluation approach
due to a.) the dynamically changing context of the evaluated interventions and b.) their innovative
nature. As such, the evaluation focused on generating real-time evidence and learning for UNICEF
Croatia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine COs that can be used to enhance current programs.
The evaluation also included elements of a formative evaluation to highlight how the adapted or new
initiatives are working and what can be learned for future programming. During the evaluation,
simplified theories of change for the nine more deeply assessed interventions were developed.
The effectiveness of the remaining interventions was assessed based on results as provided in the
documentation, where available.
Data collection: The methodology was based on rapid data collection and analysis cycles, timely
feedback, and evaluative synthesis and reflection. A mix of qualitative and quantitative research
methods was used to collect and analyze the data. Desk research encompassed primary and
secondary sources concerning ECD in four in-depth countries, UNICEF’s programmes, and COVID-19
related activities in these countries, as well as the assessed interventions specifically. Two to three
cycles of data collection per country, depending on the CO preferences, were conducted. Each cycle
included: ● a survey with frontline workers; ● Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) with frontline workers,
Implementing Partners, selected governmental officials, local leaders of public services, and UNICEF
CO staff; ● a reflection workshop (with exceptions), to discuss findings from Analytical Briefs, from
which takeaways were recorded. In addition, the evaluation team completed Key Informant
Interviews with UNICEF staff and Implementing Partners of selected interventions.

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
Limitations: Collecting “good enough” evidence outweighed methodological rigor and involvement
of rights holders in the evaluation process. Online surveys may have excluded frontline workers with
few digital skills and ICT equipment from participating in the evaluation. Limited secondary and
primary data were available on interventions not covered by the rapid data collection cycles.
The evaluation process also revealed certain limitations for UNICEF to implement a developmental
evaluation (DE) approach to guide adaptation to complex, unpredictable situations such as the
current global health crisis.
Evaluation context
Various restrictions introduced to prevent the transmission of the virus and control the COVID-19
pandemic have affected early childhood development programmes in the ECA region in multiple
ways. Some of the main disruptions have entailed: i) loss of access to high-quality early learning;1
and ii) partial or complete suspension of other face-to-face child and family support services,
including ECI, nutrition and vaccination programmes, and routine health services for children and
pregnant women.2 The insights generated on previous epidemics show that the long-term
consequences of such disruptions for children may include threats to child survival and health, and
risks for child safety.3
The implications of these disruptions were not evenly distributed and affected vulnerable children
and families the most. The global health crisis remains a particularly challenging experience for
children with developmental delays and/or disabilities, at risk of harm, from families with low
socioeconomic status, living with single parents, from remote areas. It puts young children at risk of
falling behind because they and their caregivers often do not receive adequate support and do not
possess sufficient resources, knowledge, and skills to adjust to the changes instigated by the
emergency. In addition, social isolation affects the emotional state of family members, especially
women. During the pandemic, the burden of caring responsibilities was disproportionally higher for
women than men, particularly during preschools and other care facilities closure.4
Key findings
Relevance
The findings show that, in general, the adaptations in the UNICEF-support for ECD-related services
were well-suited to respond to the COVID-19 implications in addressing the needs of caregivers
and children, including those from vulnerable groups. The support concentrated on the caregivers’
immediate needs for (i) information and guidance to address the new context and stresses in daily

routines, for enhancing care and learning; (ii) safeguarded access to services adapted to the new
reality; (iii) access to PPE and hygiene supplies.
The core purposes of assessed interventions fit well with UNICEF ECD programming and remain
valid in an emergency context. They respond to systemic gaps exacerbated by the pandemic, such
as the lack of access to tailored information and support, including mental health support, weak
coordination among child-related services and policies, neglected health education and promotion,
limited parent-frontline worker cooperation, and insufficient competencies among ECD staff to
provide services in the pandemic context. However, without further efforts to strengthen and prioritize
building strong ECD systems in the ECA region, the systematic bottlenecks may impede the longevity
of the COVID-induced interventions.
However, service provision during the pandemic (especially using remote technologies) and
related trainings for frontline workers have not always considered the specific needs of different
groups of young children and their families and the ECD professionals working with them.
Evidence shows that digital solutions are not equally accessible and relevant for all groups, types of
services, and issues to be addressed. It means that without sufficient infrastructure, equipment, and
skills, the online mode of delivery alone may decrease access to opportunities for vulnerable children
and parents and frontline workers in disadvantaged regions. In addition, the online
trainings/meetings appeared to be more difficult for the frontline workers to stay engaged and
motivated. Without the possibility of real-life simulation, they were also described as less suitable for
gaining very practical skills. Finally, attitudes towards remote services – their perception as less
attractive, useful, or trustworthy – can also become a barrier to take-up. For instance, more
resistance was noted among caregivers to engage on issues related to psychological or emotional
problems or engage in their children’s ECI. However, in the latter’s case, traditionally high reliance on
institutional care and the need to be relieved from caregiving duties, e.g., to socialize, have also
played a role.
The findings indicate that needs assessment is essential for relevant and flexible COVID-19
response. While a systematic approach to determining needs has been rather difficult to implement
during the emergency, less sophisticated pre- and post-training needs assessment has been viewed
as helpful in capturing the changing needs throughout the pandemic and serving as a feedback
mechanism. A factor that partially compensated for the limitations in this area and ensured access
to information on current needs related to the ECD services was the collaboration of line ministries,
UNICEF, and other donors.
Effectiveness
The evaluated interventions equipped the frontline workers with skills and knowledge on how to
(i) safely deliver face-to-face ECD services, (ii) deliver ECD services remotely, and (iii) support
caregivers in organizing learning and implementing ECI for their children at homes. Shifting the
capacity-building activities to an online mode enabled continuity in training provision. In turn,
adapting the content of the trainings and e-courses to new COVID-19 realities helped improve the
frontline workers’ awareness and preparedness to adjust the way they provide ECD services.
Depending on the intervention, from 87% to 100% of the frontline workers surveyed apply the
knowledge and skills gained from the trainings, courses, and mentoring sessions in their daily work.
Coupled with providing direct information, guidance, and ECD services to the rights-holders, the
interventions contributed to continued ECD service delivery for young children and their families
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 10
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. The interventions also delivered on many critical needs of
young children and their families that existed before the pandemic, thus contributing to the broader
UNICEF and national ECD goals in the countries. This was mainly achieved through improving the
frontline workers’ competencies in using modern, child-centered, and family-centered ECD
practices.
The online mode for capacity-building activities or providing ECD Information and services
directly to the rights holders enabled a broad reach. Many of the interventions far exceeded the
planned number of beneficiaries trained. They also yielded unintended effects. First, according to the
key informants, they popularized online professional development in the four countries. Second, the
savings made by shifting trainings from face-to-face to the online mode enabled the development
of additional outputs (e.g., manuals or supplementary materials).
However, the online mode reduced the attractiveness of the trainings for some frontline workers.
Integrating opportunities for group interaction and follow-up mentoring was seen as necessary to
alleviate this shortcoming. In addition, requiring digital skills and equipment was considered less
effective in reaching the most vulnerable young children and their families. In this context, UNICEF’s
efforts to ensure access to ICT equipment and assistance for the caregivers were assessed as
valuable facilitating actions. Distributing information offline and on social media also increased the
accessibility of the assessed services for the most vulnerable.
At the same time, due to their one-off nature, the majority of the assessed capacity-building
interventions have not been able to fully prepare the frontline workers to carry out their work in the
targeted areas. ECD frontline workers who shared their views with the evaluators reported needing
substantial further mentoring, guidance, and peer-to-peer support to do their work. In the context of
the pandemic, the need for more guidance on how to (i) provide remote ECD services and (ii) work
with caregivers and support them in organizing ECE and ECI at home was frequently voiced.
The effectiveness of the interventions was limited by the low preparedness of caregivers to engage
in structured activities that support children’s learning and development in the family context,
poor digital skills, and limited access to ICT equipment among frontline workers and the
caregivers, and the current policy and regulatory environments. Regarding the former, the
evaluation showed that caregivers are often skeptical of the effectiveness of online support
modalities and lack the confidence to become the main providers of structured ECI and ECE for their
children.
Finally, COVID-19 exacerbated pre-existing weaknesses in the policy and regulatory environment
that continued to impact the interventions. These included insufficient financing, poor quality of ECD
services and infrastructure, lack of multi-sectoral coordination, inadequacies in the legal frameworks,
insufficient support for professional development and low wages of ECD workers, and lack of financial
and legal bases for remote provision of ECD services.
Sustainability
UNICEF COs in Croatia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine have taken steps to ensure the sustainability
of the assessed adaptations introduced in response to COVID-19. There are plans to continue them
in a new format and context, make them more targeted, include them in national policies, and make
the learnings available for a wider audience. Notably, the experiences gained from some of the
responses to COVID-19 are used as an opportunity to strengthen policies and systems concerning
/ 11

ECD. Including them in ECD policy and planning contributes to the sustainability of their results and
more resilient ECD service provision. At the same time, policy – or the lack of it – can hinder the
sustainability of interventions assessed in this report. For instance, several issues in the regulatory
and institutional framework concerning EI affect effective ECI service provision in Croatia and Ukraine.
Prospects for sustainability also increase if the intervention outputs are embedded in a
professional development system and have the support of relevant stakeholders. Some
considerable efforts and plans have been identified in this regard, such as the inclusion of manuals,
recommendations, and online courses into regular professional development programmes.
Ensuring wider access to the adapted approaches to capacity-building activities is essential to
achieving sustainable outcomes. In this sense, activities directed at building a broader
understanding and awareness among peer frontline workers and a wider audience promoted the
sustainability of the results and measures. This refers to issues such as the importance of
preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic, positive parenting, cooperation between
ECD staff and their engagement with parents, or the quality of remote service provision. A range of
tools and steps implemented across the interventions have been identified to address them with
potential for further dissemination of the interventions’ outputs and experiences.
In their effort to adapt their ECD programmes in response to COVID-19, UNICEF COs and RO also aim
to enhance the longer-term resilience of ECD systems to render them better suited to withstanding
similar shocks in the future. In this regard, they applied the following main resilience-enhancing
approaches: 1) alternative and flexible modes of delivering services; 2) coordination of activities
across government and key stakeholders; 3) organizational learning culture responsive to crises.
While it was not possible to assess conclusively to what extent these approaches improve the
resilience of services, especially in the long run, the report presents some notable achievements in
this regard.
Conclusions
In general, the adaptations in the UNICEF-supported ECD services were well suited to respond to the
COVID-19 context in addressing the needs of caregivers and children. They addressed caregivers’
immediate needs for information and guidance to adjust to the new reality of their child’s
development and safeguarded access to services, PPE, and hygiene supplies. Vulnerable groups
have been at the center of UNICEF ECD programmes and their adaptations during the COVID-19
pandemic. However, crucial challenges emerged for reaching out to disadvantaged groups via
remote modalities. The reasons for this included limited/lack of information about vulnerable children
and families and their needs and not enough specific guidance on using remote technologies for
these target groups.
Increased digitalization of capacity-building activities and service provision in the ECD area was
one of the main changes accelerated by COVID-19. It made it possible to continue the ECD service
provision and professional development of ECD staff during the pandemic. The flexibility and cost-
effectiveness of this form of delivery made the interventions more accessible in remote geographical
areas. Moreover, there is now greater scope for applying distant forms of interaction. However, digital
solutions are not equally relevant and effective for all groups, types of services, and problems.
Without sufficient infrastructure, equipment, and skills, choosing an online mode of delivery as the
only option may decrease access to opportunities for vulnerable children, parents, and frontline
workers.
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 12
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
The evaluation findings highlight a gre at need for creating more opportunities for current and
future frontline workers’ professional development. The main area where improvements are
needed to increase staff preparedness is the lack of continuous supervision and support to ensure
the quality of services. More opportunities for networking and exchanging knowledge with peers
and/or other professionals are also needed. Frontline workers require more guidance and support in
delivering modern ECD services both in and beyond the context of the pandemic. Communication
between frontline workers and caregivers is a key area where frontline workers need more training
and support.
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed some systemic bottlenecks and gaps in the level of
preparedness among state actors for a global health crisis, which hinder the effectiveness and
sustainability of the assessed interventions.5 Caregivers’ awareness and attitudes towards
pandemic-related changes in service provision is another key factor that hampers quality ECD
provision during the pandemic.
UNICEF and its partners’ rapid and responsive reaction to COVID-19 helped ensure ECD services’
continued relevance. UNICEF’s management of the interventions and focus on activities directed at
learning from COVID-19 represent a good example of an adaptive approach. They also reflect the
flexibility and adaptability of UNICEF COs in an emergency. This was facilitated by collecting “good
enough” evidence during the emergency to grasp the key needs and respond appropriately.
Lessons learned
Lesson learned # 1: The long-standing collaboration between UNICEF, line ministries, civil society
actors, and donors makes UNICEF and its partners better equipped to cope with the unprecedented
context and contributes to organizational resilience.
Lesson learned # 2: Designated strategies to ensure the inclusion of the most vulnerable groups are
needed when using ICT solutions to deliver ECD services and information to young children and their
families.
Lesson learned # 3: Comprehensive information and methodological and mental health support for
caregivers are essential to provide effective remote ECD support to young children and their families.
Lesson learned # 4: Delivering capacity-building activities entirely online should be opted for only
when face-to-face contact is impossible, and hybrid mode should be preferred otherwise.
Lesson learned # 5: The COVID-19 crisis magnified the value of rapid-learning to adapt the support
and service delivery to the emergency context.

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
1.0 Introduction
The resilience of societies heavily depends on how governments and civil society organizations
design and implement policies for mitigating risks, preparing for, reacting to, overcoming, and
learning from disasters.6 The COVID-19 pandemic has shown some disturbing gaps in the level of
preparedness among state and non-state actors for a global health crisis. It also exposed the
significance of and the need for support for ECD, ECD workforce, and parents/caregivers to ensure
the continuity of various care-, learning - and protection-related services for children and their
families during and after the current crisis.
The current crisis has stimulated innovative approaches – often involving new technologies – on
the part of governments, partners, and providers in support of early childhood development and
affected it in predictable and less predictable ways. Settings, daily programmes, and staff teams
have had to be radically reconfigured, e.g., to offer distance service solutions, meet public health
requirements for staff and children, and meet child needs to achieve their full potential. Settings have
also had to adapt to frequent changes in government guidance as the pandemic developed and
again when emerging from the crisis.7
As this report presents, UNICEF’s early childhood development (ECD) teams across the Europe and
Central Asia (ECA) region have played a critical role in developing national responses to COVID-19.
Efforts were recalibrated to address the immediate needs of young children and their families. This
included re-purposing and strengthening available resources and workforce to provide information
and services in the circumstances of home confinement, reduced availability of ECD services, and an
ongoing public health threat.
Given the unprecedented nature of the situation, evidence is needed on appropriate and effective
ways to increase preparedness and response to such challenging situations. Accordingly, the main
lessons learned need to be distilled from the pandemic experiences to develop long-term recovery
plans and budgets for ECD services to strengthen the resilience of ECD systems across ECA. However,
to date, there is little systematic, ‘good enough’ evidence available that would contribute to a
better understanding and implementation of the COVID-19-induced adaptations and their
capacity to make sustainable improvements in the ECD services and their resilience in general.
For this purpose, UNICEF ECA Regional Office (ECARO) commissioned Ecorys to carry out the Multi-
Country Evaluation of the UNICEF ECD response to COVID-19 in the ECA region. A developmental
evaluation approach was adapted to provide rapid evidence and enable real-time adjustment of
ongoing efforts. The evaluation entailed an in-depth study in four ECA countries: Croatia, Georgia,
Moldova, and Ukraine, with a view on the lessons learned from the region as a whole. The evaluation
started in November 2020 and continued until the end of 2021.
This report synthesizes findings from the four in-depth study countries and a reflection workshop with
UNICEF representatives from RO and COs from the ECA region. It covers selected UNICEF-supported
ECD response to COVID-19 – both continuing at present and discontinued – implemented from March

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
2020 to August 2021 to respond to COVID -19 pandemics in Croatia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. It
summarizes the evaluation team’s assessment of the relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability of
UNICEF’s ECD response to COVID-19, followed by a set of lessons learned and recommendations
focusing on ECARO. The audience for the synthesis report is UNICEF’s Regional Office, but the findings
are also useful to UNICEF COs starting their new programme cycles in 2022 to reflect on the lessons
learned that apply to their contexts.
The evaluation team would like to express their gratitude to the staff of UNICEF COs for their
continuous support. We also thank the governments of Croatia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine, the
Implementing Partners, and all the frontline workers from a range of institutions who shared their
experiences and views with us. Finally, we thank the staff from the UNICEF ECARO Evaluation and ECD
teams for their invaluable inputs, guidance, and management of the evaluation.
1.1 Evaluation purpose, objectives, and scope
1.1.1 Evaluation purpose and objectives
This evaluation’s overarching purpose was to provide UNICEF COs in Croatia, Georgia, Moldova, and
Ukraine, UNICEF ECA Regional Office, and national governments and partners with a critical
assessment of the key adaptations made in UNICEF ECD programmes in the ECA region to meet the
changing needs of young children and their families. The secondary purpose of this evaluation was
twofold: 1) to provide real-time feedback and generate learnings to inform the further development
of the assessed ECD activities adapted or newly designed to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic;
and 2) to provide evidence to inform future ECD efforts in similar emergencies.
The objectives of the evaluation were to:
o assess the extent to which the ECD activities (interventions) are being implemented in the
selected countries, how they are meeting the needs of young children and families, especially
when their needs change as the COVID-19 outbreak evolves, and
o assess the effectiveness of the ECD activities in improved programming and systems
strengthening support to governments in the selected countries.
In line with the above, the main evaluation questions were as follows:

Based on these questions, a list of sub-questions was developed that is presented in Annex 1, Volume
2 of this report.8
1.1.2 Evaluation scope
In terms of its geographic scope, the evaluation entailed an in-depth study in four ECA countries:
Croatia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. The current report combines and triangulates all feedback
gathered at earlier evaluation stages, i.e., during the research in four in-depth study countries, and
incorporates findings from additional desk research and the reflection workshop with other COs from
the region. The temporal scope of the evaluation was from March 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak
started, and up to the moment of their evaluation (completed interventions were evaluated up until
their end).
As to the substantive scope (evaluation object), specific interventions for evaluation were selected
based on a set of criteria developed during the Inception Phase. Covering all ECD-related
interventions and adaptations implemented in response to COVID-19 was impossible for their sheer
volume and extent. Thus, the evaluation focused on interventions which:
• were either introduced directly in response to COVID-19 or in some way adapted to its new
realities; and
• entail(ed) capacity building or information support to the frontline workers; and
• were viewed by the UNICEF COs as especially useful to have feedback on for future
programming.
At the same time, activities that do not fall under these criteria, as requested by ToR, and were not
delivered through “a workforce” (frontline workers), were not covered by the evaluation.9 Therefore,
the primary data collected focused on the frontline workers' trainings. Other components of the
interventions have not been assessed. For example, reference to the PPE and other necessary
supplies was made only if it related to findings on frontline workers’ capacity-building activities. The
table below provides a summary of all activities that were covered by this evaluation.

No cost analysis is included because efficiency analysis was not considered a priority for the context and approach.
9 Excluded interventions: interventions which focus on the provision of COVID-19-related guidelines and recommendations to
government bodies and other actors, provision of learning/health kits to children/mothers, or the provision of training
directly to the caregivers without training or preparing the frontline workers.

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
The evaluation findings will inform ECD pr ogramming in the near future in relation to situations similar
to COVID-19 to ensure the continuity of ECD-related services delivered to children and families.
1.2 Approach and methodology
In line with the developmental evaluation approach, the evaluation focused on a) collecting and
analyzing real-time data (“good enough” evidence as per ToR) to answer the evaluation questions
and b) supporting the use of the obtained evidence for ongoing programme adaptation. For this
purpose, nine interventions were selected by UNICEF Country Offices for in-depth analysis of their
relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability during rapid assessment cycles. Each cycle focused on
one intervention, selected per the criteria outlined above.
At the beginning of each cycle, the evaluators re-constructed basic theories of change (ToCs) using
desk review and scoping interviews with the respective UNICEF COs. They were to provide an overall
picture of the analyzed projects since none were developed before. As such, they had a more
illustrative purpose and were used for developing interview/survey questions, but not for rigorous
evaluation against them.
For each cycle, the evaluators collected and analyzed data on the intervention, provided rapid
feedback to the CO, and facilitated evaluative reflection and programming adaptation.
The data collection methods included a mix of qualitative and quantitative techniques: desk
review, online surveys (hereafter referred to as “the evaluation surveys”) with frontline workers who
took part in assessed activities10 and Key Informant Interviews with selected stakeholders (including
duty bearers), frontline workers, and UNICEF COs from Croatia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine (refer
to the Evaluation Matrix and Data Collection Tools in Annexes 2 and 4, Volume 2, respectively, for more
details). Respondents for interviews were selected based on a stakeholder mapping carried out
jointly by the evaluators and the CO staff during the inception phase (please see Annex 3, Volume 2).
For each intervention analyzed in-depth, stakeholders were mapped according to the degree of (i)
their influence on the intervention and (ii) the impact of the intervention on the stakeholders.
Stakeholders with the most influence and impact were selected for individual interviews.
Representatives of duty bearers (government, civil society organizations) were also invited to
participate in the evaluation reflection workshops, review analytical briefs, and join the Evaluation
Reference Group (ERG).
The qualitative data from interviews and surveys were subject to thematic analysis using MAXQDA.
The evaluation team used coding to develop themes by identifying items of analytic interest in the
data and tagging these with a coding label. The quantitative data gathered from the surveys was
subject to quantitative data analysis. This included studying the distributions, spreads, and centers
of responses. Cross-tabulation was also used to investigate potential correlations between variables.
The key findings, conclusions, and preliminary recommendations were drawn up in Analytical Briefs
(attached in Annexes to the Country Reports) based on each rapid assessment cycle. The briefs were
reviewed by the RO and the COs and revised based on their feedback.
After the cycles, reflection workshops were organized with each CO, the ECARO, and relevant key
stakeholders. The primary purpose of the workshops was to provide space for evaluative reflection,
10 The online surveys were distributed to all of the frontline workers to whom e-mail addresses were available.

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
prioritize and refine the recommendatio ns, and discuss how they could be best implemented. The
secondary purpose was to build capacity for evaluative thinking, increase understanding and
ownership of the findings, and, accordingly, the likelihood that they will be used.11 After the workshops,
the evaluators prepared a short note with key takeaways from the meeting (see Annexes to the
Country Reports). Based on recommendations from the Analytical Briefs and workshop discussions,
the COs prepared a list of key actions to be taken. It is the evaluators’ understanding that these
actions were implemented or planned to be integrated into the formal management response of the
evaluation, fulfilling the objectives of the developmental evaluation.
Figure 1 outlines the key steps taken as part of each rapid assessment cycle and a mix of qualitative
and quantitative research methods to collect and analyze the data.

In addition to the in-depth analysis carried out through the rapid assessment cycles, other
interventions which fulfilled the selection criteria were analyzed based on desk research, primarily in
terms of their relevance. The evaluation also included a review of primary and secondary sources
concerning UNICEF’s broader ECD programming and COVID-19 response in the in-depth countries.
The documents reviewed are enlisted in the Country Reports.
Finally, as mentioned earlier, the evaluation entailed an element of a formative inquiry to help shape
the future of ECD programming in the four countries concerned.
1.2.1 Ethics
The evaluation methodology did not foresee data collection with child participants or representatives
of other, particularly vulnerable groups. However, it did involve respondents through the survey and
interviews. Consequently, the team followed the highest standards of ethics, including the UNICEF
Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis (2021), the
UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation (2020)12, and the research protocol designed for this study

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
(please see Annex 5, Volume 2). The eval uation team respected the following principles13 throughout
its engagement with UNICEF: Respect for dignity and diversity; Fair representation; Compliance with
codes for vulnerable groups (e.g., ethics of research involving young children or vulnerable groups);
Redress; Confidentiality; and Avoidance of harm.
1.2.2 Limitations of the evaluation
The key limitations to analysis included:
o Focus on collecting 'good enough' evidence to provide rapid feedback that makes adaptations
in real-time possible (developmental evaluation approach) outweighed methodological rigor.
Hence, upon agreement with the ECARO, interviews or surveys with the final beneficiaries -
rights holders (i.e., children and their families) - of the interventions were not included in the
methodology not to jeopardize the rapid nature of the data collection and analysis cycles. In
effect, the evaluators had to rely on secondary evidence and the views of frontline workers to
generate findings on the relevance and effectiveness of the interventions for the final
beneficiaries. For a similar reason, reconstruction of detailed ToCs and heavy reliance on ToCs
were not possible, and the participation of other duty bearers (government, CSOs) was
relatively limited.
o Limited secondary data was available on desk-reviewed interventions, where no interviews or
surveys were envisaged to complement desk research results. Consequently, this report is
mostly based on findings from three cycles of rapid data collection.
o Quantitative information was collected using online surveys, which may have excluded
frontline workers with few digital skills and ICT equipment from participating in the evaluation.
In addition, many of the email addresses to the frontline workers received by the evaluators
were generic institutional e-mails. This impacted the response rates in the surveys.
o The availability of gender-disaggregated data was marginal. For many of the interventions,
UNICEF did not collect gender-disaggregated data. The collection of such data was attempted
for the first rapid assessment cycle, but because women heavily outnumbered men as
respondents in the surveys in general, no sensible gender analysis could be conducted.
o Operational efficiency, and efficiency in general, were not within the scope of this evaluation.
Focus on monitoring and evaluation was made only from the perspective of their contribution
to achieving outcomes/outputs.
o The evaluators were not involved in the process of change inspired by the evaluation findings
as different interventions were assessed throughout the three rapid data collection cycles
(instead of repeating the assessment of one). Such an approach was agreed with the UNICEF
ECARO to collect more data and increase the utility of findings for future programming.
o Upon request of the UNICEF CO and ECARO, the analysis covered the COVID-19 context only, i.e.,
the interventions were not analyzed from a broad child rights perspective.
Finally, the evaluation process reveals certain limitations for UNICEF to implement a developmental
evaluation (DE) approach to guide adaptation to complex, unpredictable situations such as the
current global health crisis. These limitations arise from: ● COs staff too overburdened to engage in
ongoing inquiry; ● expectations shifting from DE towards conventional formative evaluation (with a
13 As per UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation (2008)
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 21
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
strong focus on ToCs, results, ”lessons lea rned”, and predefined evaluation questions that have to be
answered); ● lower acceptance for findings based on small samples, which are “trade-offs between
the level of certainty and speed”;14 ● assessing interventions that have already been finalized; and ●
capacity (procedural requirements) for implementing suggested changes in assessed interventions
along the way. Other, less demanding approaches that also envisage engagement of COs and focus
on lessons learned could be considered.

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
2.0 Evaluation context
As emphasized in the United Nations Secretary-General's Policy Brief, children are at risk of being
amongst the most severe victims of COVID-19.15 There is ample evidence that children bear a heavy
burden from the disruption of essential services, increased social isolation, and loss of family income,
which is particularly acute for children who have been experiencing marginalization before the
outbreak.16 Since infectious diseases are an emerging trend that becomes “more prevalent and
harder to control”, supporting children, their families, and care providers is critical during and after
the current global health emergency.17
The following sections set the context for the evaluation of UNICEF’s ECD response to COVID-19 in
Europe and Central Asia by summarizing the main implications of the 2020-2021 pandemic on
children, their caregivers, and frontline workers, the reasons behind them, and the adaptations made
by UNICEF in the ECD sector in response to the global health emergency.
2.1 Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for ECD in the
ECA region
2.1.1 Implications for children and caregivers
2.1.1.1 Disruption of early learning services
All national governments from the assessed countries and the rest of the ECA region closed early
childhood education (ECE) services at the outset of the pandemic, leaving children under the
exclusive guidance for learning to their caregivers between March and summer 2020. The lockdown
was introduced without prior verification by local authorities if the family arrangements were
conducive to ensuing learning and adequate care for children. Caregivers were often unprepared to
engage in their child’s physical, emotional, social, or cognitive development, especially in previously
unknown and challenging circumstances. ECE was therefore predicated on caregivers' educational
background, teaching capacities, access to external support, and the time and amount of work
needed to sustain family economic stability. This unprecedented situation has left many
preschool-aged children, particularly those with insufficient family support or in precarious
family situations, without access to high-quality or, in fact, any early education.
Since the support for early learning and contacts between parents and educators during the
lockdowns and quarantines heavily relied – with various results – on remote technologies, the

pandemic has revealed underlying ineq uities created by the digital divide.18 On the one hand, the
issue of a digital gap has imposed significant obstacles for many preschools to organize the
educational processes during the pandemic.19 For instance, various studies have revealed that many
kindergartens did not achieve complete coverage with remote services, leaving many children
completely withdrawn from preschool interactions.20 The most affected by this situation were
children whose caregivers do not possess sufficient digital skills, lack access to digital tools and
the internet, and have been systematically deprived of access to quality education (e.g., children
from economically unprivileged households and Roma children).21 For those children, and for all
children in general, the deprivation of the critical preschool year seems to be particularly detrimental
as it is most likely to widen the already existing school readiness and attainment gaps.22
2.1.1.2. Disruption of healthcare and social services
Various restrictions introduced at an unprecedented scale to prevent the transmission and control
the pandemic also had profound implications for healthcare and social services.23 Compared to the
year before COVID-19, the Country Offices (COs) from the four case study countries noted declines
in areas such as: newborn health care, protection and promotion of breastfeeding programmes,
home visits by social service/justice workers, disability health-related services, support child
protection interventions, and gender-based violence (GBV) risk mitigation.24
There were various reasons reported for these implications. COs highlighted the closure and
postponement of services (or facilities) and lockdown restrictions to service users’ and providers’
mobility and transportation as impacting child protection service and use. Reduction in demand due
to the fear of infection and closure of services/facilities or postponed services were top reasons for
health service disruption.25 This includes antenatal and postnatal care services neonatal, and child
health care. For the same reasons, nutrition services were disrupted in the evaluated countries, but in
this case, personnel gaps due to sickness, mobility restriction, or fear have also played a key role.
The most vulnerable to disruptions in health care provision and other child-supporting
programmes were children with disabilities and special needs, children living in poverty and areas
of armed conflict, ethnic minorities such as Roma, migrant, and refugee children, and those with

housing and food insecurity.26 The high costs related to COVID-19 and its implications that children
bear due to their vulnerable situations include famine and nutritional deficiencies, exclusion from
attention and access to the severely stretched health systems, increased risk of physical,
psychological, and sexual abuse – particularly for girls, and reduced opportunities to encounter
supportive adults and to access the justice system and child protection services.27
2.1.1.3. Disruption of family routine/life
The pandemic had equally far-reaching negative consequences for family life and routine.
Caregivers were often overwhelmed by balancing work and childcare arrangements, anxious
about being furloughed or losing their job. They were also stressed about not being able to provide
their children with access to devices and services necessary to engage with distant services.28
While during the lockdown, primary care providers spent more time caring for their children, they felt
that parenting was more challenging than in a non-crisis situation.29 One reason for this was their
limited mental and emotional capacity to cope with the hardship. They were also not prepared to
engage in stress-reducing activities with their children to ease children’s anxiety and respond to their
need for more attachment and higher demands on a parent, which are common during times of
stress and crisis.30 All this has negatively affected children and their caregivers' mental health and
emotional well-being, but the most severe effects of these implications concern children with
disabilities and those facing material deprivation. Their primary caregivers have been
disproportionately more often forced to use their annual leave and reduce food, heating, or children’s
education expenses.31 Evidence shows that parents of children with disabilities for whom community
services were often suspended reported the highest need for professional help and psychological
counseling related to childcare.32
The additional burden of extra-care was disproportionately and systematically placed on women,
who play the role of primary caregiver and educator in a household.33 The increased time spent at
home also meant an increased risk for vulnerable women and exposure to gender-based violence
(GBV) due to job loss, lack of income, domestic tension, and lack of access to information on where
to seek help.34 The lockdowns not only exposed children to the increased risk of witnessing abuse, but

they also substantially increased the risk of their experience of physical and psychological violence,
particularly among children with disabilities.35 The crisis intensified the occurrence of violence and
“harsh disciplining” due to parental stress related to financial hardship, social isolation, and lack of
contact with social services.36 These and other immediate disruptions caused by COVID-19, coupled
with a prolonged economic crisis that is likely to ensue, may compromise children’s healthy long-
term development.
2.1.2 Implications for ECD workforce
The pandemic had immense repercussions on frontline workers, who are usually hit the hardest
during disease outbreaks. At the early stages of the outbreak, ECD services suffered from shortages
in personal protective equipment (PPE), hygiene, and medical supplies. International supply chains
were disrupted, and national procurement processes could not sufficiently respond to such a large-
scale public health emergency.37 There were also no clear guidelines on carrying out the services
in these new circumstances, particularly during the first months of the crisis.38 This made frontline
workers (especially from the healthcare sector) and their closest families more vulnerable to
infection.39
This new, unpredictable situation made ECD staff prone to face greater stress, fatigue, and
exhaustion. In addition to fears related to personal safety, the stress level was also intense due to
existing shortages of staff and resources, high workload, caring for their own children’s learning at
home, and handling caregivers’ anxiety.40 Furthermore, the sudden need to effectively switch the
services online under immense time pressure left many frontline workers struggling to manage
challenges connected with providing the same quality services via the internet.41 It also exposed
their insufficient digital skills and the need to adapt to the new forms of collaboration in the digital
environment, including a redefinition of their relations with caregivers who had to undertake a more
partnering role in service delivery.42
In this context, the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the education and early
years sectors required a massive and quick effort from governments and humanitarian agencies to
respond to the various ways in which child support services were affected by this crisis. Developing
flexible, alternative approaches to ECD programmes to serve families and support frontline workers
were given priority by UNICEF to build an immediate pandemic response to the emerging and/or
35 Already prior to COVID-19, compared to children without disabilities, children with various disabilities (e.g., cognitive,
language, sensory or motor disabilities) were more likely to experience severe physical violence from their caregivers.

aggravated challenges.43 The following s ection summarizes UNICEF’s support to ensure continuity of
services in the new operational context.
2.2. UNICEF support to ECD in selected ECA countries in the
context of COVID-19
UNICEF has introduced a plethora of COVID-19-related adaptations in its ECD-related programmes
to mitigate the needs caused or aggravated by the global health emergency. In general, the mix of
response and preparedness measures could be divided into three groups focused on providing: i)
information and guidelines, ii) capacity building and technical assistance, and, iii) equipment and
other supplies. A brief description of these interventions is presented below.
2.1.3 Information and guidance/guidelines
The primary set of UNICEF’s initiatives, aiming to expand basic preventive behaviors and COVID-19
awareness, is centered around the Risk Communication and Community Engagement pillar. Within
the education sector, UNICEF helped to prepare and promote the guidelines on basic preventive
measures (such as safe use of transport, use of masks) or the protocols on school reopening and
safe operating of kindergartens.44 Furthermore, it helped provide inclusive preschool education by
providing information on including children with disabilities and supported translating existing
guidelines into minority languages.45 It has also backed ECD staff with various guides, such as a
teachers’ guide for organizing effective distance learning that considers the individual needs of
children and their families or guides on positive parenting.46
UNICEF provided information on newborn care, breastfeeding, nutrition, and immunization to support
caregivers affected by limited access to healthcare services.47 It also supported initiatives such as
online courses, a mobile application, and infographics on pregnancy, birth, and breastfeeding during
the COVID-19 pandemic in different linguistic versions.48 With the support of prominent ECD and
health experts, UNICEF provided materials to help caregivers of young children maintain physical and
mental health during the crisis.49 It also offered a comprehensive counseling guide for healthcare
professionals on how to talk with patients about COVID-19 to promote positive behaviors and
reduction of COVID-19 related stigma and discrimination.50

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
2.1.4 Capacity-building a nd technical assistance
Since the pandemic started, UNICEF has been actively assisting the development of governments’
crisis response plans, adaptations of ECD services, and the capacity of ECD professionals by offering
technical and training activities to better adjust to the crisis. Examples of UNICEF’s ECD response in
these areas include:
o organization of training sessions for ECD workers in pandemic-related issues to support the
adaptation of and/or strengthening the existing services for families with young children
during the pandemic;
o making adjustments to previously planned interventions, such as moving the regular training
for ECD staff online;51
o designing and preparing alternative education programmes through online channels, radio,
and television to ensure the continuity of learning and access to remote learning
programmes.52
UNICEF has also supported the digital initiatives in the healthcare systems within the ECA region53 and
participated in activities strengthening the infrastructure needed for infection prevention and control
(IPC) measures for better protection of children and their mothers.54
Finally, the data collection, research, and analysis carried out by UNICEF contributed to evidence-
based policy-making dedicated to young children and their families during the pandemic.55 Among
others, these efforts assisted in defining the existing gaps and needs in WASH, assessing the socio-
economic impact of COVID-19 on families and children, or estimating COVID-19 infant isolation and
care capacity.56
2.1.5 Equipment and other supplies
Despite the significant disruptions in global supply chains, UNICEF delivered critical supplies,
principally to states and communities experiencing the most severe consequences of the WASH gap
and digital divide. Backed by donors and governments, UNICEF was among the first to procure and
facilitate the distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) to ECD frontline workers, including
staff from health centers and social welfare professionals working with children without adequate
parental care and children with behavioral problems.57 In addition, it has been supporting the

The organization has also supported families and children directly. It has been supplying essential
hygienic resources such as cleaning products or disinfectants. In addition, to mitigate the
educational implications of the pandemic, it delivered books, educational materials, early learning
kits.59 It has also backed the early educational services by providing laptops to teachers and children
affected most severely by impacts of poverty (e.g., community living in Abkhazia, the Roma
population).60

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
3.0 Key findings
3.1 Relevance
This section discusses the relevance of the UNICEF ECD response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the
four case study countries in the five areas of concern: health and nutrition, early childhood education,
early childhood intervention, family/caregivers support, and the relevance of these interventions to
the broader ECD country programme frameworks. It presents evaluation findings on the relevance of
the pandemic-caused adaptations supporting ECD services to changing needs and priorities of
young children, their families, and the ECD workforce. The responsiveness of these adaptations to the
evolving context and perspectives for services’ continuation in the adapted format in the future is
further elaborated. Finally, the section presents findings concerning the consistency of the results of
the evaluated adaptations with goals and the expected ECD outcomes at the country level.
3.1.1 Health and nutrition
As described in section 2.1.1.2, the COVID-19 and the measures imposed to protect health during the
pandemic have affected access to healthcare services in many ways. To address challenges
related to this situation, UNICEF Cos from the in-depth study countries supported eight interventions
in the health and nutrition area. Most of them were designed to address the pregnancy-related needs
during the pandemic, such as:
o information on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women, their unborn or newborn
children and other related aspects (e.g., breastfeeding, nutrition, safe access health care
services, infection);
o preventing deterioration of the quality standards in the maternity wards during the pandemics;
o provision of nutrition and care for premature newborns who cannot be breastfed; and
o access to ante-natal care and specialists during the pandemic, and healthcare
services/facilities in general.
Other forms of support addressed the high demand of PPE and hygiene supplies (in all countries) for
health workers and hospitals, the need for updated protocols on infection prevention and control
(IPC) at the primary health care level (in particular in Moldova and Ukraine), the HIV testing services
for pregnant women, and WASH interventions in conflict settings (in Ukraine).
The following parts assess the relevance of these adaptations to the needs of young children and
their caregivers and the frontline workers.
3.1.1.1 Children and caregivers
The evaluation findings show that, in general, the adaptations in the UNICEF support for
healthcare-related services were well suited to respond to the COVID-19 implications in
addressing the needs of children and caregivers. They were particularly relevant to address the new
challenges in providing safe and uninterrupted healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic.
They turned out to be suitable for addressing the inequalities in the availability of health care services

also beyond the emergency context, s uch as in conflict areas of Eastern Ukraine. The following
evidence supports these claims:
o In Croatia, the relevance of UNICEF programmes such as “Neonatal-Baby Friendly Hospital
Initiative”, “Human Milk Bank” or “E-education for Pregnancy and Parenting during COVID-19”
was assessed as high, in particular, due to their adapted content to the COVID-19 pandemic
context. Since many baby-friendly practices were abandoned with the pandemic outbreak
(e.g., birth companions, feeding premature or sick babies with their mothers’ milk), UNICEF’s
advocacy, research, education, and technical assistance helped address the needs of parents
of newborns for adequate treatment in maternity wards and Neonatal Intensive Care Units
(NICUs), according to the Key Informants. For instance, as documented in relevant sources,
Roda’s “e-education for pregnancy” intervention responded to the need of pregnant women
and their partners for information and guidance on pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding.61
The interviewed Key Informants highlighted that the self-paced online course directly
responded to the needs of pregnant women and their partners. The course evaluation survey
carried out by Roda showed that over 90% of the respondents (n=791) thought that the topics
were well covered and that additional materials provided were useful.62
o Also, in Moldova, relevant knowledge and skills gained from
the training on COVID-19 response for women and their
children in 12 perinatal centers helped the frontline workers
provide precise and reliable information about COVID-19 and
its potential impact on health.63 As further specified by Key
Informants, the information and quality support received by
pregnant women served as stress-reducing and comfort-
adding factors in the emergency. They made them less
vulnerable to COVID-19 health-related and psychological
implications. The healthcare staff’s preparation was
perceived as helpful in supporting women to overcome their
anxiety and reservations in contacting health service
providers during the pandemic.
• As indicated during KIIs, the introduction of the UPHV model
with telemedicine in Ukraine provided “families, who for various reasons have limited or no
access to the system of quality health services, access to medical and psychological services”.
They also suggested that it would help address the severe problem of access to specialists
(located mainly in the cities), including psychologists and highly specialized health care
professionals. The relevance of the UNICEF approach was further increased with its family-
centered, holistic, and progressive approach, which is particularly important in Ukraine’s
context, explained evaluation respondents. This is because antenatal patronage has been
abolished, and the existing medical services for young children have not provided targeted and

holistic support. Contrary to the ex amples above, COVID-19 was not considered by some Key
Informants as a vital factor causing challenges for healthcare provision, probably because the
assessed intervention is implemented in areas already experiencing severe crisis and
shortages. In addition, hygiene supplies were also provided to parents of newly born children
together with material support and ECD information package (e.g., vaccinations and
breastfeeding) as part of the government’s and UNICEF’s “Baby Box” initiative.
• Finally, the Shared Medical Appointments (SMAs) in Georgia were reported by participating
women as having a calming effect on them during self-isolation by allowing them to spend
time with clinicians and connect with each other.64 Also, a UNICEF CO representative reported
that the overall participant response was positive. Still, more evidence is required to confirm
that antenatal consultations in the shape of SMAs were of value to participants.65
Vulnerable groups have been at the center of UNICEF ECD programmes and their adaptations
during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the assessed interventions have generally addressed these
groups’ needs. For instance, the BFHI and Human Milk Bank interventions in Croatia focused on
mothers of sick and premature babies and laboring mothers barred of a company at birth. The “E-
education for Pregnancy and Parenting during COVID-19” intervention was also intended to focus on
the most vulnerable groups of pregnant women. In Ukraine, children from socially vulnerable families
are expected to especially benefit from the piloted combination of home visits (UPHV) with
telemedicine. These two approaches should provide caregivers with timely advice on childcare and
nurturing caregiving for optimal child development and help identify children who “dropped out” of
the system and remain without medical supervision, especially in the conflict zone.
At the same time, some indications suggest that the assessed interventions faced challenges
concerning the relevance of the online mode of service provision, especially when reaching the
most vulnerable groups. For instance, based on the profile of the evaluation survey respondents,
persons from vulnerable groups accounted for minimal shares of Roda’s e-courses in Croatia, but
the reasons for this are unclear. In Ukraine, some respondents pointed out the risk of negative
selection of the most vulnerable families, who have problems with access to a stable internet
connection, lack IT equipment and skills, from the scope of the telemedicine intervention. The online
mode was also indicated as not equally relevant for all pregnant women invited to participate in
Georgia. Evidence shows that many of them replied negatively to the invitation due to the lack of
access to the Internet, while others resigned from participation at a later stage.66 While there might
be various explanations for this phenomenon, one Key Informant suggested discomfort with the
shared/group character of service provided (i.e., SMAs) and reluctance to consult personal issues
online.
Finally, the findings on gender- and violence-related aspects of the assessed interventions are
limited. The Key Informants in Moldova said that due to the emergency mode of operation, lack of
sufficient time to prepare the training, and a high number of subjects to be covered, the assessed
intervention did not cover enough aspects related to abuse and violence in households. They will be
addressed during similar interventions (i.e., post-partum depression and violence against children,
both chosen out of observed necessity). In Croatia, gender issues were tackled indirectly, e.g., by
promoting baby-friendly practices, such as birth companions. Only in Ukraine a direct reference to

gender equality was specified in a pro gramme document as an essential cross-cutting aspect
throughout the entire intervention. Still, no specific evidence was gathered on how this was tackled
so far. One example concerned the role of home visiting nurses in addressing domestic violence and
discrimination. While home visitors are expected to refer a child at risk to the appropriate services,
the main questions that remain for some KIIs are: i) how this referral system will work in the future,
and ii) whether home visiting staff will manage to combine reporting on abuses with building trust-
based relations with a family.
3.1.1.2 Frontline workers
The frontline healthcare workers were among the groups most affected by the crisis. The
pandemic aggravated the already existing systemic bottlenecks in the healthcare system (such as
staff and equipment shortages, outdated infrastructure), exposed general capacity and professional
development needs (technical, professional, and psychological support), and generated new
COVID-19-specific demands (e.g., the lack of clear protocols for emergency circumstances, limited
access to protective equipment and disinfectants). It also required healthcare staff to adapt the way
they work and learn to unexpected circumstances caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
For frontline workers, UNICEF-supported adaptations to healthcare services addressed many of
the sector’s staff concerns. Acting as one of the main partners of the Ministries responsible for health,
UNICEF engaged in developing technical documents and guidelines, provision of general and COVID-
19 focused capacity-building programmes, and the procurement and delivery of PPE supplies. The
data collected and analyzed across the in-depth study countries reveals more specific examples of
the relevance of UNICEF’s response in the health and nutrition sector:
o Evidence from the training on in-patient and out-patient care in
Moldova’s 12 perinatal centers during COVID-19 found that the
content addressed the most pressing issues of healthcare staff
related to supporting pregnant women during COVID-19 (e.g.,
nutrition during pregnancy, breastfeeding, referral, and
inpatient/ outpatient care of pregnant and lactating women). It
also covered the latest infection prevention and control protocols
at the primary healthcare level. The Key Informants highlighted
the usefulness of training for adapting the disrupted healthcare
services to the emergency, better responding to women’s
queries and needs (“how to communicate with pregnant
women, with women with newborn children in such a way that
they will feel comfortable, knowledgeable, and will stay healthy
jointly with their child”), minimizing the infection, and receiving
adequate treatment. A factor contributing to a better matching
training content with frontline workers’ expectations was a prior assessment of frontline workers’
needs carried out by UNICEF.67 It helped provide timely, accurate responses to emerging needs
and maintain services’ continuity when there is limited time for longer and more structured
planning activities.
67 When the pandemic started, healthcare workers from perinatal services and primary health care were asked about their
needs and suggestions to better cope with the emergency. Based on their responses, the topics for the online trainings were
developed.

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
o Similar findings come from Croatia , where the adaptations introduced as part of the Neo-BFHI
addressed the needs of heads of maternity wards and NICUs for practical information on
providing health care during the pandemic. As described by Key Informants and respondents
of the MURID survey, the webinar for health workers organized as part of the e-education on
pregnancy intervention led by RODA responded to: i) hospital management’s need for better
coordination, staying in contact, and sharing experiences; ii) participants’ need to receive: ●
scientific information and the latest WHO guidance (e.g., on the potential risks of COVID-19
transmission through breastfeeding), ● information about the existing support for pregnant
mothers and about the re-assessment of baby-friendly standards that has been moved online
because of the pandemic. In addition, conducting a hybrid re-assessment provided much-
needed guidance for hospitals in Croatia on maintaining baby-friendly standards during the
pandemic. In consequence, it allowed verifying current practices and encouraged compliance
with the standards during the current crisis.
o In Ukraine, the UPHV model responds to the need for a more holistic approach to ECD and family
support instead of the medically focused scope of the current model of service.68 The first
training for healthcare workers in June 2021 covered topics such as the role of the home-visiting
nurses, integrated management of childhood diseases, intersectoral collaboration,
communication techniques, and effective interaction. A range of child development-related
issues was also included (e.g., determinants of health and wellbeing of a child, the effect of
stress, the role of education, safe environment, breastfeeding, immunization, and prevention of
stigma and discrimination).69 The UPHV intervention is also expected to relieve the
overburdened primary healthcare personnel by complementing the services of family doctors
or pediatricians and its “progressive” approach that targets the most vulnerable households.
In addition, UNICEF addressed some of the major “When it comes to child's health, both a doctor and
needs of frontline healthcare workers in access a nurse focus only on the diagnosis, but many

interventions focusing on infection prevention and control (IPC) were particularly
relevant to healthcare staff needs in Eastern Ukraine, where lack of equipment for
reprocessing medical devices and waste management and insufficient quantities of IPC-related
supplies was already a challenge before the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, the evaluation’s findings revealed that some urgent frontline healthcare workers’ needs
are yet to be addressed. The most evident needs are those linked to the sharp increase in the use of
digital modalities of working and learning and the required relevant skills necessary to benefit from
them. For instance, sufficient training on using laptops and healthcare platforms was reported as
required to realize the full potential offered by this new mode of delivery. It was accompanied by
challenges related to access to or better ICT equipment such as laptops, smartphones, tablets,

webcams, internet platforms, and reliabl e internet connectivity in general.70 Other concerns relate to
the need for more didactical materials and/or guidance, as mentioned by frontline workers from
Croatia, and – more broadly - staff shortages, further affected by infections or quarantine.71 The latter
put staff under additional duress by causing long working hours and impeding the reconciliation of
trainings with job responsibilities.72
3.1.2 Early childhood education (ECE)
The pandemic further deteriorated children’s access to quality, inclusive and safe preschool
education, revealing the fragility and unpreparedness of the early education systems in the
emergency context. As the context section explained, education systems (and caregivers) were ill-
equipped to engage in support of remote learning for young children, especially those from
vulnerable and marginalized groups who already face multiple challenges in accessing or remaining
in ECE.73 They were also unprepared to apply specific protective measures in education and childcare
settings and faced shortages of PPE and hygiene supplies necessary for preschools’ re-opening and
safe operation in the pandemic context.
The assessed interventions supported by UNICEF Cos from the case study countries address these
challenges by implementing a range of interventions in the ECE area. They include support for:
o developing safety measure protocols measures on blended learning;
o pedagogical techniques for facilitating ECE remote learning;
o organizing inclusive preschool environment during the pandemic;
o awareness-raising and capacity-building on the hygiene practices and protocols to prevent
the spread of COVID-19 in preschools;
o promoting the learning of children at home, in the family context during COVID-19-related
lockdowns/quarantines;
o assessing preschools’ readiness for preschool re-opening;
o developing education platforms for preschool children’s development.
Other forms of support included ensuring preschool staff training by moving it to online mode and
providing supplies.

young children caused or exposed by th e pandemic. More specifically, they responded to their need
for: ● a safe preschool learning environment; ● more robust caregivers’ capacities/awareness on how
to support children’s learning at home; ● supporting the learning of the most vulnerable groups of
children; ● and – more generally – the provision of undisrupted preschool services during the
pandemic, including ensuring access to remote learning.
The evidence collected from Ukraine and Moldova shows that the interventions addressing
inclusive education in ECE were found to be well aligned with the change in the way education is
provided to young children in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and relevant caregivers’
needs:

families’ needs on how to support children’s learning at

children and advice on how to promote child learning in the context of the family. Chatbots in
Telegram and Viber made these resources from the platform available to every family.
o In Moldova, Roma caregivers and families with children with disabilities were among the most
vulnerable groups explicitly targeted for dealing with anxiety and skills related to learning at
home and parenting in a crisis. With the introduction of online sessions on positive parenting
for the caregivers of young children, the intervention responded to the caregivers’ need for
guidance on organizing educational activities for their children at home. Accordingly, the
holistic approach with targeted activities for parents and advocacy/outreach activities has
been assessed as appropriately addressing the need to increase enrollment and retention of
children with disabilities and Roma children in ECE.
Some interventions focused on the need of

and children with disabilities were the m ain target groups who received protective equipment and
supplies, and their return to re-opened preschools was prioritized.
The need for caregivers’ information on how to talk to children about COVID-19 was also tackled
by the assessed interventions in Ukraine and Moldova. In the latter case, a guide for preschool
children’s parents on “Organization of learning and care process in preschools during COVID-19
pandemic”75 has been developed and adjusted to the parents’ needs after piloting in five rayons. It
was designed to provide families with young children with basic information on COVID-19 and
guidance on communicating the pandemic-related messages to their children.
The assessed interventions in the ECE area prioritized the needs of the most vulnerable and
affected families. However, without adequate investments in digital skills and ICT equipment, the
most marginalized children are likely to be excluded from access to learning in a digital form.76 For
instance, according to Key Informants in Ukraine, both preschool teachers and families living along
the contact line do not have (reliable) access to the internet and other supplies required for distance
learning. As confirmed by the participants of the regional reflection workshop with ECA RO and Cos,
the digital divide remains and will remain a serious barrier. Adequate ICT for ECD professionals and
families is a huge challenge, and the deployment of technologies should not contribute to further
digital exclusion, especially of vulnerable groups. One attempt to address it was providing ICT
equipment in preschools for Roma caregivers in Moldova to facilitate their participation in parenting
sessions and mitigate a digital exclusion of Roma families.
The evidence from Ukraine suggests that children and families’ need for psychological support
during the pandemic has not been sufficiently addressed and requires additional consideration.
Despite some efforts in this area, some interviewees and survey respondents indicated that the
UNICEF inclusive education training’s content was inadequate to respond to the needs related to, for
instance, dealing with anxiety resulting from pandemic-related economic, physical and mental
health challenges faced by families of young children According to preschool teachers, children and
their families urgently require support to deal with COVID-19 illness (or fear of illness) in the family
and overall stress caused by loss of employment, isolation, and other aspects.
In most interventions on ECE that have been assessed more in-depth, issues related to gender
equality and domestic violence during the pandemic were not integrated into the assessed
training content. In terms of other cross-cutting issues, in Ukraine, considerable attention within the
training content was placed on diversity (racial, ethnic, cultural, physical, intellectual, etc.); however,
gender-discriminatory norms and attitudes were not integrated into the intervention.
Finally, it should be noted that limited access to preschool education in the four case study
countries, in particular among the most deprived children (e.g., Roma children, families living in
conflict areas, children with special education needs), is an area that required an improvement
already before the COVID-19 outbreak. The awareness of the importance of inclusive education
among preschool teachers and non-didactic staff has also been low. Their response to the children’s
specific developmental needs remained insufficient before the pandemic.

3.1.2.2 Frontline workers
UNICEF-supported adaptations and interventions in preschool education responded to the needs
of frontline workers for knowledge and skills during the pandemic and beyond. The modifications
of the training contents to the pandemic context have further increased their relevance. Evidence
shows that over eighty percent of the responding staff from two out of three ECE interventions agreed
that the training/course ‘very much’ responded to their professional development needs. These
concern support ensuring safe conditions for preschools reopening during the emergency and
providing quality services to vulnerable children, and engaging with caregivers during the pandemic
in Moldova. The training content that focused on inclusive learning environments in Ukraine was also
seen as aligned with the current professional needs of preschool teachers. In this case, however, more
respondents perceived the intervention as ‘somewhat’ relevant (50%) than those for whom it was
‘very much’ relevant (42%).

More specifically, the training for frontline workers was practical and tailored to their professional
needs related to adjusting their work to the pandemic conditions and related challenges:
o In Moldova, the online training and follow-up mentoring sessions for ECE staff were relevant to
increasing the safety and quality of preschool education services during COVID-10. With
protocols, regulations, and guidelines for parents on safe hygiene practices, they addressed
the need for information on how to apply safe and healthy hygiene practices and behaviors
during the pandemic to diminish high health and safety risks for young children inside and
outside preschools. The evidence shows that the training met frontline workers’ information
needs on: ● applying the regulations for re-opening preschools in practice (87% of survey
respondents); ● using hygiene equipment for the prevention and control of COVID-19 (84%); ●
informing parents about safe hygiene practices (82%); ● and adapting pedagogical
approaches to ensure quality interaction with and between children in the context of strict

prevention measures (73%).77 It a lso explained to the ECE staff how COVID-19 could spread
when the knowledge about the virus was limited.
o The intervention in Ukraine prepared ECD staff to support the learning of children when
preschools were closed. It provided the necessary guidance for preschool teachers on: ●
organizing preschool education remotely; ● establishing remote communication with parents
of children; ● engaging parents to organize appropriate activities for their children at home; ●
organizing the work of support teams; and ● implementing individual development
programmes for children with special education needs. In the latter case, the COVID-19
adapted intervention on supporting an inclusive preschool environment was found to be highly
relevant to the needs of preschool teachers from two conflict-torn oblasts of Ukraine (Donetsk
and Luhansk). All training participants in the training who took part in the survey assessed “the

previously mentioned, preschool teachers in Ukraine
generally have insufficient competencies to support inclusive education.
o In Georgia, UNICEF-supported pilot training and a webinar for preschool managers and
education specialists of Adjara kindergartens addressed their needs on: ● the knowledge
regarding the provision of ECE during the pandemic; ● and the need to continue ECE without
the disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic.78 The results of the survey with training
participants (n=46) from June 2020, shared by UNICEF, suggest that the coaching was very
interesting (76%) or mostly so (11%), and the working methods were appreciated.
However, additional needs for a more efficient learning process emerged among educators during
the pandemic despite these developments. Among the more pressing issues, the Key Informants
from Moldova listed a need for methodologies and guidelines to adapt the learning process to the
pandemic conditions and implement online educational activities for children with disabilities and
special educational needs. Additional training on using ICT technologies and online platforms and
accessing professional learning platforms was also mentioned.79
3.1.3 Early childhood intervention (ECI)
The limited availability of services for the youngest children with developmental delays and/or
disabilities has been an issue in many countries. Similar to the other challenges discussed in previous
chapters, it was further exacerbated by the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic increased the need

to introduce EI remote delivery strategies to continue services provision when standard support forms
are unavailable. However, EI service providers appear largely not equipped to respond to these new
requirements. They need additional support to identify new modalities, strengthen digital and
technology infrastructure, and train professionals to use these new modes of service provision.
To respond to these challenges, UNICEF Cos from Croatia, Moldova, and Ukraine, engaged in EI
targeting interventions that guided remote service provision, training resources for EI practitioners,
and resources for parents. Specifically, these included:
o The online course for EI practitioners on providing quality tele-intervention services during
COVID-19 and trainings on positive parenting covering in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic;
o trainings for parents/caregivers on early intervention advocacy, on availability of referrals to
inclusive services during COVID-19;
o organizing and supporting parent groups through parenting platform;
o information materials for community professionals and parents on ECD, EI, and other related
topics, including information on COVID-19;
o on-line course on AAC for ECD/ECI professionals.
In addition, in-kind assistance was also provided. For instance, for infection prevention and control
measures during the provision of EI, UNICEF CO from Moldova procured sanitizers, protective
equipment, and other WASH and waste supplies to families with young children with disabilities and
developmental delays. In Ukraine, the CO engaged in delivering ECD kits for EI service in the East of
Ukraine.
3.1.3.1 Children and caregivers
Parents of children with disabilities are among the vulnerable groups heavily affected by the COVID-
19 caused disruptions. They faced various behavioral-, communication-and learning-related issues
concerning their children, accompanied by fear, psychological problems, and sometimes loss of the
single ECI support service they received. The evidence from this evaluation shows that by moving
ECI services, counseling, and family support online, several needs related to these challenges
were addressed by the UNICEF-supported interventions in the ECI area. Above all, this related to
the need to ensure continuity of ECI service provision to young children with developmental delays
and disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and for parental support and information about
the child’s development milestones:
o By preparing ECI practitioners to provide EI using virtual technologies, the tele-intervention
project in Croatia ensured continuity in assessing the needs for ECI support for families and
children who could not access in-person services usually provided in ECI centers. The
interviewees also highlighted that the intervention addressed the need to strengthen the
capacity of caregivers to support child learning and development, which became even more
pronounced with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.80 As many early intervention services in
Croatia suddenly started being provided remotely, caregivers of children with disabilities and
80 The project included an online module on how to coach parents and mentoring sessions on "Active Parent Roles in Virtual
Early Intervention" aimed to equip practitioners with skills to address parents’ hesitancy and involve them in the process of
service provision.

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
developmental delays had to i mplement EI for their children, based on professionals’
instructions. Addressing this issue is especially important because parents of children with
developmental delays and disabilities have often been skeptical and apprehensive about
actively engaging in early childhood interventions, as indicated by most frontline workers
consulted on this.
o In Moldova, the capacity-building activities for preschool staff and caregivers on the
education of children with special educational needs (SEN) were considered by the Key
Informants as responsive to the educational needs of children with disabilities and their
families. The information on organizing educational activities for children with SEN at home
included in the caregiver’ trainings provided much-needed practical advice on specific
activities that can be arranged at home, depending on a child’s condition. The training content
also covered issues related to managing emotions providing psycho-emotional support for
young children’s caregivers, thus tackling high levels of anxiety, often leading to adverse
effects on family life.
o In Ukraine, the Early Intervention Institute survey among families receiving EI services through
online counseling revealed that during the strict lockdown, the EI services remained the only
service that families continued to receive regularly.81 This was possible because the online
sessions engaged parents and equipped them with the skills necessary to support their child’s
development. Moreover, the intervention introduced a family-centered approach, with parents
playing a pivotal role in supporting children’s development, which further increased
intervention’s relevance for children and their families. As mentioned by some participants, the
training was “supporting parents in making decisions, without pushing priorities that the family
did not choose”. Such an approach has been a novelty because parental experience
supporting their child’s development has been rarely recognized.82
In addition, one UNICEF intervention in Croatia, which was not a direct response to COVID-19, focused
on the inclusion of children with complex communication needs by promoting the concept of AAC. In
this case, all interviewed stakeholders agreed that the intervention addressed the need of young
children with disabilities and developmental delays and their families for an ECI workforce skilled in
using AAC technologies. The majority (68%) of the frontline workers surveyed for this evaluation
believed that the training appropriately considered the ECI/ECD needs of different groups of children
with complex communication needs and their families, given the new reality of the COVID-19
pandemic. An additional 28% of survey respondents said that it did so partially. Finally, even if the
intervention did not intend to address the challenge of securing continuity of ECI/ECD services in the
face of COVID-19 related disruptions, this need was addressed by the above-mentioned tele-
intervention project. The synergy effects between the UNICEF interventions were seen as a positive
factor contributing to its increased relevance and efficiency.
At the same time, the ECI interventions were not always relevant in addressing the needs of
children from disadvantaged households and children with severe disabilities. This finding was
particularly evident in Croatia, where the tele-intervention course was less relevant in ensuring
continuity of ECI service provision in households without internet and those with children who require
in-person support from an expert, such as a physiotherapist. Despite the efforts of UNICEF partners to

provide low-income families of children w ith disabilities with the necessary ICT equipment or support
in setting up of mobile applications required for virtual ECI, children living in households without
internet connection and those living in severe poverty were by far the most difficult to access for ECI
practitioners at the start of the pandemic.83 Also, in Ukraine, not all vulnerable families can benefit
from the ECI services in the oblasts covered by the intervention. Since ECI requires significant funding
from local authorities, the services concentrate mainly in large cities, while many poorer
municipalities cannot afford it, especially those along the contact line. As for the training on AAC
technologies in Croatia, its content was assessed by the surveyed frontline workers as less helpful in
addressing the ECI/ECD needs of children with highly pronounced and multiple developmental
disabilities. Similarly, in Ukraine, the frontline workers who participated in the survey showed slightly
less confidence when addressing their information-related need on providing ECI services to children
with multiple vulnerabilities (e.g., from poor households, from remote areas). However, their
satisfaction level was still high (31% of respondents said the training fully addressed their needs and
54% - considerably).
Finally, given that women perform most caregiving work in the assessed countries, the two
assessed interventions included strategies to tackle gender norms and promote an equal
distribution of domestic and caregiving work among women and men. The course on tele-
intervention for ECD/ECI professionals in Croatia included guidance on including both parents in early
childhood intervention practices at home. Relevant gender-sensitive issues were also incorporated
in the project on social inclusion of Roma children and children with disabilities in Moldova, where
training participants received information on the importance of lessening the care burden on the
female caregivers and fathers’ active role in this process.
3.1.3.2 Frontline workers
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered how ECI practitioners provide services to young children
with disabilities and developmental delays. Many ECI professionals were left without information on
how to carry out ECI in the new circumstances effectively. At the same time, the emergency context
made some pre-pandemic needs, such as the need for a more holistic ECI/ECD support, even more,
pronounced and exposed gaps in the professional development of ECI professionals. To address this,
better communication with caregivers and coordination among ECI specialists from diverse fields is
necessary to generate a shared understanding of EI, its approaches and methods across disciplines,
and address child development more holistically.
The interviews and the evaluation surveys show that training for EI practitioners was relevant to
their professional needs. As shown in Figure 3, most of the respondents in the evaluation surveys
said that the training met their knowledge and skills needs ‘very much’, while for the rest of the
participants, the training ‘somewhat’ met these needs. In two out of the three more in-depth assessed
interventions, no more than 3% of the respondents found them ‘not so much’ relevant to their
professional needs.

Source: Responses of frontline workers who participated in the evaluation surveys
When looking at specific countries and interventions more closely:
o The tele-intervention project in Croatia responded to the frontline workers’ need for guidance
on how to provide virtual early intervention. Most interviewed and surveyed frontline workers
said that the online course, the mentoring sessions, and the materials addressed their need
for instruction on involving caregivers in their child’s early intervention. Accordingly, delivering
the AAC training and the tele-intervention course online addressed the frontline workers’ need
for continued capacity-building support during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the
answers in the evaluation survey in Croatia suggest that the training was less suitable for
healthcare workers and preschool teachers who are the least likely to provide ECI to children
with CCN in their work. Since the training targeted a diverse range of ECI/ECD professionals, the
specialist content related to supporting complex disabilities had to be limited. Given the lack
of coordination among the professions that hampers the effectiveness of Croatia’s ECI
system,84 such an approach was appropriately aligned with the need to enable knowledge
sharing and align approaches to ECI of different professionals, according to most interviewed
respondents.
o In Ukraine, the interviewees indicated that skills related to applying a “family-centered
approach” have become especially relevant during the pandemic.85 Accordingly, the
evaluation survey respondents perceived the ECI training as highly relevant to the ECI
specialists needs for improving their communication with families, cooperating with other
specialists, and addressing the needs of the youngest children (from 0 to 3 years). For instance,
respondents mentioned that their needs were fully or considerably addressed in learning how
to engage parents in ECI (62% and 27%, respectively) and providing quality EI to children with
developmental delays and/or disabilities (58% and 39%). Special attention on young children

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
(0-3 years) in the training conte nt has been appreciated since ECI professionals are not
always ready to address the needs of such small children in their work (children usually come
to specialists when they go to kindergarten). Similar to the coordination needs in Croatia, the
focus on working in a multidisciplinary team in the training content was considered very
relevant and helpful in understanding the specifics of other professionals’ work. In the view of
the frontline workers who participated in the survey, the intervention had met their needs for
information and skills fully (77%) or to a considerable (19%) extent when working as part of a
multidisciplinary team providing ECI services. Also, in terms of supervision, survey respondents
representing all professions who took part in the intervention agreed that the supervision
meets their needs for information and skills to a full or considerable extent.
If these interventions are sustained, they will also be relevant in the longer term (beyond the
pandemic) to mitigate the consequences of the general EI personnel shortages and increase
services outreach to families in underserved areas.
All frontline workers appreciated the changed mode of training delivery into an online format for
its applicability in the context of the pandemic. According to the KIIs and the survey results in
Croatia, it was relevant to the participants’ needs and did not affect the appropriateness of the
content. For 95% and 96% of the survey respondents, the online training format made their
participation possible, while 86% and 92% of respondents said it has made their participation easier.
In Ukraine, however, most respondents agreed or strongly agreed (83%) that the face-to-face format
would have been better suited to deliver the training content, even though the online format made
their participation possible or easier.
All respondents highlighted the need for continuing support and professional development of ECI
professionals. Particular attention in this aspect was devoted to more training and didactical
materials on working with caregivers and parental attitudes, more and/or better information and
communication technologies (ICT) equipment, and extended supervision to be better supported in
their work.
3.1.4 Child protection and family/caregivers support
Due to the pandemic, many vulnerable children and their families faced challenges in accessing
social, health, educational services provided by the state and municipalities. They also required
psychological support to deal with the consequences of the COVID-19 induced isolation and stress.
The increased time spent at home for many children and caregivers meant the more significant risk
of being exposed to domestic violence, abuse, or neglect.
UNICEF COs interventions assessed in this evaluation related to child protection and family support
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. They included:
o psycho-social support, information, and referral to other ECD services;
o activities related to the provision of healthcare and nutrition services;
o distribution of hygiene equipment directly among families and children, especially the most
vulnerable ones.
In addition, various information and guidance materials on ECD in the COVID-10 context have also
been developed and disseminated among caregivers of young children.

Specific examples of the relevance of the Cos support in the selected countries in these areas include:

The hotline staff also perceived the service
Key Informant from Georgia
as relevant in terms of providing callers with
necessary information about different services
and information or referral to services providing support in case of abuse and
violence, and psychological support (all but one respondent indicated that the
hotline responded “to the full extent” in the last two areas). According to Key Informants,
children’s needs have changed since the beginning of the intervention and shifted from the
predominant focus on social services towards increased demand for psychological support
and education. In this sense, the Child Hotline’s short-term outcome devoted to psychological
counseling indicates responsiveness to this development. The needs that have been covered
to a lesser extent are related to housing and home adaptation and addressing more complex
situations, including those that require identifying underlying problems and those dealing with
gender-specific prejudices and discrimination.
o In Ukraine, introducing the UPHV model with telemedicine is relevant in addressing key
geographical inequalities in the availability of health care services in Eastern Ukraine. Children
from socially vulnerable families are expected to benefit especially from this model as their
parents will receive timely advice on childcare and nurturing caregiving for optimal child
development. When addressing domestic violence and discrimination, home visiting nurses
will be trained to assess the psychological climate in a family, determine whether the child is
at risk, and refer it to the appropriate services. Observing the psychosocial environment in
which a child lives86 is even more critical in a situation of chronic stress caused by the
humanitarian crisis in Eastern Ukraine. However, designing this referral system and preparing
staff to combine reporting on abuses with building a trust-based relationship with a family are
perceived as demanding tasks. Other relevant interventions in the child protection area in
Ukraine include: i) transformation of the Baby Homes to prevent further institutionalization of
young children as a result of increased vulnerability due to COVID-19; ii) strengthening the
capacity of the social service workforce on case management and prevention of child
protection risks, including violence; iii) provision of psycho-social support and GBV/VAC
prevention and response services to women, men, boys, and girls; iv) development of online
courses on psychosocial support response during COVID-19, positive parenting, and other
aspects.
o Other examples of support for caregivers’ needs related to their mental well-being and
adjusting their family routines to the new situation have been discussed in sections 3.1.2 and
3.1.2 above. For instance, in Moldova, parents/caregivers of children with disabilities received
mini-guides (per disability type) on providing ECE and care to children with SEN. They included

advice on working with children wi th SEN at home and the mental health of young children and
their caregivers during the pandemic.
In addition to the above, UNICEF also secured and distributed hygiene and other supplies among
families with vulnerable children and institutions for children, access to which is a serious challenge
in the assessed countries. In Moldova, for instance, sanitizers and PPE supplies were provided to 225
vulnerable families benefitting from EI for young children with developmental delays and disabilities
and to district psycho-pedagogical assistance services. The Crisis Centre for women and children,
survivors of gender-based violence, received necessary hygiene items to ensure women and
children with quality services. Accordingly, food and hygiene packages were distributed among 300
vulnerable families affected by violence. In Ukraine, the caregivers of every newborn receive a ‘baby
box’ with essential childcare items, including information materials on ECD. The intervention started
on 1.07.2018 (ongoing).
3.1.5 Broader ECD country programmatic framework
The evaluated UNICEF’s interventions in health and education fields and the adaptations in their
delivery mode and content due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak are highly relevant to the UNICEF
general ECD priorities and UNICEF programmes in the four countries about health education and child
protection. Moreover, they are relevant to the achievement of other child rights’ obligations at the
country level (including, in particular, those enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals and
various international child protection treaties such as the Convention of the Rights of the Child), as
well as are in line with other national policies and initiatives in the field.
The interventions in Moldova are in line with UNICEF Country Programme 2018-202287. The training of
the frontline workers in health and education is perceived as relevant for achieving Outcome 1 –
Equitable, child-sensitive systems, and services and Outcome 2 – Social change for child rights. In
the case of Outcome 1, the interventions contributed to the implementation of the following outputs:
1) by 2022, the health system is to improve capacity to generate demand and provide quality
maternal and newborn, child, and adolescent health services, including outreach, and to advise
caregivers supporting childcare, growth, and development, and 2) by 2022, schools and preschools
can apply and monitor quality teaching and learning and can address violence, dropout, and
absenteeism. In the case of Outcome 2, the interventions contributed to implementing the following
output: by 2022, caregivers in selected districts have the capacity and skills to take responsibility for
childcare, health, development, education, and protection, and encourage and practice positive
behavior.
In the case of Georgia, since the interventions are consistent with Country Programme 2016-2021,
their results feed into the achievement of UNICEF’s outcomes no. 1 (“By 2020, all young children,
especially the most vulnerable, are supported to survive, thrive and reach their full potential for
success in school and later in life”) and no. 2 (“By 2020, vulnerable children are benefiting from a
proactive, child-sensitive social protection system that promotes social inclusion and the right to
supportive and caring family environment”).88

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
The UNICEF interventions in Ukraine, part icularly the UPVH home-visiting model, inclusive education,
and EI trainings, are relevant to the achievement of objectives of the Country Programme 2018-202289.
In the field of access to healthcare for mothers and children, they feed into output 4 “By 2022, all
children and pregnant women in Ukraine, including situations of a humanitarian crisis, utilize
improved quality and affordable mother and child healthcare services”. As expected in the
Programme, the interventions under the implementation aim at “improving children’s access to
quality health services”, “ensuring uninterrupted access to services in the conflict-affected areas”, as
well as “will also foster positive and equitable parenting”. The inclusive education interventions in
Ukraine are relevant for the achievement of in line with output 1, which focuses on early learning (“The
education system can provide greater access to children aged 3-6 years, especially the most
disadvantaged, to quality and inclusive early learning services”) under outcome 3 “By 2022, all
children and adolescents in Ukraine, especially those disadvantaged and affected by the conflict,
have access to inclusive and quality school education and early learning”. In the field of Early
Intervention, UNICEF interventions are highly relevant to the CPD output 2: “In at least 10 priority regions
with the highest needs, national and local capacity and resources exist to provide adequate early
intervention services for young children and their families”, under outcome 2: “By 2022, the most
vulnerable children in Ukraine benefit from more-child-friendly and family-oriented social welfare
and justice systems”.
Finally, the interventions in Croatia are relevant for the achievement of the objectives of Country
Programme 2017-202290, in particular, Outcome 1 “by 2021, the Government implements appropriately
resourced inclusive ECE and multisectoral ECI policies at national and subnational levels, with a
special focus on the most vulnerable children”.
UNICEF interventions in all four countries are integrated into the United Nations Partnership
Frameworks for Sustainable Development. For Moldova, they fit under Outcome 1: The people of
Moldova, in particular the most vulnerable, demand and benefit from democratic, transparent, and
accountable governance, gender-sensitive, human rights- and evidence-based public policies,
equitable services, and efficient, effective, and responsive public institutions and Outcome 4: The
people of Moldova, in particular the most vulnerable, demand and benefit from gender-sensitive and
human rights-based, inclusive, effective and equitable quality education, health and social policies
and services. (SDGs: SDG 1, SDG 4, SDG 5, SDG 8, and SDG 16)91. For Ukraine, they are in line with
Outcome 2: By 2022, women and men, girls and boys, equitably benefit from integrated social
protection, universal health services, and quality education, and Outcome 4: By 2022, communities,
including vulnerable people and IDPs2, are more resilient and equitably benefit from greater social
cohesion, quality services and recovery support (SDGs: SDG 1, SDG 3, SDG 4, SDG 8 and SDG 10)92. For
Georgia, the UNICEF interventions are consistent with Outcome 1: By 2025, all people in Georgia enjoy
improved good governance, more open, resilient, and accountable institutions, the rule of law, equal
access to justice, human rights, and increased representation and participation of women in decision
making, Outcome 2: By 2025, all people in Georgia have equitable and inclusive access to quality,

standards (all SDGs)93. Finally, the UNICE F interventions in Croatia align with SDG outcomes for this
country (SDGs: SDG 3, SDG 4)94.
The evaluated ECD interventions in all four countries are also found to be highly relevant to
strengthen the implementation of children’s rights enshrined in national instruments, such as the
Code on the Rights of the Child (Georgia) and international agreements ratified by the four
countries, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child or the Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities. They are consistent with national ECD strategies and other initiatives at
the national and supranational levels, e.g., for Croatia, the UNICEF interventions are relevant for the
activities implemented under the EU Child Guarantee Programme (Country Office has been
supporting the testing of a two-year programme titled Fulfilling the Child Guarantee for the most
vulnerable children in the Međimurje County). The evaluation found a number of synergies between
the evaluated interventions and other ECD initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic at the
country level, e.g. the tele-intervention and AAC programme in Croatia are also complemented by
UNICEF’s ongoing advocacy for the implementation of an integrated ECI system, the SMAs in Georgia
synergize and cohere with COVID-19-related activities focusing specifically on infant and maternal
health and more broadly on improving primary healthcare, the interventions in Moldova are
integrated into Governmental annual action plans and are part of larger governmental and donors’
efforts to ensure safe access to health services and early learning and care for young children during
the COVID-19 pandemic such as Government COVID-19 Emergency Response Plan95, MECR’s
‘Preparedness and Response Plan for the Management of COVID-19 Situation in Education in General
and Technical Vocational Education’, Moldova COVID-19 Response and Recovery Window under the

3.2 Effectiveness
This section summarizes the main results of the assessed interventions and considers how they
contribute to broader UNICEF’s ECD and COVID-19 goals and objectives. We outline the interventions’
strengths and weaknesses, zooming in on remote modalities to (i) provide frontline workers with
training and guidance and (ii) provide the rights-holders with information, guidance, and ECD
services. By doing so, we identify the key features that make the interventions effective. Importantly,
we also highlight the remaining gaps and further support needed by frontline workers to enable them
to provide adequate ECD services during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we outline the
key factors related to the current demand for ECD services and enabling environments in Croatia,
Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine that render the adaptations less effective.
3.2.1 Strengthening frontline workers’ skills and knowledge
The majority of the interventions assessed were centered on the capacity building of ECD frontline
workers. Previously planned interventions were adapted by3 changing the mode of the trainings and
mentoring sessions from face-to-face to online and/or adapting their content to reflect the new
realities of providing ECD service provision during the pandemic. Most of the assessed previously
planned interventions underwent both types of adaptations. As regards newly introduced trainings,

all were delivered online and devoted to addressing the frontline workers’ professional skills’ needs
that emerged in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The target numbers of trained ECD professionals either exceeded or achieved across the adapted
or newly introduced capacity-building interventions. Figure 4 below shows the outputs achieved
as a percentage of outputs planned for interventions for which output targets were defined in
programme and project documentation. Notably, most of the online trainings and e-courses that
were open to all relevant professionals achieved output indicators that far exceeded the indicators
planned. This included trainings with and without new content adapted to COVID-19 realities.

The majority of other outputs planned as part of the assessed interventions were also achieved. In
addition to training professionals, the capacity-building interventions also entailed the development
of guidance materials for frontline workers and caregivers, the development of online e-learning
platforms, mentoring sessions, and trainings for caregivers. A review of available programme
documentation shows that progress is underway towards achieving the remaining outputs planned
for the second half of 2021 or postponed. The KIIs and documentation indicate that they will be
achieved in all four countries.
The assessed interventions yielded serval types of results. Firstly, some interventions equipped the
frontline workers with information about COVID-19 risks and IPC measures, preparing them to
deliver safely ECD services in the context of the pandemic. This was notably the case of the two
interventions at Moldova, which boosted the health workers’ and preschool workers’ competencies
for applying IPC practices. The majority of the survey participants indicated that the training fully
prepared them to deliver ECD services aligned with strict IPC measures. Greater preparedness to
deliver ECD services in the context of the pandemic was also reported by ECD workers in Ukraine who
participated in trainings on inclusive education and family-centered EI provision. Both trainings were
adapted to include content on COVID-19 risks and relevant prevention and control measures.

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
Secondly, several interventions equipp ed the frontline workers with knowledge and skills on
delivering ECD services remotely. In Croatia, 52% of the surveyed ECI practitioners reported that the
online course on virtual early intervention provided them with a strong understanding of virtual early
intervention. Another 45% indicated that the course helped them understand the basic concepts. In
Ukraine, half of the surveyed frontline workers trained on multidisciplinary EI provision reported that
the support ‘fully’ or ‘considerably’ prepared them to provide remote early intervention services.
Another 46% said the intervention prepared them to do so ‘somewhat’. Similarly, the interviewed
health workers who completed online trainings in 12 perinatal centers in Moldova said that the
activities helped them (i) apply innovative approaches in antenatal care (hybrid contacts with
pregnant women); and (ii) develop detailed plans for providing face-to-face and remote antenatal
services.
Thirdly, most interventions strengthened the capacities of frontline workers to guide caregivers on
how to organize learning and implement ECI for their children at home. Preschool workers trained
on inclusive education in Ukraine and parental education in Moldova learned how to guide parents
on organizing learning activities for their children at home. The training in Moldova also equipped the
frontline workers with skills to support caregivers for positive parenting practices. In Croatia, the e-
learning on virtual early intervention helped ECI practitioners support caregivers of children with
disabilities and developmental delays in organizing child learning and development at home.
The majority of the frontline workers surveyed apply the knowledge and skills gained from the
trainings, courses, and mentoring sessions in their daily work. As shown in Figure 5, the shares of
surveyed frontline workers who apply the knowledge and skills gained from the training varied
between 87% and 100% across the interventions. The two interventions centered on the safe delivery
of services in the context of COVID-19 yielded the highest shares of frontline workers who apply the
acquired skills in their work. Almost all of the surveyed frontline workers who participated in the
trainings on IPC in perinatal centers and abiding by sanitary regulations in preschools in Moldova
used the new know-how. In addition, most of them (90% of the preschool workers and 71% of the
health workers) said that they apply it to a significant extent. Somewhat lower shares of frontline
workers who apply the knowledge and skills gained during the trainings were noted by the
participants in the ECI-focused trainings. However, considering the highly specialist nature of the ECI
trainings, the obtained results are still notable. For instance, in Croatia, the online course and
accompanying mentoring sessions on tele-intervention encouraged 33% of surveyed ECI workers to
start implementing the virtual early intervention.

The adaptations contributed to the continuity of ECD services for young children and their families
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, as outlined in the section on relevance, not all young
children and families could benefit from the educational, health, early intervention, and child
protection services provided during the pandemic. For instance, it was particularly difficult for early
intervention professionals in Croatia to provide tele-intervention to low-income families. Similarly, in
Ukraine, the pandemic further impaired the already difficult access to ECI services for families living
in rural and remote areas.
The interventions also delivered on many critical needs of young children and their families that
existed before the pandemic, thus feeding into broader UNICEF and national ECD goals in the
countries. This was mainly achieved through improving the frontline workers’ competencies in
using modern, child-centered, and family-centered ECD practices. For example, preschool
teachers in Ukraine and Moldova improved their awareness and knowledge of organizing inclusive
education. ECI workers in Croatia and Ukraine strengthened their skills to provide family-centered ECI.
Lastly, health workers in Ukraine acquired an understanding of family-centered health care.
At the same time, due to their one-off nature, the majority of the assessed capacity-building
interventions have not been able to fully prepare the frontline workers to carry out their work in the
targeted areas. In the case of nearly all the interventions, most of the surveyed frontline workers said
that the training/mentoring/course prepared them ‘to some extent’. This was especially the case of
interventions aimed to equip frontline workers with skills to provide complex and/or fully remote
services. As the interviewed UNICEF representatives from the COs underlined, no single intervention
can fully address the frontline workers’ knowledge and skills needed in a particular area. Continuous
capacity building is needed to achieve that. They also highlighted that the contribution of the
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 51
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
interventions to broader ECD goals96 takes place only in conjunction with other interventions
supported by UNICEF and its partners.
ECD frontline workers who shared their views with the evaluators reported needing substantial
further mentoring, guidance, and peer-to-peer support to do their work. Across the interventions,
frontline workers voiced the need for more frequent opportunities for professional development. As
shown in Figure 6, the need for further ‘professional materials, tools, and guidance to provide the right
support’ was indicated by most frontline workers surveyed. Open-ended answers in the surveys show
the need for more guidance and methodological support to apply relevant and modern ECD
practices. In the context of the pandemic, the need for more guidance on how to (i) provide remote
ECD services and (ii) work with caregivers and support them in organizing ECE and ECI at home
was frequently voiced.
It is thus not surprising that the participants perceived trainings and courses which entailed an
element of mentoring in small groups as the most effective. Integrating mentoring or guided group
discussions were seen as especially important for interventions offering self-paced courses or
learning in large groups. The availability of printed or online guidance materials for the training
participants was another key feature that helped improve the participants' learning outcomes.
According to the survey respondents, the materials helped them implement the knowledge they
gained during the trainings and courses in their daily work.

them deal with occupational stress, access to ICT equipment, and better connectivity. As shown in

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 52
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
Figure 6, psychological support was indic ated as a pressing need by all of the surveyed participants
in the training in perinatal centers in Moldova and by 43% of participants in the training on UPHV.
Confirmed by the interviews, this indicates that health workers, in particular, require psychological
support to help them deal with stress. The interviewed health workers trained on UPHV in Ukraine
also mentioned that the training content did not sufficiently address the young children and their
families’ needs for psychological support. The interviewed professionals reported needing guidance
on how to help the families deal with pandemic-related anxiety. Their need for more and better ICT
equipment and Internet connectivity is discussed in the following section.
3.2.1.1 Using online modalities for capacity building activities
Shifting previously planned trainings from face-to-face to the online format allowed the continuation
of capacity-building activities for ECD frontline workers in two main ways. Firstly, the strategy was
used to deliver previously planned trainings such as the training on AAC technologies in Croatia and
the trainings on the UPHV model and multidisciplinary early intervention in Ukraine. Secondly, it made
it possible to organize new trainings on providing ECD services and information during the pandemic.
This was notably the case of the two trainings for preschool workers and health professionals in
Moldova and the e-course on virtual early intervention in Croatia.
The online mode facilitated considerable reach of the trainings and courses open to large pools of
professionals. The vast majority of the surveyed frontline workers said that the online format of the
training and/or mentoring sessions made their participation possible. As explained by several
interviewed participants, protection from infection afforded by the online mode was an important
reason for this. Another reason was not needing to travel when workloads were soaring.
The lack of time was the main reason why some professionals signed up for online trainings but,
in the end, did not start or complete them. Testimonies of early intervention workers in Croatia and
preschool workers in Moldova also show that organizing online sessions during working hours may
disfavor participation. Other reasons for non-participation across the countries included a limit on
the number of participants and the lack of appropriate digital technologies or skills.
The majority of the surveyed participants were satisfied with how the online learnings were
delivered and organized. Both self-paced e-courses and online trainings delivered in real-time were
assessed as attractive by the participants. Self-paced modules were appreciated for their flexibility,
while real-time sessions - for their interactive nature.
Yet, some participants in the online trainings complained about insufficient opportunities for
interaction. For example, some training participants on the safe re-opening of preschools in Moldova
regretted that discussions in break-out rooms were not organized. They also noted that some trainers
struggled to engage their audiences via the online platforms. The online format made it difficult for
almost half of the respondents to stay engaged and motivated. The limited possibility to learn
through practical simulations was listed as a shortcoming of using remote technology by some in
Croatia, Georgia, and Moldova. This issue was raised explicitly by the health workers trained on IPC in
Moldova and ECI professionals trained on AAC devices in Croatia.
In a context of no health emergency, most of the surveyed frontline workers would like future
similar learning opportunities to be delivered in a hybrid mode (see Figure 7). The face-to-face
mode was indicated as the second most preferred option in the case of most interventions. Generally,
the hybrid mode was indicated as the preferred alternative across the age groups, with a slight
tendency for older persons to favor face-to-face solutions. No discernable trend between urban and
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 53
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
rural areas was identified. However, rath er than suggesting no correlation, this could be due to the
skewed geographical distribution of the survey respondents, out of whom the vast majority described
themselves as being from urban areas.
Figure 7: Frontline workers’ mode preference for similar trainings in a context of no health emergency
Source: Responses of frontline workers who participated in the evaluation surveys
The attractiveness and accessibility of ECD professionals' online capacity-building activities are
diminished by suboptimal digital skills and a lack of quality ICT equipment. When asked about the
primary skills they should improve, approximately half of all surveyed frontline workers pointed to
skills related to the use of remote technologies. Moreover, some frontline workers were excluded from
participating in the online interventions altogether because they lacked the necessary digital skills.
For instance, 19% of preschool teachers in Moldova could not be trained on parental education due
to a lack of digital skills required for subsequent delivery of trainings to the caregivers.97 Across the
interventions, interviewed stakeholders underscored the need for training on using ICT technologies,
equipment, and online platforms to address this.
In some cases, these challenges were partly overcome by bringing together ECD professionals in their
workplaces to participate in trainings delivered online using institutional computers. However,
inadequate ICT equipment was reported to negatively affect optimal training even then. For example,
during training for preschool workers in Moldova, the training participants had to share one computer
while keeping physical distance, limiting their possibilities to interact with trainers. In this context,
initiatives to improve the frontline workers’ digital skills may be more promising, provided that
sufficient ICT equipment is also secured. A notable example of such efforts is Ukraine, where UNICEF
and Step by Step Foundation organized a webinar on using remote technologies during the
pandemic.

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
Unintended effects
Organizing online learning opportunities for ECD workers appears to have yielded two types of
unintended effects.
Firstly, anecdotal evidence suggests that the online trainings and courses helped to raise the
awareness and popularity of online opportunities for continued professional development.
Interviewees in Croatia and Moldova highlighted that the online activities implemented by UNICEF
and the Implementing Partners were a first-time experience for many of the frontline workers. They
believed that the interventions helped many training participants overcome their reservations and
start using online platforms and ICT equipment in their practice.
Secondly, as highlighted by many UNICEF and Implementing Partner interviewees, the cost-
effectiveness offered by the online mode enabled the development of additional outputs, such as
guidebooks and manuals. For example, in Croatia, savings were made due to shifting a training that
was previously planned as face-to-face training to the online mode and used to develop a manual
on AAC technologies. The manual was subsequently integrated into the in-service training of ECI
professionals at the University of Zagreb.
3.2.2 Remote provision of services and information for young
children and their families
The evaluation covered three interventions which entailed using online or offline solutions to provide
remote ECD services for young children and their families during the pandemic. These included the
Child Hotline 111 in Georgia and shared medical appointments (SMAs) and e-education for pregnancy
in Croatia. All three were introduced directly in response to COVID-19.
Out of the three interventions, all planned outputs were achieved under Croatia's “E-education for
Pregnancy and Parenting during COVID-19” intervention. These included (i) Output 1.1. Women and
their partners have access to continuity of care through e-courses on pregnancy, childbirth
preparation, and breastfeeding; (ii) Output 2.1. Women and their partners have access to updated
and relevant pregnancy health care indicators through the Expecting App; (iii) Output 3.1. Women
and their partners, including those from marginalized communities, reached by WHO infographics
about pregnancy, birth, and postpartum; and (iv) Output 4.1. Health care providers and policymakers
have access to a webinar on critical information and lessons learned on e-learning tools to reach
pregnant and postpartum families during the COVID-19 pandemic.98
Under the Child Hotline 111 in Georgia, the achievement of outputs was partial. Output 1 – the hotline
becomes fully operational – was partly achieved. The evaluation showed that the hotline is
operational, i.e., the number functions, the hotline can and does receive calls, and staff can provide
information and referral and psychological counseling. However, one may question whether the
hotline is indeed fully operational. The hotline lacks: (i) essential resources such as a directory of
child-related services and a mapping of those services throughout the country, (ii) documented and
sufficiently detailed standard operating procedures and referral pathways, as well as (iii) certain
technical links to other similar services, e.g., the emergency hotline 112 or the hotline 1505 maintained

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
by the Ministry of the Internally Displace d Persons from the Occupied Territories, Labor, Health and
Social Affairs.99
The achievement of the second output of the Child Hotline 111 – a database with case progress
recorded – also raises some questions. The hotline documents data on the number of calls per day
and the general issues that the calls refer to (e.g., social, health, education, psychological counseling,
violence against children). Yet, it is not clear based on the data available to the evaluators to what
extent the cases are documented beyond such general information. The interviews indicate that the
hotline does not collect sufficient data related to its work and does not have a monitoring and
evaluation system to assess the quality of support provided by the hotline staff.100 As a result, the
extent to which Child Hotline 111 achieved its intended outcomes is also partial.
Available evidence indicates that all three interventions contributed to improved access to service
provision for the rights holders. The hotline improved access to a range of social and psychological
services for young children and their families during the pandemic. While several hotlines or
emergency lines are also relevant, there has so far been none devoted purely and comprehensively
to children’s and parents’ needs. Additionally, emergency hotlines such as 112 have been
overwhelmed during the pandemic. Thus, the possibility to receive information or services through
one call was a major direct benefit of the intervention for young children and their families.101
In turn, the antenatal e-learning course in Croatia and the SMAs in Georgia provided pregnant
women with information and advice on pregnancy and breastfeeding when traditional
information channels were not available or seriously limited. Of 781 participants who completed
the e-pregnancy course evaluation survey (15% of total users) in Croatia, 98% would recommend the
courses to friends. Almost one-third (28%) reported that after the course, ‘they know a lot’ after the
course, and 65% said they ‘know enough’.102 No data was made available to the evaluators, which
would allow us to determine how effective the SMAs have been in increasing the participants’
knowledge and awareness about the COVID-19 prevention measures, pregnancy-related issues, and
further antenatal services, which was the SMA’s stated objective as per the project description
provided by UNICEF.
The e-education for pregnancy and parenting intervention in Croatia achieved notable unintended
results. As reported by Roda, all three e-courses developed as part of the intervention were integrated
by the Medical Secondary School of Dubrovnik into the institution’s training curriculum.
Using the online mode to deliver information and advice to pregnant women in Croatia and
Georgia helped achieve considerable reach. As of 2020, the intended target of 5,000 women who
complete courses on pregnancy, childbirth preparation, and breastfeeding in Croatia was almost
met. Over 7,000 women, amounting to one in five pregnant women over nine months, took part in at
least one antenatal e-course.103 In Georgia, 26,000 – or one in three – pregnant women in Georgia
participated in virtual shared consultations.

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 56
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
However, based on the available evidenc e and the observations of UNICEF representatives, the Child
Hotline 111 and the antenatal education e-courses were less effective in delivering on the needs of
the most vulnerable groups. Based on the profile of the evaluation survey respondents,104 persons
from vulnerable groups accounted for very small shares of Roda’s e-courses. Only 1.5% of the survey
respondents reported a mother tongue that is not Croatian, and only 2% indicated that they did not
complete their secondary education. Further, only 12.5% of the evaluation course respondents said
they live in rural areas, and 2.5% live on islands. While the reasons for this are unclear, evidence from
around the world shows that digital education can exclude the populations without access to ICT
equipment or a lack of digital skills.
Indeed, shortages in digital skills and ICT equipment on the part of both rights holders and frontline
workers severely limit the online provision of ECD services across all the four countries studied in-
depth. The lack of laptops, tablets, or computers, adequate access to the Internet, and digital skills
among the caregivers/patients and the frontline workers were raised as key barriers to the
effectiveness of the online ECD services by preschool, medical, and ECI workers alike. A survey with
110 ECD frontline workers in Croatia carried out by MURID in October, and November 2020 showed that
21% of the respondents did not provide services online during lockdown because of a lack of relevant
ICT or digital skills. This is despite the efforts of UNICEF and its partners to provide ICT and support in
setting up mobile applications for the most vulnerable groups of young children and their families.
The evaluation showed that distributing information offline and on social media increased the
accessibility of the assessed services for the most vulnerable. Based on observations of a UNICEF
representative interviewed, the SMAs in Georgia effectively reached out to the rights holders due to
the use of individual phone calls from the staff of responsible agencies. In Croatia, distributing (i)
printed infographics among health centers and (ii) digital infographics on social media allowed
pregnant women and young mothers from Roma communities to see them. According to the final
programme report, both types of infographics were well-received, although the extent to which their
translation to Bayash was necessary is questionable. Feedback from hospitals in the two counties
showed that the majority of the Roma women in those counties could not read in Bayash but were
able to read Croatian.
Evidence suggests that having a targeted information campaign and using specific information
channels is necessary to reach out to vulnerable groups. In Croatia, the distribution of printed
infographics on pregnancy and parenting among health centers in locations with marginalized
groups and centers catering to asylum seekers helped to ensure the coverage of vulnerable groups.
In contrast, in Georgia, the channels to spread the information about the Child Hotline 111 were
assessed as limited by the key informants. The information campaign about the hotline did not
include a targeted communication to reach out to vulnerable groups using specific channels,
hindering the service’s accessibility for the most vulnerable, such as homeless children.
3.2.3 Caregivers’ attitudes and demand for ECD services
The role of caregivers in supporting their child’s ECD is paramount. It has become even more critical
since the pandemic as access to ECD specialists and official service delivery channels were
disrupted. At the same time, the evaluation revealed that many caregivers have reservations towards
104 According to the intervention’s Final Report, information on the sex of the participants was not collected for ethical
reasons. Evaluation survey respondents represent 15% of all of the participants in the e-course.

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
remote ECD services and lack the confi dence and preparedness to actively engage in structured
activities for learning and development at home. The collected evidence suggests that this reduces
the effectiveness of the programmatic adaptations and interventions rapidly introduced by UNICEF
in response to the pandemic.
The analyzed programme documentation and interviews show that many caregivers are hesitant
to receive ECD services online, even with the relevant digital skills and ICT equipment. As reported
by key informants in Moldova, a dislike of online interaction among many of Moldova’s adults created
challenges with the delivery of online sessions on positive parenting. In some cases, the online mode
of the trainings with parents was reported to have negatively affected parental engagement in the
sessions, particularly in discussions on psycho-emotional problems and disability. In Croatia, many
frontline workers reported that the caregivers were skeptical about the benefits of virtual early
intervention. As one respondent said: “most parents do not use online applications for such purposes,
they are afraid of how it will be, and whether there will be any benefit for their child”. Respondents of
the MURID survey also noted a reluctance among the caregivers to let a professional into their
home.105 Similarly, as a UNICEF Georgia representative perceived, a distrust towards online service
provision may have been one of the factors for a relatively high share of pregnant women resigning
from participating in the SMAs.
Since positive attitudes can help future mainstreaming of online service provision, building them may
be an essential component of future actions. Increasing the quality of such services can also boost
the population’s trust towards them. The evaluation also found the need to promote ECD awareness
and behavior change among caregivers, especially those with children with disabilities and
belonging to Roma communities, to ensure demand for ECD services in general.
In Croatia and Ukraine, a shift from a child-centered to a family-centered approach in early
childhood intervention driven by an uptake in virtual ECI exposed the caregivers’ low
preparedness to engage in early intervention for their children actively. As observed by several
UNICEF staff members, most caregivers of children with disabilities in the ECA countries still heavily
rely on specialists to provide early intervention, without always seeing how critical their role is in the
process. In addition, as reported by several frontline workers in Croatia, caregivers are often hesitant
to engage in their child’s ECI because they lack a conviction that they can competently do so. As a
result, some families did not benefit from the ECI offered via virtual means during the first months of
the pandemic.106
In addition, UNICEF’s experiences with delivering support to Roma families with young children in
Croatia and Moldova show that many Roma parents of young children are not aware or convinced
of the importance of ECE. Interviewed Croatian authorities, who were involved in distributing ECD kits
to families with young Roma children, noted that many Roma children dropped out of preschool
during the pandemic.
3.2.4 Enabling environment
A range of systemic bottlenecks in Croatia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine was identified to impede
the short-term and long-term effectiveness of the adapted and new interventions.

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 58
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
Firstly, the ECD systems in the four count ries are underfinanced, negatively affecting both the supply
and demand for ECD services. For instance, in Croatia, the evaluation of the tele-intervention project
and the AAC programme showed that many organizations and professionals who completed the
training would not be able to start providing ECI virtually or using AAC devices without continuous
support. At the same time, as indicated by the key informants, the resources dedicated by the
government to the professional development of ECI professionals in Croatia are marginal. Moreover,
there is a lack of a proper financing system for AAC technologies for families with children with
disabilities and developmental delays, precluding them from fully benefitting from ECI in general.
Across the four countries, key informants believed that the working conditions of ECD professionals
are poor and negatively impact the frontline workers’ capacity to put their newly gained knowledge
and skills into practice.
In Georgia, the effectiveness of a pilot training aimed at strengthening the knowledge and
competency of preschools staff will depend on systemic factors, such as the infrastructure and
resources available in kindergartens. Research shows that spending on resources per child is
minimal. Data from 56 municipalities reveals that 62.5% spend less than 10 Georgian Lari per child
annually on educational resources (some spend as low as GEL 0.73 and 1.11).107 ECEC services located
in high mountainous or ethnic minority communities do not have access to the resources necessary
to meet children’s needs or plan respective developmental activities.
Similarly, the effectiveness of the Child Hotline 111 in responding to the needs of children and their
families is limited by the poor quality and availability of relevant ECD services in the country. The
service provided by Child Hotline 111 heavily depends on the availability and responsiveness of other
child-related services in the country. Yet, the surveyed hotline operators noted problems with poor
quality of relevant services (5 out of 7 responses) and shortages of services and support
programmes (5 out of 7 responses) available to vulnerable children (especially with disabilities) and
families in Georgia in general and in their respective location (e.g., municipality, town/village).
In addition, while ECD systems in the four countries are being developed, multi-sectoral cooperation
for comprehensive ECD provision is still generally lacking. For instance, in Croatia, the lack of a
comprehensive ECI strategy and action plans and coordinated intersectoral planning significantly
hinders ECI programme development. The lack of a common ECI policy and coordination
mechanisms contributes to the fragmentation of services. As a result, there is a lack of a common
framework for a holistic EI provision, and early intervention is understood differently across the
different professional groups providing ECI services. In effect, the effectiveness and sustainability of
measures to strengthen the capacity of those who provide early intervention in Croatia are limited.
The formation of the intersectoral National ECI Commission represents some progress. However, the
Commission has not yet developed common standards for early childhood intervention. The recent
efforts of UNICEF and its partners to develop and pilot approaches to coordinated ECI provision in
selected counties are promising. However, UNICEF should ensure the engagement of the central
government to safeguard national buy-in and commitment to upscale the solutions developed.
There are also specific legal and institutional barriers that negatively impact the functioning of ECD
services and the effects of the interventions. For instance, in Ukraine, the division of responsibilities
between the assistant of a preschool teacher and preschool teachers is not well defined,
complicating the effective organization of inclusive education in kindergartens. According to the
107 Peeters, J., Hulpia, H. (2018). Study on quality of early childhood education and care in Georgia. Summary, UNICEF, p. 11.
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 59
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
evaluation respondents, this introduces misunderstandings and demotivates the assistants since
while the requirements for their education are high (higher education at the master's level), they are
often perceived as support staff. This affects the extent to which the preschool staff will be able to
apply the solutions they learned during the trainings on inclusive preschool education.
Moreover, there is a lack of financial and legal basis for the remote provision of ECD services in the
four countries. For example, in Ukraine, the current budgetary framework for preschool education
was described by the key informants as complicating the issue of remuneration of employees in
conditions when preschool institutions work remotely. Specifically, since preschool education is
financed from local budgets, some oblasts did not pay full wages to kindergarten staff during remote
ECE provision. Reportedly, there were cases when special educators were not paid for their services.
Similarly, no models on how to cost telemedicine or tele-intervention are available.
Respondents across the four countries noted that current spending on ICT equipment for frontline
workers and caregivers with young children is also marginal, considerably affecting accessible
and quality professional learning and ECD services during the pandemic.

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
3.3 Sustainability
Assessing innovative, alternative, and/or flexible ECD responses to COVID-19 that increase resilience
programming to find new and effective ways to serve families and support frontline workers is a
priority to build sustainable preparedness, response, and recovery capabilities.108 This section
presents the evaluation’s findings regarding the sustainability of UNICEF-supported interventions and
their contribution to building more resilient services. First, it reveals whether the results of adaptations
in the UNICEF-support to ECD services are (or can be) mainstreamed forward and last over time.
Second, it looks at approaches applied when implementing these interventions that make ECD
services better prepared for other challenging situations similar to COVID-19. For this, respondents'
perceptions on the value and sufficiency of the assessed adaptations to face future crises were
analyzed together with information on measures already put in place or planned to ensure the
continuity of the interventions’ results.
3.3.1 Sustainability of current responses
Some tangible steps have already been taken to ensure the sustainability of the assessed ECD
adaptations introduced in response to COVID-19. There are plans to continue them in a new format
and context, make them more targeted, include them in national policies, and make the learnings
available for a wider audience. The following part summarizes the opportunities for the sustainability
of the results and measures that can contribute to long-term effectiveness in service provision.
3.3.1.1 Integration into national policies
The experiences gained from the responses to COVID-19, if applied, provide an opportunity to
strengthen policies and systems concerning ECD. Moldova is a good example of using the training
results from the health (perinatal) area, together with the positive practices and protocols from other
countries in the region, for the development of Standards for the supervision of pregnant women in
ambulatory conditions (approved through the MHLSP Order N890) and for the development of
National Clinical Protocols on COVID-19. In the education area, the sustainability of the intervention’s
results is likely to be supported by implementing the Education Strategic Plan 2021-2030 and the Plan
of Action for 2021-2024. Both documents were developed by the MECR, with the support of UNICEF and
the Global Partnership for Education, in response to the pandemic.109
In one case, the Child Hotline, new governmental regulations were introduced to facilitate the
intervention’s establishment in a short period, support its operation, and coordinate with different
state institutions. Although initiated as an immediate response to the pandemic crisis, the Child
Hotline service is envisioned as a long-term, durable, and expanding programme. It is governed by
Georgian laws and child protection procedures, legitimizing its further development and financing.
Georgia has also begun to create an institutional framework at the level of municipalities that could
support the work of the Child Hotline 111 in the future. Every municipality now has a structural unit for
child protection and child support. Nevertheless, to ensure the durable operation and further

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
development of the Hotline, a comprehen sive development strategy is needed to determine, among
others, the extent of cooperation with other stakeholders. It will increase the service’s potential to
become a preventative tool and create a coordinated system of services with a long-lasting impact
on children’s needs.
In addition to building the capacity of frontline workers, some interventions have specific forms of
built-in support contributing to their lasting effects directly. For instance, to achieve progress at
the institutional-, policy-, and system-level, the project on Social Inclusion of Roma Children and
Children with Disabilities in the Western Balkans (Moldova) envisages advocacy and technical
assistance increase the local authorities’ budgets for preschool education by 2%. This achievement
is expected to improve the overall conditions for preschool workers for further strengthening and
using their skills in providing early education to children with special educational needs (SEN) and
other vulnerable children. Another example is legal, and cost-effectiveness modeling analysis carried
out as part of the universal-progressive home visiting model (Ukraine) to facilitate the development
of a legal and regulatory environment in support of home visiting. However, in this case, national-
level changes to legal and financial regulations on mother and child health services will be necessary
if the model is to be incorporated into broader health care and social service systems.
At the same time, policy – or the lack of it – can hinder the sustainability of the interventions
assessed in this report. For instance, several issues in the regulatory and institutional framework
concerning EI affect effective ECI service provision in Croatia and Ukraine. These include the lack
of information and guidance on virtual ECI, such as ECI Standard Operating Procedures (Croatia),
and no guidelines for implementing the current legislation/policy on EI services (Ukraine). The
insufficient interagency cooperation between social, medical, and educational services in the ECI
area (Ukraine) and the insufficient equity focus considering the needs of the most vulnerable children
and families in emergency preparedness and response plans (Croatia) have also emerged as
elements of the policy environment hampering sustainability. Thus, establishing an enabling policy
environment with financial and institutional support to organizations to help them integrate the
learned practices and experiences into their regular ECI programmes will determine their wider-scale
adoption.
Evidence:
Frontline workers need additional information and guidance on how to carry out virtual ECI,
including comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures, manuals, briefs, etc. Over 65% of the
survey respondents indicated this to be the main form of support they need.
Tele-intervention for children with developmental delays and disabilities (Croatia)
Similar concerns relate to organizing inclusive ECE during and beyond the lockdown. As reported by
the respondents from Ukraine, preschool educators need a sufficient regulatory and institutional
framework concerning preschool education, followed by concrete instructions addressing their most
practical preoccupations related to service provision during COVID-19 (such as: How to work with
children during a lockdown? What techniques to use to comply with sanitary conditions and provide
a developmental environment and content to children?).
Yet, without strong political commitment to ECD/ECI, it is hard to expect that resources will be
mobilized to provide additional support to practitioners. According to respondents from Ukraine
and Croatia, budgetary limitations concerning ECI and inclusive education negatively affect the
prospects for continuing and implementing interventions in these areas. For instance, municipalities
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 62
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
in Ukraine do not have sufficient financia l resources for implementing EI services and the capacity-
building of community professionals. Thus, despite progress in the development and implementation
of ECI policy, the overall policy and organizational environments continue to hinder the
sustainability of the interventions, including investment in the capacities of the local workforce.
In the nearest future, their results are likely to be supported and sustained by UNICEF and its partners’
efforts as they are a part of UNICEF’s broader ECD framework.
3.3.1.2 Plans for continuation and institutionalization
The prospects for sustainability increase substantially if the intervention outputs are embedded
in a professional development system and benefit from the support of relevant stakeholders.
Some considerable efforts and plans have been identified in this regard, such as including
manuals, recommendations, and online courses in regular professional development
programmes. For instance, the University of Zagreb approved a manual on AAC tools as official
university literature, and plans were made to integrate the manual into FERS’ lifelong learning
programme. In Ukraine, the online course developed as part of the intervention targeting EI services
was submitted to governmental partners (the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Social Policy) for
integration into in-service professional development programmes. There are also plans for
developing and adopting recommendations on ECD/UPHV for medical universities and colleges to
ensure access to continuous professional medical and thus secure the sustainability of the UPHV. The
key healthcare stakeholders expressed interest in the UPHV model of services for children and their
families. Discussions are underway to establish a permanent oblast training-resource center for
continuing medical education of doctors and nurses. Also, in Croatia, there is enthusiasm among ECI
providers for continuing the provision of virtual ECI in the longer term, even after the COVID-19
pandemic, and plans to integrate virtual ECI into regular programmes. In this case, however, there is
a need to clarify whether and how it will continue. Similarly, the hybrid re-assessment of baby-friendly
standards carried out by the UNICEF-supported BFHI team is likely to continue in Croatia or other
countries in the region that have already taken up the solution.110
Some assessed interventions envisage the continuation of their activities but with modifications
in the content and target groups. More emphasis on skills and support that emerged as necessary
during the healthcare crisis is expected in future activities. For instance, the training course for
healthcare frontline workers from Moldova’s 12 Perinatal Centers will be more focused on improving
the communication of frontline healthcare workers with families, women, and children (mainly in a
vulnerable situation) on prevention of infection, vaccination, and treatment. More practical
simulations are also envisaged together with more training for frontline health care workers from the
rural areas as they work with pregnant women in more challenging conditions and have limited
access to information. Similar targeted training is planned for capacity-building activities for
preschool staff to ensure the safety of the educational and care processes in education facilities. It
will occur in two formats: one for those who need advanced skills and another for those requiring
more basic skills, and it will address frontline workers’ needs regarding digital skills enhancement.111
Finally, in Georgia, the governmental institutions unofficially plan further improvement and expansion

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
of the Child Hotline service, as reported by KIIs. This will depend on expanding cooperation with
various actors and enlarging/updating the pool of the existing services.
The extent to which these results continue beyond the pandemic will depend on whether further
resources are dedicated to the frontline workers’ professional development. Firstly, frontline
workers need additional information and guidance on how to carry out services in specific areas (e.g.,
ECI, ECE) and circumstances (e.g., lockdown), and how to use specific devices (e.g., AAC). It also
includes further know-how on supporting and empowering parents to assume their critical role of
partners to practitioners in ECI, ECE, and early stimulation to achieve positive outcomes for children.
Secondly, more opportunities for networking and exchanging knowledge with peers are needed to
facilitate problem-solving and teamwork. Establishing professional communities or networks could
multiply the effects of the interventions by the distribution of materials and knowledge sharing
among members, reaching those who were not previously engaged in the intervention. Thirdly,
regular and personalized mentoring and supportive supervision is required, for instance, to help
frontline workers deal with more complicated cases. Fourthly, a factor that could amplify trainings’
attractiveness and uptake is integrating the training in the university curricula on service provision in
emergencies and post-graduate courses. Lastly, appropriate ICT equipment and devices and
internet access are necessary to continue distance learning and the digital mode of service provision.
These are necessary conditions for frontline workers to consolidate their knowledge and follow-up
learning, have access to information sources at all times, and participate in future trainings, most
likely in the hybrid (online and face-to-face) format.
Evidence:
Most of the frontline workers (96%) who took part in the evaluation agreed that the ECI training
should continue even after the pandemic is over, preferable in a hybrid mode.
A promising option for effective and long-lasting training delivery could be the online capacity-
building platform for healthcare and education frontline workers. Such a platform should have an
integrated training needs assessment questionnaire and feedback mechanism and be flexible for
developing and posting new trainings as per the identified needs. This would offer training relevant
to frontline workers’ needs and increase their chances of participation given their busy schedules
and care responsibilities at home. The establishment of the training platform would also require the
development of proper regulation and cooperation with the medical university to take the lead.
3.3.1.3. Disseminating experiences and promising practices
Using knowledge gained during the COVID-19 crisis by ensuring wider access to created and
accumulated knowledge is essential to achieving sustainable outcomes of the assessed
interventions. In this sense, activities directed at building a broader understanding and awareness
among peer frontline workers and a wider audience promoted the sustainability of the results and
measures in question.
The following tools and steps have been identified with potential for further dissemination of the
interventions’ outputs and experiences:
• extensive distribution of training packages on strengthening capacities of preschool staff,
parents, and LPAs to ensure a state of preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic
(Moldova), and posting all developed information materials, including the guide for parents,
on the MECR and Chisinau municipality websites;
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 64
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
• methodological guidance regard ing the online trainings on positive parenting, informational
materials on positive parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a paper on lessons
learned from the education sector’s response to COVID-19 (Moldova);
• plans to develop a video library with training content, recorded sessions, and a separate
“questions and answers” session to better disseminate the training on COVID-19 response for
women and their children in Moldova’s 12 Perinatal Centers among non-participants
(Moldova);
• training instructions and accompanying materials for teachers as tools to assess the
individual needs of children and families, cooperate with support teams, establish contacts
with the Inclusive Resource Centers, and engage with parents more effectively, which can be
used beyond the current pandemic (Ukraine);
• ECI training instructions and materials that help specialists understand family's needs, assess
children's and their families' strengths, establish contact with a child, provide support to and
empower the parents to engage them more effectively, and cooperate with other specialists
within the multidisciplinary teams (Croatia);
• access for EI practitioners to an online course, guidelines, and resources on providing quality
tele-intervention service for children with developmental delays and disabilities during the
COVID-19 pandemic (Croatia);
• a series of capacity development activities for preschool educators and managers for
improved services for young children and an event for all municipalities of Adjara planned to
share achievements, challenges, and next steps from the eight pilot preschools in Batumi and
Khulo (Georgia).112
With the acquired knowledge, the above-listed developed materials, instructions, and
recommendations could be further used for training and self-study and part of the continuous
professional education.
3.3.2. Resilience-enhancing approaches
Resilience in the ECD area is crucial because it facilitates the continuity of service provision in
times of crisis. The most commonly understood definition of resilience is the ability to withstand a
major disruption (difficulty or shock), recover quickly, or spring back into shape.113 In this evaluation,
resilient early childhood education or healthcare system (or services) can be defined as “a system
that is able to prepare for, manage and learn from shocks”, such as the COVID-29 pandemic.114
The COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the importance of resilience building-strategies to prepare for,
prevent, and mitigate crises. It has provided an opportunity to see and test what works and what
should be improved to navigate this and other crises and support a sustainable recovery in the in-
depth study countries. To use this opportunity properly, it is particularly important to analyze

experiences from COVID-19 responses, in terpret the findings, and promote the reflective practice to
learn from them to increase preparedness for similar emergencies in the future.115
This subsection discusses improvements in the resilience of services resulting from the adaptations
introduced in response to COVID-19 and the capacity to address similar situations in the future. In
doing so, it looks at three main resilience-enhancing approaches (or strategies) applied by UNICEF
COs and RO through their interventions: 1) alternative and flexible approaches to deliver services; 2)
coordination of activities across government and key stakeholders; 3) organizational learning culture
that is responsive to crises.116 While it was not possible to assess conclusively to what extent these
approaches improve the resilience of services, especially in the long run, the data collected reveals
some notable achievements in this regard. Progress in the three approaches, as discussed below,
allows concluding that adaptations introduced in response to COVID-19 have the potential to
improve the resilience of ECD services and make them better prepared for another challenging
context in due course.
3.3.2.1. Alternative and flexible approaches to deliver services
The unprecedented impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the education and early years
sectors required a massive and quick effort from governments and UNICEF to respond to the various
ways in which child support services were affected by the crisis. In doing so, alternative and flexible
approaches were implemented to deliver essential services without major disruption. In the literature
on resilience, there are three main areas of achievements that indicate that these approaches
contribute to increased resilience, namely: i) ensuring the provision of services for at-risk population
groups; ii) crisis preparedness training and training for additional skills; and iii) training of frontline
workers to serve specific or at-risk population groups.117 These are briefly discussed below.
Ensuring the provision of services for at-risk population groups
The assessed interventions focused directly or indirectly on ensuring services, particularly for at-
risk population groups. The OECD says it is one of the main pillars of action aligned to the child well-
being and a policy challenge in the post-COVID-19 decade and the longer-term goals.118 The UNICEF
COs’ responses display several approaches undertaken to ensure continuity of ECD services in the
new operational context influenced by the pandemic. Some were introduced directly to respond to
the global health crisis, and some were adapted to the new circumstances. These interventions
prioritized the needs of vulnerable children and – in some cases –addressed personnel/provider
shortages in underserved areas or when in-person services are not feasible. In addition to being used
for future emergencies, some of these solutions can also be used to provide information or services
for hard-to-reach populations in general.
Crisis preparedness training and training for additional skills

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
Crisis preparedness and response tra ining and guidance focused directly on strengthening
infection prevention, response, and control capacities and/or improving/enabling service
delivery in crisis settings. The majority of surveyed frontline workers agreed that the competencies
acquired from the assessed interventions would be useful in the case of other public health
emergencies beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The respondents also concluded that having staff who
know how to respond to health emergencies makes their institutions better prepared to deal with
future shocks and crises and, in consequence, adds to a stronger and more resilient ECD system. In
addition, some of the basic training materials adapted to the COVID-19 situation, after minor
modifications, can be used for any other health care emergency.
Examples:
The Child Hotline 111 in Georgia is seen as a potential source of evidence for policy-makers on
the needs regarding child protection and early childhood development and gaps in existing
services. Almost all hotline operators (7 out of 8) have agreed that, in the context of the COVID-
19 pandemic and within their remits, they can fully respond to the immediate needs of children
under the age of 7 and their families with different types of vulnerabilities who call the Hotline.
UNICEF’s ECD response to COVID-19 in Croatia entailed the roll-out of new solutions for service
provision and technical assistance in the country, which can be used for future emergencies
and provide information or services for hard-to-reach populations in general.
Figure 8: Views on training usability in crisis settings, beyond the COVID pandemic
• Access to the EI services for families with children with developmental delays and/or
disabilities (Ukraine): The majority of survey respondents (87.5%) agreed that the skills and
knowledge gained/strengthened through the training and supervision would be helpful in the
case of other public health emergencies beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.
• Quality of Education (part of the Safe School Operation Framework, Ukraine): Almost one in
nine (89,5%) survey respondents believed that the training improved their capacity to provide
early learning support to preschool children and their families in crisis settings in general, beyond
the COVID-19 pandemic.
• Strengthening capacities of preschool staff, parents, and local public authorities (LPAs) to
ensure a state of preparedness and response to COVID-19 pandemics (Moldova): All KIs
agreed that the intervention contributed to strengthening the resilience and long-term
effectiveness of ECD services beyond the context of a public health emergency.
• COVID -19 response for women and their children in Moldova’s 12 Perinatal Centers (Moldova):
Almost all survey respondents believe that intervention contributed to strengthened resilience
and long-term effectiveness of ECD services beyond the context of a public health emergency.
Out of 14 responses received, 12 surveyed frontline health care workers think that the training
course improved their capacities to deliver perinatal and postnatal care services to women and
their children in crisis settings beyond the COVID pandemic and should continue even after the
pandemic is over.
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 67
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
The trainings also covered many essent ial aspects not directly related to infection prevention and
control but highly relevant in the pandemic context. The evaluation findings indicate that demand
for additional skills, such as those to engage (with) caregivers or peer frontline workers and
deliver/access services online, increased considerably because of the new circumstances of service
provision. A good example is the early learning sector, where parents became an inevitable mediator
between teachers and children and thus an even more indispensable partner in addressing their
children’s educational needs. Focus on building skills and conditions for good relations between
preschool staff or ECI professionals and caregivers can help make the ECD system more resilient in
case of future shocks.
Examples:
In Ukraine, the shift from a child-centered to a family-centered approach in ECD/ECI is focused
on changing existing practices, and the mindsets of frontline workers and caregivers, whose role
in child health, development, and EI is pivotal, especially during current crises.
In Moldova, guidance on supporting children in pandemic conditions helped both frontline
workers and caregivers adapt to the new situation and cope with their new tasks and stress
related to the unexpected situation.
Training of frontline workers to serve specific or at-risk population groups
As discussed in the context and relevance sections, vulnerable children and families are the most
affected by the crisis and need the most support. Hence, the preparation of frontline workers to reach
and support them helps to react faster and in a more targeted way at times of crisis. The evaluation
shows that training for frontline workers who work with specific or at-risk population groups was
an essential component of the assessed adaptations. Some were designed to reach vulnerable
children early in life, when it matters most, and include activities that increase children’s educational
success and empower vulnerable families.119 From the resilience perspective, such an approach
strengthens the potential of a system to address the vulnerabilities of the ECD final beneficiaries
during COVID-19 and other emergencies.
3.3.2.2. Coordination and collaboration between sectors and relevant key
stakeholders
The long-standing cooperation between UNICEF and various national and local authorities and
partners played an enabling role in coping with the unprecedented context. Firstly, most UNICEF’s
COVID-19 related activities involved the government or other state actors. The national, regional, and
local government stakeholders were brought on board to advise, discuss, validate the intervention
frameworks, and facilitate the engagement of other stakeholders. It helped to be up-to-date with
the most urgent needs, facilitated the coordination of the response to the multiple needs in the ECD
system and its actors, and avoid duplication of interventions. Secondly, the interventions were
delivered by strong, local implementing partners with experience in supporting access and quality of
ECD locally. Together with previous experience of collaboration with UNICEF, effective collaboration

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
with implementing partners (NGOs) was reported as a facilitating factor for the interventions smooth
roll-out and outreach to populations most affected by shock situations.
The cooperation between the intervention participants can become an opportunity to extend their
contacts beyond the project timeline. For instance, although not officially intended as the training
result, some crucial collaborations formed during the implementation of the intervention continue.
For instance, in the case of the “Social Inclusion of Roma Children and Children with Disabilities in the
Western Balkans project” (Moldova), the collaboration between the Psycho-pedagogical Assistance
Services and the kindergartens continues even if their jointly implemented task ended in 2020. Also,
in Moldova, public authorities from several communities, in a joint effort, requested the central
government to support them to create the required conditions for re-opening preschool facilities. As
a result, they received permission from the Ministry of Finance to use unspent budgets to improve the
overall infrastructure (inside toilets, water pipe systems, boilers for hot water, sanitizers, computers),
which helps deliver services a more appropriate setting.
Examples:
According to the interviewed stakeholders from Croatia, UNICEF’s leadership and long-standing
experience in advancing ECD in Croatia, both during the COVID-19 pandemic and before it, has
been a key factor enabling the intervention’s relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability. Even
if state financial support could not be secured, national and local government stakeholders
were brought on board to advise, discuss, and facilitate the engagement of other stakeholders.
In Georgia, the involvement of the MoESCS in pilot training for preschool staff in Adjara is an
important factor, which can help mainstream the service in other regions of the country. The
intervention is now led by the TPDC, a legal entity of public law of the MoESCS. This partnership
is a significant achievement, as TPDC is the focal agency for determining in-service training
requirements for preschool educators. These requirements are currently minimal (66 hours)
and, because of the intervention, could be expanded to include more intensive and practice-
based supervision/coaching for all preschool educators in the future.
In Ukraine, the KIIs reported that solid relations with the authorities had been established at the
local/oblast level and the motivation and understanding of the importance of UPHVM initiative
are very high. At the central level, negotiations are underway with the National Health Service. At
the institutional level, the key healthcare stakeholders are motivated to participate in the
intervention. For instance, the hospital management is interested in developing a UPHV model
of services for children and their families.
3.3.2.3. Organizational learning culture responsive to crises
A quick effort to provide an adjusted reaction to various ways in which child support services were
affected by COVID-19 reflects the flexibility and adaptiveness of UNICEF COs in an emergency
situation. Accordingly, the activities directed at learning and adaptation among COs, ECARO, and
stakeholders, build an evidence base for an informed and timely response during current and
future emergencies. This evaluation is a good example of applying a learning approach to review
the emerging evidence from the crisis, which is vital for addressing current and future shock
experiences effectively (see a figure below on reflection and learning points during the evaluation).
It promotes sharing lessons and experiences within and between COs, which can catalyze knowledge
mobilization across ECD sectors and disciplines. Such an approach creates the potential to build a

more coherent response to a crisis in th e future as more coherent systems or service provision are
generally believed to be also more efficient and adaptable to various shocks and disruptions.120

Recognizing the main learnings from COVID-19 and integrating them into future activities is
critical for preparedness and response to a crisis situation. In addition to the reflection and learning
points above, continuous monitoring and assessment of current solutions – before their more
permanent introduction – are necessary to achieve this.121 While all the assessed adaptations
managed to include monitoring and feedback mechanisms to various extent, there is still some room
for improvement in a more rigorous approach to data collection. Tackling it during post-shock
“normality” is a viable option as it can be challenging to develop and plan proper monitoring and
evaluation procedures during an emergency.

resilient; in other words, it is not synonymous with “sameness.” From: Evaluating_Complexity.pdf

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 70
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
4. Conclusions and recommendations
It is a demanding task to develop responses to challenges that emerge in an uncertain context, where
the external environment is changing unpredictably. The COVID-19 crisis clearly revealed how
important is to be prepared for such disasters and develop a coordinated response, particularly in
the ECD sector. Exploring effective ways to increase preparedness to such situations requires more
profound insight into the nature of the challenges throughout the pandemic and quick conclusions
about what does and does not work. Accordingly, to make these lessons “learned”, the most
promising elements of responses to the crisis should become a part of a broader intervention or
emergency preparedness activities.
This concluding section, as the whole report, contributes to the pool of knowledge on relevance,
effectiveness, and sustainability of ECD response to COVID-19 pandemic. It first summarizes the
implications of the evaluation findings and offers a set of lessons learned from the interventions and
the evaluation process. Then the report presents recommendations that should be implemented
going forward to better respond to (changing) needs and services provided and ensure conditions
to make continuous adaptability and resilience inherent parts of a broader system. The key points
below related to challenges and proposed solutions were discussed and validated during the ECA
reflection workshop.
4.1 Conclusions
SYSTEMIC BOTTLENECKS
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed some systemic bottlenecks and gaps in the level of
preparedness of state actors for a global health crisis, which hinder the effectiveness and
sustainability of the assessed interventions.122 The main gaps include: ● lack of coordinated
government strategy/policy and supporting institutional instruments and insufficient funding for ECI,
preschool, and inclusive education; ● lack of a sufficient number of ECD services and their unequal
geographical distribution as compared to the needs; ● staff shortages across key sectors and
services (healthcare staff, specialists, and ECE staff in general, especially qualified with child centers,
play-based, inclusive ECE ); ● low considerations for emergency planning preparedness; ● limited
availability, responsiveness and coordination between child-related services; and ● no sustainable
system of supply of qualified service providers and their professional development. These gaps
expose the need for continuous efforts to strengthen key ECD systems to prevent disruptions in
services in the context of health emergencies, particularly for the most vulnerable to shocks groups.123
Lack of such support is an obstacle to building resilient and sustainable ECD services.
THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS AND THEIR NEEDS
In general, the adaptations in the UNICEF-supported ECD-related services were well-suited to
respond to the COVID-19 implications in addressing the needs of caregivers and children. They
addressed caregivers’ immediate needs for information and guidance to adjust to the new reality of
122 Gromada, A., Richardson, D., and Rees, G. (2020). Childcare in a global crisis: the impact of COVID-19 on work and family
life. UNICEF Innocenti Research Brief 2020-18. Available here.

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
their childcare and learning and safegu arded access to services, PPE, and hygiene supplies. At the
same time, vulnerable groups have been at the center of UNICEF ECD programmes and their
adaptations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, the new modalities for service provision enforced by the pandemic were not equally
relevant solutions for all beneficiaries. Some crucial challenges emerged concerning reaching out
to disadvantaged beneficiary groups and addressing their specific needs. This concerned mainly
the provision of online services for children with disabilities and special educational needs, and low-
income families. One of the main reasons for this was the limited/lack of information about
vulnerable children and families and their needs. Without such knowledge, it was difficult for frontline
workers to understand and develop an appropriate response to address the situation of children with
disabilities and their families during and beyond the emergency period. A related factor that
hampered the effectiveness of remote service provision was the lack of sufficient guidance on using
remote technologies for such purposes. For instance, the evaluation showed that any guidance
regarding preschool education using remote technologies must separately consider the specific
needs of different preschool children (e.g., with special educational and developmental needs) and
the ECD professionals working with them. Finally, the pandemic has further impaired the already
difficult access to lower-income families and families living in rural and remote areas. The case of EI
services shows that reaching caregivers with relevant information on the availability of services is an
urgent issue to increase their participation and use. Without tackling these issues, it can be expected
that COVID-19 or other similar emergencies will widen disparities and put already vulnerable children
at particular risk.
ONLINE MODE OF DELIVERY
Increased digitalization of capacity-building activities and service provision in the ECD area was
one of the main changes accelerated by the COVID-19-caused disruptions. It has brought about
certain advantages for both frontline workers and caregivers. First, it made it possible to continue
ECD services and professional development of ECD staff during the emergency. Second, it addressed
staff shortages in specific locations or/and professions. Third, it facilitated communication and
collaboration between the frontline workers and caregivers. The flexibility and cost-effectiveness of
this form of delivery made capacity building and support programmes more accessible in remote
areas. They allowed the transfer of knowledge and skills to non-participants, contributing to more
inclusive early childhood services. With an increased awareness of the benefits of digitalized learning
and service provision among frontline workers (though mainly in a hybrid form), there is now greater
scope for applying distant forms of interaction.
However, digital solutions are not equally relevant and effective for all groups, types of services,
and problems. Without sufficient infrastructure, equipment, and skills, choosing an online mode of
delivery as the only option may decrease access to opportunities for vulnerable children, parents,
and frontline workers. First, evidence shows that shortages of ICT equipment, devices, sufficient
internet infrastructure, and connectivity were serious constraints to distance learning and the digital
mode of service provision. Second, insufficient digital skills among frontline workers and caregivers
prevented some from providing/benefitting from online services during the lockdown. Lack of such
skills is an obstacle for building resilient ECD services, it limits the efforts to adapt to the current
emergency context and similar contexts in the future. Third, the online trainings/meetings appeared
to be less suitable for developing practical skills, for which face-to-face or hybrid mode of training is
preferred after the pandemic. Participants also seem more difficult to stay engaged and motivated
to participate. Fourth, the attitudes towards remote services – perceived as less attractive, useful, or
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 72
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
trustworthy – can also become a barrie r in take-up. It can negatively affect parental engagement,
especially in psychological or emotional problems and disability sessions. However, in the latter case,
traditionally high reliance on institutional care and a need to socialize and relieve from duties also
play a role.
FURTHER GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT
Frontline workers are critical agents in providing social and emotional support to children and
their families in the emergency context and require support to cope with the current crisis.124 The
evidence confirms that capacity-building activities for ECD staff that tackled issues related to COVID-
19 content were highly demanded by the participants in the trainings. It also exposed a great need
for creating more opportunities for current and future frontline workers’ professional development.
Therefore, additional efforts are needed to strengthen the capacities of the ECD workforce in areas
that are crucial for relevant, effective, and sustainable ECD preparedness and response to the
emergency.
The main area where improvements are needed to increase staff preparedness is the lack of
sustainable mechanisms to provide continuous supervision and support to ensure the quality of
services. Almost all frontline workers highlighted the significance of a follow-up system that offers
ongoing mentoring and supervision, information, and guidance to provide the proper support and
adapt to pandemic conditions. They also pointed out the need for more networking opportunities
and the exchange of knowledge and experiences with peers and/or other professionals (e.g., through
dedicated platforms). Important areas where frontline workers need more support or felt less
prepared included among others: ● clear methodologies and guidelines for adapting services to
COVID-19 reality (e.g., how to carry out virtual EI services or use necessary devices; how to adapt the
inclusive education to pandemic conditions); ● interaction with other medical and social providers,
and with caregivers; and ● identifying risks associated with parental mental health. Also, an increased
need for mental health support to frontline workers has been reported. The lack of sufficient support
to deal with stress while working under immense and unprecedented pressure puts their well-being
and resilience at risk.
The pandemic accelerated content relevance on (inclusive) education, parenting skills, and
interaction between frontline workers and caregivers in the assessed interventions. Since not all
services can be moved online, parents take additional responsibilities for their child's development,
as COVID-19 has shown. As a result, they become mediators between teachers and children and
indispensable partners in addressing their children. Thus, creating conditions for good relations
between ECD staff and caregivers and providing further support for parenting skills development can
help make the ECD services more resilient in future shocks.
However, the communication between frontline workers and caregivers has been one of the key
challenges of ECD frontline workers before and during the pandemic. Some groups are challenging
to contact and engage with. At the same time, due to the new, challenging context of service
provision, the frontline workers had to change how they work with caregivers and required guidance
on how to do that. For instance, learning how to involve caregivers as partners in ECD services and
increasing family involvement and competencies for supporting their child’s learning and
124 As mentioned earlier, the survey was implemented by UNESCO Bangkok together with UNICEF, ARNEC, ECWI, and ISSA. More

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 73
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
development have become especially relevant during the pandemic. It also responded to the
caregivers’ need for support on organizing daily routines for their children at home and engaging in
their development. For this to succeed, good communication and mutual understanding are key. It
helps build trust between ECD staff and the caregivers community that (altered) services and
parental role in child-support are for a child’s good.
AWARENESS AND ATTITUDES
In addition to already existing reluctance to use ECD services among some caregivers125,
awareness of and attitudes towards pandemic-induced adaptations in service provision can
become an important factor that hampers the effectiveness of the adaptations. This applies
mainly to the caregivers’ reluctance to engage in ECI since the attitudes of many caregivers remain
a crucial challenge for the effective provision of adapted ECD services in circumstances of restricted
face-to-face contact. Caregivers’ heavy reliance on specialists contributes to difficulties involving
families in online sessions or activities to support their child at home. The reasons for this could be
threefold: denying them of a rare opportunity to relax and socialize when their children are at the
facilities receiving professional support; a fear that they are not adequately prepared to carry out
such activities; and a resistance to allowing ECI professionals to “enter” their family life via online
mode of interaction. The new approaches to parental engagement and service provision are also
challenging for frontline workers. For instance, the family-centered approach requiring a new
caregivers’ role is still not well-rooted in professional practice, which still does not recognize the
parental experience in addressing their own child's issues and does not involve parents as partners.
In addition, frontline workers also have reservations about using online and blended models of
service provision and professional development, e.g., due to their quality, effectiveness, and
necessary skills.
UNICEF’S ADAPTABILITY
Adaptability became a decisive factor for rapidly addressing the disruptions caused by the
pandemic. UNICEF’s support contributed to the adaptation of the ECD services by offering quick
adjustments to the various ways child support services were affected by COVID-19. The
adaptations introduced in response to COVID-19 can improve ECD services’ resilience and prepare
them for other challenging situations in the future. However, while they are perceived as highly
valuable in withstanding disruptions, the findings also imply that they are not entirely sufficient. For
instance, reaching out to the most vulnerable groups, which is among key elements of a resilient
system, emerged as a less effective component of the assessed interventions—also, bolstering
frontline workers' skills in certain areas and developing staff support mechanisms (e.g., mentoring,
supervision, networking) emerged as a vital issue for having a well-supported workforce that can
perform under pressure. Without an adequately supported ECD workforce, the capacity to adapt to
shocks is significantly lowered.126
UNICEF’s management of the interventions and focus on activities directed at learning from
COVID-19 represent a good example of an adaptive approach. They also reflect the flexibility and
adaptiveness of UNICEF COs in an emergency situation. This was facilitated by collecting “good
enough” evidence during the emergency to grasp the key needs and respond appropriately. Various
quick feedback collection mechanisms were applied for this purpose that helped to constantly
125 The Key Informants indicated that the skepticism of the Roma children caregivers about structured early learning led
many Roma children to drop out of preschools during the pandemic.

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
monitor the interest in the topics cov ered during the training sessions and make real-time
adjustments, if necessary. Gathering lessons from this experience can help create a pool of solutions
and main steps to be applied in a crisis context and beyond. This would be a simplification in similar
emergencies in the future.
4.2 Lessons learned
The findings and conclusions from this evaluation show that despite its severity, the current crisis
offers an opportunity to learn from the response to COVID-19 and identify aspects that impede its
relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability. In doing so, the following main lessons learned were
distilled from the assessed interventions and proposed for consideration in future ECA RO actions:
Lesson learned # 1
The longstanding collaboration between UNICEF, line ministries, civil society actors, and donors
makes UNICEF and its partners better equipped to cope with the unprecedented context and
contributes to organizational resilience. Such a collaborative approach was among the main
factors that contributed to achieving positive interventions’ results. Strong involvement of
governmental and/or local actors in all evaluated interventions created better prospects for their
sustainability and opportunities for the interventions to have stronger and broader effects. The
pandemic also revealed the importance of the UNICEF convening role that helped connect the work
of key ECD stakeholders from various sectors, which facilitated the provision of quick and well-
adjusted response. The COVID-19 experience is a good testing ground for developing fast-track
procedures with key stakeholders to ensure that the response to a similar health crisis is available
quickly and targets the highest needs.
Lesson learned # 2
Designated strategies to ensure the inclusion of the most vulnerable groups are needed when
using ICT solutions to deliver ECD services and information to young children and their families.
The evaluation showed a high risk of excluding the most vulnerable groups when using online
modalities to provide ECD services. Specifically, children and their caregivers from low-income
households are likely to fall through the cracks of such interventions. Therefore, ICT solutions must go
hand-in-hand with investments that enhance access to digital infrastructure and equipment for
disadvantaged young children and their families. Access to devices such as computers,
smartphones, printers, and reliable Internet for the providers of the services needs also to be secured.
Meanwhile, interventions that rely on ICT solutions should be complemented with other forms of
support accessible for the vulnerable groups, such as printed materials with easy-to-understand
infographics or television/radio campaigns. Direct outreach through offline information campaigns
remains the only effective approach to address the needs of some vulnerable groups, and specific
channels of information dissemination are needed to reach them.
Lesson learned # 3
Comprehensive information and methodological and mental health support for caregivers are
essential to provide effective remote ECD support to young children and their families. In the face
of the pandemic, caregivers had to assume much of the responsibility for their children’s learning,
including implementing ECI and organizing structured learning activities at home. As the evaluation
showed, however, in addition to struggling to balance their domestic and professional
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 75
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
responsibilities, caregivers in the ECA cou ntries are often unprepared to do so. This is true, especially
for the most vulnerable groups, such as families with children with disabilities and Roma families.
Comprehensive support for caregivers is needed to equip parents with the skills and confidence to
engage in support of their children’s learning and development at home. Programmes to support
parental well-being and mental health and efforts to increase awareness of modern ECD practices
are thus required, considering the time constraints faced by caregivers when engaging with their
children at home. Yet, to be effective, they should be coupled with other forms of support reducing
the sources of stress, e.g., related to meeting the basic family needs or accessing social and health
assistance programmes.
Lesson learned # 4
Delivering capacity-building activities entirely online should be opted for only when face-to-face
contact is impossible, and hybrid mode should be preferred otherwise. The evaluation revealed
that although online courses, training, and mentoring allow reaching out to large numbers of
professionals, they do not allow for sufficient spontaneous interaction and level of engagement of
the participants. Online capacity-building events in larger groups should always be accompanied
by small group mentoring or discussions. The combination of self-paced online modules (giving
flexibility) with mentoring groups (giving opportunities for interactions) can also be an attractive
option. The collection of the most promising practices in this aspect, implemented during COVID-19,
and sharing them among ECD key stakeholders is a good starting point. However, if the
epidemiological conditions allow, some parts of similar trainings may be delivered offline to enable
learning based on practical simulations, networking, and spontaneous exchanges.
Lesson learned # 5
The COVID-19 crisis magnified the value of rapid-learning to adapt the support and service
delivery to the emergency context. Therefore, a quick collection of the best available knowledge is
essential to trace the changing pandemic context, determine what works for whom in which contexts,
and modify the response based on emerging findings. For this, mechanisms that facilitate recurring
peer learning and stocktaking activities should be inherent organizational components that reduce
isolation to address unpredictable and complex situations. They offer space to share experiences on
the advantages and weaknesses of applied solutions and think beyond a “one-time intervention”
approach. In the longer term, they build an evidence base for rethinking and updating ECD strategies
and reducing the potential for failures in the future, which contributes to more resilient service
provision.
4.3 Recommendations
The next set of recommendations directed to the ECA Regional Office was developed based on the
summary of the findings from the Country Reports for the four in-depth case study countries in this
evaluation and a summary of the key challenges for UNICEF ECD response (Section 4.1) presented
during the workshop with UNICEF representatives from RO and COs from the ECA region.
The following actions are recommended for UNICEF ECA Regional Office to improve UNICEF ECD
response:
SYSTEMIC BOTTLENECKS
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 76
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
Beyond the immediate needs created by the pandemic, the outbreak of the global health crisis
exposed and aggravated some significant shortcomings in the ECD service provision. The
recommended actions to address the main challenges identified in this evaluation include:
o Continue supporting COs to enhance their overall ECD system strengthening efforts to
ensure the effectiveness of the response provided during COVID-19 and other emergencies.
This includes: ● re-assessing the availability and quality of ECD service provision, including the
impeding factors; ● focusing programming on improving: ECD-related policies, availability of
funding, staff capacity, data collection systems.
o Support COs to promote the sustainable implementation of remote modalities in service
provision and capacity building of practitioners in ECI, health, and ECE through the
development of regional assets and guidance, the establishment of a repository of relevant
documents and good practices, and facilitating horizontal knowledge sharing related to: ●
existing state guidance on remote service provision, ● legislation, ● funding
arrangements/investments in digital transformation, ● protection of personal data, ●
technological solutions, and ● skill building. Support the use of digital technologies in existing
ECI programmes and adjust them to the individual needs of children with SEN, based on
successful experiences from similar efforts.
o Provide technical support to COs for development of national models of coordinated, family-
centered ECI policies including: ● development of guidelines for a holistic, family-centered EI
provision; ● improving interagency cooperation between social, medical, and educational
services; ● sufficient budgetary allocation for ECI services.
o Leverage partnerships at the regional level to expand advocacy, capacity building, and
technical support to COs for building national models of family-centered ECI systems.
THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS AND THEIR NEEDS
Reaching out to and maintaining regular support and contact with disadvantaged families is
essential during an emergency. To achieve this, the following recommendation is proposed based
on the evaluation findings:
o Support UNICEF COs to develop monitoring and reporting systems and programmes
(including data collection solutions) to gather up-to-date knowledge on the situation of
vulnerable groups and their specific needs, including developmental and socio-emotional-
related needs in various epidemiological scenarios. ● Encourage the use of methodologically
sound pre- and post-training/intervention assessment approaches to collect “good enough”
evidence in emergency situations. ● Increase efforts to evidence and understand the impact of
the pandemic on women and men, including through systematic collection and analysis of
sex-disaggregated data and the engagement with advocacy groups and regional partners.
o Encourage governments, CSOs, and other partners to develop and implement solutions that
ensure data on the most vulnerable groups of children during pandemics. ● Include
provisions in Programme Cooperation Agreements (PCAs) with CSOs or other partners that can
be activated in emergencies to allow them to promptly engage in conducting a rapid
assessment of the status and needs of the most vulnerable groups.
o Maintain diversity of partnerships and work collaboratively at the country and regional level
with CSOs, authorities, and donors. They have deep knowledge of local contexts and reach

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
the most vulnerable groups. Jointl y: ● design child-sensitive and gender-sensitive emergency
preparedness and responses programs that prioritize services and support for the most
vulnerable children and families; ● identify and support the scale-up of the most effective
COVID-19 responses for addressing the needs of the most vulnerable children and families; ●
identify the best ways to mobilize resources to provide them with targeted and relevant support
in the emergency context. ● Advocate for combining direct outreach strategies with remote
support to assist the most vulnerable groups.
DISTANT MODE OF SERVICE DELIVERY
While switching to remote or online mode of delivery helped to continue service provision during the
pandemic, families with young children and ECD staff faced various challenges to benefit from such
modification fully. To improve remote ECD service delivery, it is recommended to:
o Support COs to advocate for and support revision of plans and strategies on remote ECD
service provision in line with the lessons learned from COVID-19 experiences. Focus on: ●
ensuring that the most vulnerable groups have access to remote services; ● ensuring that the
key constraints faced by frontline workers, caregivers, and young children are addressed; ●
rolling out of successful digitalization practices for meaningful participation of preschool
children, professionals, and parents in online learning ● ensuring diverse and accessible
(nondigital) formats are available when access to online services is not possible; ● quality
assurance and monitoring.
o Advocate for and support the revision of competency frameworks for ECD staff to include
digital skills and digital provision of services. ● Call for strengthening digital literacy skills and
the use of new technologies (including for training, supervision, peer support, and service
delivery) through pre- and in-service professional development programs.
FURTHER GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT
The lack of sustainable continuous professional development of the ECD workforce to prepare them
for public health emergencies, such as COVID-19, is a significant obstacle to building resilient and
sustainable ECD systems. To support capacity-building of frontline workers, it is recommended to:
o Develop technical resources and tools and facilitate knowledge sharing to support COs' work
toward establishing effective national systems for continuous pre- and in-service
professional development of a qualified ECD workforce. ● Recommend and support building
systems that i) strengthen competencies in inclusive early childhood education; ii) integrate
sustainable forms of mentoring and supervision; and iii) integrate COVID-19, mental well-being,
communication skills, and gender-related content in the training curricula.
o Establish online platform/s with core training packages in national languages for self-paced
online trainings in the area of ECD during COVID-19 or other similar emergencies. Focus on: ●
inclusive education, ● ECI, ● home visiting, ● maternal and child health, ● play-based
approaches and parenting support.
AWARENESS AND ATTITUDES
The caregivers’ awareness and attitudes towards ECD in the pandemic conditions and beyond are
crucial for their engagement in supporting their child’s cognitive and emotional development.
Therefore, it is recommended to:
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 78
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT
o Support COs to develop long-term strategies to address social attitudes and norms, parental
knowledge, and skills that affect the demand for quality ECD services and parental ability to
engage in developmentally stimulative practices with their children and provide optimal care.
● Devote particular attention to ECI and inclusive education (e.g., early learning and early
intervention).
o Partner with parental and other CSOs in the ECD area at the regional level to: ● develop and
implement joint awareness-raising campaigns targeting families with young children on
issues related to positive parenting and well-being in challenging situations; ● support parental
advocacy activities.
