Executive Summary
1. This report summarizes results of the final evaluation of a three-year (2018-2021)
Adolescent Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) Intervention that UNICEF, the Ministry of Health’s
Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS (DNHA) and Reproductive Health Unit (RHU),
Ministry of Education (MoE) and their partners implemented with US$250,000 support
from the Global Thematic Funds through the Netherlands grant. This funding, when
provided in 2018, targeted 12 per cent of adolescent girls 10-19 years in Salima,
Dedza and Mangochi districts, which translated to 35,000 girls - 24,500 in school and
10,500 out of school. In line with Article 24 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child
(CRC), the goal was to prove the concept of whether anaemia as high as 35.3 per
cent in Malawian adolescent girls can be reduced by complementing diversified diets
with IFA supplementation and deworming. Salima, Dedza and Mangochi were
selected because they were the core of the problem and were part of the first six
districts (others were Lilongwe, Machinga and Dowa), which piloted the IFA
supplementation in 2019, with resources from the Department for International
Development (DFID).
2. Key activities of the Netherlands-funded Adolescent IFA Intervention in Malawi were
the provision of weekly IFA tablets to adolescent girls in and out of school, deworming
with albendazole biannually and nutrition education with emphasis on the Malawi six
food groups to improve diets and intake of iron. School Health and Nutrition (SHN)
teachers and Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) were the ones administering
tablets in schools and communities respectively.
3. The evaluation assessed the intervention using 18 key evaluation questions
formulated based on the standard Development Assistance Committee (DAC)
evaluation criteria of coherence, efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability. It
integrated human rights, gender and equity under each evaluation criterion and
question in the data collection tools. Field work took place between 11th and 24th
February 2022 in all the three targeted districts.
4. Quantitative and qualitative data, both primary and secondary, came from:
▪ A review of key documents, including the project proposal, situation analysis
report, minutes of review meetings and various policies among others.
▪ A survey of 662 adolescent girls in and out of school.
▪ An anthropometric survey of 662 girls to assess their nutritional status.
▪ A total of 14 focus group discussions (FGDs) across the districts.
▪ 58 key informant interviews (KIIs) with Principal Nutrition, HIV and AIDS Officer
(PNHAOs), District Nutrition Officers (DNOs), SHN coordinators and teachers,
head teachers, district pharmacists, HSAs, community health nurses (CHN), and
staff from UNICEF and its government partners.
5. A multi-stage cluster sampling, involving purposive, stratified and random sampling,
was used to select 20 schools for the evaluation. The plan was to select and interview
4 girls in each of the eligible classes (standard 4-8), making a total of 20 per school.
Girls out of school were stratified by age (corresponding to classes they would have
xi
been in) and selected from each stratum using random sampling to participate in the
study. Girls remaining in the strata participated in focus group discussions (FGDs) and
other Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) sessions to triangulate the findings.
6. The intended users of the evaluation include the Government of Malawi (GoM), line
Ministries of Health, Education and Youth, concerned district assemblies, country and
regional offices of UNICEF, UN agencies implementing the JPGE programme (WFP
and UNFPA), the Netherlands Government as the donor and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) involved in health and nutrition programming in the country.
7. Key findings from the evaluation are summarized below in accordance with the DAC
criteria that was used.
8. Evaluation criterion 1 – Coherence: In Malawi, the Netherlands-supported IFA pilot
intervention is the first of its kind. The intervention was implemented in districts where
the need was greatest, evidenced by high rates of anaemia in women of reproductive
age (WRA) 15-49 years.
9. Evaluation Criterion 2 – Efficiency: Efficiency of the Adolescent IFA Intervention
was assessed to be highly satisfactory. Between 2018 and 2021, the intervention has
invested US$ 59,332 to procure 182,000 blisters of Iron 60mg (as Ferrous Fumarate
185mg) and Folic Acid 400mcg Remodia-Chypre and provided 52 tablets per girl in a
year. Every girl received 26 blisters in the whole year, each with 10 tablets and had to
take 1 tablet per week. Compliance, defined as adhering to a weekly regimen, as
reported by adolescent girls themselves, was high at 79 per cent because they were
taking tablets in the presence of SHN teachers, HSAs and parents, if at home.
10. Evaluation Criterion 3 – Effectiveness: A study on anaemia is scheduled to be
conducted later in 2022 by the Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS)
commissioned by the National Statistical Office (NSO). However, trends from other
countries that have implemented similar interventions show significant reductions of
anaemia among adolescent girls only in 8 to 14 weeks of IFA supplementation for
example, from 49 to 5 per cent in Tanzania, 20 to 5.7 per cent in Indonesia, 70.1 to
13.4 per cent in Nepal and 29.8 to 0 per cent in Thailand. The impact of the Adolescent
IFA Intervention on reduction of anaemia in Malawi is therefore anticipated to be huge.
11. Descriptive analysis of anthropometric data shows that the prevalence of underweight
(defined as Body Mass Index, BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) in adolescent girls 10-19 years old
has decreased from 12.9 per cent reported by the MDHS of 2015/2016 to 10.4 per
cent in February 2022 when field work for this evaluation took place. In younger girls,
10-14 years, underweight prevalence has declined by 4.1 percentage points from 21
per cent to 16.9 per cent, as reported by MDHS. When compared to the prevalence
reported by the situation analysis study that was conducted to establish baseline
information for the six pilot districts, the decrease is much higher at 20.3 percentage
points in Salima, Dedza and Mangochi from 30.7 per cent to 10.4 per cent on average.
xii
12. Between 2010 and 2016, the prevalence of underweight and thinness deteriorated in
Malawi, with underweight rising from 14 per cent to 21 per cent and thinness from 2
per cent to 8 per cent among adolescent girls aged 6-12 years old for which data is
available. These figures mean that underweight prevalence increased by 50 per cent
and thinness by 300 per cent. By implication, reductions observed in this evaluation
represent the beginning of positive trends that need to be nurtured and scaled up.
13. Through community radios, community sensitization and door to door campaigns,
available data by the Story Workshop Educational Trust (SWET) show that the project
has managed to reach 54,826 adolescents (32, 354 girls and 22,472 boys) with
messages of IFA supplementation and diets. Adolescents have also been receiving
nutrition education, particularly on the Malawi six food groups from SHN teachers and
HSAs in schools and communities.
14. More than half (51.4%) of the adolescent girls surveyed in this evaluation reported to
have attended nutrition education classes. In-school girls were more likely to have
attended a nutrition class (54.3%) compared to out-of-school girls (40.3%).
15. As a result of these efforts, adolescent girls and boys consistently demonstrated
knowledge of the Malawi six food groups’ model, including recognition of the individual
groups, and the foods contained therein. Nearly two-thirds of them (65.5% - 67% in-
school and 60% out-of-school) were able to name all six food groups in the model
diagram when displayed in front of them during interviews.
16. In the 24-hour dietary diversity survey conducted, 68.4 per cent of the girls reported
to have consumed various meat and meat products compared to 47 per cent reported
by the situation analysis study three years ago. Consumption of dark green leafy
vegetables, which are also a good source of iron, has increased as well from 89.5 per
cent to almost 100 per cent (99.1%), legumes from 49 to 50.9 per cent and fats and
oils from 70 per cent to 87.9 per cent. Vegetables were abundant during the time of
the evaluation due to the rains and with the acquired nutrition knowledge adolescent
girls consumed them regularly as part of their diet.
17. From 2018 to 2019, the intervention trained 1,810 government frontline workers (665
SHN and head teachers and 1,145 HSAs) in areas of supply, administration,
management and IFA supplementation as reported by district staff. Teachers can now
administer IFA tablets to pupils competently which will continue to reduce workload
for HSAs and increase coverage of the intervention. Interviews conducted showed
that HSAs and SHN teachers are able to order supplies from district pharmacy stores,
manage them and provide reports for compliance with minimal supervision, which are
all indicators of ownership necessary for long-term sustainability of the intervention.
18. Besides IFA supplementation, close to three quarters of all adolescent girls (65.2%)
interviewed indicated to have received albendazole tablets within the last 12 months.
A total of 98 per cent of these girls ingested the tablets, with the majority in Mangochi
(36.7%) and girls in school at 81.4 per cent, taking them twice (mean=1.53) on
average. Interviews with health workers in all the three districts revealed that the
Adolescent IFA Intervention did not provide any albendazole to the schools and health
centres to deworm girls. Albendazole was provided as part of the Bilharzia program
by the district hospitals to deworm masses.
19. Gender and Human Rights: By implementing these activities, the Adolescent IFA
Intervention in Malawi has upheld rights to health, nutrition and education, including
xiii
but not limited to those outlined in the CRC, not only for adolescent girls in and out of
school, but also boys who are sometimes left out by humanitarian and development
projects. The intervention made deliberate efforts to train both female and male
frontline workers to ensure equity and inclusiveness in capacity building and service
delivery, which has resulted in tangible results registered.
20. Challenges faced: Despite numerous successes registered, the Adolescent IFA
Intervention faced many challenges during the three years of its implementation. The
main challenge was addressing misconceptions as IFA tablets were perceived as
either family planning pills to curtail population growth, COVID-19 vaccination or the
medication for cancer in Salima. This is likely to continue if no mass awareness is
conducted within communities, local leaders, parents and girls in the future. The other
challenges were related to the COVID-19 pandemic (hence the misconception above)
and frequent political violence during the disputed presidential elections in Malawi.
Project officers worked remotely for a good part of 2020 in fear of the consequences.
Activities that were intended to be implemented during this period were interrupted.
The aforementioned delays affected the project’s impact.
21. The following are the key recommendations for the Ministry of Health (DNHA and
RHU), Ministry of Education (MoE), Ministry of Youth (MoY), UNICEF and the
concerned districts - to be implemented by December 2023:
1) UNICEF, as one of the agencies championing the sector, should leverage on the
existing projects and scale up IFA supplementation to additional four of the
remaining eight districts in the country (namely Ntchisi, Nkhotakota, Nkhata Bay,
Mzimba, Karonga, Balaka and Mulanje) by the end of 2023.
2) DNHA and RHU, MoE, MoY, UNICEF and concerned district councils should
address the existing misconceptions surrounding IFA supplementation to increase
acceptance and compliance.
3) Train 4 SHN teachers at each school from standard 4 to 8 to reduce the access
work load and interruption of classes during IFA days.
4) Collaborate with the World Health Organization (WHO) and explore the possibility
of leveraging resources and efforts around procurement and distribution of
albendazole for the Adolescent IFA Intervention.
5) Provide adequate fuel (at least 130 litres per quarter) to each district to allow district
teams carry out joint monitoring and supervision of activities.
6) Provide resources and introduce quarterly review meetings for the district teams
to look at the district performance, identify bottlenecks on time, and plan for
activities for the next quarter.
7) Improve the collection of IFA compliance data. Train data entry clerks already
available at district hospitals to enter the data into the District Health Information
System (DHIS2).
8) Provide clear roles to address current tensions between PNHAOs and DNOs.
9) Integrate the IFA supplement supply chain within the Ministry of Health (MoH) and
Central Medical Store Trust (CMST) system to strengthen capacity and
sustainability. Table 17 at the end of this report provides a summary of specific
recommendations, implementers and the timeframe required.

1.0 Introduction
1. In 2018, UNICEF Malawi Country Office received US$250,000 from the Global
Thematic Funds (GTF) through the Netherlands grant to pilot a 3-year (2018-2021)
programme as a proof of concept for the efficacy of iron and folic acid (IFA)
supplementation in reducing anaemia and other forms of undernutrition in adolescent
girls, 10-19 years of age. Despite a decrease among children under five,
undernutrition remains high in Malawian adolescents. The Malawi Demographic and
Health Survey (MDHS) of 2015/2016 reported that 12.9 per cent of adolescent girls
15-19 years of age are underweight, after registering a low BMI of <18.5 kg/m2,
compared to 5.7 per cent women of 20-49 years of age because nutrition interventions
are not adequately accessible for adolescent girls.
2. The prevalence of anaemia among adolescent girls (15-19 years) in Malawi is at 35.3
per cent, overweight 7.1 per cent and obesity, which increases the risk of nutrition-
related diseases (heart diseases, stroke, diabetes and cancer) is at 12 per cent, as
reported by the MDHS of 2015/2016. Between 2004 and 2010 rates of anaemia
dropped by 13 percentage points from 42.4 per cent to 28.6 per cent, but these gains
were reversed, and the prevalence increased by 6 percentage points to 35.3 per cent
in 2015/2016 (Figures 1 and 2).

3. Anaemia is a condition in which the number and size of red blood cells, or the
haemoglobin concentration, falls below an established cut-off value, consequently
impairing the capacity of the blood to transport oxygen around the body. Anaemia is
an indicator of both poor nutrition and poor health. The most common cause of
anaemia worldwide is iron deficiency, resulting from prolonged negative iron balance,
caused by inadequate dietary iron intake or absorption, increased needs for iron
1
during pregnancy or growth periods,
and increased iron losses as a result
of menstruation and helminth
(intestinal worms) infestation. In
women, an estimated 50% of anaemia
worldwide is due to iron deficiency.
4. Other important causes of
anaemia include infections, other
nutritional deficiencies (especially
folate and vitamins B12, A and C) and
genetic conditions, including sickle
cell disease, thalassaemia - an
inherited blood disorder- and chronic
inflammation. Pregnant adolescents
are particularly vulnerable to anaemia
because they have dual iron
requirements, for their own growth
and the growth of the foetus, and are
less likely to access antenatal care.
5. The map to the left shows
anaemia rates in women of
reproductive age, 15-49 years, in
Malawi as reported by the MDHS of
2015/2016. It also illustrates the first
six pilot districts and the three districts
where UNICEF has pre-tested the IFA
intervention as a proof of concept with support from the Global Thematic Funds (GTF).
1.1 Rationale for Adolescent Nutrition
6. Anaemia is of public health concern in Malawi. In women, especially during
pregnancy, anaemia is associated with premature births, low birth weight babies, still
births, miscarriages, death of the baby and/or the mother during or after delivery. In
both adolescent boys and girls, anaemia limits concentration in daily tasks, may
contribute to high school dropout, and reduces physical fitness and work productivity.
Periodic blood loss through menstruation for the adolescent girl imposes additional
need for iron and other essential nutrients, and can contribute to anaemia. Anaemic
girls have lower pre-pregnancy iron stores, and the pregnancy period is too short to
build iron stores for the growing foetus and mother.
2
7. Adolescence is an appropriate time for interventions to address anaemia as it is a time
for rapid growth and development, and a critical time for laying the nutrition foundation
for childbearing. Providing Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) supplements during adolescence,
continuing into adulthood, improves iron status and reduces the risk of developing iron
deficiency and anaemia.
8. In addition, adolescence is a critical stage when knowledge and attitudes about
nutrition are still forming and as such behaviour changes may create a positive and
long-lasting impact with respect to prevention of adult malnutrition and long-term
communicable diseases. Improving nutrition during adolescence can also help
individuals who have had a challenging childhood with respect to their physical growth
and cognitive development. Interventions for adolescents will in this regard help
ensure young women enter pregnancy with knowledge and nutrition support.
9. Global evidence shows that investing in adolescent nutrition yields four dividends: (1)
it improves the present nutritional status of the adolescents, (2) it improves the well-
being and productivity in their adult life, (3) it reduces nutrition and health risks of their
children and (4) it breaks the vicious intergenerational cycle of malnutrition and the
multiple problems associated with it.
10. As per the WHO threshold for nutritional deficiencies, intermittent iron and folic acid
supplementation is recommended if anaemia prevalence is 20 per cent or higher
among non-pregnant women of reproductive age (15-49 years). Under this context,
the Government of Malawi has prioritized implementation of multi-sectoral
interventions to address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls 10-19 years of age,
including the use of IFA supplementation to address the problem of anaemia.
1.2 Adolescent IFA Intervention in Malawi
11. In 2018, UNICEF Malawi became the first country in the Eastern and Southern Africa
Region (ESAR) to support the government to pilot IFA supplementation and prevent
anaemia among adolescent girls. UNICEF Malawi Country Office championed
resource mobilization and received US$250,000 from the Global Thematic Funds
(GTF) through the Netherlands government, which was used to fund the intervention.
This funding targeted adolescent girls and boys in where the Government of Malawi
was already implementing the UN Joint Programme on Girls Education (JPGE II).
The efforts were consolidated with technical support from UNICEF and its partners,
World Food Programme (WFP) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The
IFA intervention was implemented in the existing schools and health facilities across
three districts - Mangochi, Salima and Dedza. These districts were part of the first six
districts (Mangochi, Salima, Dedza, Lilongwe, Machinga and Dowa) that piloted the
adolescent IFA supplementation in 2019 with funding from the Department for
International Development (DFID).
3
12. Overall goal of the Adolescent IFA Intervention: To improve nutritional status of
adolescents, with a focus on school going and out-of-school adolescent girls aged
10-19 years in Mangochi, Salima and Dedza districts, by 2021.
13. Specific objectives to achieve the goal were:
i) To promote consumption of diversified diets using the Malawi six food groups
approach among 70 per cent of adolescent boys and girls aged 10-19 years.
ii) To standardise integration of weekly IFA supplements in the Ministry of Health
supply chain.
iii) To promote compliance of IFA supplements and deworming tablets in 70 per cent
of school going and 60 per cent out-of-school adolescent girls.
iv) To create an enabling environment for effective implementation of adolescent
nutrition intervention in Malawi.
14. Population Coverage: The intervention targeted 35,000 adolescent girls (24,500 in
school and 10,500 out-of-school) and 34,462 boys aged 10-19 years. These figures
represent 12 per cent of adolescent girls and boys in the districts. Administratively,
every district in Malawi is divided into Traditional Authorities (TAs), which are sub-
divided into Group Village Headman (GVH) areas and then villages as the smallest
administrative units. The intervention was implemented in 764 schools, 99
communities and 32 TAs (Table 1) as reported by District Nutrition Officers (DNOs)
and Principal Nutrition, HIV and AIDS Officers (PNHAOs).

1.3 Activities of the Adolescent IFA Intervention
a) Weekly IFA supplementation for adolescent girls
15. Adolescent girls registered in this intervention received tablets containing 60mg
elemental iron and 400ug folic acid weekly, on Wednesdays. Adolescent girls absent
from school on these days were given their weekly tablets on the next day that they
attended classes. Stocks were kept in the head teachers’ offices. School Health and
Nutrition (SHN) teachers administered tablets to girls at schools and recorded it in
compliance cards immediately. SHN teachers gave girls a complete set of IFA tablet
blisters to take at home during holidays under direct supervision of their parents. Girls
4
living close to health facilities received their tablets from HSAs or community health
nurses (CHN) during holidays along with girls out of school.

acid tablets used in the project
b) Deworming among girls
16. Another activity of the Adolescent IFA Intervention was deworming of the girls by
providing them with 400mg of albendazole. Deworming reduces blood loss and
prevents anaemia. Periodic mass deworming protects communities by removing or
reducing the worm burden and decreasing the risk of new individuals becoming
infected. In Malawi, deworming is carried out with albendazole tablets supplied by the
World Health Organization (WHO) biannually.
c) Nutrition Education
17. The intervention also offered nutrition education to both girls and boys to increase
consumption of diversified diets, rich in iron and other micronutrients, based on the
Malawi six food groups.
1.4 Partnerships in the Adolescent IFA Intervention
18. Key stakeholders were the Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS (DNHA), which was
responsible for coordinating activities of the intervention across the three districts, and
the Reproductive Health Unit (RHU). The RHU was facilitating integration of IFA into
the medical supply system by the Ministry of Health (MoH).
5
19. Additional partners included the Department of School Health, Nutrition, HIV and AIDS
in the Ministry of Education, the Department of Community Nursing and District Health
Offices (DHOs) in the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Youth. These ministries
provided key frontline workers to conduct various project activities. UNICEF also had
an NGO implementing partner, the Story Workshop Educational Trust (SWET), which
promoted Social Behaviour Change and Communication (SBCC). Figure 3 presents
relationships among these partners. Annex 1 provides further details about their roles.
Figure 3: Stakeholder mapping and relationships in the intervention
1.5 Reporting Channels
20. Reporting lines were clear and followed the opposite channel for the supply of IFA
tablets. School Health and Nutrition (SHN) teachers prepared monthly reports and
submitted them to health facilities when they collected tablets for their schools. Health
facilities in turn sent the reports together with theirs to the district hospital. The
Assistant Environment Health Officer (AEHO) validated the reports before sharing
them with the DNO for compilation and submission to DNHA.

2.0 Evaluation Type, Purpose and Specific Objectives
22. This was an end of project evaluation to assess coherence, efficiency, effectiveness
and sustainability of the Adolescent IFA Intervention after three years of its
implementation. Key questions included: 1) has the Netherlands-funded Adolescent
IFA Intervention succeeded in achieving its desired results? and 2) whether the
intervention was able to improve nutritional status of adolescents, with a focus on
school going and out-of-school adolescent girls aged 10-19 years in the three pilot
districts by 2021.
7
2.1 Specific objectives (SO) of the evaluation
23. The specific objectives of the evaluation are as follows:
i) Assess the extent to which context factors were considered in the design of the
intervention and if they were coherent with policies and programmes of other
partners operating in the same districts.
ii) Evaluate the extent to which the intervention was implemented in the cost-efficient
manner in the targeted schools and communities.
iii) Propose a Theory of Change (ToC) in consultation with all key stakeholders.
iv) Evaluate effectiveness of the intervention in producing expected results for
adolescent girls and boys, service providers, parents and community leaders.
v) Evaluate outcomes and the extent to which the intervention has contributed to
improving compliance with IFA intake.
vi) Evaluate the extent to which the intervention promoted social behavioural change
towards intake of diversified foods, including iron rich foods among adolescents.
vii) Document lessons, key challenges, gaps, strengths and good practices.
2.2 Scope of Work
24. The evaluation covered the whole period of the intervention from 2018 to December
2021 and was conducted in all the three targeted districts. It interviewed and
measured adolescent girls 10-19 years of age as primary beneficiaries. Boys received
nutrition education in the project and participated in focus group discussion (FGDs).
Schools, communities, key persons and various groups of people were consulted as
well to obtain first-hand information and perceptions regarding the intervention.
25. Areas not covered: The evaluation did not include the relevance criterion because
anaemia rates in non-pregnant women of reproductive age (15-49 years) are above
20 per cent in almost every district as reported by the MDHS of 2015/2016, therefore
intermittent IFA supplementation is needed. In addition, the evaluation did not assess
rates of anaemia as this is already scheduled to be conducted by the forthcoming
MDHS of 2022/23 by the National Statistical Office (NSO).
2.3 Main users of the evaluation
26. Primary users of the evaluation are the Government of Malawi (GoM), country and
regional offices of UNICEF and the targeted schools and communities. Line Ministries
of Health, Education and Youth, and UNICEF can use the findings to understand the
extent to which the intervention has (a) proved that IFA supplementation can work in
Malawi and (b) generated useful lessons to guide future programming. UN agencies
implementing the JPGE programme (WFP and UNFPA) that have been providing
support throughout and UNICEF as a recipient of the grant are particularly interested
in the overall performance, efficiency and effectiveness of such an intervention in the
local context of Malawi and sharing of the results with the regional office (ESAR) and
other UN agencies to enhance learning.
27. District assemblies and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) working on nutrition are
interested in the impact and benefits of the intervention to adolescent girls with respect
to improving nutritional status.
8
28. On the other hand, the current and prospective donors - the GTF, Netherlands
government and World Bank, have a key interest regarding the accountability, value
for money and worth of continuing to provide funding for adolescent nutrition in the
country.
3.0 Evaluation Criteria and Key Evaluation Questions
29. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s DAC (Development
Assistance Committee) criteria of efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability
(OECD/DAC, 2019) were used to assess the intervention. Another criterion assessed
in the evaluation was gender equality and human and child rights, specifically the right
to the highest attainable standard of health (article 24 of the CRC) as defined in Table
2.
30. The ToRs listed the main questions to be considered under each evaluation criterion.
The evaluation team reviewed these questions during the inception phase and
developed a matrix for the evaluation. The matrix (Annex 2) presents the evaluation
criteria, definitions of each criterion, questions asked, tasks performed to respond to
each question, main sources of information as well as data collection methods and
data availability. The main evaluation questions were accepted as proposed in the
Terms of Reference (Annex 3), with a few questions added by the evaluation team.

5.2 Has the intervention contributed to equitable participation/reach and benefits to
various groups (boys, girls and people with disabilities)?
4.0 Methodological Design and Approach
33. A mixed methods and participatory approach to collecting quantitative and qualitative
data was used to ensure that voices of all stakeholders were taken into account and
findings were verified. The evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations
were formulated with the aim of guiding future policy and programming by the
Government of Malawi (GoM), in particular Ministry of Health (DNHA and RHU),
Ministry of Education, Ministry of Youth, UNICEF and other key partners.
34. Prior to data collection, the evaluators and UNICEF held a number of virtual meetings
to streamline the design and activities for the intervention, beneficiary targeting, scope
of work, data needs and sampling issues. The design of the evaluation incorporated
several elements agreed during these meetings and followed guidelines, norms and
standards of the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG).
35. Data for the evaluation was obtained from the following sources:
i. A review of the key documents such as the project proposal, situation analysis
report, minutes of review meetings and various policies
ii. A survey of 662 adolescent girls in and out of school
iii. An anthropometric survey of 662 girls to assess nutritional status
iv. A total of 14 FGDs with groups of interest (see annex 5)
v. 58 key informant interviews (KIIs) with PNHAOs, DNOs, SHN coordinators and
teachers, head teachers, district pharmacists, HSAs, community health nurses
(CHN), and staff from UNICEF, SWET and government partners (Annex 5).
36. In the adolescent girls’ survey, the evaluation adapted the English questionnaire used
by the situation analysis study to make comparisons easy and uploaded it into ODK
to minimize errors and ensure quality of the final dataset. The questionnaire was
translated and back translated into vernacular Chichewa to avoid misunderstanding
and misinterpretation of the questions by enumerators and respondents. It included
11
questions on IFA supplementation, deworming with albendazole, nutrition education,
access to diversified diets based on the Malawi six food groups, knowledge, attitude
and consumption of iron rich foods and an anthropometric form.
37. Disability Inclusion: In-line with international best practice, the adolescent survey
included the Washington Group Questions Short Set1 to determine the disability status
of individual respondents. Research assistants were provided training for
administering the questions in accordance with guidelines provided by the Washington
Group therefore, the findings have been disaggregated by disability status to provide
further insight into reach and benefits experienced by adolescent girls with disabilities.
4.1 Recruitment and Training of Research Assistants
38. A total of 10 enumerators were recruited and trained for 4 days from 7th-9th February,
2022 at the Ministry of Gender’s Adult Literacy and Education Centre in Lilongwe to
ensure they understood the questionnaire and could administer it uniformly. They
included three interns from UNICEF as part of capacity building.
39. The training was based on the following components:
i. Going through the paper version of the survey tool question wise, to ensure
that the enumerators were well-acquainted with it.
ii. Role plays by research assistants depicting the actual interview scenario with
adolescent girls.
iii. Training on ODK version of the survey questionnaire.
iv. Orientation on the evaluation methodology, roles of the evaluation team
members, work performance expected, ethics in data collection and the field
protocol – how to sample schools and health facilities and get consent from
gate keepers, like teachers and parents, and girls sampled as respondents.
40. On the 4th day of the training (10th February, 2022), the evaluation team pre-tested the
methodology and tools in TAs Maganga and Kambwiri of Salima. Each enumerator
completed at least two surveys. This exercise helped them (a) get familiarized with
the electronic questionnaire, (b) practice the methodology and (c) identify glitches,
lack of clarity, and misleading/difficult-to-comprehend questions. The survey team
held a de-briefing session after the pre-testing exercise and addressed minor
problems faced with the methodology and the use of ODK questionnaires. The pre-
test sample was not included in the actual sample for the survey because it was for
learning purposes.
41. UNICEF staff provided backstopping services throughout the training. They oriented
the evaluation team on the child safeguarding and protection policy. Towards the end
of the orientation, the whole team signed a copy of the policy to show their commitment
to abide by it.

4.2 Sample Size Determination
42. A rapid formative Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviour and Practices situation analysis
that served as the baseline for this project sampled a total of 513 adolescent girls in
the 6 pilot districts. For this evaluation, the sample size of adolescent girls was
increased to 840 to easily disaggregate and generalize the results by district, category
of girls (in and out of school) and age group (10-14 and 15-19 years old).
43. The sample size was calculated using the USAID’s FANTA sampling guidelines by
Robert Magnani (1997) for cross sectional studies and was based on 95 per cent
confidence level, 80 per cent power level and a design effect (D) of 2 (Annex 6).
44. A three-stage stratified sampling technique was used to select adolescent girls for
interviews and anthropometric measurements. Stage 1 involved random selection of
two or three Teacher Development Centres (TDC) in each district depending on the
number of schools sampled. In stage II, the evaluation team selected one primary
school and one group village headman (GVH) area at random from the catchment
areas of the selected TDCs. Stage III involved stratification of girls (standard 4-8) and
random sampling for interviews. Districts with larger numbers of adolescents
participating in the IFA intervention contributed to larger sample sizes than their
counterparts. Four girls were selected for interviews from each class, making a total
of 20 per school.
45. Out-of-school adolescents - In consultation with Community Health Nurses (CHN)
and HSAs, the evaluation team mobilized adolescent girls out of school who were
receiving IFA supplementation from health facilities. These girls were stratified by age
(corresponding to the classes they would have been in) and selected from each
stratum using random sampling to participate in the study. Girls remaining in the strata
participated in FGDs and other Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) sessions to
triangulate the findings.
46. Field work was carried out from the 11th till the 24th of February 2022 in Salima. By the
end of the field work, a total of 662 interviews with adolescent girls were completed.
Table 3 summaries the numbers of interviews completed in the three districts.

47. UNICEF provided a list of all the schools and health facilities that the evaluation used
as a sampling frame. Upon getting to the districts, the evaluation team first met with
the PNHAO and SHN coordinators to discuss and finalize the sampling plan and make
bookings. This process helped to ensure that schools and health facilities visited
included those in remote areas and their counterparts closer to the roads and trading
centres. This also helped in ensuring that schools that were close to each other were
not selected to ensure heterogeneity of responses. SHN teachers were asked to
provide a list of girls who were present on that day from which the team selected some
for interviews.
48. An anthropometric survey of the sampled adolescent girls took place at the schools
and communities. Two teams of trained enumerators took the measurements. Each
team comprised of 5 people, 1 person for registering the girls, 2 people for taking
height measurements, and 2 for weight and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC).
49. At each school and health facility, the teams started with measurements before
interviewing the girls. Each enumerator had samples of IFA and albendazole tablets
to show to the girls and help them remember. The enumerators also displayed copies
of the Malawi six food group guide and seasonal food calendars during interviews to
ensure credibility and validity of the data collected.
4.3 Qualitative Data Collection
a) Key Informant Interviews (KIIs)
50. The evaluation team conducted Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) at national, district and
community levels to triangulate information from the adolescent survey. Participants
were adolescent girls and key persons who took part in the project from its inception
till completion (Table 4). These interviews were useful in collating stakeholders’
viewpoints on various issues concerning the IFA intervention, particularly those that
were difficult to derive from the adolescent girls who participated in the survey.

b) Focus Group Discussions (FGDs)
51. The evaluation conducted a total of 14 FGDs with groups of 6-10 people selected
purposively from all the three pilot districts for first-hand information (Table 5).
Discussions centred on selected topics with planned questions using the PRA
methodology, while allowing for interesting, new or unplanned follow up questions.
The emphasis was on examining adolescent girls’ knowledge, attitudes, practices and
behaviours in relation to nutrition, gender equality and human rights. Semi-structured
questionnaires with open ended questions and PRA guidelines were used to guide
the discussions. An anonymous voting game was used with girls and mothers to elicit
unbiased responses towards IFA compliance. Girls and mothers were asked:
1) When the IFA supplements were available, how frequently were you/your daughter
given a tablet?
2) When the IFA supplements were given to you, how frequently did you/your
daughter take the tablet?
52. Respondents were then invited to anonymously place a stone in a covered cup (so
that other respondents could not see) to vote for one of the following four options:
1) Every week without fail
2) Sometimes it was given/taken, sometimes it wasn’t given/taken
3) Never
4) I don’t know
53. The groups then witnessed the counting of the stones and were invited to discuss the
total votes. At no point were the respondents asked to reveal their answers and their
reasons.

54. Supervision: Evaluators were present in the field with the teams to supervise and
continue mentoring them. Supervision involved ensuring that the survey methodology
was followed closely, confirming that enumerators were asking questions and
recording answers as agreed, checking how enumerators were completing
questionnaires and taking anthropometric measurements daily and organising
evening wrap-up sessions with all of them together to discuss any problems
encountered and addressing them.
15
4.4 Data Analysis
55. Electronic data from the adolescent girls’ survey were exported, cleaned and analysed
in SPSS computer package (Version 21, IBM Corp. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows,
Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. Released 2016). Descriptive statistics, such as frequencies
and means, were generated and used to describe the findings in line with the
intervention’s results framework. Cross tabulations were used to disaggregate the
findings by district, category of girls and age (10-14 vs 15-19 years).
56. Qualitative data from FGDs, KIIs and simple observations were analysed by field
teams at the end of each day and upon completion of data collection in a particular
area. Analysis of this data involved verifying the information collected, compiling and
summarising it and identifying key findings in order to contextualize quantitative
findings.
4.5 Ethical Consideration
57. The evaluation followed UNICEF’s procedure of Ethics in Evidence Generation and
all its guidelines on the ethical participation of human participants, including children,
and conformed to the 2020 United Nations Evaluation Group’s (UNEG) Ethical
Guidelines as well.
58. After a briefing that UNICEF made during the training, each one of the evaluation team
members signed the policy to show commitment to uphold UNICEF’s values and
observe the do no-harm principle. This entailed treating all people (women, men, girls,
boys, children, the elderly and chronically ill people) with respect and dignity and
challenging any form of harassment, discrimination, intimidation and exploitation.
59. Every team member agreed to promote human and child rights and oppose criminal
and unethical behaviours. All interviews were preceded by a brief introduction about
the purpose of the evaluation and seeking consent from the respondents. All the
research tools underwent a rigorous ethical review by UNICEF and were approved
(annex 7). All parents, guardians and teachers signed consent and assent forms to
give permission for the team to administer questionnaires with adolescents (annex 8),
capture photos if deemed relevant and take anthropometric measurements.
60. Enumerators informed teachers, parents and girls that participation was voluntary,
highlighting on people’s rights to refuse participation, skip questions they did not want
to answer, and to stop interviews at any time they wanted. They were informed that
there would be no implications for exercising these rights. The evaluation team abided
by their professional ethical conduct, such as guaranteeing confidentiality, neutrality
and respect for respondent’s dignity and culture.
16
4.6 Limitations of the Evaluation
61. Resistance by parents to provide consent – Parents in some communities,
especially in Mangochi, were reluctant to provide consent for their children to
participate in the study due to misconceptions that surround the IFA supplementation.
Adolescent girls were discouraged to come to the health facilities where they were
receiving IFA tablets for anthropometric measurements and interviews in this regard.
The survey team made prior appointments and efforts to engage parents through
HSAs, but low numbers turned up for interviews in many communities.
62. A mixture of in and out of school adolescents receiving IFA supplementation at
health centres – Following the closure of schools in March 2020, some adolescent
girls continued to receive IFA supplementation from health facilities even after opening
of schools. When HSAs mobilized adolescent girls, who were receiving IFA
supplementation at health facilities, the evaluation team discovered that the majority
of them were those in school. Lower numbers of out-of-school adolescent girls were
interviewed than planned in this regard.
Box 2: Misconceptions and perceived side effects caused by IFA tablets
i. IFA tablets are intended for pregnant women, meaning that adolescent girls who are
not pregnant should not take them.
ii. IFA tablets are contraceptives. District staff suggested that the misconception may
relate to the appearance of the IFA tablets and the blister pack they are provided in,
which resembles contraceptive tablets. For this reason, communities and parents
were frightening girls in some areas that those who will take the tablets will not
conceive in future. Conversely, in other communities in Salima and Mangochi there
were reports that some girls had become pregnant as a result of engaging in
sexually risky behaviours due to the belief that they had taken contraceptives. In
future, during the orientation of district staff, frontline workers and communities the
two types of tablets need to be displayed. The project should make some women,
like those in care and mother groups, champions of change to continue reaching out
to communities and girls in youth clubs that JPGE has already established with
correct messages to foster behavioural change and compliance.
iii. IFA tablets are distributed to reduce the population. Significantly, this was related
by community and district level stakeholders to a population report that was
published by the Government of Malawi around the time that the IFA intervention
commenced, which stated that Malawi is over-populated and that efforts should be
made to reduce the population.
iv. IFA tablets were wrongly seen as COVID-19 tablets for vaccination, particularly in
Mangochi
v. Girls in some areas said they do not like the smell of IFA tablets, reporting “They
smell bad”.
vi. Other girls in Salima and Mangochi said that IFA tablets have side effects of vomiting
and triggering menstruation.
vii. IFA tablets would prevent cervical cancer. The fear was that taking such medication
when one does not have cancer may lead to the development of the disease.
17
63. Unavailability of key persons and focus group discussion participants at
national and district levels – Critical key informants that could otherwise have
provided strategic information with regards to the design, implementation and
effectiveness of the approaches were not always available for interviews. This delayed
the evaluation process as they kept postponing the interviews to an extent that some
could not be interviewed during the time of the evaluation. Likewise, though the
consultants worked collaboratively with District Coordinators and frontline workers,
they were unable to identify members of youth clubs and care groups targeted by the
IFA Intervention to participate in the FGDs. In Salima, the PNHAO indicated that youth
clubs born out of the IFA Intervention in collaboration with Afikepo’s Nutrition and
Access to Primary Education (NAPE) project had just been formulated and no
activities had commenced yet.
64. Lack of routine monitoring data from the District Nutrition Offices (DNOs).
Another challenge was DNOs failure to share electronic data from schools and health
facilities as most of it remained in hard copy formats. It was therefore difficult to
quantify achievements and impact of the project in some areas.
65. Expectation of allowances by key persons – There were high expectations of
allowances from key informants in schools and health facilities, particularly in
Mangochi. The evaluation did not budget for any allowances as guided by ethical
requirements, which discourage making payments of any kind to study respondents.
In some cases, such key persons declined to help in mobilizing adolescents in their
schools and catchment areas. To mitigate the problem, the consultants made lunch
compensations of four thousand Kwacha to maintain good relationships.
66. Social desirability bias – A key theme emerging from the qualitative data was the
reference to ‘others’ in the reporting of ‘socially undesirable behaviours’ as perceived
by respondents, namely non-compliance with the IFA supplements. Where
respondents discussed this, they commonly noted that ‘other girls did not take the
tablets, but we did’, or ‘other girls engaged in risky sexual behaviour because they
thought they had taken contraceptives, but we did not’. This may indicate that
respondents were biasing their responses to conform to what they perceived to be the
socially accepted response in the context of being interviewed. This is a common
phenomenon in interviews or FGDs. Findings should be read in the knowledge that
they may reflect a more positive picture than reality.
5.0 Evaluation Results
67. UNICEF and its partners from the Government of Malawi have pre-tested iron and
folic acid supplementation among girls (10-19 years) for the first time and succeeded.
Over a relatively short period of time (2018-2021), the intervention accomplished most
of what it set out to do, reaching or exceeding many of its most important targets.
18
Systems have been put in place to set a foundation for other interventions, capacities
of government frontline workers while service providers have been strengthened and
promising practices have been tested for wider application. These approaches will
benefit not only the communities, schools and adolescents in the impact districts, but
also others in Malawi and elsewhere. The results under each criterion assessed in the
evaluation were found to be satisfactory and in a number of cases, highly satisfactory.
Specific Objective (SO) 1: Assess the extent to which context factors were
considered in the design of the intervention and how it was coherent with policies
and programmes of other partners operating in the same districts
Evaluation Criterion 1: Coherence
Question 1.1: To what extent were contextual factors considered in the design and
delivery of the intervention?
68. The Adolescent IFA Intervention was found to fit the health and nutritional needs of
adolescent girls in the targeted districts quite well. Mangochi, Salima and Dedza had
one of the highest rates of anaemia in women of reproductive age ranging from 59 per
cent in Dedza, 69.7 per cent in Mangochi and 72 per cent for Salima according to the
Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS) of 2015/2016.
69. Adolescents’ diets were poor; solely composed of stiff maize porridge and vegetables
as relish, as reported by the situation analysis study conducted from November to
December, 2018. Consumption of meats, poultry, eggs, milk and milk products was
very low. Production of small livestock, for instance goats and chickens, was low and
a majority of the households could not afford to buy these food commodities from the
market. Local foods that are good sources of iron, such as caterpillars, ants and
indigenous vegetables were despised and not eaten in adequate amounts that could
result in substantial intake of iron. The situation analysis study reported that more than
half of the girls and their households lacked knowledge about iron deficiency,
anaemia, foods that can help prevent the disease and how to prepare them.
Therefore, UNICEF and its partners designed and implemented the IFA Intervention
to address these problems and prevent the situation from deteriorating.
70. Interviews with adolescent girls in and out of school showed that many of them feel
that their situation has changed as a result of the intervention. One girl from TA
Kalonga in Salima attested that, “I did not know that a variety of foods found locally in
our communities, such as wild fruits, vegetables and animals, which we do not like
eating much thinking they are traditional for girls like us, are very good sources of iron,
but are lacking in our bodies. The project has taught us about the Malawi six food
groups and to eat them (local foods) regularly in our diet.” Similar sentiments were
echoed in other communities in the three districts as well.
19
Question 1.2: How did various components of the same intervention and other
interventions by UNICEF operate together to achieve its objectives?
71. Weekly IFA supplementation, deworming, nutrition education for social behaviour
change and dietary diversity as well as capacity building and involvement of frontline
workers, including teachers and HSAs, have shown to synchronize well and be an
effective model of reaching out to adolescent girls and boys in and out of school.
72. UNICEF and its partners did well to pre-test the IFA supplementation and deworming
in the same three districts, targeted by the UN Joint Programme on Girls Education
(JPGE) II. The programme was implemented by the Government of Malawi from 2018
to 2020 with technical support from three United Nations agencies (UNFPA, UNICEF
and WFP) and financial support of the Royal Norwegian Government. A new four-year
phase was approved in December 2020 and is currently ongoing (2021-2024). JPGE
III is implemented in 169 primary schools in these districts and targeting the same girls
from standard 5-8 because it is within this age when girls in Malawi tend to drop out
of school due to numerous socio-economic and cultural reasons. JPGE III is also
focusing on out-of-school adolescent girls targeted by the IFA Intervention, ensuring
that they receive basic life skills that they currently need and would require during their
adult life.
73. The impact has been huge because of this co-existence, and sound collaboration and
coordination. Government frontline workers, parents and communities corroborated
that the two programmes together have upheld girls’ rights to education, health and
nutrition in addition to avoiding duplication of efforts that would result in wastage of
resources if each one of them was working separately.
74. As an example, in Salima JPGE introduced school health clubs in 6 of the targeted 11
TAs and promoted backyard gardens and orchards to support the dietary diversity
component of the IFA Intervention. JPGE has trained food committees, mother groups
and SHN teachers on cooking demonstrations and nutrition education as mentors for
the school clubs formed. The IFA Intervention used these clubs to implement activities
on nutrition and diets to increase iron intake. According to the PNHAO and DNO for
the district, JPGE also purchased and supplied additional reporting tools for supply to
various schools and health facilities after they finished in the final year of the IFA
Intervention. Traditional Authorities (TAs) where JPGE and IFA Interventions worked
together in the district are Kambalame, Ndindi, Kambwiri, Pemba, Maganga and
Kaulunda. The impact registered is huge and needs to be scaled up to other TAs.
20
Question 1.3: To what extent was UNICEF’s Adolescent IFA Intervention by the
GoM and UNICEF coherent with policies and programmes of other partners
operating within the same context?
75. The Adolescent IFA Intervention was a multi-sectoral project that integrated health
and nutrition actions to address the problem of iron deficiency and anaemia in line
with priorities and commitments of the government of Malawi, UNICEF and other
External Development Partners (EDPs), in particular the donor, the Netherlands
Government.
76. The intervention was aligned to the Multi-Sectoral Adolescent Nutrition Strategy of
2019-2023, and the National Multi-sectoral Nutrition Policy (NMNP) and its Strategic
Plan of 2018-2022 as the main policy documents guiding the programming of nutrition
as a human and child rights issue in the country. As an example, the intervention has
achieved three of the nine activities outlined under strategy 2 of objective 1 of the
NMNP and its Strategic Plan, namely: 1) provide iron-folate supplementation to
pregnant and all women 15-49 years of age, 2) conduct nutrition education and
counselling for adolescent girls and women at facility and community levels, and 3)
procure and distribute the following to all facilities: iron, folic acid, vitamin A and de-
worming tablets for women 15-49 years (including pregnant women).
77. Additionally, the Adolescent IFA Intervention by UNICEF and GoM provided synergy
and complementarities to other policies like the Malawi Growth and Development
Strategy III (MGDS III) (2017-2022), the National Agriculture Policy (NAP) (2016-
2021) and National Resilience Strategy (2018-2030), which seek to address
micronutrient deficiencies, through other means, such as biofortification and
fortification of major staple foods.
78. From a global perspective, the IFA Intervention has contributed to achieving agenda
2030, especially indicator 2.2.3 for target 2.2 of SDG 2 that aims to “end hunger,
achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. Target
2.2 of this goal states that “By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving
the internationally agreed-upon targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5
years of age, by 2025, and address nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and
lactating women and older persons. Indicator 2.2.3 is about reducing the prevalence
of anaemia in women of 15-49 years of age. This indicator is based on the goals
outlined by the 65th World Health Assembly (WHA) that took place in May 2012 for
fighting all forms of malnutrition globally.
79. The Adolescent IFA Intervention partnered well with other programmes throughout its
period of implementation.
1) Afikepo Nutrition and Access to Primary Education (NAPE) project funded by
the European Union (EU) and the Government of Germany with support from GIZ.
21
NAPE (2017 to April 2022) trained school club patrons, matrons and community
members on how to establish school gardens and grow indigenous and nutritious
crops and vegetables. NAPE focused on Home-Grown School Meals (HGSM) to
enrich school meals with indigenous vegetables and legumes that are highly
nutritious. NAPE has established adolescent clubs in schools receiving IFA
supplementation in Salima to leverage efforts by UNICEF and DNHA.
2) CARE Malawi provided fuel to distribute IFA reporting tools in schools and health
centres.
3) WFP provided vehicles for district teams to carry out monitoring activities for the
Adolescent IFA Intervention.
4) Organized Network of Services for Everyone's (ONSE) Health project funded
by USAID supported nutrition activities, particularly in Salima.
SO 2: Evaluate the extent to which project activities were implemented in a cost-
efficient manner in the targeted communities.
Evaluation Criteria 2 – Efficiency
80. The evaluation team analysed efficiency of the IFA Intervention in the targeted districts
to be very satisfactory based on three questions outlined in the ToRs.
Question 2.1: How well have UNICEF’s resources, both human and financial, been
managed to ensure timely, cost-effective and efficient attainment of the results?
81. According to individual interviews with project managers and staff in the districts,
funding for the IFA project was disbursed as planned. Since the funding came in the
form of a grant, the project was designed in accordance with the financial envelope
made available to UNICEF by the donor.
82. The total budget that UNICEF Malawi country office received from the Netherlands’
government is US$250,000. Table 6 shows that different categories of activities were
fully funded as planned. In terms of expenditure by category, Table 6 shows that the
purchase and replenishment of IFA tablets accounted for 30 per cent of the total
budget, 23.7 per cent was allocated for actual purchasing of the IFA tablets, and 3.6
per cent went to freight costs and local distribution to the schools and health facilities.
Monitoring and evaluation spent 30 per cent through costs for the baseline and endline
studies, monitoring support to the districts and integration of IFA indicators in the
national M&E system. The project spent 17.2 per cent of the budget on social
behaviour change communication (SBBC), which included planning and facilitation of
community engagements, mass media engagement and mobilization, and the
identification, engagement and empowerment of adolescent nutrition champions.
Capacity development had a cumulative expenditure of 13.4 per cent, emanating from
learning and development sessions, printing of compliance cards for 35,000
adolescent girls and demonstrations of diversified diets using locally available foods.
22
83. Other budget categories represent smaller shares of the total project cost. These
include expenditures on visibility at US$14,000, representing 5.6 per cent of the
budget, and cross sectoral support at US$9,616 (4%) as illustrated in Table 6.
84. In summary, operational costs related to the provision of IFA supplements and
associated activities accounted for almost 100 per cent of the total expenditures
incurred. No investment was made on equipment, vehicles and furniture. Moreover,
the budget did not include administrative costs like salaries and remuneration of staff.
The presence of in-country experts at UNICEF and partner organizations helped the
project to save time and resources that would have otherwise been spent on additional
recruitment processes or hiring consultants to do certain tasks. The use of the national
supply chain from district hospitals to communities also enabled the project to make
financial savings in terms of staff salaries, logistics, and monitoring and supervision
costs, thereby making it possible to reach a larger number of beneficiaries at a lower
cost, as desired.
85. A large portion of the budget was disbursed in the first year (US$109,740 – 43.9%).
This is because large components of M&E and SBCC, and 50 per cent of expenditures
for the IFA tablets were planned to be spent in the year (Table 6). With respect to cost-
effectiveness, the evaluation found an average cost of US$2.38 per beneficiary girl
registered in the project per year; disaggregated as follows: US$3.13, US$2.07 and
US$1.94 for years 1 to 3 respectively (a total of US$7.14 in three years) as illustrated
in Table 7. This level of efficiency compares favourably well with similar interventions
implemented elsewhere. For example, the cost of the IFA programs per adolescent
girl per year in Sri Lanka, for which data is available, is estimated at US$2.272 and in
India US$0.583 for projects that have taken place most recently in the past five years.
Data from other countries in Asia, such as Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, the Philippines and Vietnam, show that in previous efficacy studies, the cost
varied from US$0.12 to $3.64 for an annual supply of 52 IFA supplements to
adolescent girls4.

Question 2.2 How efficient was the collaboration and coordination at the national,
zone, district and community levels?
86. Collaboration and coordination of IFA activities were assessed to be good and
expected to be scaled up. At the national level, DNHA was responsible for the overall
coordination and management of project activities. When IFA tablets were procured,
Pharmacy Departments at district hospitals received and stored them before supplying
them to PNHAO offices. From these offices, supplies were delivered to health centres
24
by drivers. District Nutritionist, members of District Nutrition Coordinating Committees
(DNCC) like Youth Officers, SHN coordinators and the PNHAO monitored the whole
process to ensure consignments were delivered as dispatched. SHN coordinators
were the ones instructing the SHN teachers to collect supplies from the health centres
and to store them in the head teachers’ offices for weekly distribution.
Question 2.3 What factors affected the efficiency of the project?
87. Despite the availability of funding and its disbursement as planned, a number of
factors affected efficiency of the intervention. The main factor was the expiration and
stock out of IFA tablets before the project came to an end. Procurement of IFA tablets
and supply to health centres and schools was carried out immediately in the first
months of 2019 to save freight and distribution costs. Being on a pilot basis, the project
only budgeted and procured IFA tablets for years I and 2; 52 doses per year for each
of the 35,000 girls registered in the project. IFA supplementation therefore did not take
place after expiration of the consignments that were delivered. During field work for
this evaluation, no school had supplies and supplementation had since stopped.
88. At the district level: District pharmacy managers, in-charges of health centres and
DNOs complained that they were not involved in the targeting of beneficiaries (girls),
ordering of the tablets and planning of delivery to schools and health facilities. All
these activities were said to be unilaterally managed by UNICEF and DNHA parallel
to the national supply chain system followed by the district hospitals.
89. At the school and health centre level: The main problem was low storage capacity.
Schools, as reported by the SHN Teachers and Head Teachers, in particular, had
limited space to keep huge quantities of IFA tablets.
90. At the community level: Efficiency of the project was affected by misconceptions
regarding the IFA tablets that reduced compliance by the girls.
SO 3: Propose a Theory of Change in consultation with all key stakeholders.
91. The Theory of Change (ToC), detailed in Annex 9, draws from multiple sources
including:
- The ‘Framework of interventions and determinants of adolescent nutrition’
provided in the Multi-Sectoral Adolescent Nutrition Strategy of 2019-20235.
- The ‘Socio-Ecological Model’ provided in the Multi-Sector Nutrition Education and
Communication Strategy (NECS) II, 2019-20236.
- Data collected through this evaluation.

page 10
6 Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Education and Communication Strategy (NECS) II, 2019-2023, Government of
Malawi Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS, pp 9
25
92. These data sources are reviewed through an Actor Based Change (ABC)
framework lens7. Given the IFA Intervention’s objectives, the Theory of Change
identifies two key actors, and two target behaviours that it seeks to address, as
shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5: Key Actors and Target Behaviours
93. As outlined further in Annex 9, a socio-ecological model, and behavioural analyses of
the two target behaviours are presented. These analyses form the basis of two
proposed Theories of Action, which outline the pathways of change from intervention
toward changes in the targeted behaviours. The two Theories of Action, are then
presented jointly in a Theory of Change (Figure 6), which shows how changes in the
target behaviours, if sustained over time and adequately resourced, will contribute
toward the proposed outcomes in adolescent health and nutrition, as outlined in the
‘Framework of interventions and determinants of adolescent nutrition’ provided in the
Multi-Sectoral Adolescent Nutrition Strategy 2019-2023.
94. The IFA Intervention is in line with the Multi-Sectoral Adolescent Nutrition Strategy of
2019-2023 whose goal is to have well-nourished adolescents who can contribute to
economic growth and development of the country. The Theory of Change (ToC)
adopts and feeds into the conceptual model presented in this Strategy. The Theory of
Change (Figure 6) developed through a rigorous analysis of the final evaluation
primary data, desk review of the national nutrition policy and its accompanying
strategy papers, envisages that supplementation of iron through IFA tablets coupled
with positive practices on diversified diets as guided by Malawi’s six food groups in an
enabling environment will lead to significant improvement in adolescent nutrition. A
key component of the Adolescent IFA Intervention is the financial support from
UNICEF and technical support from the DNHA, Ministries of Health and Education as
agents of delivery of the program support to the adolescents.

95. A few components have been added to the Conceptual Framework presented in the
Multi-Sectoral Adolescent Nutrition Strategy. The additions made and their
justifications are as follows:
96. Inputs
i. Funding – Currently, UNICEF is one of the main development partners
supporting IFA supplementation in Malawi. Funding is a crucial component as the
intervention cannot sustain itself until the Government of Malawi (GoM) is able to
self-finance it.
ii. Human Resource (roles of government implementing agencies) – The roles
of the Ministry of Health through the DNHA, RHU and DHOs are key components
of the intervention since IFA supplementation is also partly a health issue.
Conversely, the ToC highlights the role of the Ministry of Education which is
significant to the implementation. The intervention targets 70 per cent of in school
adolescents and should continue in that manner when it is scaled up.
iii. Stakeholders - Religious and traditional leaders determine the achievement of
the IFA Intervention as they are culturally more empowered to determine
behavioural change in a society (hence should be considered an important
stakeholder to ensure success).
97. Interventions
i. Promotion of behavioural change through Social and Behavioural Change
Communications (SBCC) approach is a key intervention outlined in the ToC
(Theory of Change) to increase intake of iron rich foods, diversified diets and IFA
supplementation among adolescents.
ii. Provide targeted supplementation for adolescent girls 10-19 years: the main
activity for the IFA Intervention for adolescents aimed at eradicating iron
deficiency among adolescent girls 10-19 years. This needs to be reflected in the
ToC to guide implementation.
iii. Include nutritional education intervention through the Life Skills course, health
talks and Care Groups as part of the ToC.
iv. Build capacity of frontline workers in IFA provision, data management and
reporting: The evaluation found that there are capacity gaps in the provision,
data management and reporting by frontline workers such as SHN teachers and
HSAs. In this ToC, the project should enhance training and incorporate on-going
training of staff in schools and health facilities.
v. Promoting coordination among facility, district and national level partners
in IFA supplementation should be considered as one of the elements for the
ToC for this project. Coordination gaps especially at district level compromised
achievement of the results and contributed to poor distribution and management
of IFA stocks. It is important that UNICEF facilitates engagement with key
stakeholders at national and district levels to ensure the coordination structure is
28
owned by all stakeholders, with roles and responsibilities specified. These include
the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, DNHA, District Health Officers,
Districts Nutrition Officers and Principal Nutrition, HIV and AIDS Officers.
SO 4: Evaluate effectiveness of the Adolescent IFA Intervention in producing the
expected results for adolescent boys and girls, service providers, parents and
community leaders in the targeted communities.
Evaluation Criterion 3: Effectiveness
Question 3.1: To what extent has the Netherlands-funded adolescent nutrition
programme on IFA provision and capacity building of service providers been
successful in achieving its objectives?
98. The Adolescent IFA Intervention had four primary objectives:
(i) To promote consumption of diversified diets using the Malawi six food
groups approach among 70 per cent of adolescent boys and girls aged 10-
19 years.
(ii) To standardize integration of weekly iron and folic acid (IFA) supplements
in the Ministry of Health’s (MoH) supply chain.
(iii) To promote compliance of IFA supplements and deworming in 70 per cent
of school going and 60 per cent of out-of-school adolescent girls.
(iv) To create an enabling environment for effective implementation of
adolescent nutrition in Malawi.
Objective 1 of the Project: To promote consumption of diversified diets using the
Malawi six food groups among 70 per cent of adolescent girls and boys aged 10-
19 years.
99. Through community radios, community sensitization and door to door campaigns,
available data by the Story Workshop Educational Trust (SWET) show that the
project managed to reach 54,826 adolescents (32,354 girls and 22,472 boys) with
messages of IFA supplementation and diets, as of 2020. This figure represents an
achievement of 78.9 per cent, which is higher by 28.9 percentage points since the
project planned to have 50 per cent of the 69,462 adolescent boys and girls
reached in the pilot districts.
100. Descriptive analysis of data from the 24-hour dietary diversity score based on the
Malawi six food group guide shows that the project has achieved tangible results
by the end of three years. Figure 7 shows an increase in the consumption of iron-
rich foods. More than two thirds of the girls interviewed (68.4%) reported to have
consumed various forms of meat and meat products, including those that are
locally available, compared to 47 per cent found by the situation analysis study in
29
2018. Consumption of dark green leafy vegetables, which are also a good source
of iron, has increased too from 89.5 per cent to almost 100 per cent (99.1%),
legumes from 49 per cent to 50.9 per cent and fats and oils from 70 per cent to
87.9 per cent as illustrated in Figure 7. Vegetables were plentiful during the time
of the evaluation due to rains and with nutrition knowledge acquired adolescent
girls consumed them regularly as part of their diet. Conversely, the evaluation
found a decline in the consumption of fruits by 18.1 percentage points from 63 per
cent reported three years ago to 44.9 per cent. Focus group discussion (FGDs)
revealed that indigenous fruits like mangoes and guavas were out of season and
those that household grow in their fields, such as watermelons and cucumbers,
had not yet matured in February when the evaluation took place. Adolescent girls
and their families lacked money to buy and eat fruits that were available at the
market (e.g. bananas and apples) regularly as required in this regard.

Baseline Final Evaluation
Figure 7: Food consumption at baseline (2018) and final evaluation (2022)
101. Table 8 shows that more than half (58.6%) of the girls had high dietary diversity as
they consumed five or all the six food groups a day before the survey. More than
one third of them (35.6%) consumed 3-4 groups (medium diversity) and only 5.8
per cent were in the low diversity category because they ate 1-2 food groups.
These results, while not entirely due to this project since the presence of other
interventions in the same districts, suggest a positive contribution of the project
through nutrition education and promotion of iron rich foods. Trends were similar
across the districts, with Mangochi reporting the highest diversity (Table 8).

102. A further assessment was carried out to understand the type of foods among the
six food groups that were available and constituted diets of the adolescent girls in
the targeted districts. Girls in Mangochi reported the highest consumption of animal
food products (81.9%) a day before the survey followed by Salima (61.6%) and
Dedza (59.3%) as shown in Figure 8.

103. Organ meats, while are a very rich source of iron, were rarely accessed and
consumed by adolescents as already indicated above. Only 5.1 per cent of the
girls had consumed this essential source of iron in the 24 hours prior to the study.
They confirmed that organ meat and meat in general are expensive and eaten
occasionally in most households. “Our parents cannot afford to buy meat regularly,
although it is readily available at the market,” a girl reported at Kankhombe primary
school in Salima. Fish is the most common source of iron, especially in Salima and
Mangochi because they are close to the lake. Caterpillars, insects and ants remain
largely unpopular and seasonal. More efforts are needed to increase consumption
of these local foods and make them reliable sources of iron in the districts.
104. Table 9 shows that households from which adolescent girls reside are now eating
one more food group with an average dietary diversity score of 4.6 compared to
4.1 recorded by the situational analysis study of 2018.
105. SHN teachers explained that at times IFA supplementation sessions were
preceded by health talks, which included guidance on the Malawi six food groups
and foods that are rich in iron to complement the tablets. Adolescent girls reported
to have received information from other sources about nutrition and diets including
wrappers worn by women (zitenje in Chichewa) that Feed the Children provided
through Tiwalere project, radios and parents at home.

106. Further engagements with SHN teachers revealed that they have not received any
standard guidelines to use in nutrition education of adolescent girls to promote
consumption of iron foods. Most of the teachers explained that their weekly roles
were therefore limited to the distribution of IFA tablets and keeping records on
compliance, but little on nutrition education. “We give nutrition education because
we see that it is necessary, but it is not a major component of this program. We
have no topics and reference guidelines to use. We only talk about the Malawi six
food groups and we cannot be delivering the same topic every week,” said one of
the SHN teachers in Mangochi. Similar sentiments were expressed by teachers in
most schools of Salima and Dedza.
Objective 2 of the Project: To standardize integration of weekly iron and folic acid
supplements in the Ministry of Health (MoH) supply chain
107. Over the past 3 years, from 2018 to 2021, the project invested US$59,332 to
procure IFA tablets for 35,000 girls and ensured that each one of them had 52
tablets in a year to allow weekly intake. In the initial phase (2019), the project used
the Ministry of Health (MoH) and Central Medical Stores Trust (CMST) supply
chain system to procure tablets, as confirmed by district and community staff -
32
SHN teachers and HSAs. In subsequent consignments of November 2021 and
March 2022 (Figure 10), the project changed and set up a parallel structure and
the reasons for doing this remain unknown.
Figure 10: IFA supply chain versus Central Medical Stores Trust (CMST) system
108. As an example, in supplies for November 2021 and March 2022, UNICEF and
DNHA delivered supplies to PNHAOs who then circumvented district pharmacy
stores and distributed directly to health centres for further sharing with beneficiary
schools and community delivery points.
109. The parallel structure resulted in a number of challenges related to monitoring,
stock management and reporting. Several schools and health facilities reported to
have received more supplies than were actually needed due to the lack of accurate
information on the numbers of registered girls. “Tablets have expired because it
has taken longer for the girls to finish the huge supplies delivered,” SHN teachers
and HSAs said.
110. In some cases, due to poor information and monitoring in the parallel structure,
IFA tablets meant for adolescent girls were distributed among pregnant women by
health facilities, for instance in Salima. These inconsistences and anomalies
presented a high cost to the project and need to be addressed in the future.
33
Objective 3 of the Project: To promote compliance of iron and folic acid
supplements and deworming in 70 per cent of school going and 60 per cent of out-
of-school adolescent girls
111. Interviews with girls in all the three districts revealed that when IFA supplements
were available in the first and second years, 79 per cent of them complied by taking
weekly doses as recommended.
112. To promote compliance, the project required adolescent girls to take tablets weekly
on spot under direct supervision of teachers, HSAs or Community Health Nurses
and parents. The following procedure was followed and is recommended to be
continued:
i. All registered girls came to a common place.
ii. Each girl washed her hands when it was her turn to take the tablet.
iii. SHN teachers and HSAs provided the tablet to each girl to ingest on spot.
iv. Girls brought their cups from home as a COVID-19 precautionary
measure.
v. SHN teachers and HSAs recorded in the compliance forms for each girl
after taking the tablet.
vi. In instances where a girl missed her weekly dose, it was given on another
day within the same week. However, if this was not possible, the following
week’s dose was given when it was due.
113. During the holidays, SHN teachers provided girls with the IFA tablets to take at
home and record it on the compliance forms themselves. This practice was
particularly for schools away from health facilities. Girls living close to health
facilities received their tablets from HSAs and through the various forums available
in the communities during holidays.
114. In spite of these achievements, after March 2020 the project suffered from stock
out of supplies mainly because of disruptions by the COVID-19 pandemic. Girls
did not have the opportunity to comply, therefore, when asked during the
quantitative survey, ‘Have you received IFA supplements in the past 6 months
(referring to the period from September 2021 till February 2022 when the endline
data was collected), 13.6 per cent said yes’. The rest (85.4%) of the girls did not
take any supplements during this period.
115. These results are similar to those in Salima for which data were available and
shared with the evaluation team. Table 10 shows 12.4 per cent and 20 per cent
compliance, by adolescent girls in schools and communities in the district, for the
months of September and October 2021 respectively. Most schools had no IFA
stocks during this period, hence lower compliance was reported when compared
to communities. UNICEF placed an intern in the office of the PNHAO who captured
this data. Dedza and Mangochi had no such data to share with the evaluation team.

Deworming of Adolescent Girls
116. The Adolescent IFA Intervention was designed to provide albendazole tablets
twice every year to treat intestinal worms in girls. The survey asked a series of
questions to establish coverage of the intervention. Results (Tables 11 and 12)
show that close to two thirds of the girls (65.2%) indicated to have received
albendazole tablets within the 12 months preceding the survey. On average, the
girls received the tablets twice (mean=1.56) as recommended.
117. In terms of albendazole intake, 98 per cent of those who received the tablets were
from Mangochi (36.7%) and girls in school (81.4%). Interviews with health workers
in all the three districts revealed that the IFA Intervention did not distribute any
albendazole to the schools. Albendazole was provided as part of the Bilharzia
program by district hospitals.

Objective 4 of the Project: To create an enabling environment for effective
implementation of adolescent nutrition intervention
Question 3.2: What were the major factors influencing the achievement or non-
achievement of the project objectives?
118. The project achieved notable successes in creating an enabling environment for
effective implementation of adolescent nutrition in the targeted districts. Examples
of factors that show the environment was conducive include the following:
36
1) Delivery of IFA tablets directly in schools and health facilities –The choice
of schools and health facilities as distribution places made it possible for girls
to access the tablets easily from teachers and HSAs whom they saw daily and
trusted.
2) On spot monitoring for compliance – SHN teachers, HSAs and parents had
a responsibility to observe girls when taking IFA tablets and record it, which
helped to ensure compliance whether girls were at school or home.
3) Training of government frontline workers helped improve capacities while
increasing competence and efficiency for carrying out project activities within
the busy working schedules.
4) Increasing knowledge about the Malawi six food groups - Adolescent boys
and girls consistently demonstrated knowledge of the Malawi six food groups
model, including recognition of individual groups, and the foods contained
therein. Nearly two-thirds adolescents (65.5% - 67% in-school and 60% out-
of-school) were able to name all the six food groups in the model diagram when
displayed in front of them during interviews. SHN teachers and HSAs covered
the subject as part of nutrition education and health talks before administering
tablets, although not regularly. More than half (51.4%) of the adolescent girls
surveyed reported to have ever attended nutrition education classes. In-school
girls were more likely (54.3%) to have attended such classes compared to 40.3
per cent of out-of-school girls (Figure 11). SWET also covered issues of diets
and the Malawi six food groups during mass awareness campaigns through
community drama and radio, which reached adolescent girls and boys as well.
Figure 11: Adolescent girls who have received nutrition education
37
Question 3.3: To what extent has the implementation of strategies and project
approaches, such as intake of the weekly IFA supplements worked as intended?
119. As outlined in detail above, implementation of strategies and project approaches
such as the intake of weekly IFA supplements in schools and health facilities,
involvement of government frontline workers, engagement of communication
partners like SWET, and incorporating nutrition education as part of the IFA
supplementation sessions have worked well and delivered the results. These
approaches are some of the best practices that the project should scale up.
Question 3.4: How effectively did UNICEF engage with the Government to
strengthen coordination and how far did government leadership and political will
influence the achievement of the results and vice versa?
120. There is evidence to suggest that higher government ownership over the
intervention at district level can be correlated with greater problem solving and
resource mobilisation for effective delivery and monitoring.
121. Political will is and has been demonstrated by the GoM through development of
the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) III (2017-2022), and the
National Multi-Sector Nutrition Policy and Nutrition Strategy (2018-2022) launched
in June 2018. As one way of operationalizing the policy and strategy, the
government has developed the Multi-Sectoral Adolescent Nutrition Strategy (2019-
2023), which aims to deal with health and nutrition issues affecting adolescents.
This, though not an end in itself, demonstrates affirmative action on part of the
government. While UNICEF mobilized the funds for IFA supplementation and will
continue to do so, government ministries and departments have been at the core
of the implementation process. The DNHA and RHU coordinated IFA activities at
the national level; district-level structures such as the PNHAO, DNO, SHN
coordinators, SHN teachers and HSAs played key roles in providing IFA
supplementation services.
Question 3.5: How successful was UNICEF in reaching the most vulnerable
groups in the target districts?
122. In this intervention, UNICEF and its partners succeeded quite well in reaching out
to adolescent girls, including those in remote areas where there was a lack of basic
amenities, including nutrition education and healthcare services. UNICEF and its
partners implemented the Adolescent IFA Intervention in the same schools and
communities where these girls are present in their daily lives, to enable them
access IFA and deworming services easily. They put the same teachers,
community health nurses (CHNs) and HSAs, who already educate the girls on
issues of education and health, at the forefront to render services and ensure
compliance.
38
123. Another unique result achieved by this intervention is its ability to reach out to boys
who in most cases are left out by humanitarian and development projects. The
boys took part in nutrition education and many of them testified in FGDs that they
have been enlightened. “We have learned about the Malawi six food groups for the
first time. We did not know anything about them previously and as a result we were
eating food just to satisfy hunger. We have now started discussing the importance
of nutrition in our youth clubs while increasing consumption of diversified diets at
home, thanks to the project,” said one group of the boys during FGDs in Salima.
Question 3.6: What other changes (positive, negative, direct, indirect or intended
and unintended) have occurred as a result of the project interventions?
As for unexpected and negative results, the following were identified:
124. Sharing of the tablets with pregnant and lactating mothers by health
facilities. According to pharmacists and DNOs interviewed, IFA tablets procured
by the project were also given to pregnant and lactating women when normal
supplies were out of stock at the hospital. Conversely, the project benefited from
albendazole that hospitals procured for routine treatment of bilharzia as already
stated.
125. Increased workload for SHN teachers. Since one SHN teacher was trained and
because only one day of the week was specifically dedicated to IFA
supplementation (Wednesdays or Thursdays in most of the schools), rather than
having sessions spread over several days of the week (for example, 1 day for each
class to be done quickly), SHN teachers complained about heavy workload and
that other school activities were neglected in favour of IFA supplementation. Head
teachers, SHN coordinators and other key persons suggested supporting SHN
teachers during these days to alleviate the workload by training additional teachers
for standard 4-8.
SO 5: Evaluate outcomes of the adolescent nutrition programme and the extent to
which the project has contributed to improving compliance of the intake of Iron
and Folic acid supplements.
126. The goal of the Netherlands-supported IFA Intervention was “to improve nutritional
status of in and out of school adolescent girls aged 10-19 years in the three districts
by the end of 2021” The evaluation assessed whether this goal was achieved by
asking girls, their schools and communities to respond to three main questions.
127. The Adolescent IFA Intervention has worked and shown tangible impacts amidst
the challenges faced. Both in and out of school girls complied well between 2019
and 2021 because they were taking tablets in the presence of SHN teachers and
39
HSAs or parents, if at home. These frontline workers corroborated and anticipated
the impact on reduction of iron deficiency and anaemia to be huge in the absence
of an anaemia study.
128. Nutritional Status of Adolescent Girls: Weight and height measurements were
taken to derive Body Mass Index (BMI) and assess the prevalence of underweight
girls. BMI was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meter
squared (kg/m2). The values obtained were further compared with the reference
population from the 2006 WHO Anthro to generate BMI-for-age. A BMI of less than
18.5 kg/m2 was used to determine underweight. Results (Figure 12) showed that
the underweight prevalence, which represents both chronic and acute deprivation,
has decreased from 12.9 per cent reported by the MDHS of 2015/2016 to 10.4 per
cent in February 2022 - when field work for the evaluation took place. In younger
girls 10-14 years, underweight prevalence has declined by 4.1 percentage points
from 21 per cent reported by the aforesaid MDHS to 16.9 per cent.
129. When compared to the situation analysis study of nutrition, knowledge, attitudes,
behaviour and practices of adolescents on iron and folic acid (IFA)
supplementation, the decrease is much higher at 20.3 percentage points in Salima,
Dedza and Mangochi from 30.7 per cent to 10.4 per cent (Figure 12).

Situation Analysis (2018) Final Evaluation (2022)
Figure 12: Declines in underweight in girls between the baseline and endline (%)
130. Between 2010 and 2015/2016, the prevalence of underweight and thinness
deteriorated in Malawi, with underweight prevalence rising from 14 per cent to 21
per cent and thinness from 2 per cent to 8 per cent among young girls aged 6-12
years old for which data are available. These figures mean that underweight
prevalence increased by 50 per cent and thinness by 300 per cent. A SMART
nutrition survey of 2018 in 26 out of 28 districts of Malawi found an underweight
40
prevalence of 14 per cent in adolescent girls of 10-14 years. In the selected six
pilot districts, the SMART survey found underweight prevalence of 26.5 per cent.
By implication, reductions observed in this evaluation represent the beginning of
positive trends that need to be nurtured and scaled up.
131. Of the 95 out of 662 girls who were underweight (14.4%), 15.6 per cent were in
school and 9.7 per cent out of school. These results were expected because girls
in school have busy work schedules during learning periods that reduce time for
eating. The evaluation also found that girls out of school engaged in small
businesses and earned money to fend for their food needs. Underweight
prevalence in girls was lowest in Salima (10.3%), followed by Mangochi (14.9%)
and then Dedza (17.1%). All the three districts are food sources for the country as
they produce fish, rice, maize, groundnuts, soybeans and various vegetables.
There is, therefore, need for further nutrition education to foster social behaviour
change with respect to food utilization in the districts.
132. The evaluation did not assess iron deficiency anaemia as the National Statistical
Office (NSO) is scheduled to do the same survey in 2022-23. However, reductions
in underweight prevalence serve as evidence for improvements in nutritional status
in general as various foods consumed are sources of both macro and
micronutrients, including iron.
Contributing factors
133. According to the participants in the individual interviews and FGDs, main factors
that have positively contributed to the achievements of the project's outcomes are:
i. Training of frontline workers. In this project, trainings of frontline workers
(HSAs and teachers) for all the participating schools and health facilities, to
offer nutrition education and IFA tablets, have contributed to the nutritional
gains registered. Teachers, HSAs and their managers have acquired a good
understanding of the program and delivered the results.
ii. Delivery of the project in the existing schools and health centre
infrastructure, has brought IFA tablets and other interventions much closer
to the expected beneficiaries (adolescent girls and boys), thus increasing
availability and access to services.
iii. Nutrition education. Lessons offered have helped adolescent girls, boys and
their communities diversify diets to include sources of iron, using the Malawi
six food groups, and locally available food items. The evaluation found an
increase in the consumption of certain foods like meat and meat products and
dark green leafy vegetables.
iv. Support to the districts by partners such as UNICEF, WFP and UNFPA
(JPGE programme), CARE Malawi and EU (Afikepo - implemented by
41
UNICEF and FAO in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture) helped to
leverage efforts and made it possible to carry out monitoring and supervision
of activities, although these were irregular.
v. Successful partnerships with various organizations and programmes also
helped to consolidate resources and efforts that in turn accelerated
performance and impact.
SO 6: Evaluate the extent to which the intervention promoted social behavioural
change towards the intake of diversified foods, including iron-rich foods among
adolescents
134. The IFA Intervention adopted the Social Behaviour Change Communication
(SBCC) approach to help adolescent girls and boys, and community members at
large understand the importance of adequate nutrition and IFA supplementation.
The intervention required frontline workers (SHN teachers and HSAs) to conduct
awareness talks before IFA supplementation in order to highlight benefits among
adolescent girls. Interviews with SHN teachers and HSAs revealed that such talks
were conducted mostly during initial stages of the intervention. Discussions with
various groups of girls confirmed the reports by frontline workers.
135. The Story Workshop Educational Trust (SWET), an implementing partner in the
project, also supported promotion of social behaviour change through the following
interventions:
1) Mobilizing and conducting meetings with traditional leaders to eliminate harmful
practices.
2) Empowering school-based structures such as parent-teacher associations
(PTAs) and mother groups to mobilize and engage parents on the uptake of
IFA tablets by girls.
3) Conducting community and school-based accountability meetings to reinforce
community action and data reporting on nutrition and IFA supplementation.
4) Awareness campaigns through community and school-based meetings and
radio programmes on IFA supplementation and the value of girls’ education.
136. SWET used theatre for development (TFD) tools, such as drama, radio programs,
and dialogue sessions with community members and traditional leaders. Through
these interventions, the project managed to reach 32,354 adolescent girls, 22,472
boys and 2,510 local leaders with behavioural change messages to promote good
nutrition and IFA uptake. Table 13 presents a summary of activities conducted by
SWET to support social behaviour change and the extent of reach in the project
districts.

Evaluation Criterion 4: Sustainability
Question 4.1 To what extent has the programme contributed to the strengthened
capacity of duty bearers and service providers in nutrition, health and other
relevant sectors?
137. The Adolescent IFA Intervention has trained and strengthened the capacity of
district personnel in the health and education sectors in areas of distribution,
administration and management of IFA tablets. In Salima, for instance, the project
trained around 200 out of the 366 HSAs available, 164 SHN teachers and 164
head teachers from the participating schools (Table 14). Teachers, can now
administer IFA tablets to pupils competently, a practice that will continue to reduce
workload for the HSAs. Interviews conducted showed that HSAs and SHN
teachers are able to order supplies from district pharmacy stores, manage them
and provide reports for compliance with minimum supervision.

Question 4.2: What evidence exists to inform the view that particular activities in
the project are being replicated beyond the initially intended reach of the project
(e.g. outside of geographic areas or target groups)?
138. By the time of the evaluation, IFA supplementation was limited to the schools and
health centres participating in the project across the three districts. The use of own
supplies from the Bilharzia program for young children to deworm adolescent girls
(10-19 years) by the district hospital in Salima is a good spill over effect example
of the IFA project because according to the DNO it has never happened before.
43
Question 4.3 What internal/external factors and drivers have contributed to or
constrained the sustainability of the programme?
139. In summary, the following are the internal and external factors that guarantee the
sustainability of this intervention:
i) Active involvement and capacity building of local communities and
structures. The IFA Intervention did not establish new structures. It used
existing structures with a long experience of working in the sectors and built
their capacities before putting them in the forefront to lead.
ii) Institutionalization of IFA activities into routine work of government
workers. HSAs ordered IFA tablets from district hospitals together with other
medical supplies for their health centres. Similarly, SHN teachers served the
same girls they teach daily, which increased trust and compliance. Many of
them continued to demonstrate commitment and the ability to plan and work
without any incentives.
iii) Engagement of the same team of district managers to monitor and
supervise activities in the field. This enabled them to carry out IFA activities
when they went out to perform other tasks.
iv) A major external factor of relevance on sustainability are the partnerships
and integration of IFA Interventions and those of large-scale projects working
with adolescents like the JPGE and Afikepo. Activities that these projects
leveraged, such as formation of adolescent clubs, Home-Grown School Meals
(HGSM), nutrition education and hygiene promotion, will continue to have an
impact on the adolescent girls in the years to come.
140. Conversely, over the past three-years the Adolescent IFA Intervention has faced
a number of misconceptions that have affected successful implementation and
compliance by adolescent girls. This is likely to continue if no awareness is created
within communities, local leaders and parents. There are also a number of
challenges that need to be addressed which have been summarised in the
subsequent sections on the report.
Question 4.4: To what extent are various stakeholders, including service providers,
community leaders, parents and households likely to sustain behaviour changes
related to the goals of the project after it has ended.
141. The IFA Intervention implemented a range of activities at different levels to address
iron deficiency and anaemia in adolescent girls 10-19 years of age. This section
discusses integration of the interventions in the national nutrition, health and
education systems using the six pillars of governance, financing, human
resources, service delivery, infrastructure and supplies, and information system.
44
142. For each pillar, the evaluation team analysed the level of integration based on the
existing data to judge the degree of likelihood by various stakeholders to sustain
behavioural changes and the best practices registered.
Governance
143. Full integration at this level is achieved when the mechanisms for accountability,
drafting of policies, plans and reports, coordination and resource allocation are
under the control of local authorities. Integration in the context of IFA Intervention
is partial when these responsibilities are shared between the health and education
system and other organizations. In Malawi, national policies including the Malawi
Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) III, National Multi-Sector Nutrition
Policy (NMSNP) and National Multi-Sector Nutrition Strategic Plan (NMSNSP) of
2018, the Multi-Sector Adolescent Nutrition Strategy (2019-2023) and Malawi
Vision 2063, have been developed by the government with support from
development partners placing nutrition on top of their agenda.
144. A large part of this project’s governance was undertaken by government ministries,
departments and frontline workers. DNHA provided overall coordination and
management at the national level. At the district level, the project was managed by
DNOs, PNHAOs and District Education Manager (DEM) who were working hand
in hand with SHN teachers and HSAs at the community level. Distribution of IFA
supplies from the district pharmacy store to health facilities was carried out by the
districts themselves. However, being a pilot project provision of resources
dedicated to the procurement of IFA tablets and distribution to district pharmacies
came from UNICEF. In terms of governance, there is currently partial integration
of the IFA Intervention in the nutrition, health and education systems in Malawi.
Funding
145. In this regard, funding refers to the raising of funds to support the IFA Intervention
program and the means by which these funds are obtained. Integration is complete
when the process of budgeting, fundraising and financing the program is entirely
handled and provided by the government and local authorities.
146. In Malawi, although malnutrition is considered a priority by the government through
adherence to various multi-sectoral nutrition platforms and development of
policies, strategies and plans, no national budget line is directly allocated to
nutrition. Departments prepare budgets every year, but when the Other Recurrent
Transactions (ORT) come there is no funding. Financing nutrition is heavily
dependent on development partners who are at liberty to fund activities of their
choice. For instance, funding for the Adolescent IFA Intervention was largely
provided by UNICEF. However, the government participated through provision of
45
healthcare and education frontline workers, and infrastructure for the storage and
provision of supplies to the girls. When the supplies expired, IFA supplementation
sessions came to an immediate halt in all the three districts. The integration of
funding for the IFA supplementation program therefore remains partial in the
country.
Service Delivery
147. IFA services are fully integrated if they are delivered within the local infrastructure
and under the responsibility of government health and education workers.
Integration is partial when this responsibility is shared between government health
workers and staff specifically recruited for the intervention.
148. Since its inception, the provision of IFA supplementation services was
institutionalized into routine and day-to-day activities of government structures.
Administration of tablets to the girls was performed within these structures under
the direct supervision of SHN teachers and HSAs. All supply and reporting
activities were delivered by government health and education workers. Integration
of service delivery is therefore full in the pilot districts.
Human Resources
149. UNICEF and DNHA provided training for staff involved in the project at its very
onset in year 1. The project selected 2 SHN teachers at each school - one was
trained along with the head teacher. It also trained Primary Education Advisors
(PEAs), HSAs and district senior officers (PNHAO, DNO and SHN coordinator).
The trainings offered were learning experiences and have equipped the personnel
with the necessary knowledge and skills, which they will continue to employ in
addressing iron deficiencies even after the program has ended.
150. However, a challenge voiced by districts, schools and health facilities was the high
turnover of trained staff. Some of the staff were posted to other locations, where
the IFA Intervention was not available, while newly assigned officers to replace
them were not part of the orientation training. The newly selected SHN and HSAs,
in most cases did not participate in the project complaining that they were not
trained. New PNHAOs and DNOs who also came to the districts after the training
had already been cascaded, had difficulties catching up. Integration of human
resources is therefore partial.
Infrastructure and Input Supply Chain
151. As mentioned in the preceding sections, IFA services were deployed within the
national health and school structures, which is an important and positive element
for sustainability. However, the delivery system for the IFA tablets ran parallel to
the national supply chain system by the Central Medical Stores Trust (CMST). The
46
CMST in this regard had no direct oversight of the ordering of supplies (as it was
done by UNICEF and DNHA). At the schools, space had shown to be limited and
was not conducive for the storage of nutrition supplies such as IFA tablets for a
period of one year. The supply chain system followed by the IFA Intervention and
storage infrastructure are still not well integrated to the CMST system and
therefore remain unsustainable in the end.
Health Information System
152. The monitoring system is fully integrated when the information technology
infrastructure, data collection and analysis are provided by government
institutions. In this program, data collection started from schools and health
facilities to district hospitals, which then consolidated and shared the data with
DNHA. IFA supplementation data are not part of the District Health Information
System (DHIS2). This component is therefore partially integrated (Table 15).

153. In summary, the general finding on sustainability is that the program
implementation has shown partial performance in different areas and, for this
reason, the likelihood that it can be sustained without donor support is low at the
moment. Nutrition activities as already stated depend on support from
development partners. Behavioural changes that stakeholders of the project can
sustain relate to those on nutrition education and diversification of diets to increase
consumption of iron rich foods. Interviews with communities and girls have
revealed that knowledge, willingness and practices are high, meaning that when
these foods are available, they will continue to consume them.
Evaluation Criterion 5: Gender and Human Rights
154. This section presents findings from both quantitative and qualitative data in line
with the OECD’s DAC criteria questions related to Gender and Human Rights. An
overview of the evaluation questions has already been provided above in section
3.0 (methodology).
47
Question 5.1: To what extent has the intervention been aligned with UNICEF’s
equity agenda in addressing the needs of the target groups (i.e. to what extent has
the initiative reached different groups, including those marginalized and living with
disabilities)?
155. In line with the Country Programme Document’s (CPD’s) focus on human-centred,
rights-based approach to programming, the IFA Intervention had the intention to
contribute toward greater gender equality between adolescent girls and boys. This
section details the extent to which that intention was realised.
156. The IFA Intervention specifically targeted adolescent girls for IFA supplements due
to the biological and physiological drivers that
cause this group to be more vulnerable to iron-

workers and community (girls, boys and mothers) In school girl FGD respondents
respondents.
157. The data suggests, however, that the recognition of this biological fact may have
been confounded with social norms of girls and women as child-bearers and child
carers, as a number of community-level respondents referenced this norm when
articulating the reasons for girls to be provided IFA supplements. It is plausible to
suggest that this linkage may be reinforcing inequitable gender norms within target
communities. The scope of this evaluation is insufficient to draw strong conclusions
in this regard, and so this hypothesis should be treated as a question for further
research.
158. Though key respondents noted that the UNICEF CPD focusses on social inclusion
of marginalised groups, including people with disabilities, no documentation
pertaining to how people with disabilities were to be targeted was made available
to the evaluation team. Such documentation may include specific disability
inclusion training for frontline workers and implementing partners, specific
approaches to ensure that activities are accessible, available and acceptable to
people with disabilities, and specific approaches to gathering monitoring data that
can be disaggregated by disability status, such that disability inclusion is
determined and responded to during programme delivery. Further information
regarding reach and benefits to people with disabilities is discussed below.
Question 5.2: Has the intervention contributed to equitable participation/reach and
benefits to various groups (what proportion of boys, girls and people with
disabilities)?
159. Adolescent girls, as the key target for the IFA supplements, consistently reported
engagement in the IFA supplementation intervention when tablets were available.
48
160. In general, there were no substantive differences in the scores on key indicators
for in-school girls compared to out-of-school girls, though there were varying
reports regarding the delivery of nutrition education classes. The strongest
determinants of whether an adolescent girl had attended a nutrition education
session were their enrolment in school and district of residence. Just over half
(54%) of in-school girls reported to have attended a nutrition education session,
compared to just 40 per cent of out-of-school girls. The district breakdown is shown
in Table 16. Girls in Salima were more likely to report having attended a nutrition
education session than in Dedza and Mangochi.

Short Set methodology. Overall, adolescent girls with disabilities scored slightly
worse than adolescent girls without disabilities across all key indicators, as shown
in Table 16. Disability inclusion requires intention of inclusion, meaning that an
intervention that will make an effort to understand the specific needs of girls with
disabilities, will adapt the outreach approach with these needs considered, and will
monitor the extent to which girls with disabilities are included such that they can
fully participate, benefit from and lead an intervention. These findings suggest that,
though there may not have been discrimination (i.e. intention to marginalise) there
was no inclusion (i.e. intention to include) either. This could explain why girls with
disabilities scored slightly worse than girls without disabilities on all indicators.

Lessons Learned
162. Low sensitization resulted in uncertainty about project implementation and
reduced acceptance of the IFA tablets by communities, parents and girls.
Table 6 under the efficiency section shows that UNICEF budgeted for IFA tablets
only for the first and second years since the project was for pilot purposes only.
49
Nevertheless, it did not inform health workers, SHN teachers and other
government frontline workers at the district level adequately about this. Therefore,
all of them expected a three-year supply to be available. When the supply ended
in the second year, there was self-judgement that the project had no resources to
proceed hence, other activities also slowed down.
163. Similarly, communities and parents in the three districts lacked the basic
understanding of the IFA tablets and had various misconceptions because they
were not sensitized at the beginning according to the FGDs conducted.
164. In areas where sensitization was done well by mother groups, school management
committees (SMCs), HSAs and Agriculture Extension Development Coordinators
(AEDCs), for instance in TA Kambalame and other parts of TA Kalonga in Salima,
the project recorded high acceptance rates of the tablets because the stakeholders
understood the benefits.
165. The project became aware of the problem and engaged SWET in 2020. SWET
addressed misconceptions around IFA supplementation through community
dialogue sessions, radio and drama in communities. Nevertheless, three main
factors affected the impact SWET would have made:
i. Late approval of SBCC messages by the Ministry of Education, which
delayed SWET in commencing its work on the ground.
ii. COVID-19 pandemic – Unfortunately, barely 4 months into the program
SWET’s activities coincided with peaks in COVID-19 infections and
restrictions on crowding. SWET reprogrammed and started doing door to
door awareness meetings. However, this reduced potentially high numbers
of households that could have been reached had it been mass awareness
campaigns.
iii. Late engagement - The organization was engaged in the program late in
2020 while intervention had already started in 2018.
166. Lack of clear roles of the PNHAO, DNO and health workers created confusion
and neglect of work. IFA tablets were initially supplied from pharmacy stores at
the district hospital and the District Nutrition Office (DNO), according to the
intervention design. In the course of implementation, the project started working
with Principal Nutrition, HIV and AIDS Officers (PNHAOs) without official
communication to the DNOs. This created tension and affected working
relationships between the two offices in all the three districts.
167. Likewise, SHN teachers, SHN coordinators and HSAs indicated that they had no
idea who to consult at the hospital as there was no appointed person to coordinate
issues related to IFA tablets among the pharmacist, AEHO and DNO. For instance,
during stock outs none of the three could take the lead responsibility to inform
schools and health centres of the problem or address restocking concerns.
Schools and health facilities used to consult each one of them separately and got
varied information. There is a need to draw ToRs for the PNHAO and DNO offices
to streamline coordination, monitoring and management of activities.
50
168. Inability by the office of the DNO to compute data, from the schools and
health centres, affected reporting of the project at district and national levels.
As data were coming from the districts, DNO offices were overwhelmed to capture
it in computers due to their busy schedules. The evaluation team found heaps of
report forms piled in the offices. None of the three DNOs had electronic data ready
to share with the evaluation team. In Salima, the project placed an intern in the
office of the PNHAO who computed the data for a few months and shared it with
the evaluation team. The recommendation is to include IFA data in the District
Health Information System (DHIS2) and engage clerks who already enter data for
other programs like Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition
(CMAM), malaria, tuberculosis and antenatal care at district hospitals to capture it.
There is therefore a need to orient 2 or 3 clerks at every hospital about the project
and data entry.
169. Implementation of the Adolescent IFA Intervention in conjunction with JPGE
II and III in the same districts has enabled UNICEF and DNHA leverage efforts
and accelerate impact. On a positive note, JPGE II and III provided additional
resources and support over the three years of the Adolescent IFA Intervention.
This support included 1) training of teachers and health workers to lead the
implementation of the IFA activities, 2) provision of resources to SWET for
awareness campaigns around IFA supplementation, life skills and child marriages,
and 3) provision of reporting tools when they got finished in the districts. These
activities enhanced quality of service delivery and impact.
Challenges of the IFA Intervention
170. Although this intervention has met its goal of contributing to improving the
nutritional status of adolescent girls (10-19 years) in the three pilot districts, the
implementation process has been challenging. These challenges are not only the
reasons for shortfalls in implementation, but also suggest that the impact would
have been greater had the project operated smoothly.
171. The main ones (for example those that have not been discussed in detail already
in the preceding sections of the report) are:
172. External factors beyond the control of the project
i. Covid-19, which was first detected in early April 2020, in Malawi, disrupted
activities in the entire lifespan of the project.
ii. Frequent political violence during disputed presidential elections of May
2019.
Project officers worked remotely for a good part of 2020 and 2021 in fear of the
consequences of the two external factors. Implementation of activities was affected
in one way or the other. As an example, on 23rd March 2020 the government of
Malawi closed schools as part of imposing stricter COVID-19 preventive measures.
Schools remained closed for more than eight months. During this period,
51
adolescent girls took the IFA tablets and recorded the compliance cards
themselves at home under the supervision of their parents. Administration of
tablets at health facilities was not possible because crowding in public places was
limited to 50 people.
173. Lack of joint monitoring of activities in schools and health centres. PNHAOs,
DNOs, SHN coordinators and the district teams used the vehicles they had from
other projects to monitor activities. However, the project provided fuel only once
toward the end of 2021 after the IFA supplies had already ended. The fuel provided
at MK90,000 was not enough to visit all the schools and health centres. Project
activities remained largely unmonitored within quarters and across all the three
years.
174. Lack of monthly and quarterly review meetings at the district level. The IFA
Intervention held quarterly meetings at the national level where progress and
planning of activities were discussed. The minutes of these meetings were shared
with the evaluation team. However, interviews with PNHAOs, DNOs and SHN
coordinators revealed that no such meetings took place in the districts. Lack of
necessary facilities and limited connectivity in the districts made it difficult to
convene virtual meetings that would include all the concerned parties.
175. Inability to procure and distribute albendazole tablets. Interviews with key
persons and schools involved showed that albendazole tablets were not provided
to the health facilities and schools under the IFA Intervention. In Salima,
albendazole was provided to girls in 2020 under the Bilharzia program which the
district hospital ensures routinely to deworm masses.
176. Low implementation of nutrition education to girls and boys. SHN teachers
and HSAs only briefed girls and boys on the Malawi six food groups according to
the interviews conducted. Teachers did not have reference materials or guides and
there was limited time to do thorough nutrition education as part of IFA
supplementation sessions since everything happened within class time by one
SHN teacher. FGDs with boys in all the three districts revealed that they had been
hardly reached with nutrition messages.
177. Lack of data to show progress of the project. Inability by the District Nutrition
Offices to compute results from schools and health facilities resulted in the lack of
data for the IFA Intervention. The only electronic data from Salima that the districts
were able to share with the evaluation team were collated by the intern placed by
UNICEF. This has made it difficult to quantify some of the indicators of the project
using routine monitoring data.
178. Staff transfers and turnover. One difficulty voiced by the participants was the
high turnover of trained staff. Replacements, if made, were done after the trained
ones had already left. There was lack of orientation and transfer of information,
which was creating dilemma on how to continue the project in various schools and
health facilities. The project trusted that head teachers and SHN teachers trained
would cascade the knowledge and skills to their colleagues, but this model did not
52
work well as every teacher wanted to attend the first training themselves. When
they were left out, they felt rejected and refused to consider themselves part of this
project. Trained SHN teachers therefore experienced work overload in this project
because they could hardly be assisted by their fellow teachers who did not receive
the first training. At the health facilities, HSAs newly employed and deployed
lacked the orientation also since they come on the job with the Malawi School
Certificate of Education (MSCE) and do not receive any formal nutrition education.
Nutritionists and senior staff members who joined the project after it had already
started, such as the PNHAO and DNO for Salima, were never trained which made
the implementation and supervision of activities difficult.
179. Delays in the submission of reports to health facilities. SHN teachers had
difficulties taking reports to health facilities because most of them were located far
away from the schools. Some schools failed to submit reports for particular months
and provided them later which complicated the filing process, carried out by the
district nutritionists.
180. Reporting tools got finished in most schools and were not restocked as
quickly as wanted. As a result, some schools and health facilities stopped
sending reports. Other schools and communities devised their own tools. JPGE III
bought various additional tools in July 2021 (compliance cards, monthly community
platforms and monthly healthy facility tools). Nevertheless, as already pointed out
the tools came at a time when provision of IFA supplementation had almost
stopped due to lack of supplies and therefore remained unused in most of the
schools and health facilities.
181. Limited funding for nutrition by the government. Nutrition activities in the
districts are donor dependent. The government does not fund despite districts
putting them on the budget yearly. Even in the District Implementation Plan (DIP),
there is no vote for nutrition. District offices, UNICEF, OXFAM, CISANET, CISONA
and Save the Children have been analysing budgets, particularly in Salima and
lobbying through District Executive Committees (DEC) and full council8 for
inclusion of nutrition funding on the government budget. DNHA, UNICEF and
CSONA have taken a step further and initiated advocacy meetings with members
of the parliamentary committee, development partners and decision makers from
the central government for budgeting and finance. Positive results have started
emanating as a result of these efforts according to the PNHAOs and DNOs. In the
agriculture and education sectors, there has been an increase in the funding under
Other Related Activities Transaction (ORT), which cover nutrition. In Salima, plans
were underway to allocate money from the local tax revenues to the PNHAO’s
office, for nutrition activities.
8 Full district council comprises of the executive committee (MPs, all sector heads of
departments, Traditional Authorities (TAs) and counsellors. The lobbying is done for the council
to advocate for inclusion and funding of nutrition on the development agenda of the country
53
Box 3: Key strengths and best practices for IFA supplementation
The following are the key strengths and best practices observed:
i. A strong policy environment that puts nutrition on top of the development
agenda. The United Nations has cited Malawi as having a very high
commitment to nutrition through the Hunger and Nutrition Commitment
Index where the country is ranked number 2 among 45 countries.
ii. Increasing number of NGOs, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs),
Development Partners (DPs), Community Based Organizations (CBOs)
and others working at community level interested in adolescent nutrition to
reduce iron deficiency and anaemia.
iii. Existence of nutrition coordination structures at national, sectoral, district
and community levels. DNHA has posts at all these levels.
iv. The SHN programme with a pool of teachers is available and modelled to
promote agriculture, nutrition, health and sustainable environment
targeting all school-going children, including adolescents.
v. Decentralization of activities to district level, which is helping to ensure
effective and timely implementation of agriculture and nutrition activities.
6.0 Conclusion and Recommendations
182. In conclusion, the Adolescent IFA Intervention is a success looking at the impact
and lessons generated. The design used, which involved putting government
frontline workers at national, district and community levels to lead in the
implementation of activities, has shown to work well and is sustainable. Using the
3-year generous support from the government of the Netherlands, the intervention
is one of the first of its kind in Malawi to pre-test the use of iron and folic acid to
reduce anaemia among adolescent girls (10-19 years) and has shown tangible
results. No study has been conducted to assess levels of anaemia most recently
by the NSO. Nevertheless, with 1,820,000 IFA tablets the project procured
between 2018 and 2021 (52 for each one of the 35,000 girls targeted), most of
which have been ingested by the girls on spot in the presence of SHN teachers
and HSAs, coupled with improvements on diets as shown by results from the 24-
hour dietary recall, reductions in anaemia are anticipated to be huge in the three
pilot districts. Activities under the three key result areas (IFA supplementation,
deworming with albendazole and nutrition education) synchronized well and
should be scaled up. Co-existences, collaboration and coordination present with
large-scale adolescent projects like the JPGE, Afikepo and ONSE should be
fostered to continue leveraging resources and improving quality of service delivery.
183. As per the WHO threshold for nutritional deficiencies, intermittent iron and folic
acid supplementation is recommended if anaemia prevalence is 20 per cent or
higher among non-pregnant women of reproductive age (15-49 years old).
54
184. The IFA Intervention is therefore an unfinished agenda because anaemia remains
high among adolescent girls in the rest of the districts in Malawi where no such
interventions have taken place. Between 2004 and 2010, rates of anaemia
dropped by 13 percentage points from 42.2 per cent to 28.6 per cent, but these
gains were reversed, and prevalence increased by 6 percentage points to 35.3 per
cent according to the MDHS of 2015/2016. Many actions remain undone to scale
up successful and pre-tested interventions for a wider impact.
185. The government of Malawi with support from UNICEF is committed to scaling up
the IFA supplementation to other districts in the country. After starting with the six
districts, UNICEF and DNHA received funding from the German government
through Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) and sub-granted it to the Hunger
Project for the implementation of adolescent nutrition in Phalombe and Nsanje
from 2020-2023 under the SUN project. Most recently, UNICEF has started
funding the Adolescent IFA Intervention in Kasungu and Blantyre (2020-2025, a
period of 5 years) under the JPGE and KfW-SUN funded project by Farmers Union
of Malawi (FUM) respectively. These efforts have brought the total number of
districts receiving Adolescent IFA Interventions with grants from UNICEF to 10.
186. Besides this, with funding from the World Bank and the Global Financing Facility
(GFF) the government of Malawi is implementing a 5 year (2018-2023) US$60
million Investing in Early Years (IEY) for Growth and Productivity project in 13
districts of Malawi. In the districts, the project is benefiting 1.2 million children under
five years, 2.2 million adolescent boys and girls of ages 11–19 years, and 370,500
pregnant and lactating women. For adolescent girls, IEY is providing iron-folate
supplements and deworming tablets to girls who are in and out of school. The 13
districts are Rumphi, Mchinji, Ntcheu, Mangochi, Machinga, Neno, Chikwawa,
Zomba, Likoma, Mwanza, Dowa, Thyolo, and Chiradzulu. UNICEF, as one of the
agencies championing the sector, should leverage on the existing projects and
scale up IFA programming to at least four of the remaining eight districts (Ntchisi,
Nkhotakota, Nkhata Bay, Mzimba, Karonga, Balaka and Mulanje) by 2022
depending on the severity of the problem and the availability of funding. Chitipa,
not listed anywhere above, has a lower prevalence of anaemia in women of
reproductive age 15-49 years at 16.1 per cent according to the MDHS of
2015/2016. Adolescent interventions in the districts should continue to focus on
nutrition education and dietary diversity.
187. The evaluation supports scaling up in phases as already done with UNICEF
support to allow time for standardizing procedures, addressing challenges
identified and learning additional lessons for a wider application.
188. Table 17 below summarizes recommendations to overcome identified bottlenecks
in the implementation of the scaled-up phase.

including copies for SHN coordinators for them

do not receive copies of the monthly reports from
the schools at the moment.
5. Weekly registers are not user friendly, and SHN
teachers find it difficult to follow records of
beneficiary girls due to the way they have been
designed. Schools and health facilities have
already informed UNICEF and DNHA about this.
Therefore, the design needs to be simplified for
easy record-keeping and follow up.
6. Another key reporting change to make the whole
process inclusive and efficient is that schools
should submit their reports to Teacher
Development Centres (TDCs) where teachers
go every month for Continuous Professional
Development (CPD). This will reduce delays in
the submission of reports. The AEHO should
collect reports from all the schools at the CPD
and submit them to health facilities. Health
surveillance assistants (HSAs) can then submit
both school and health facility reports to the
district nutritionist. Thereafter, the district team
should meet briefly every month to validate the
district report before sharing with the DNHA to
improve accuracy and quality of data at the
national level.

8. Train 2-3 clerks at each district hospital about

This should be done in 2022, during the
planning phase of the next program cycle.
Once the program commences, it should be
completed throughout.

as suggested above, can also make
stakeholders recognize it belongs to the
government.
At the community level, there should be more
sensitization and increased involvement of
structures on the ground, including Care
Groups, Mother Groups and Community Health
Nurses, from the very beginning of the project.
