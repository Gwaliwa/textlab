We are three weights for society,
Poor, black and peripheral,
Lives that fight for dignity,
In a world that sees us as risk.
Born in the periphery, where the sun sets,
Black skin, steel heart,
Where life is a constant not,
And hope, a hug.
Poor, without riches, but rich in dreams,
Walking against the tide,
In the hands, the marks of a hard work,
In the soul, the strength of those who believe.
Black, color of night, resistance,
Heir to a struggle story,
Carries persistence in the chest,
Of whom for justice, fight.
Peripheral, margin, forgotten,
But with your head held high,
In the chest, a fearless heart,
In the mouth, the voice of life.
We are three weights for society,
Poor, black and peripheral,
But we carry the truth,
Who makes the fight, your craft.
And even if they judge us inferior,
Our voices will not be silenced,
We are warriors, we are winners,
And our lives will never be erased.
