Evaluation of migration interventions in Mexico, Guatemala,
Honduras and El Salvador Country Report: Honduras
Executive summary
Context: Honduras is a Central American country, mainly of origin and return of migrant population.
The exodus responds to poverty and lack of job opportunities, as well as at high levels of insecurity
citizen, violence and the need for family reunification; coupled with deep political instability and
high levels of corruption. These structural problems are motivations for accelerated growth
of child migration; whether they migrate alone or accompanied. In recent years they migrate north
(United States and Mexico) in the so -called "caravans." As migration increases, the
return; According to official sources, between 2016 and May 2021, 58,453 NNA, of these have been returned
34,785 accompanied and 23,668 not accompanied; 38,392 boys and 20,061 girls. The highest number of
NNA returned comes from Mexico: 48,926, and then the United States: 7,831. Nna often returned
They face stigmatization by the community, social exclusion, violence, displacement
internal and extreme poverty. A problem, increasingly present in Honduras, is internal displacement
Forced of NNA, whose main cause is violence, from maras and gangs.
UNICEF's proposal, Children on the Move (com). Since 2016, UNICEF, from its global strategy
Children on the Move (com) proposed to offer an answer to the needs of protection of the NNA in
Migration situation; and does it through six policies (6 polycy asks): 1. protect the NNA against the
exploitation and violence; 2. put an end to the arrest of the NNA establishing alternative measures for their
careful; 3. Keep families together; 4. Ensure access to education and health of NNA; 5.
Address the structural causes that cause NNA to abandon their homes, and 6. Eradicate xenophobia
and discrimination. In the framework of COM, the priorities of UNICEF in Honduras were directed,
mainly, to generate an environment of attention and protection of children returned and displaced by violence,
For this purpose, collaborating with the State to provide effective and timely answers to childhood in
Migration situation, particularly returned childhood.
Object of the evaluation: in the absence of an explicit subregional strategy document for COM, it was defined
the object of evaluation as those interventions in the field of nna migration that: i) that have been
beneficiaries, totally or partially, for the capital seed com; ii) respond to local needs; III)
They respond to the 6 Global Policies, and IV) are pilot experiences or cases around which to learn
or climb. Under these criteria, the interventions selected for being more representative were:

Purpose, objectives, scopes and users of the evaluation: the evaluation, of an intermediate nature
and as a formative process it valued the relevance, efficacy and sustainability of interventions. Its purpose
was to respond to the commitment acquired by UNICEF to evaluate interventions after receipt of
a seed capital, as well as identify opportunities and conditions necessary for expansion or replica
successful of the interventions developed; and provide opportunities to achieve greater coordination

Among countries and strengthening cross -border work, to improve your response to the needs of NNA
in migration situation. The temporal scope of the evaluation was from 2017 to November 2020 and
Its geographical scope included 26 municipalities in 8 departments, all vulnerable to migration.
The evaluation of COM in Honduras is inserted into a multipo -evaluation process that includes Mexico, the
Salvador and Guatemala, so this evaluation is a case study for this process. The general objective
From the evaluation it was “learning about the implementation of the different proposed and developed models
by UNICEF to respond to the different phases (origin, transit, reception and return) of the flows
Migratories in the four countries that implement the initiative: Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala ”.
The users of the evaluation results are the managers and officers of Lacro and the country office; the
strategic allies (authorities and government entities, civil society organizations) and its
families.
METHODOLOGY. The country evaluation has a qualitative - descriptive design, attending a design no
experimental, with theoretical, participatory and use -oriented approach, that is, he sought to understand the evolution
of analysis categories as factors related to interventions and their relationship together from the
Perspective of key actors. No type or statistical analysis of information was performed.
In methodological terms, the information lifting was carried out in virtual modality due to the
Pandemia by COVID-19 and corresponding sanitary measures. Information lifting techniques
They included the documentary review (approximately 70 documents); 3 work sessions with the team
of unicef-honduras; 14 interviews (12 individual and 2 collective) and 2 focal groups, consulting in total
29 people (9 men and 20 women), including UNICEF personnel, public and private institutions
Allied and relevant actors in the country with relevant information. Some limitations were: i) the
Impossibility of a face -to -face field work for pandemia, so everything was made virtually; ii) the
Impossibility of listening to NNA's voices, also for pandemia; iii) changes in the evaluation team,
specifically the Honduras evaluator, which implied that the last one did not have direct access to some
key actors; iv) UNICEF reports are general, not specifying the interventions evaluated;
and v) Lack of information on how interventions contribute to the expected results of UNICEF.
Main findings. The main findings of the evaluation are based on the evidence found
In the reviewed documents and the answers obtained by the actors to the questions asked in the
Interviews
RELEVANCE. UNICEF HONDURA INTERVENTIONS show adequate alignment in three
Levels: 1) At the institutional level, with the programmatic frame, 2) at the operational level, with the needs of
Nna migrants and 3) nationwide, with priorities related to childhood and adolescence protection
Migrant Regarding the first, OP OP work is in line with the framework
Com programmatic and its polycy Asks. Supported interventions are consistent and complementary between
Yes, providing a comprehensive response to different care needs. At the operational level, interventions
They are relevant because they start from a correct identification of the effects of the migration phenomenon in
Nna migrants, which has served to guide services and programmatic offer to respond to these
differentiated effects and impacts derived from the different dynamics of human mobility,
incorporating gender and higher interest approaches to childhood. At the country level, UNICEF's support for these
interventions is relevant because it corresponds to the migration regulatory frameworks and priorities
nationals in terms of protection and attention to childhood and migrant adolescence.
UNICEF guided the action of its programmatic components education and protection to develop
complementary initiatives with each other, through projects that since its formulation contemplated the
particular needs of returnee; and prioritized municipalities highly vulnerable to migration. TO
through the emotional recovery strategy for girls and boys with emphasis on returned migrants,
It contributed to the emotional recovery of NNA with specific emotional problems, using a
playful methodology. The need for comprehensive care for the right to psychic integrity was answered
of childhood in a situation of returned migration. With UNICEF educational bridges he wanted to guarantee access to

period between 2017-2020. UNICEF
NNA quality education in migration or return situation, through its academic leveling and
School reintegration, in addition, the improvement of the pedagogical and academic skills of educators, and the
awareness of fathers, mothers and caregivers about the importance and right to children's education
and girls. With the model "Reintegration of returned childhood", UNICEF promoted the integral reintegration of the
boy or girl to her family and the community (when the best interests of a boy/girl requires it), which
He involved monitoring each case to guarantee reintegration from an educational approach,
Motivational, family and community.
The three models of attention and protection were adapted to address the needs of the context
Honduran, tested and improved; However, the presence of the gender approach in its design and
Implementation was not systematic, nor the interculturality approach, despite the fact that the CPD 2017-
2021 focused on child
Honduran The non -incorporation of the aforementioned approaches, as minimal, did not allow UNICEF, or
decision makers, had clarity about specific strategies that should be joined, within the framework
of the different models, in order to address particular and differentiated needs.
Efficacy: interventions in Honduras have contributed to the achievement of the objectives set in the framework
PRO programmatic for the country, in terms of strengthening the attention to NNA in return and
Community and family reintegration. In all cases they have managed to influence institutional advances and
Strengthen procedures and actions for the development of a comprehensive NNA protection system in
migration, return and reintegration situation. A fundamental achievement of the intervention linked to the model
of psychosocial attention was the design and adaptation of a methodology for Honduras, to improve the state
Emotional Nna affected by migration. It was even able to evaluate the emotional recovery of children and
Girls From a random sample of 352 NNA, evidence of improvement in 30% of them was obtained, in
Social skills, self -esteem and coping capacity. In addition, 7,291 NNA were benefited from
The methodology and 189 with severe emotional problems were referred to professionals in psychology.
With educational bridges, the right of access to education became effective. With CNR 660 NNA returned
They were schooling; With ACOES the program was implemented in 11 educational centers benefiting 1,094
Nna; And with Cinde, 223 educational centers were reached for the modeling of PE, and was found through a
Survey that PE contributed to the fact that in 72% of the educational centers, acts of violence were reduced and
They will benefit 46., 583 NNA. Educational bridges became an answer to the challenges of education
Honduran to guarantee rights to NNA and provide an inclusive educational offer, for the
Reincorporation to educational centers and permanence in them. Also to attend overness
referred to boys and girls who are not of timely age to be to a certain school.
The "returned childhood reintegration" model managed to identify cases of children with needs
Specific protection. NNA monitoring procedures were strengthened and according to the needs
detected, families approached the services that are developed with municipalities or with
State institutions or others. UNICEF facilitated seed funds as another component of reintegration. He
Accompaniment of UNICEF has not only been financial, but also strategic. He favored an encounter
On reintegration with international experts to share experiences and enrich the model.
He also contributed for the development of a childhood protocol in a migration situation referred to the
reintegration and reintegration of boys and girls, and supported to publicize the model and add other donors.
As a expected result, today UNICEF partners: CNR, ACOES, Cinde., CRH, Dinaf, have new
skills. UNICEF strengthened its abilities for optimal development and scope of results.
In addition, the strategy that Hilvanar UNICEF achieved impacted municipalities, generating better conditions for
Childhood in a situation of returned migration. The narrative in front of people and the deported children changed
of exclusion and discrimination to "welcome." UNICEF approach in municipalities led to strengthening
capacities of municipal governments, influence their municipal plans to introduce results
Specific for childhood in a migration situation, and implement and adapt the different models for their
Attention and protection, from the reality of each municipality.

Sustainability: COM Honduras interventions have reached conditions to be sustainable. The
Rective public institutions in education and childhood welcomed the models worked with UNICEF and
They improved their capacity to respond to childhood needs in migration. On the other hand, the
Interventions promoted by UNICEF were inserted into the legal and political structure of Sigadehh, which
favors the sustainability of its results and opens opportunities for its continuity from the
Public institutionality. But there are risks regarding sustainability, among them, the lack of assignment
of resources from the State and the mobility of personnel.
On the other hand, from UNICEF technical and financial accompaniment, civil society partners have
improved their capabilities and have specialized knowledge, which allows them to manage the models
developed. They contribute to sustainability: the voluntary work that characterizes the CRH and Acoes, the
Interventions and awareness products in communities around childhood protection.
The three models promoted by UNICEF have conditions to be scalable nationwide and
international. The evaluation considers that equally relevant for scalability is the strategy of
UNICEF that joints all its childhood interventions in a migration situation. Systematize it
and spread it, in addition to constituting an accountability exercise, could involve a path to improve
Its sustainability and replicability. It would be a useful tool for the generation of collaboration networks and
mobilization they contribute to that sustainability and replicability.
Conclusions
RELEVANCE. UNICEF interventions in Honduras were properly aligned with needs
of nna. Its alignment with the state agenda allowed the development of innovative proposals such as
Educational bridges, a model of psychosocial attention to NNA and a community reintegration model,
which were adapted to the context of the country and the needs of the NNA in migration. The
Interventions are relevant with government and local policies, and with national regulations. In turn,
These interventions correspond to UNICEF's international and national interests and contribute to
The achievement of the SDGs. A purpose of UNICEF, together with its strategic allies, was to provoke
Safety and roots conditions for the NNA vulnerable to migration. The Global Children On program
The Move did not imply introducing the approach to childhood in migration, because
Honduras's office was already doing it, but yes, that it was more evident and articulated. Now,
It remains a need to ensure the implementation of relevant approaches such as equality of
gender and intercultural, which will allow visualizing the needs, differentiated and particular responses,
according to the conditions and circumstances of each NNA.
EFFECTIVENESS. The interventions evaluated managed to fulfill their purposes, being key factors for this, their
focus on municipalities vulnerable to migration; the adaptation capacity of UNICEF strategies
Honduras and the relevance of the proposed models. Psychosocial and psycho -emotional attention taught
For the Honduran Red Cross, it reached more than 7,000 girls and boys, and effectively achieved improvement (measure
with a set of indicators) in the emotional state of NNA in a migration situation or affected by the
migration. Educational bridges on his side, generated links between school, family and community; and it was established
In an answer to the challenges of Honduran education to guarantee rights to NNA and provide an offer
Inclusive and quality educational. The family and community reintegration model approached families
opportunities for the satisfaction of needs, in order to contribute to the roots in their communities and prevent
Forced migration. However, in each model specific situations should be resolved: with respect to PE,
UNICEF must determine the continuity of its support for SEDUC for its implementation in other municipalities.
In the case of psychosocial and psycho -emotional attention to NNA, it constitutes a challenge to achieve projects
of longer term to include the monitoring and monitoring of the children addressed. In the case of
Reintegration Model, the main challenge is its sustainability for public institutionality.
SUSTAINABILITY. The three interventions evaluated: educational bridges, psychosocial care model and
psycho -emotional, and model for reintegration, have scalability conditions, not only at the level
8

National, but also international. They are methodologies that have been effective and adaptable to
contexts and needs and are sustainable as long as there are installed capabilities and products of
knowledge they contribute to their continuity. However, budget support is required from the
State, which puts at high risk the sustainability of processes and their benefits.
Some learned lessons that gave rise to good practices are: i) the use of the structure
of Sigadehah to articulate strategies in the municipal councils, strengthens public institutionality
for the fulfillment of its obligations for the protection of childhood rights in migration;
ii) Strengthen community work with grassroots organizations and service providers, in addition to
develop their capabilities through technical and financial accompaniment, allowed UNICEF to arrive
Really to rights holders; iii) pays for efficacy, the integration of different components of UNICEF
contributing to the same strategy; iv) technical accompaniment close to its partners, enhancing
capacities, articulation spaces and improvements in their institutional skills; v) The processes of
adaptation of the models to the needs that arise and to the context; and vi) spontaneous coordination
No formalisms, to organize quickly in front of emergencies and provide timely answers to
Context needs.
Lessons to learn: i) The introduction of models without establishing an output strategy puts in
risk the sustainability of these; ii) the non -incorporation of approaches as gender and intercultural equality,
prevented incorporating and referring to particular and differentiated problems and needs of NNA in
Migration situation; iii) some projects require a follow -up phase to know the effect on
the life of children; and iv) the limited systematization of the strategies implemented hinders their
Knowledge and scalability.
Recommendations: The following recommendations have been prioritized from the preliminary session of
Return of findings developed with OP and Lacro. Respond to evaluation findings and
They focus on actions that could develop or boost the OP of Honduras. The recommendations were
reviewed and prioritized by OP, taking into account their relevance and ability to implement them.
1. Strengthen transverse approaches especially gender and intercultural equality in future
interventions in favor of childhood in a situation of returned migration and displaced by violence,
in accordance with the CPD 2017-2021 and institutional mandates of UNICEF and the United Nations.
2. UNICEF for the development of its strategy implements several projects with several allies, all
complementing each other, but formulated and implemented separately. It is recommended
formulate a systematization of the integrality of the strategy to contribute to the management of the
knowledge and scalability.
3. It is recommended to improve communication and articulation mechanisms to provoke synergies
They contribute to UNICEF interventions. This could contribute to increasing work
interagencial.
4. Assess the continuity of work and support with the SEDUC in the field of educational bridges, for the
modeling and implementation of the model.
5. The methodology of psychosocial and psycho -emotional care has been successful. It is recommended
strengthen it and prepare it for replicability.
6. Currently all personnel destined for the reintegration methodology are funded by the
Cooperation, including UNICEF, IOM and ACNUR. Institutional sustainability is required, so
So much, a gradual output strategy is recommended, to ensure the continuity of the action and the
appropriation by the DINAF.

Country Report: Honduras
I. Introduction
In 2017, UNICEF headquarters in New York granted UNICEF country (op) offices (op) in Mexico,
Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, a seed capital destined to strengthen their programmatic work in the
Childhood area in migration, within the framework of its Global Children on the Move initiative (hereinafter
Com). According to Lacro, the Seed Fund was not conditioned on interventions or objectives
specific, so that each office developed its own proposal, and since then, the funds are
they used to strengthen those existing interventions, prioritized by each OP according to their
Local context, considering generating positive impacts for NNA in migration.
Two years later, Lacro initiated an external and formative evaluation of the implementation of Com
in each of the countries mentioned. It is a multipurpose evaluation of UNICEF's interventions
Regarding children and adolescents (NNA) in irregular migration situation under the framework
COM. As it is a multipurry evaluation, and to contribute to learning, evaluation
It included four country evaluations to highlight the main COM interventions, as well as the different
OP strategies around them. The country evaluations were developed through case studies,
Considering the four implementing countries, that is, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, and
He focused on the transformative character and on the scalability opportunities of national interventions.
Case studies were a first level of evaluation analysis, for which a report of
Evaluation by country regarding interventions com. The findings of this first level of analysis of the
evaluation were key supplies for a second and third level of analysis, where the assessment was made
Multipaís and prospective regional, respectively. The findings, conclusions and analysis recommendations
Of this second and third level, Multipaís Evaluation Report were reflected in the final report. The reports of
Case study were also part of the annexes of the global evaluation report.
This is the case study report corresponding to Honduras and is structured of the following
way: section I is this introduction, section II narrates the country's context where the
interventions and describe the main efforts promoted by UNICEF to implement them, the
Section III presents the object of the evaluation, section IV the purpose and objectives of the evaluation process, the
Section V provides more details in relation to the scope of the evaluation, section VI mentions the
Criteria and evaluation questions, section VII includes information in relation to methodology, section
VIII describes the limitations found during the evaluation and the mitigation measures that were considered,
Section IX refers to evaluation ethical considerations, section X addresses the findings of agreement
At each evaluation criteria, section XI presents the conclusions, section XII includes a summary of the
good practices and lessons to learn and finally, section XIII provides the most recommendations
relevant to this evaluation.
II. Context and background
Migration is a worldwide phenomenon that no region in the world is on the sidelines. The phenomenon
Migratory has multidimensional causes linked to economic, social, political, cultural and
Environmental Being the economic one of the main causes of emigration, they are developed countries1,

nationals, including those in an irregular situation, this prerogative is subject to its rights obligations
humans, according to the «International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all migratory workers and their
relatives »(United Nations, 1990), and should consider the situation particularly at risk experienced by children and
teenagers migrating alone or accompanied (United Nations 1990).

Those who attract a large number of migrants, for assuming great job opportunities and
consequence, better economic forecasts.
Central America, and as a whole Mesoamerica, is a region characterized by directed migratory flows
fundamentally to the United States. These migrations are increasing. According to the flow report
Migratories in Central America, North America and the Caribbean of the International Migration Organization
(IOM), the accumulated total of Central American migrants presented to Mexican authorities shows
an increase of 52% in the period from January to March 2018, compared to the same period of the
2017.2
According to IOM information, the main destination of Honduran migrants is states
United, followed by Mexico and Spain, and emigration is mainly concentrated in young people, 3 whose
ages range between 18 and 32 years.4
On the profile of migrants, 2019 studies show that 61% are made up of people who
They only attended primary school, 27.1% with secondary education, 5.6% studied university education,
1.4% with technical education and people without education reached 4.9%. In addition, there has been an ascent
of people with secondary education who decide to leave the country, a phenomenon that was demonstrated with the
"Caravans", when primary education teachers left their jobs to join the
same, arguing that their salaries were not enough for the maintenance of their family nucleus. The
main economic activity to which migrants are dedicated in agriculture, then workers
of the maquila and business or business employees, whose income does not exceed the minimum wage. With the
Caravans are included among migrants of the elderly, people with disabilities and members
of the LGBTI population.5
Given the conditions of the country, the immigration profile of Honduras is mainly of emigration, which is
confirmed by the IOM, however, the same conditions that force to migrate, especially violence
and insecurity, have brought new internal mobility modalities, such as forced displacement.6
II.1 NNA vulnerability situation in Honduras as migration factors

to. Poverty. By June 2019, 59.3% of Honduran households were in poverty conditions
and of the total Honduran households (2,099,089), 26.8% were in extreme poverty.8 Poverty is
more serious in the rural area, but in the urban area it reaches more than half of the households (52.5% urban and
68.2% rural). 9 According to ECLAC, within the framework of Covid 19, poverty would go from 54.8% of the total population,
57.8% in the worst scenario, raising the number of poor people to almost 5.5 million. This represents a

3%increase, higher than the Latin American average of 2.6%. In this way, Honduras is placed as one
of the countries with greater poverty in Latin America.10
b. Violence. In the case of violence as a cause of migration, this is attributed mainly to crime
Organized, including drug trafficking, family groups involved in criminal activities and maras or
gangs.1 While the homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants has decreased in recent years,
It remains high: in 2016 it was 59,05 per 100,000 inhabitants, in 2017 of 43.5 and in 2018 of 40.72.12
In 2020 the rate was 37.6, equivalent to 3,496 registered homicides. Despite the annual gradual decrease,
Honduras remains the most violent country in Central America.13
For the National Forum for Migration in Honduras (Fonamih), many people are forced to "flee"
of the danger and risk climate. “The very high levels of violence have caused more and more people
Huy to the north to save their lives. ”14 According to UNHCR, there is robust evidence to hold two
Affirmations: that violence is one of the main causes for which thousands of Hondurans and Hondurans
(as well as Salvadorans and Guatemalans) leave their country, and that many of these people can have
international protection needs. For greater evidence, research shows that Honduras is
nationality with more asylum applicants in Mexico.15 In this way, migration becomes a
Survival option for many Honduran population sectors.
c. Family gathering and remittances. In recent years, the
family reunification, mainly because of the high percentage of people who have relatives residing in
USA. IOM studies cite a survey by the Inter -American Development Bank
of 2019, which identified that two out of five migrants migrated by family reunification, to a greater extent
sons and daughters to meet with their parents.16 In the case of women it is observed that it is a factor that has
much more weight in their decisions than in men.17 official statistics of the Integral Care System
To return migrant (Siamir) place family reunification as a second reason for migration (15.40%),
after economic reasons (92.78%).
Remittances are also an important incentive for migration. For receiving families they mean
An economic improvement of the home and are used to pay debts contracted to finance the route
Migratory In general, remittances, increase the availability of currencies at the macroeconomic level and at the level
micro favor an increase in the consumption of goods and services necessary to meet the needs
basic, which in turn influences the reduction of poverty and extreme poverty or, in the worst case,
prevents the proportion of the population living in poverty. 18 Honduras received
1,570 million dollars in remittances in the first quarter of 2021, which represented a 29% rise

d. Other factors that motivate migration. Inequality, political instability and natural disasters
accentuated by climate change, among others, exacerbate the causes of migration. This is confirmed with
the IOM, which has indicated the political causes, the high unemployment rates and the increase in insecurity
as factors that have increased Central American emigration.20 In the case of Honduras, the situation
worsened at the end of 2020 with hurricanes ETA and Iota, who left more than a hundred people dead,
Infrastructure damage for more than $ 10,000 million and according to the Social Forum for External Debt (FOSDEH),
around 860,000 jobs will be lost, 240,000 more than those estimated by the Covid 19 pandemic, and the
poverty index is expected to reach 75% or 80% .21
II.2 Honduras as a country of origin.
Poverty, violence and insecurity, and political instability that characterize Honduras affect
Differentiated way to childhood of the country, which puts its fundamental rights at high risk such as living
free of violence, integrity, health and access to education. For example, chronic malnutrition affects
to 42% of the population under 5 years of the poorest quintile, which places Honduras in the third country in
Latin America and the Caribbean with higher indices of child chronic malnutrition. 22 access to education is
limited, a situation that worsened with Covid 19, when closing schools to face the pandemic, and then
With the hurricanes ETA and Iota many schools were destroyed. The closure of schools meant that around
of 48.27% of the students enrolled for the 2020 school year (1.4 million of the total of 2.9 million)
They were out of education (even online for not having access to the Internet, a computer or a
mobile phone) .23 correlatively, in the current context it is estimated that the increase in work will be doubled
Infant Infantes work as farmers, servants, merchants, garbage collectors,
miners or fishermen. 24
The aforementioned structural problems also mean motivations for child migration. The forum
Dakar Honduras argues that the main cause of minors migration in the territory is violence,
lack of opportunities and little access to the educational system.25 Recent studies confirm the above,
pointing as main causes of this migration family disintegration, chaos in education and
health, economic suffocation and insecurity and violence.26
The types of violence fleeing the NNA are mainly the violence they experience in the home
and violence committed by organized crime. Gangs and other criminal organizations threaten,
They harass, hit, violate, riot and kill honduran children and adolescents with impunity, and
threaten to harm their families.27
These factors influence the decision of the NNA and their families to undertake dangerous trips in search of
Security, family reunification and opportunities. When boys and girls migrate alone they are often

They manage to reach the destination countries, and despite the actions of several governments and organizations, they can
find new threats and vulnerabilities, especially while remaining outside the
legality.
In 2014, one of the highest peaks of the NNA migration not accompanied from Honduras occurred, which
reached the figure of 18,244 NNA; The other peak was in 2019 with 20,398, and if the childhood figures are compared in
Migration situation not accompanied between 2010 and 2019, these increased by almost 2,000%.28
This seems to indicate that with the caravans not only the migration of complete families, but also
The non -accompanied NNA number. Another element to highlight is the increase in girl migration.
Childhood data presented to Mexican authorities reveal this fact: in the 2015-2019 period there were
64,000 NNA presented, being 39,219 boys and 25,027 girls, but in 2019 the girls represented 41.9%
of the total minors presented.29
II.3 Caravans as a migration modality
In recent years, migration ceased to be isolated or small groups; large nuclei of
residents and families complete with girls and boys, plus a high proportion of young people, who try to reach
the American border through various routes, by means of the so -called "caravans." The
Caravans of Central American migrants towards the United States are a kind of flows
Extraordinary migratories, which began almost spontaneously. However, the IOM documented that behind

Organization.
Migrating in caravans implies greater security and protection for people, being less exposed to
crimes and abuses on the route. They also see the opportunity to reduce costs by not having to pay “coyotes”.
But also, it means more possibilities to obtain humanitarian assistance on the route, from
Non -governmental governments or organizations.31 For specialized international organizations, caravans
respond to three main causes: the need to improve living conditions, to protect life and
integrity against violence and insecurity, and to achieve reunification with the rest of the family, which already
previously migrated to the United States.32
The first caravan of Honduras began with about 1,000 people on October 13, 2018. In the tour
He was integrated migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and other countries. It is estimated that he could reach
about 6,000 people.33 of that first experience to date, there have been more than half a dozen caravans

tried to prevent the passage of a caravan integrated mainly by Hondurans, returning to some
3,000 people by buses; many others would have managed to continue their course towards the border of Mexico, towards
The USA. 36
Recently, the new United States government offered additional humanitarian aid to Honduras, the
Salvador and Guatemala, but conditioned to address the causes of irregular migration.
II.4 Honduras as a return country
To the phenomenon of emigration is added that of return, that is, the return to the country of origin. In principle, it should
It is an "assisted return", which implies accelerating the procedure for returning immigrants
and that essentially obeys the immigration policies of transit and destination countries. Therefore, this
Return must occur under conditions that respect the integrity and rights of migrants. Without
However, in many cases it operates without determining care, care and protection needs
which are required.37 International Human Rights Organizations have expressed concern about
forced returns that do not take into consideration the voluntariness, health and dignity of people
Affected 38 Oacnudh documented cases of collective expulsions and forced returns from Guatemala,
which could constitute a violation of the principle of non -return.
Since 2017 there has been a 57% increase in the returned Honduran population from
Mexico and the United States, from 47,832 return cases in 2017 to 105,633 cases in 2019. in
Average, 6 out of 10 returned migrants came from Mexico. According to official sources, in 2020,
31,321 people were returned. This figure does not disaggregate the percentage of voluntary returns.39
Most of the returned people are men, although with a growing participation of women and children,
girls and adolescents (NNA). The majority group of returned migrants is between 31 to 50 years of
age and the second age group between 18 and 30 years. The main destination departments of the
Returned Migrant Population are those with urban population concentration and development
Socioeconomic such as Cortés, Francisco Morazán, Atlántida and Olancho.40
Notwithstanding the high number of returned migrants, the creation and implementation of policies
Public Protection, Attention and Assistance Programs is a recent issue in Honduras and they have not
developed widely. For United Nations agencies, the attention to the returned migrant must be a
priority, especially if violence is considered, a main reason for migration, remains
in force when returning. Returned people find the same violent environment that forced them to migrate.
This generates fear, particularly in the case of unaccompanied NNA that have been subject to violence and
extortion by maras and gangs. Likewise, attention is essential to address the effects of the
violence suffered during the trip. IIM investigations point out that childhood in a migration situation in

Scenarios for the development of your life projects.
II.5 Honduras and the forced displacement of the country.
Another problem that marks Honduras regarding the mobility of NNA, is the internal forced displacement.
Human Rights Organizations such as Casa Alianza Honduras have indicated that violence is
main cause, from the maras and gangs. These force the childhood of neighborhoods and colonies to form
part of their criminal structures and subsequently the NNA are used in their different activities
criminals When families and children refuse to be part of criminal structures are
threatened and even killed, not being left to leave their homes and communities
to protect your physical integrity. 48
Other grounds for forced internal displacement in NNA are extortion, drug trafficking, enmity
and sexual abuse. 2020 data from the Interinstitutional Commission for the Protection of Persons
Displaced by violence (CIPPDV) show the figure of 247,000 internal displaced people, although it must
consider that many cases are not denounced.49 Unfortunately, the figure is not disaggregated by
age, which does not allow to know the number of children involved, however, data from the same entity of the
2014 pointed out that young people represented an important segment of the internal displaced. The NNA
From 0 to 14 years they represented 3 out of 10 internal displaced.
II.6 The government response: regulations, institutional and public policies.
Regarding childhood protection, Honduras approved in 1996 the Code of Children and Adolescents. From
Then secondary laws have been generated to contribute to a protection environment, such as the framework law of
Integral Development of Youth (Decree No. 260-2005) and the Early Alert Law "Amber", to locate
and protect disappeared or kidnapped boys and adolescents, as a governing body of childhood
Government level, the direction of childhood, adolescence and family -dinaf- was created (Executive Decree PCM-
27-2014).
In 2019, the first comprehensive system for the guarantee of childhood (Sigadenah) and its
National Council (Executive Decree PCM-020-2019), which operates through synergy between institutions

In terms of emigration of Hondurans and Hondurans, the State has taken some initiatives

particular, this with the technical and financial support of international cooperation.

2015, dated August 5, 2015, responsible for harmonizing the policies established in the laws

They established three returned migrant care centers (CAMR), which operate at the national level: Camr-

CAMR-SPS: receives and serves the adult population returned/deported by air from anywhere in any part of

In order to identify the care needs of the Hondurans returned in the CAMR, it was designed

population. From this information, the National Information Center of the Social Sector of Honduras (CENISS) 52
processes statistical data on repatriated/returned in the comprehensive system of attention to
Returned migrants (Siamir), with the purpose of facilitating the understanding of the country's immigration reality.
Honduras also has the consular and migratory observatory (commighted), which generates data
statistics and monitoring of the functioning of the consular and migratory theme. These tools contribute
to have certain data that allow decision makers to objectively size the problem
Migratory
Likewise, 14 municipal units of return to return (UMAR) were installed, located in the
communities with the highest percentage of migrants expulsion, as part of the monitoring route and

It is weak or void, its actions arise when there are extreme situations, which denotes that causes are not attacked,

Sure, regular and orderly, which was effectively signed on July 13, 2018 by the Member States
of the UN, as a non -binding legal instrument.
UNICEF provided relevant inputs to the "New York Declaration for refugees and migrants",
adopted in 2016 within the General Assembly. At that time, UNICEF developed six policies -
UNICEF’s Six Policies- to position the best interest of children, in the face of the 2018 pact, these were:
1. Protect migrant children against exploitation and violence: increase channels
legal and insurance for childhood in migration and those who seek protection
international. The fight against trafficking, the strengthening of childhood protection systems
and the extension of access to information and assistance can help keep the
NNA.
2. put an end to the arrest of migrant children establishing alternative measures for their
Care: Apply alternatives to detention, such as care in host families, homes

supervised independent and other family or community modes for childhood in a situation
of not accompanied migration and those who have been separated from their families.
3. Keep families together: adopt more strict policies to prevent children from being
separated from their parents, mothers and other members of their families and that are established
more agile procedures to gather families in destination countries.
4. Ensure access to education and health of all migrant children: provide
Children in a migration situation the access they need to education and health services,
Thus, as housing, nutrition, social protection, water and sanitation.
5. That the structural casusas that cause them to abandon their homes are addressed: address
the deep causes of violence and poverty, especially through access to education,
the strengthening of health and social protection systems.
6. Eradicate xenophobia and discrimination: urge greater understanding between NNA and families
migrants and host communities, as well as establish firmer measures to combat the
discrimination and marginalization in transit and destination countries.
In 2017, UNICEF published its Global Children on the Move (Com) 56 program as the response of
UNICEF in favor of those affected by migratory movements, where the
mentioned 6 policies. The programmatic framework responds to the migratory cycle (origin, traffic, destination and
return) and places the rights of childhood in a situation of migration, protection and access to services
social in the center.
The Global Com Programmatic Frame is based on the existing programming of UNICEF in migration matters
and intends: (a) make the necessary adjustments to cover gaps, (b) increase coherence, (c) establish
priorities, orientations and principles, in support of national and regional offices and committees
nationals, and (d) underpin UNICEF's global action work on migrations in the world. To do this,
Retakes the 6 UNICEF policies and provides general guidance on: (a) the relevant regulatory framework
for each of the policies; (b) a theory of change for each policy; and (c) recommendations on
monitoring and measurement of proposed interventions.
Although interventions are different in each country, UNICEF's role or contribution
Respond to the following priorities:
Yo. Work with municipal governments, community -based organizations and schools to
Reduce violence in communities and the educational environment.
II. Strengthen national and local child protection systems to identify and support better
to the NNA at risk and reduce pressures to migrate due to violence.
III. Protect children in a migration situation in transit and destiny, prioritizing the development of
Alternatives to detention.
IV. Reintegrate children in a migration situation that return, working with the authorities

specialized for the return and management of individual cases.
The priorities described have been addressed through four lines of action that UNICEF develops in
Collaboration with various key actors, which includes rights holders, as well as owners of duties
and of responsibilities: i) technical assistance, ii) capacity strengthening, iii) advocacy and incidence, and IV)
Communication for Development (C4D).

period between 2017-2020. UNICEF
II.7.2 at the country level
The UNICEF 2017-202157 Country Program (hereinafter CPD 2017-2021), focused on childhood in conditions
Of greater disadvantage, mainly rural, indigenous and Afro-honduran childhood. Although in terms
Specific the CPD did not refer to the particular care of childhood in a migration situation, if contemplated
as part of childhood in conditions of greater vulnerability, so that two of the components of
UNICEF, Education and Protection, directed actions towards this population. From Education, UNICEF
It would strengthen their alliances with the Ministry of Education for, among others, to contribute to the incorporation and
permanence of NNA in a migration situation, especially returned migrants and displaced by the
Violence, in the educational system, reinforcing its academic abilities through the bridges program
Educational.58 In the protection component59, violence was established as a priority issue,
forced displacement and irregular migration, pointing out that one of the main causes of migration of
Honduran boys and girls is violence.
In this way, UNICEF gave special attention to the provision of immediate care services and protection
to children, adolescents and repatriated families to Honduras, and to support their prompt recovery and
Reintegration to the community. UNICEF worked with community partners, such as the Honduran Red Cross and
Municipal offices for NNA, in order to provide mental health and psychosocial support to children;
coordinated with ACOES, an active organization in some of the most violent communities in the capital of
Honduras, to provide educational bridges, allowing the return to the children's school
migrants and internal displaced. He also associated with women in the arts to implement sports
for development (S4D) and cultural activities ("believe through art") in communities with some
of the highest rates of expulsion of migrant girls and children internal.
In 2019 there was a mid-term review of the 2017-202160 CPD, there it was expressly pointed out that “the
migration, especially when it is forced or irregular, reduces school attendance. ”Therefore, within the framework
of the education component, UNICEF reoriented its education cooperation strategy from
safe learning environments, through a community -based approach, using models of
Education (such as Paz-Convivia-Ciudadanía and educational bridges), and the promotion of the participation of
Community organizations. Likewise, he sought to increase access to NNA education under conditions of
exclusion, focusing on the specific needs of children in motion (displaced because
of violence and poverty, returned migrants).
The expected effect designed for the education component was: “at 2021, girls and boys in greater
disadvantage, mainly those affected by violence, forced displacement and migration, have
Access to safe, inclusive, flexible and innovative modalities of quality education. "
From the protection component, work with municipal governments was strengthened because
of the Municipal Councils of Guarantee of Children's Rights would articulate the local interventions of
Reduction of violence against childhood and the attention of victim's childhood. Among the strategists it was contemplated:
reduce physical and sexual violence against NNA; alliances with media; development of
Community mechanisms for childhood protection in communities; strengthen
municipal governments to reduce children's homicides; and case management for childhood protection
Victim, in alliance with Dinaf. Within the framework of this component a new output was created (3.6)

“Pertinent institutions of the central government and municipal governments have the capacities for
childhood protection in its migratory cycle ”.61
Due to the relevance that education and protection components would assume in the second half of
Implementation of the 2017-2021 CPD, an increase in the ceiling of external resources approved was requested,
Especially considering that education would reorient to guarantee education for adolescents
(mainly women) in contexts of violence, migration and exclusion62; and protection in the acceleration of
Community and municipal interventions for child protection in migration and reduction of
violence. 63
III. Object of evaluation
In 2017, under the Global Children on the Move (Com) program, UNICEF headquarters in Nueva
York gave each country office (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador) an approximate amount of USD $
400,000 as a seed capital, aimed at strengthening its programmatic work in the childhood in childhood in
Migration situation. According to the Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean of UNICEF (Lacro),
Seed capital was flexible and not conditioned on specific interventions or objectives, in a way
that each office developed its own proposal, and since then, the funds were used to strengthen those
interventions that each office prioritized according to their local context, considering that they could generate
Positive impacts for NNA in migration.
It is then understood as an object of evaluation those interventions (or group of projects) in matters
NNA migration that: i) They have generally benefited in totality or partly by seed capital
Com; ii) respond to local needs; iii) respond to the 6 Global policies, and iv) they intended
be pilot experiences or cases around which to learn or climb. For this evaluation process, UNICEF
Honduras identified and selected those interventions considered as the most relevant to the criteria
mentioned and, in addition, that they had not been covered by previous evaluations. In such a way that
present evaluation could highlight accumulated experiences, learned lessons and good practices, thus
as useful recommendations to improve the respective management. This is how 3 were identified
interventions described in tables 2 to 6, due to its denomination, social organization, the period
of execution, geographical coverage and the budget of each of them.
The object of evaluation defined by the OP is part of a broader and more global approach practiced by UNICEF
Faced with childhood in a migration situation, which in summary implies:

➢ On the one hand, to enhance the capabilities of the Honduran State to respond, from a
Human Rights and Gender Equality approach, to the peculiarities of migration
Children's irregular, with emphasis on returnee, also adding to childhood displaced by
Violence
➢ On the other hand, to train and prepare communities, families and school for the
Prevention of violence against children, in order to reach safe spaces, where the NNA
They can develop skills for their life projects, achieving a healthy childhood, with access
to quality public services, in a protection environment, both in your family and in the
community.
In such a way that the different projects are not isolated or disintected, on the contrary, they are part of
articulated strategies, responding to a thought of complementarity to form a
Integral care and protection model.
In sum, the evaluation object will be a part of that integral action of UNICEF; and will understand the
following interventions or projects:
1. Educational bridges for access to quality education, which was implemented through three stages,
with various actors and with direct intervention of SEDUC: the Norwegian Council for Refugees
in 2017; ACOES for the 2018-2019 period; and Cinde for the conceptualization of the modality
Pedagogical of educational bridges from the experience of the CNR and ACOES.
2. Emotional recovery of boys and girls with an emphasis on childhood in a situation of returned migration,
With the Honduran Red Cross.
3. Reintegration of childhood in a migration situation returned and internal displaced by violence,
to their families and communities, with participation and direct responsibility of Dinaf.
These interventions articulated with each other make up a COMMITTEAN COMMITTENED ATTENTION MODEL IN
migration situation and displaced by violence. Due to its structural relationship, at some times
The report will link an intervention with another, or make general analysis, without separating them. The opposite would be in
detriment of the nature of the interventions subject to evaluation and, therefore, of the process itself. TO
Continue, the evaluation will highlight the most relevant characteristic aspects of the evaluation object.
III.1 educational bridges
Educational bridges (PE) is an educational strategy aimed at reintegration or permanence in the system
childhood educational in migration, returned and/or displaced by violence, as well as
students who have abandoned school or in potential risk of abandonment. Includes leveling
Academic with mathematics for life, Spanish for life, sciences for life, psychosocial work,
Art, culture and recreation. In general, it seeks to allow leveling, reintegration, roots and, respect and valuation
of children and adolescents.
From this initiative, specialized materials and methodologies have been developed to achieve their
task. This intervention was developed with direct involvement of the Ministry of Education (SEDUC)
to ensure the school reintegration of children and adolescents returned and displaced by violence,
as well as with the participation of civil society organizations such as ACOES, CINDE and CNR, which
They implemented projects with the technical and financial accompaniment of UNICEF.

Considering that generalized violence through forced recruitment, extortion, threats
and mobility restrictions, among others, generate specific NNA effects that limit their access and
permanence to the right to education, UNICEF allied with the Norwegian Council for Refugees, through
the project “Implementation of educational bridges to attend girls, boys and adolescents in transit and
affected by violence ”.
The purpose of this project was benefiting with the PE program at 1,000 NNA outside school in 30 colonies
In three municipalities (a municipality in Francisco Morazán and two municipalities in Cortés), areas affected by
Migration and violence. NNA would be identified through a census, as well as caregivers, members
of the community and tutors, qualified in a pedagogical strategy for school leveling. It was sought
also that community and school participation structures will have capacities for the
Participation in educational management, so that this will contribute to improving access and quality of education
with particular emphasis on the development of resilience capacities. Among these structures, the
Municipal Council for Educational Development, the School of Development, to student governments and to
Parents associations.
The process showed that “the child labor factor and the disinterest in education are still barriers to
access that are stronger than even the situation of violence. ”64 The exercise also allowed to obtain
quality information about other variables to take into account for protection such as: displacement and
Risk of displacement, forced recruitment risks, risk of migration and exploitation risks

In the first phase the psychosocial support needs of childhood were addressed and based on it it began
An emotional recovery process. It started from the return to joy model (object of another evaluation),
which was reviewed to identify strengths and weaknesses, additionally, several guides were studied
Methodological implemented in other countries.68 With this background, a guide for
Honduras, creating a methodological script to work specific emotional indicators. They worked
9 Emotional indicators: social skills, resentment, anxiety, self -esteem, aggressiveness,
Feeling of guilt, ability to face, sadness and regressive behavior.
In the new phase a review of the methodological script was made to evaluate good practices, in such a way that
It was more systematic. In addition to working with emotional indicators, information was included in the
files to make a pre and post test to know how much improvement the boys and girls had regarding their
Emotions A platform was made to enter the evaluation of children and thus could be determined if
There were improvements. A purpose of this II phase was to consolidate the alliance with the Autonomous University of
Honduras/School of Psychological Sciences, for the continuous review of the quality of interventions
aimed at childhood and training processes to volunteers; and of the municipal councils of
Guarantee of rights, which contributed their professionals in psychology.
We worked with both children in a situation of returned and childhood affected by migration,
Understood as NNA with migrant relatives. With this second population, the actions focused on the
"Resentment" indicator. The project was executed by the Honduran Red Cross and participated in Alianza Oim,
who donated kits so that the CRH volunteers could carry out their tasks with the NNA. In it
Pandemic framework by COVID 19, a third phase of the project to work municipalities has been agreed
of the southern and north region of the country. In addition, dialogues with the Autonomous University of

Dinaf with the support of UNICEF has implemented, since 2015, identification, protection and
childhood reference with protection needs, in order to identify children with situations of
greater need, derived from violence, and generate an integral response of protection and security. From
of 2018, with support from IOM and ACNUR adapted specific guidelines for childhood care
returned, so that they have the decent conditions for their integral development and thus reduce the
Recidivism to irregular migration.
The exercise requires monitoring actions to address specific cases, making home visits and
effective records for girls and boys to reach services offered by institutions
governmental and non -governmental such as: educational reintegration, professional training,
entrepreneurship, community work and social or labor services aimed at their relatives or
responsible Therefore, in 2019, UNICEF supported Dinaf to strengthen regional offices with
technical personnel specialized in childhood care in migration or with situations of
violation of rights, to implement monitoring actions for cases referenced from the
Childhood care center in migration and their families "Belén", as well as giving the
beneficiaries helps to facilitate their reintegration and reintegration from an educational, motivational approach,
family and community.
In addition to financing the team of reimbursements that would attend childhood in a migration situation
Referenced from the Belén Center, UNICEF would provide social assistance to childhood in a migration situation that
It could consist of food, medications, housing improvements, microenterprises, scholarships and others
valued as necessary.
According to the project, the implementation corresponds to the DINAF, with the technical accompaniment in addition to
UNICEF financial, being activities to develop by the reintegators:
➢ Home visits to prepare socio -economic studies to childhood in a migration situation

Understand the relevance, efficacy and sustainability of the different proposed models (interventions),
as well as identify opportunities and conditions necessary for successful extension or replica
developed interventions. Likewise, the evaluation is expected to provide information to understand the
role of the regional office and headquarters and provide opportunities to achieve greater coordination between
countries, as well as strengthening cross -border work, improving the response to the needs of childhood and
adolescence in a migration situation. In short, the purpose of the evaluation lies in enhancing the
possibilities of strengthening and scalability69 of the interventions. Likewise, “it is expected that the
Evaluation provides information to understand the role of the regional office and headquarters, so these
They will also benefit from the findings ”.70
According to the TDR, the evaluation findings are expected to confirm the usefulness of the
identified interventions and that the recommendations are accentable and allow adjustments to the
COM program, to strengthen UNICEF's response to the childhood phenomenon in migration. Of
The same way, the findings are expected to support the work of law that is carried out in
Each country.
Performing the evaluation responds, on the one hand, to UNICEF's acquired commitment to evaluate
interventions two years after the reception of seed capital, but also to the need to identify
opportunities and conditions necessary for successful expansion or replica of the developed models, thus
how to provide opportunities to achieve greater coordination between countries and strengthen work
cross -border, since NNA migration is a sub -regional and cross -border phenomenon.
IV.2 Objectives
The TDR (see in Annex 1) developed by UNICEF Lacro for this evaluation, establish as a goal
main to learn about the implementation of the different proposed models (interventions) and
developed by UNICEF, to respond to the different phases (origin, transit, reception and return) of the
migratory flows in the four countries that implement the initiative: Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras and
Guatemala. This will be done by analysis of some specific interventions identified.
It is a mainly formative and future evaluation, which takes into account the
current conditions and proposes actionable recommendations of practical application in job support
programmatic of the countries that participated. In that sense, the specific objectives of the evaluation-pais,
Insert in a multipurpose process, they are the following:
69 Scalability is a broad concept that can lead to replication, optimization, iteration, adaptation, diversification,
reinvention Likewise, scalability may be the possibility of implementing an intervention model in a different context (another
national territory, or another country) and/or that there is an important possibility that the intervention model be assumed as a policy
public by the State, or it has already been.

V. Evaluation scope
The thematic, geographical and temporal scope is described below.
V.1 thematic scope
The interventions subject to the evaluation have a thematic scope referred to the strengthening of
Institutional capacities for children affected by migration and childhood internally displaced by the
violence, from an NNA rights protection approach over the migration and
Security, based on national and international standards. Therefore, the rights holders in
The framework of common interventions in Honduras are mostly:
• Children and adolescents who migrate alone or with their caregivers.
• Children and adolescents and their families who have suffered forced displacement within their
own country or that have crossed borders.
• Children and adolescents and their families in a return to Honduras after an attempt to
migration.
V.2 Geographic scope
The evaluation will cover the interventions defined by the OP and its implementation area.71 The project of
Reintegration focused on strengthening the action of several of the regional offices of Dinaf,
Covering 11 of the 18 departments of the country, without specifying municipalities. The prioritized departments
They were: Francisco Morazán, Paraíso and Olancho of the Regional Office Centro Oriente; Cortés, Santa Barbara,
Yoro and Atlántida, of the Northern Regional Office; and Copán, Ocotepeque, Lempira and Intibucá, of the Regional Office
West.
PE -related projects and NNA emotional recovery were implemented, in general, in 25
municipalities located in 8 departments of the country, selected for their vulnerability to migration
of nna. In each area strategic alliances were required with key actors, 72 beyond the partners

Alliance with central state institutions such as Seduc and Dinaf, which could eventually
Promote the scalability of interventions nationwide.
V.3 Temporary scope
According to the TDR, this evaluation is of an intermediate nature and covers the period included
between May 2017 to December 2019. However, during the initial phase of the evaluation it was agreed with the
Evaluation Management Group (GGE) expand it until November 2020, in order to take into account the
Context of the Covid-19 pandemic and, therefore, to have a relevant evaluation for the present and future
next.
VI. Criteria and evaluation questions
The country evaluation applies the criteria of the Development Aid Committee (CAD) of the Organization for the
Economic cooperation and development (OECD73), and is based on the evaluation standards of the group of
United Nations Evaluation (UNEG). Specifically, the country evaluation will respond to the following three
Criteria: relevance, efficacy and sustainability. Due to OECD's tendency to include a criterion of
Coherence, the EE chose to evaluate elements related to coherence within the framework of relevance.
The impact and efficiency criteria were discarded from the TDR of the evaluation.
The evaluation matrix (Annex 3) is structured in a logical sequence that includes: criteria,
questions and sub -questions, indicators, sources of information, techniques and participating actors and has served
of guide for the lifting and analysis of information and data and is aligned with the TDC that was rebuilt
During the process, in order to focus the analysis on the changes, rather than the results (outputs) of the
activities.
The evaluation matrix does not include a specific criterion on the human rights -based approach and
gender, since questions and sub -questions were included in the rest of the criteria, to promote
A transverse analysis. Evaluation questions were used to inform the evaluation criteria of the
CAD / OCDE, which were defined in this evaluation as follows:
• Relevance: Adaptation of the Children On the Move (Com) initiative in terms of design,
Goals and strategies to the social, political and economic contexts of the country, as well as to the
Migration and return situation of childhood and adolescence in Honduras.
• Efficacy: the extent to which interventions achieved, or are expected to achieve, their objectives and
its results, including differential results between population groups and
Adolescence in migration and return.

• Sustainability: Probability that installed capacities, budgets, alliances, supports,
institutionalization and other positive effects of the initial initiative are maintained beyond the
Validity of this, that is, the extent to which they continue or are probable that the benefits continue
net of interventions.

VII. METHODOLOGY
VII.1 GENERAL ASPECTS AND ETHICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES
The Methodology and Work Plan of the country evaluation has been aligned with the TDR, the evaluation framework
Multipaís, the expectations of the Evaluation Management Group (CGE) and UNICEF Honduras. In this sense, the
present evaluation starts from a non -experimental design, with theoretical, participatory and oriented approach to the
use. The country evaluation has a qualitative - descriptive design, that is, it will relate a set of
Analysis categories (evaluation criteria and Key ISSUES, the latter in Annex 4), will not perform any kind
of quantitative or statistical analysis of the information, but rather will seek to understand, from the
Actors perspective, the evolution of certain factors linked to their interventions.
Mainly, the processed information was qualitative due to the context of pandemic by
COVID19, which is explained in the limitations of this study.
According to the objectives, scopes and criteria of this evaluation, the methodology used has
considered: a) the theory of rebuilt change, b) retrospective study when examining the changes or
Contributions of the interventions implemented in several years, c) use of various sources and methods
Information collection (document review, individual interviews and monitoring reports).
Through the use of a participatory approach, the evaluation sought to ensure the participation of the parties
Interested key in evaluation planning, such as key informants and in the validation of
Evaluation findings. The evaluation process included actors such as the Country Office (OP) in Honduras,
Public Sector, Civil Society. This process allowed to capture the perceptions and views of the parties
Interested and beneficiaries and were used as primary sources of information, for an analysis of the
34

contributions and effects, and draw conclusions about the validity of the theory of developed change and
Achievement of the articulated objectives of this evaluation and according to the TDR.
Table 9. Evaluation approaches.
Approach based on the rights of the child and the best interest of the child -isn-:
The evaluation analyzed how the rights of the NNA have been promoted, observed and respected
of migration in interventions. To do this, the evaluation matrix was incorporated the approach based on
the rights of the child and the best interest of the child -isn- with questions, sub-questions and indicators
Specific, which were also reflected in the tools for information lifting.
Gender approach:
In the analysis, two specific criteria were applied: i) the equity criterion, which refers to the strategies
developed to meet specific needs and respect for the rights of NNA without discrimination
or prejudices due to their sex and, ii) the criterion of equality, referring to the strategies contemplated to
Promote full inclusion and equal conditions in the benefits proposed by interventions to
assess. Therefore, it was identified how said approach was incorporated into the design of the
interventions and how it was put into practice, according to the differentiated needs of girls and
adolescents and nna LGBTI and Afro -descendant and indigenous childhood.
The focus centered on use (UFE):
This approach allows the findings and recommendations of the evaluation to allow the creation of
knowledge by identifying good practices, lessons learned and challenges to be
considered in the scalability of future interventions, in order to provide useful recommendations to
Interested parties. This approach can only be operational if it contemplates the participation of
Evaluation users and process appropriation and results are facilitated. Therefore, evaluation
included work sessions with the OP for confirmation of the object and use of the evaluation, the validation of the
theory of rebuilt change, and the presentation and feedback of preliminary findings and
Suggested recommendations.
This country evaluation, as a learning process, has been designed as a case study, whose results
They will be supplies for a multipurpose and prospective analysis, 74 from multiple study cases and
cumulative, 75 taking into account the additional 3 countries (Guatemala, Mexico and El Salvador). Said analysis
It will focus on the transformative nature and on the scalability opportunities of the interventions. By
Another part, in accordance with the GGE, with the aim of avoiding an extensive report, reference is made to the
Methodology in general that has been established in the initial evaluation report.
VII.2 CHANGE THEORY
As mentioned earlier, in the framework of the country evaluation the change of change was rebuilt
(TDC) country for interventions COM76 in order to properly represent what the
interventions pursue and how they do it, through:
74 As established in the initial evaluation report, the prospective regional analysis refers to the analysis of the
results and advances obtained in interventions to identify the articulation conditions created (or to create) as
Input to establish a regional integrated response to the migratory phenomenon that affects children and adolescents.
75 A multiple and cumulative case study brings together the findings of many case studies to answer questions from
assessment.
76 This TDC integrates all interventions into the framework of COM, including others that transcend the object of this evaluation, but
which are an important part of UNICEF's comprehensive strategy in Honduras (Annex 2)

a) Explain how it is intended to boost change, instead of limiting yourself to enunciating a series of
planned activities and results. The above, in order to identify if:
Yo. the premises on which the desired change and the causality of the contribution was raised
Unicef are relevant and,
II. If the interventions implemented respond to them.
b) Identify during the process:
Yo. The obstacles and,
II. Changes in the intervention, as well as the relevance of the adjustments.
c) Explain the plausibility of climbing the models in other contexts.
d) Identify and test the hypotheses of the evaluation.
The change hypotheses proposed in the reconstructed TDR are:
1. If the State strengthens a child protection system in migration, endowed with
Strategies for NNA to access rights such as education, and at the same time, have resources
specialized to prevent violence against returnee and/or displaced by violence,
achieve an inter -institutional and intersectoral articulation at all levels (central, departmental,
municipal and community), with the participation of strategic alliances of the private sector and society
Civil to favor technical and financial accompaniment, then Honduras would be in
Conditions to effectively meet the protection needs of childhood affected by the
migration or migration, achieving compliance with their rights, which
It would contribute to prevent forced irregular migration.
2. If families, school77 and communities are sensitized to the prevention of violence
Against NNA, they participate in alternative models to obtain safe learning spaces, and
They use protection services available for their sons and daughters, then they would constitute an environment
Protector with capacity and tools to prevent and address violence against children in
situation of return and displaced by violence, and to demand the protection of their rights, in order
to contribute to the development of children.
3. If boys and girls returned and/or displaced by violence are supported by institutions,
the family and the community to enhance their skills, and also their psycho -emotional needs
and psychological are effectively treated, and a process of family reintegration and
Community, then these boys and girls would be able to develop skills to
Life and enjoy their rights, as holders of them, safely and effectively.
The reconstructed TDC has been reviewed by the OP in its first version, the comments and observations are
present remedied in the figure below. The changes and advances achieved as a result of the
Implementation of the interventions subject to the evaluation have been analyzed in the light of said TDC.
77 The school, although it is part of the public institutionality is understood in the TDC and in the respective effect, as a component
Essential of the protective environment in the communities, where NNA, relatives and educators converge.

VII.5 Information analysis
The procedures for the analysis of information and its triangulation, as well as the identification of the
findings and formulation of theories, conclusions and recommendations, were governed by the following criteria
Methodological:
1. The identification of specific categories to determine the analysis units (Key Issues).
2. The comparison, comparison and triangulation of both documentary and obtained information from
Sources consulted, with a view to achieving the greatest consistency and validity in the analysis and findings.
Evidence was triangulated from two mechanisms: i) Triangulation of the EE, in which they are used
multiple observers opposed to a singular. To do this, in any interview and work session
Two or more evaluating ones were present, and II) triangulation of methods and sources, in which
Two or more sources of information are combined with similar approaches in the same study

IX. Ethical considerations
The evaluation was carried out according to the standards, standards and ethical guidelines of the Evaluation Group of the
United Nations, 79 with the guide to integrate the gender and human rights approach into
EVALUATIONS 80 and with the technical note of the evaluation performance indicator.81 The investigative process,
evaluation, information collection and analysis complied with the ethical standards contemplated in the
UNICEF procedures; In this regard, the methodology proposed in this report was reviewed and
Authorized by the Ethics Committee of said Agency. It is noted that in this evaluation they were not carried out

X.1 relevance
Question 1: To what extent do interventions respond to the rights and needs of the holders of
Rights (NNA), taking into account the gender approach?
Finding 1. The interventions of UNICEF Honduras were designed to respond to the needs of
Nna in return or reintegration and affected by migration. Based on this, they promoted the
development of institutional capacities to offer a comprehensive response; They formulated projects that
They considered their rights, addressed their educational leveling and access to education, attention

NNA Rights returned, internationally recognized.
To determine to what extent the interventions of UNICEF (understood as the lines of action
evaluated) respond to the rights and needs of the NNA it is essential to consider the context of the
country. Synthesizing what is indicated in the context section, Honduras is mainly an emigration country,
and the structural causes of this phenomenon especially affect children, who migrate by
Violence (in the public and private sphere), lack of opportunities, poverty, and family reunification. The data

UNICEF then sought to strengthen the attention and protection of returned children and displaced by the

among themselves, through projects that since its formulation contemplated the particular needs of the
children and adolescents returned:

treatment of psychopedagogical problems, as well as the potentialities of the center as a space

2. The emotional recovery strategy for girls and boys with emphasis on returned migrants,
responded to the need for comprehensive care for the right to psychic childhood integrity in

Specific emotional problems. NNA was identified directly or indirectly with
Migration, with whom a playful methodology implemented by volunteers was implemented

With each boy a first psycho -emotional approach was achieved, which was called “first

Major psychological, boys and girls were referred to a professional in psychology so that
They will be linked to a clinical consultation.
3. With the model "Reintegration of returnee", implemented by the Dinaf, UNICEF promoted
the integral reintegration of the child to her family and the community (when the best interests of
boy/girl requires it), which implied monitoring each case to guarantee the
reinstatement. NNA beneficiaries were provided to facilitate their reintegration and reintegration from
An educational, motivational, family and community approach.
It is evident then that UNICEF's purpose was to articulate and enhance a care system and
protection that gave comprehensive answers to the immediate needs of returned and displaced children
for violence, which will cover access to education and psycho -emotional and psychosocial attention, for the
development of their skills, at the same time favoring their reimbursement in the family and community for their
protection. UNICEF interventions in turn, tried to generate roots to the NNA to prevent a
Forced migration in high -risk conditions.
For these interventions, UNICEF prioritized municipalities where poverty, difficulties in accessing

Finding 2. UNICEF articulated strategic alliances that enabled a better response to rights
of nna in a migration situation and affected by migration.
The interventions described by UNICEF in synergy with entities and organizations linked to the
Childhood and migration protection. The alliances, state and non -state, articulated by UNICEF allowed him
a better approach to the needs presented by the childhood situation in migration and affected
For migration. It was a conjunction of efforts for the rights of returnee, where
Each part contributed capacity and experience, which strengthened the action.
The UNICEF - DINAF alliance implied a NNA reintegration model returned to their families and
communities, based on international standards. To enhance its action, the DINAF approved a
Regulation of the Center for Care for Children and Migrants Belén, a methodological guide for the
Reintegration and monitoring process of returned migration and a protocol of
Immediate protection, repatriation, reception and monitoring of childhood in a migration situation, to which
UNICEF made recommendations for its improvement.
The UNICEF Alianza - Honduran Red Cross went to provide mental health services and psychosocial support to
childhood in migration. A methodological script for Honduras of emotional recovery was adapted,
Field supervisors and CRH volunteers were trained in the script, and days of
Awareness at the national level with municipal units and other instances that work in favor of childhood

Together with CNR, ACOES, CINDE and SEDUC, UNICEF promoted and promoted educational bridges. The
Revised documentation and the interviewed actors agree that PE responded to the needs of
NNA education returned and displaced by violence by favoring the return to the school of thousands of
These migrant boys and girls were also formed and sensitized tutors and families for the bridge program.
In short, the alliances established by UNICEF contributed to maximize their cooperation and achieve advantages
that would not reach otherwise. In this effort, UNICEF in addition to strengthening public institutionality
At the national level, coordinating with Dinaf and Seduc, he committed, at the local level the municipal governments in the
provision of childhood services in a migration situation and displaced by the
violence. In both spheres, UNICEF provided technical and financial assistance to take measures
special care and protection specials, favoring state capabilities to
Comply with childhood rights in migration (Effect 1 of the TDC).
Finding 3. UNICEF was skilled in adapting models of attention to NNA to address the needs of the
context. Models that once adapted were implemented, tested and improved.
Both experts from UNICEF, Cinde and CNR, and SEDUC staff, expressed to the evaluation, in the
respective interviews that, the PE program is not exclusive to childhood in a migration situation, or for
returned childhood, or childhood displaced by violence; And they agreed that UNICEF recognized their
potential to benefit NNA outside of school, in areas affected by migration and violence, in order
to ensure that they access alternative and flexible programs in the formal education system. According to his opinion,
PE was adapted to generate motivational and pedagogical spaces to be implemented in the population
de -cololarized to contribute to its entry to the regular classroom, becoming a model to facilitate the
childhood insertion in migration situation returned and displaced by violence in formal education,
benefiting their school leveling, and reinforcing aspects that will facilitate their permanence in the center
educational.
After the PE implementation experience with CNR and ACOES, UNICEF promoted Cinde a
systematization of the model for the identification of best practices and learning, and the design of
didactic tools and learning suggestions, so that the methodology could be validated
for a better implementation by SEDUC, and that served NNA in other contexts. The documentation
44

reviewed is coincident with Cinde manifestations, in the sense that UNICEF's vision was to constitute PE
as a good implementation practice of the educational area in other educational centers in the country, to
associates and cooperators that will implement related actions. Such systematization would contribute to the Secretariat
of education with support from UNICEF, will offer a proven state pedagogical strategy.
Thus, with PE UNICEF it facilitated the SEDUC a comprehensive educational proposal, the Secretariat must model it,
Evaluate and adjust it. Along these lines, representatives of the SEDUC expressed to the evaluation that, with support
of UNICEF and Cinde, the SEDUC finished designing the model in 2019 and the materials were developed from
First cycle until ninth grade.
In the same tonic, and according to documentary sources, "first psychosocial aid", implemented by the
CRH, is an improved version of the strategy "Return of joy", implemented by UNICEF in 2014,
as a pilot project with the purpose of responding to the psychosocial needs of childhood in a situation
of migration at that time. Since 2017 with CRH, childhood emphasis was emphasized in a migration situation
returned and childhood affected by migration and took advantage of a more effective volunteer managed by the
CRH.
In the first phase of the intervention evaluated, the model was improved by including the derivation of cases that

in this way an effective and sustainable methodology.83
In the case of receiving NNA returned, in 2019 UNICEF sought to improve the action of the DINAF respect
to the implementation of identification, protection and reference guidelines of childhood with needs

According to the program document, this qualitative step was aimed at returning children

The aforementioned examples demonstrate UNICEF's interest in the continuous improvement of the response to
NNA needs in a migration situation, looking for comprehensive care. UNICEF adjusted the models to
The reality of the country to respond in a timely manner to this population. Although in these proposals of UNICEF
There is no evidence that NNA's opinion has been taken into account for its formulation, it is obvious that the

motivated UNICEF to improve proposals to respond better to respect their rights
and to the proper attention of your needs.
Finding 4. The presence of the gender approach is not systematic. There is no evidence of an approach
differentiated from migrant girls or affected by migration, or of other populations traditionally
excluded and marginalized (indigenous, for example).
UNICEF did not demand the integration of the gender approach to the design and implementation of the
interventions, according to implementing partners and documentary sources. In project design,

For example, the need for a differentiated approach between girls and boys was not alluded to, there was only reference
to amounts of children and adolescents who would be benefited from the action. The projects with the CRH and
ACOES limited themselves to specifying the ages of the beneficiary population: in the first NNA from 7 to 17 years, in
The second 5 to 17 years old.
In implementation monitoring, although the tool called “programmatic visit”, which allows
Check the advances in results, obstacles and reorientation measures if necessary, you have a section
on “particular measures adopted of equity, gender, interculturality, environment and
sustainability ”, the evaluation observed: i) the approach on which all the partners reported was
exclusively about gender; ii) It is indicated that girls were identified with certain characteristics, but
The characteristics also identify boys, such as girls with their dad or mom in the United States,
girls not included in the educational system; iii) It is indicated that special needs of girls were identified
as teenage mothers and single mothers, adopting measures to allow their inclusion in the
Project activities, however, such measures are not indicated, in this tool, or in the other
on monitoring; and iv) it is pointed out that girls are attended, through the inclusion of content that
They promote the elimination of gender stereotypes, but no particular actions are reported on the
Attention to the needs of girls.
Regarding a disaggregation by sex, only the CRH made an approach to the gender approach to highlight
The number of girls and the number of boys benefited, and there was also an adaptation of activities according to
the various age groups: from 7 to 9, from 10 to 13 and from 14 to 18. Notwithstanding this differentiation, in their reports
There is no allusion to particular situations of girls who were found or who were
resolved, despite the fact that girls and adolescents women are particularly vulnerable, by living a double
Discrimination for its gender and age.
The evaluation also reviewed the inclusion of the gender approach in some relevant products of the
interventions, or in use by the partners for the approach of NNA in migration situation:
➢ Immediate protection protocol, repatriation, reception and monitoring of girls and boys
Migrants: uses inclusive language but does not point to the need for a differentiated approach
When it comes to girls, the only specific reference is when it refers to which boys and girls are
more vulnerable to being victims of human trafficking, indicating that “pregnant girls, because
Their condition makes them more vulnerable to payment or compensation offers for adopting
to your daughter or child. ”The subsequent recommendations that were made to the document for improvement do not
They contained either any allusion to transcend inclusive language.
➢ Methodological script for emotional recovery for childhood affected by migration and factors
Related by CRH: it does not use inclusive language, nor does it refer to elements of
Gender equality.
➢ Educational Bridge let's up to date, orientations for the facilitating teacher, preliminary version,

It basically focuses on the roles of women and men, in which they can do equal jobs,
and in the assignment and acquisition of an identity; However, it does not allude to power relations or
to social conditioning that establish differentiated forms between men and women.
➢ Methodological guide for the process of reintegration and monitoring of nna migrant Hondurans
Returns used by Dinaf (indicated as draft): establishes as one of its approaches
Transversal The gender approach, however, in the methodology does not differentiate approach
of boys and girls, nor recognize particular situations of girls.
In general, the evaluation can affirm that there was a registration vacuum of the inclusion of the equality approach
gender in evaluated interventions. On the other hand, the interventions of the OP in the com frame
They are also omisas regarding other approaches such as interculturality, pertinent in childhood approach

In migration, despite the fact that UNICEF 2017-2021 CPD focused on childhood in conditions
Of greater disadvantage, mainly rural, indigenous and Afro-honduran childhood.
The non -incorporation of the aforementioned approaches, as minimal, does not allow UNICEF, or makers of
Decision, have clarity on specific strategies that should be joined, within the framework of
different models, so that these not only adapt to the contexts and the child of childhood in
migration situation or affected by migration, but also to particular and differentiated needs
of migrant girls, and indigenous and Afro -descendant boys and girls.
Question 2: To what extent is the intervention consistent with the country's public policy priorities?
FINDING 5. The UNICEF interventions in childhood in a situation of affected migration and childhood
For migration they are aligned with national and local public policy priorities.
Additionally, UNICEF contributed to strengthening and operationalizing the protection policies and actions of the
government.
UNICEF's action is harmonized with different government initiatives aimed at the attention of
Migrant population and childhood in a migration situation. Some of the government actions where
You can clearly observe this coincidence are:
1.
Migrant population returning to the country. Promotes a scheme that facilitates and provides paths
expeditas that articulate the different actors with which returned migrants must
establish a relationship that facilitates reintegration; and promotes roots based on actions
Resilient in social, environmental, cultural and economic contexts.
2.
Support for care processes in migrant people. In this space they converge
various efforts, as government instances especially linked to social programs,
International cooperation and civil society.
3. The returned migrant care centers that provide primary care for people
migrants who return to the country via air and land.
4. Municipal units for returning migrant attention, which operate at the municipal level for
attend childhood in a situation of returned migration and family units, offering services of the
central and local government.
Similarly, UNICEF management is consistent with national regulations, especially with the code
of childhood, which in its article 2 provides for the necessary prevention and protection regime that the State must
guarantee all NNA to ensure their integral development, creating organisms and
necessary procedures to offer them the protection they need; And with the Law on the Protection of
Migrant hondurans and their relatives84 that establishes as one of its objectives “configure policies and
programs that must develop the state of Honduras in the case of the return of Hondurans to the country, to
In order to facilitate their social, labor or business integration ”(Art. 1 Inc. 12) ..
UNICEF's evaluated interventions are not only coinciding with the national efforts cited, but
that reinforce them, by providing specialization in the protection of childhood rights in a migration situation
Returned Along these lines, there is coincidence between actors consulted by Dinaf and Unicef, that
UNICEF interventions are relevant as long as they respond to the need to develop policies and
programs oriented to returned childhood, and to that extent, they strengthen the migrant care center

ACOES, CRS, the SEDUC and UNICEF confirm that UNICEF through PE, responds to the need to favor
access to education for NNA in exclusion, focusing on the specific needs of

On the other hand, UNICEF interventions: (i) educational bridges, (ii) emotional recovery of children and
Girls with emphasis on returned migrants and (iii) reintegration from NNA to family and community are
aligned with local policies related to the comprehensive care of returnee, of the comprehensive system
of childhood rights guarantee (Sigadeh) 85, and its national council, and especially as regards
at the accompaniment of the local action of Sigadeh86, where it promotes the work articulated in the
Municipal Councils of Children and Adolescents, in the municipalities prioritized by UNICEF (see description of
municipalities in section II. Evaluation object, pages 23 to 30). These actions contribute to the purpose
to establish a comprehensive system for the guarantee of children's and adolescence rights in Honduras, whose

Regarding support for municipal councils: UNICEF interventions contribute to strengthen their functions
of local integral protection, since these councils have among their functions ensure adequate
installation of the system at the municipal level, taking into account the perspective of cultural relevance, and
promote measures through the formulation and approval of strategies, plans, programs and projects to

Question 3: How were interventions in the three areas of the
COM Strategy (country, multipaís - global)?
Find 6. The interventions subject to evaluation are aligned with regional and global frameworks
of UNICEF in matters of childhood in a migration situation, with the SDGs and with the manud. OP adapted the
Regional priorities of UNICEF Global and UNICEF Lacro in childhood in migration situation
to the Honduran context, and to the possibilities and management capabilities of the National Office.
The UNICEF Honduras Cooperation Program 2017-2021, where interventions are inserted
evaluated, contributes to the implementation of 8 of the 17 sustainable development objectives: End of the
Poverty (1), zero hunger (2), health and well -being (3), quality education (4), gender equality (5),
Reduction of inequalities (10), climate action (13) and peace, justice and solid institutions (16).
Particularly, the interventions evaluated respond directly to 4 of the 5 effects established in the
United Nations Development Assistance Framework (MANUD) 2017-2021 (direct effects of the
Manud with UNICEF participation):
1. Boys, girls and adolescents most vulnerable from prioritized municipalities, at pre -basic, basic levels
And medium, they access an inclusive and quality education.
2. Populations excluded from prioritized municipalities have access to comprehensive health services and
Quality, from an approach of social determinants of health for the progress of the right to health.
3. The most vulnerable Honduran population in focused municipalities has improved the exercise of their
Rights, with more effective, inclusive and transparent institutions; With a broad and effective
Citizen participation.
4. The Honduran population, in particular the one in vulnerability in the
Municipalities with high incidence of violence and crime, improves its conditions of coexistence,
Citizen Security and access to protection mechanisms, with broad citizen participation.
In relation to the UNICEF 2018-2021 Strategic Plan, OP interventions are aligned
directly with the third of their results88: Each child is protected against violence and exploitation;
that alludes to childhood in a migration and displaced status, establishing the need for protection by
means of programs that support UNICEF.
Regarding the articulation and alignment with the priorities of the UNICEF Regional Office for America

the interventions evaluated, to the regional action call to take immediate measures to help

Child has an equitable opportunity in life. For each result, content is developed.
89 UNICEF LACRO promotes six priorities to keep migrant children and adolescents protected and provide a future
better. It seeks to give an answer from an integral approach to address the rights of children and adolescents in the countries of
origin (prevent and respond to violence and improve their opportunities), during traffic (access to services, cases and care management
appropriate), during the reintegration (if they are returned to their community of origin) or at their destination (social integration and non -discrimination).

The purpose of UNICEF and CRH was to respond to the negative affectation caused by irregular migration in
The emotional well -being of children; being the goal to reach NNA returned and affected by the
migration, suffering symptoms related to post -traumatic stress disorder, such as anxiety,
nightmares, lack of concentration and low performance in school.94
Summary of results of the intervention on psycho -emotional care

In an interview, the Seduc said that this proposal was modeled by the institution with the support of the

In addition, that the municipal direction of San Antonio de Cortés made an evaluation and most teachers
evaluated that it is an excellent proposal that brings families and the community to the education process of

The aforementioned is complemented by what was manifested to the evaluation by ACOES and CNR, in the sense that PE was

The evaluation collected CNR opinions that PE is an opportunity within the framework of COVID 19,

UNICEF decided to work at the municipal level, prioritizing 25 municipalities highly vulnerable to migration,
where it implemented the interventions evaluated. In them he sensitized local authorities, communities,
families and schools on prevention of violence against NNA, and highlighted its relevance in supporting the

In summary, UNICEF used its institutional mechanisms, and especially its visionary capacity to adapt
models of attention to the needs of the national context, in general, and particularly to the needs
of childhood in a migration situation. According to the OP, com represented an opportunity to do more

In relation to the Lacro office, the OP recognized that it has generally responded to its needs,
showing open to double track communication; It is flexible with the required reports and creates spaces

positively valued.
X.3 Sustainability
Question 1: What conditions have been created or are present to ensure the sustainability of
Results of the intervention in Honduras? [i) changes in public policies; ii) improvement in the ability to
Response in childhood protection in migration; III) Development of more proposals
long term aimed at modifying the structural causes of irregular nna migration]
FINDING 16. Rective public institutions in education and childhood adopted institutional policies
based on the models worked with UNICEF. Interventions promoted by UNICEF have a
support in the national regulatory framework and were inserted into the legal and political structure of SIGADENAH,
which favors the sustainability of its results and opens opportunities for its continuity from the
Public institutionality. But there are risks regarding sustainability, among them, the lack of assignment
of resources from the State and the mobility of personnel.
UNICEF Honduras interventions contributed to the development of favorable institutional policies
for the protection of NNA in migration. Seduc accepted and modeled PE as a policy
institutional to guide its action against access to childhood education in migration and
displaced by violence. PE, promoted by UNICEF within the framework of Com, then constitutes a
model that helps sedu in achieving specific objectives, such as educational leveling and
reintegration into educational centers when it comes to a migration situation and displaced by the
violence.
Currently, SEDUC with the support of world vision and Pestalozzi Foundation is universalizing the
Pedagogical materials elaborated within the framework of PE. Moreover, SEDUC has expressed interest in

Facilitators, in several departments of the country, who can resume the initiative. These factors, together with
the official guideline of the SEDUC of acceptance to every migrant boy in schools and the obligation to

Dinaf, meanwhile, assumes reintegration, technically and financially facilitated by UNICEF, as a
institutional policy that will seek to advance in the development of a management to meet the needs of

Complementarily, local governments are continuing to the management of the reimbursement, which
It contributes to the sustainability of the model. However, with the budget cuts by 2021 motivated by
Pandemia and tropical storms, Dinaf has not been able to assume the human resource as it had been
agreed between the Executive Directorate and UNICEF.
On the other hand, UNICEF interventions imply regulatory obligations for the State. The law of
Protection of migrant Hondurans and their relatives indicates the state obligation of a return policy
that understands, among others, the access of the population returned to the social benefits existing in the country;
The Fundamental Law of Education guarantees access to education as a human right; and the code of
Childhood and adolescence provides for the integral protection of NNA.
In the same way, UNICEF interventions at the municipality level are inserted into the agenda of the
Municipal Councils, which are part of the Sigadenah structure, which makes these entities lead
Child protection processes, particularly childhood in a situation of returned and displaced migration
For violence.
The political interest and will of the public institutions to assume the interventions of UNICEF must go in
parallel with the financial will, which is a weakness, since, despite the appropriation of the

Another risk for sustainability is the high mobility of personnel in strengthened institutions with

Conclusion 1: The interventions subject to the evaluation, which fundamentally involved two
Components of the programmatic action of UNICEF Honduras, Education and Protection, were complemented
among themselves to develop NNA around migration and/or affected by migration, a system
of attention and protection. UNICEF accompanied the State to provide assertive responses to

with government and local policies, and with national regulations, in addition, being interventions
Specialized in the protection of childhood rights in a situation of returned migration, they reinforce them. To his
time, these interventions correspond to UNICEF's international and national interests and contribute
to the achievement of the SDGs.
Conclusion 2: UNICEF's strategy, which articulated its interventions, promoted the active participation of
valuable, state and non -state allies, who contributed from their spaces and experiences to configure
an articulated reaction to violence in its relationship with forced displacement and migration
irregular, pretending to cause safety and roots conditions for the NNA vulnerable to migration.
In that strategy they played a fundamental role each and every one of the models selected by UNICEF, which
They were adapted to the context of the country and the needs of the NNA in migration.
Conclusion 3: The Global Children On the Move program did not imply introducing the approach to the OP approach
of childhood in a migration situation, because it had already been doing it, but that it was more evident and
articulate. Now, although Unicef Honduras demonstrated vision, skills and capabilities in the
Implementation of a comprehensive strategy, taking advantage of the state structure developed in the municipalities,

XII. Good practices and lessons to learn
Relevant experiences have been identified during the implementation of interventions. When the

As institutional practices, they are classified as learned lessons that gave rise to good practices.
When certain actions are still taken, they are pointed out as lessons to learn.
XII.1 Good practices
1. The use of the Sigadeh structure to articulate strategies, especially the
municipal councils, which on the one hand strengthens public institutionality, and on the other,
UNICEF incidence opportunities on the agenda of these tips, in line with the necessary
municipal participation in the implementation of the models.
2. Community work with basic organizations and service providers, which already carry out
a work related to the local level, but that their faculties with UNICEF are enhanced through
technical and financial accompaniment. Community work has allowed UNICEF to arrive

3. involvement of different components, contributing to the same strategy, which accounts for

fundamental in the articulation with municipal governments.
4. The technical accompaniment close to its partners, enhancing capabilities, generating spaces
of articulation, improvements in the abilities for the implementation and constant review of the
Methodologies for improvement.
5. The processes of adapting the models to the needs that are presented and to the context. Are
models that were not necessarily thought to benefit children in a migration situation
or affected by migration, but that UNICEF and its partners have modified taking advantage of their
flexibility. In addition to their adaptation to a new agenda, they have also been adapted to
specific needs that must be solved. For example, adapt to the NNA situation that

Also the adaptation of schedules compared to the risks of invisible borders.
6. Spontaneous coordination without formalisms, in which UNICEF participates, to organize
quickly in the face of emergencies and provide timely answers to the needs of the context.
XII.2 Lessons to learn
1. The introduction of models to be known, proven and appropriate by institutionality

Through projects, however, it implies a risk to sustainability that is not established

Budget responsibility from the State.
2. The non -incorporation of approaches as gender and intercultural equality, prevented incorporating and doing

concrete demands of the different populations.
