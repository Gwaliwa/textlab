EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Summary
1. This report consolidates the findings of the Summative Evaluation of UNICEF's contribution to the education
sector in Angola, implemented by the Angolan Central Office (ACO) between 2015 and 2019.
2. In accordance with the Terms of Reference, this evaluation aims to “assess the contribution of the Education
Programme in improving institutional capability and the provision of services in the education sector in the
country, at the national and subnational levels, based on international standards and norms of education
assessment, through approaches in relation to gender, equity and children rights, while also considering
political, social, economic, and institutional challenges, limitations and opportunities, etc."
3. The evaluation examines, on one side, the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of UNICEF
interventions in the context of the development of the education sector and, on the other, the coherence,
coverage and coordination of interventions in the emergency context.
4. The total budget for the Education Programme was 7.431.270,28 USD and the total expenditure for its
implementation was 7.859.649,38 USD. This budget was part of a larger budget for the 2015-2019 Country
Program of Cooperation (CPC).
Purposes and Objectives
5. The purpose of this evaluation is to a) analyse the contribution of the ACO Education Programme to the
improvement of institutional capability and the provision of services in the education sector in the country,
within the scope of the 2015-2019 CPC; and b) provide knowledge to support the operationalization of the
activities already planned in the 2020-2022 CPC for the education sector.
6. To conduct this analysis, the evaluation team used the evaluation criteria and evaluation questions as
defined in the Terms of Reference (ToR) for this project, revised during the preparation of the Inception Report
(IR).
7. Five specific objectives were defined for this evaluation:
• To critically analyse the performance of the ACO Education Programme in terms of relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability in development contexts, and in terms of coherence,
coverage and coordination in emergency contexts during the 2015-2019 country program;
• To provide evidence on the achievements of predicted or unforeseen results at the national and
subnational levels, and on the main factors that facilitated or limited these achievements;
• To conduct a critical review of the Theory of Change (ToC) reconstructed for the 2015-2019 CPC and
the deviations that occurred during this period, identifying the role of gender, equity and children
rights approaches in the design and implementation;
• To identify the key components of the current cooperation cycle, which can be expanded in the new
cycle, considering the focus on integrated, decentralized approaches that prioritize early childhood
education, girls' education and information management;
• To recommend evidence-based results and conclusions about the contribution of the Education
Programme to the country's education system and services, as well as recommendations for the new
cycle of cooperation.
Target audience
8. This assessment was commissioned by UNICEF’s Angola Country Office. In general, the audience for this
assessment mainly includes UNICEF teams, both at the national level (Education Section, Management
Section) and at the regional level (Regional Office sections). However, considering that the Angolan Ministry
of Education (MED) was the main and major partner and direct beneficiary of the Programme's contributions,
i
there is an understanding that the key management teams of the Ministry of Education are part of the target
audience, as well as the Provincial Education Offices.
Approaches and Criteria
9. This assessment was carried out using a participatory approach using mixed methods of data collection and
analysis.
10. Through a qualitative approach, the evaluation team analysed legislation, official documents of the
Government of Angola (GoA), official documents for planning and monitoring the progress of the
Programme, administrative records and consultancy reports from the Programme and partners. The
provinces of Bié, Cunene and Huíla were selected for the fieldwork, where a total of 77 semi-structured
individual and group interviews were conducted.
11. As part of it quantitative approach, the evaluation team had access to the Result Assessment Module (RAM)
reports, aggregated budget data, as well as the quantitative information from the Country Office Annual
Reports (COAR). Secondary data and statistics that make up the evaluation matrix were also requested from
different departments of the Ministry of Education (detailed in the "Approaches and methods" section of this
report).
12. In line with the ToR, the criteria used in this evaluation correspond to a subset of those proposed by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development - Development Assistance Committee (OECD -
DAC) and adopted by the UNICEF Evaluation Office. Based on these guidelines, and as already mentioned in
paragraph 3, the adopted criteria to analyse the development context were relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency and sustainability; and in the emergency context, the criteria of coherence, coverage and
coordination.
Main findings
13. In general, UNICEF's contribution to the education sector in Angola was guided by national priorities defined
in national regulations, and sought to act within the scope of the main difficulties evidenced by national
statistics. The Cooperation activities were adjusted when necessary to meet national and subnational
emergencies and needs, and were implemented in coordination with the government, seeking
complementarity in actions. These adjustments, however, were not disruptive, and it was possible to draw a
consistent inferred ToC over time. The institutional performance of the MED was strengthened, particularly
from the activities of the management pillar characterized by training and support for the
professionalization of national and local managers.
14. Within the development context, the Programme's interventions analysed were relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency and sustainability.
15. Relevance: the evidence collected allows us to state that the Education Programme for the 2015-2019 period
was relevant for the education sector in Angola. Cooperation themes were aligned with national needs and
government priorities, and the cooperation focused on central national policies, through advocacy activities
and technical support, allowing the Education Programme to contribute to the structuring of the national
education policy in a comprehensive and strategic way. On the other hand, the economic crisis that the
country faced and continues to face, and its recent rise to the category of middle-income country, thus
limiting the flow of donations to the country, created a scenario of budget constraint that affects the
cooperation, reducing predicted co-financing capabilities by the government. In future cooperation, it will be
strategic to design mechanisms to guarantee co-financing by the government in such a way that it is possible
to effectively carry out the prioritized activities, maintaining the relevance of the cooperation.
16. Although limited in scope, UNICEF's role at the local level is valued by subnational governments for the
benefits in places that receive pilot interventions. Governments and school communities aim not only for the
continuity of UNICEF-funded interventions, but also maintain the expectation of greater investment, which
suggests the need to align expectations in the local action.
ii
17. Even though teenagers in Angola nowadays are more likely to improve their health and well-being than a
decade ago, many still lack access to essential information and quality services. Despite the fact that youth
policies, especially the strengthening of life skills in education, are a national priority and institutional priority
for UNICEF, the theme was explored in a non-systematic way in the 2015-2019 cooperation cycle through
poorly integrated curriculum development and teacher training actions in life skills theme, situational
analysis on access, retention and the transition from primary to secondary schools and education for girls in
the 1st year.
18. Effectiveness: Technical support and advocacy for the preparation of studies and policy documents stood out
as approaches to contribute to the construction of national policies for special education, early childhood,
and teacher training. As they focus on the national education policy, on fundamental themes to promote
access, quality and management, these results are considered crucial, and with great potential to impact the
well-being of children in Angola. In addition to the development of national regulations, in the case of the
policy for special education and the policy for early childhood, results were achieved for the implementation
of public policy. In the area of professionalization of school management, we highlight the support for the
development of educational statistics, systematized in the SIGE at the national level, and in the School
Charter, at the subnational level, even though training for the use and timely dissemination of information
are still important challenges. Support for training helped both to professionalize management and to
strengthen leadership and families, although the scope cannot be determined due to the lack of
administrative records, and its sustainability is a matter of concern. Worthy of mention are the studies
related to the General State Budget (GSB) that subsidized both public employees and society for a more
qualified impact in favour of education. The improvement in school conditions was limited to the reference
created in the Child-Friendly Schools (EAC), and to technical support for researching the reasons for school
dropout rates. In terms of curriculum standards and learning assessments, the results were modest, as
technical support for curriculum evolution and the development of national learning assessments has not
yet evolved into a curricular overhaul or into the consolidation of an assessment system at the national level.
19. Among the main external factors that limited the scope of the results, we can highlight: changes in the
government structure; the low number and technical capability of the employees at national and
subnational level responsible for implementing the initiatives; the high turnover of government employees;
the reduced fundraising capacity of UNICEF, but mainly from the government, due to the economic crisis;
the asynchrony between the GoA budget cycle and the UNICEF planning process, generating a mismatch
that impairs the inclusion of the priorities defined in the cooperation in the public budget; infrastructure
problems (school, sanitation and roadways); the insufficient number of teachers; structural barriers and
discriminatory social norms reflected in practices such as early marriage, gender-based violence, and boys
favouring in family investments in education, and that, while the Constitution of the Angolan Republic
defines access to education as a fundamental right for all, without any form of gender discrimination.
20. Efficiency: within the scope of efficiency analysis, considering the data available (which did not include
detailed expenditure data or opportunity cost in alternative actions) it was possible to verify that the
efficiency of the program was negatively affected by the actions’ territorial and thematic dispersion, by the
size of the teams in relation to the purposes of the Programme and by the need for continuous agreement
with a wide network of partners. UNICEF's flexibility, while valued by partners, results in a loss of focus on
actions of greater strength, and therefore loss of efficiency.
21. The advocacy strategy in the construction of national policies is considered to be more efficient due to its
potential national impact. Subnational efficiency, on the other hand, should be analysed based on the
effective gain of scale of initiatives such as TUPPI and EAC. The preparation of trainers is a strategy adopted
with potential efficiency gains due to the possibility of expansion. However, the lack of administrative
records makes verification difficult. Intersectoral action, carried out within the scope of the two projects
mentioned above, and also during humanitarian aid, presents itself as an opportunity to improve efficiency.
The change in the cooperation structure, prioritizing early childhood care, reinforced the efficiency of the
Programme, as this is an age group in which investments offer higher returns.
22. The high turnover of government employees, the lack of communication and coordination between different
departments, changes in government structure and limited technical capabilities are four external factors of
iii
inefficiency that could have had employed palliative measures. Inside UNICEF, the high turnover of the
Education Programme leader and prolonged periods without leadership also generated a loss of efficiency
due to the learning curve that must be faced with changes.
23. Sustainability: an important sign for sustainability is the incorporation of the cooperation results in the
country's public policies, and the existence of budgetary resources for its continuity. In this sense, among the
results of the Programme, the consolidation of national policies, especially those about special education,
stand out.
24. The greatest threat to sustainability lies in external factors, particularly the lack of public resources to
implement public policies, to execute the expected counterparts and scale up pilot experiences. Public
employee turnover also threatens sustainability, as investments in technical support, preparation and
consolidation of partnerships need to be constantly renewed.
25. While sustainability results largely depend on the government, other actions, such as building partnerships
with the third sector, the academy, other international associations and funding organizations, while also
expanding the range of partners around the initiatives, are all key factors for sustainability. During the period
under review, partnerships were consolidated with ADRA, Mosaiko, ISCED in Huíla and the World Bank,
examples from which a broader support network could be consolidated.
26. In the emergency context, the Programme's coherence, coverage and coordination are analysed.
27. Coherence: The logic of emergency actions has changed over time. Although the Education Programme
planned under result 1 (Output 1 on access) activities in emergency contexts in partnership with the central
government (MED / DNEG and DNASE) since the first work plan for the 2015-2016 biennium, it was only in
2017 that the theme gained prominence as a singular expected result (separate from output 1).
28. The evaluation sought to identify what was done by the Programme to mitigate the effects of the crises faced
by the country on children, especially to their equal access to quality education (Annex VI). At this point, it is
important to highlight that there is little documentation on actions in emergency contexts.
29. Even so, ACO's Annual Reports provide a breakdown of what was done by the Programme in the context of
emergency actions. This information shows alignment with the needs, contexts and priorities of the
government and helps in dimensioning the effort undertaken.
30. Considering all limitations, the external coherence of the program was guaranteed by communication with
external actors, especially with provincial governments, particularly in the identification of needs and the
definition of measures to be taken. In addition, the actions were designed based on demands arising from
the government, which guaranteed this alignment.
31. Coverage: There is no systematized, standardized, and accessible information that allows viewing how many
and which people were assisted by the Programme. There are many gaps in the information available in all
the different internal reports. The coverage data for emergency actions bring few numbers and without any
distinction of the beneficiary's profile. Thus, the analysis of coverage is limited to the analysis of local needs
in the different territories of Angola, in view of the geographical location and type of intervention carried out.
32. By analysing the type of intervention carried out, such as responses to migratory and drought crises, and by
considering both the discourse of the interviewees and the reference documents for this evaluation, it
appears that UNICEF's actions, in view of its possibilities and limitations, sought to prioritize the most severe
situations. The evidence shows clear concern and targeted approach to serve the most vulnerable in all
actions carried out by the Programme, such as either in development or emergency contexts, in the selection
of geographic coverage or in the definition of the assisted population.
33. Coordination: Through document and interviewees' discourse analysis, it is possible to affirm that there were
mechanisms for UNICEF to coordinate its actions with other actors, mechanisms that also aimed at
promoting the improvement of the MED performance.
iv
34. It is possible to confirm that there was some integration in the response to the prioritized emergency
situations, and interviewees from UNICEF, the Central Government and the provincial governments affirm
that this coordination existed and facilitated the work, and that there is a common perception that this joint
action was essential. The information gathered during the fieldwork allows us to state that UNICEF
interventions were determined according to the MED demands, with which UNICEF maintains a constant
dialogue.
35. On the other hand, the perception of UNICEF interviewees is also that the articulation with other actors still
needs to be improved, as the structures of mitigation and damage reduction are not well developed, neither
at the central level nor in the provinces, nor is there a structure to coordinate emergency planning. The lack
of a consolidated network implies the challenge of starting articulation with each action, resulting in longer
response times.
Gender, equity and children's rights: equity, especially that of gender, is a transversal factor to successive
NDPs and the GoA has approved several legal instruments aimed at promoting Gender Equality and Equity
in order to respond in a sustainable and multisectoral manner. The transversal priorities proposed by the
UNICEF program (early childhood development, adolescents, gender and humanitarian action), acted as
catalysts for policies for equity.
The effectiveness of the response in the complexity of the humanitarian context is less evident, especially in
cases related to the defence of the rights of girls and women who require an informed programming about
risks and prevention systems.
Even though at the national level UNICEF plays a leading role as an advocate for gender equity, national
information systems need to be strengthened to collect, analyse and use data disaggregated by gender to
ensure the integration of this perspective into program actions.
The use of communication methods with a gender perspective were reinforced in the programme's action
plans to ensure the active participation of children, youth and communities, as well as a sustainable
behaviour change. Nevertheless, there is no robust gender analysis nor are there priority strategies for
change, which are effective and evidence-based in line with a gender action plan.
It is in the health sector that the gender theme is most effective and reinforced, especially in the area of
maternal and child health, affecting development in early childhood.
In addition, the Programme did not explicitly describe the objectives of gender equality and empowerment,
including approaches that address cultural, social and political barriers to gender equality in the context of
implementing activities.
Limitations
36. The main limitations of the evaluation carried out include:
• Face-to-face fieldwork prevented by the pandemic - the lack of face-to-face visits, especially in the
case of provinces, municipalities and schools, made it difficult for researchers to get closer to the
reality of the interviewees and, thus, to specific information, making information collection and
analysis more challenging;
• Low access to educational statistics - as identified during the elaboration of the IR, there was a
shortage of educational statistics, which were requested to the authorities with a low rate of return.
This was partially overcome with publications obtained through UNICEF;
• Changes in monitoring instruments and logical frameworks of the cooperation, staff turnover in the
government and in the Education Programme, and the lack of comprehensive documentation have
hampered the task of drawing a complete picture of the cooperation over time. Thanks to UNICEF's
v
efforts to facilitate communication, the evaluation team had access to a notable number of former
national government employees and the organization itself. In the case of the subnational level,
however, the interviews were limited to employees on duty.
• Despite UNICEF's efforts, interviews with former UNICEF representatives and with a former employee
that was frequently cited by interviewees could not be conducted, particularly at the subnational
level.
Conclusions
37. As a result of the evaluation, the assessment team came to a series of conclusions based on the evidence
collected and lessons learned, including:
• The Education Program for the 2015-2016 period was effectively guided by the national priorities
defined in the national regulations, and sought to act within the scope of the main difficulties
evidenced by national statistics, as well as to align itself with the agenda for the Sustainable
Development Goals and with UNICEF’s global planning
• Cooperation activities were adjusted when necessary to meet national and subnational needs and
emergencies, without compromising the logic of action reflected in the Theory of Change, and were
implemented in coordination with the government, seeking complementarity in actions.
• The institutional performance of the MED was strengthened, particularly from the activities of the
management pillar, characterized by training and support for the professionalization of national and
local managers.
• The most comprehensive results, with the greatest potential for impact on the situation of Angolan
children, were achieved through technical support strategies and advocacy actions. These strategies
were applied notably for (i) the approval of national policies for inclusive education, early childhood
and teacher training; (ii) to contribute mainly to the implementation of inclusive education policies;
(iii) for the development of service models (TUPPI and EAC), and (iv) for the consolidation of school
management systems (SIGE and the School Charter). Items (i), (ii) and (iv) structure national policies
that will impact children across the country, making more accurate diagnoses feasible, providing
normative support and guiding their effective implementation. Although they have not reached a
large number of children and families, EAC and particularly TUPPI, given its low implementation cost,
have created models with the potential to become national public policies.
• In the case of interventions in emergency contexts, it can be concluded that, although the Education
Programme works to ensure a coordinated approach with other actors, and seeks to reach those who
need it most, the lack of response protocols and shared multisectoral contingency plans compromises
the result, since the cyclical nature of disasters would allow for pre-emptive planning and the
articulation of a local network that may respond faster.
• In addition, integrated approaches tend to be more effective, especially those that have adopted the
school as a reference platform for multisectoral interventions. Therefore, in order for integration to
be successful, it will be necessary to also make the partners aware of the benefits of multisectoral
implementation and for them to be willing to work under this new paradigm.

1. INTRODUCTION AND METHODS
1. This report consolidates the findings of the Summative Evaluation of the United Nations Children's Fund’s
(UNICEF) Angola Country Office (ACO) Education Programme, carried out between January and September
2020 by Plan Eval. Within the scope of the Country Program of Cooperation (CPC) 2015-2019, the Education
Program defined as its main long-term result to promote access to quality education, with equity,
inclusiveness and with a focus on improving learning. To this end, it aimed to: 1) expand access, focusing on
the most vulnerable, 2) expand national capacity to improve education and learning, 3) increase school
management capacity with an active participation of parents.
2. Figure 1 presents the Theory of Change that served as a basis for this evaluation of the Education Program.
Its narrative can be found in Annex I. It should be noted that this ToC was reconstructed by the evaluation
team in the absence of a Program ToC, and it was presented as part of the approved Inception Report (IR).
The analysis under the various evaluation dimensions refers to the planned functioning of the program
reflected in this representation of the ToC.
About the Evaluation: purpose, objectives, and context
3. This evaluation had as its objective to analyse the contribution of UNICEF’s ACO Education Programme to
improving institutional capacity, and service provision of the educational sector in the country, on national
and subnational level, between 2015 and 2019. The evaluation also aimed at analysing the program through
evaluation criteria and evaluative questions defined in the Terms of Reference (ToR) of this contract, which
were revised during the elaboration of the IR.
4. Thus, the evaluation sought to analyse the contribution of UNICEF’s ACO Education Programme for the
results obtained on the 2015-2019 CPC, and to provide knowledge that can support the operationalization
of the activities already planned for the 2020-2022 CPC regarding education, analysing the elements that
made the contribution of the Programme more invaluable, and how these practices may be replicated and
adapted for the new 2020-2022 cooperation cycle. This was guided by an integrated approach.
5. Therefore, the specific objectives for this evaluation were: 1) to critically analyse the performance of the ACO
Education Program in terms of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability in development
contexts, and also in terms of coherence, coverage and coordination in emergency contexts during the 2015-
2019 country program; 2) to provide evidence on the reach of predicted and unpredicted results, on national
and subnational levels and on the main factors that facilitated or limited them; 3) to conduct a critical review
of the ToC reconstructed for the 2015-2019 CPC and the deviations that occurred during this period,
identifying the role of gender, equity and children rights on design and implementation; 4) to identify the
key components of the current cooperation cycle, that may be expanded on the new cycle when considering
the focus on integrated, decentralized approaches and that prioritize early childhood education, girls
education and information management; 5) to propose results and conclusions based on evidence of the
contribution of the Education Program for the educational system and country services, as well as
recommendations for the new cooperation cycle.
6. It is noteworthy that the COVID-19 pandemic started before the fieldwork of this evaluation. After a joint
analysis by Plan Eval and UNICEF ACO of the impacts on the evaluation and options for adapting to the new
conditions, we opted for the continuity of the evaluation1. This adaptation considered the possible
consequences of social distancing policies adopted by governments worldwide on the evaluation questions,
on its operationalization and on the data collection process. It was clear that the pandemic context would
impact not only the evaluation’s operationalization, but also the sustainability of the results achieved by the
Program, in the face of the challenging socioeconomic context and worsening inequalities. For this reason,
and in view of specific objectives 4 and 5 mentioned previously, although outside of the evaluation scope, we
present the analysis within this new context, when relevant, highlighting which lessons learned in the
implementation context will be valid and/or should be adjusted to this new reality.

based on the Technical Note: Response of the UNICEF Evaluation Function to the COVID-19 crisis, from ACO.

Approaches and methods
7. The criteria in this evaluation, explained in the Terms of Reference (ToR), are a subset of those proposed by
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - Development Assistance Committee (OECD
– DAC) and adopted by UNICEF Evaluation Office. For this evaluation, the definitions given by the review of
the 2019 OCDE – DAC criteria will be adopted:
Relevance: Is the project doing the right things? The extent to which the objectives and intervention
design answer to the necessities, priorities and policies of the beneficiaries, country, institution,
partners and the world in general, and are still valid in face of changes in context.
Effectiveness: The extent to which the intervention has achieved, or is expected to achieve, its
objectives and results, including any differential results among groups.
Efficiency: Is the project using well all available resources? The extent to which the interventions has
delivered, or may deliver, results in an economical and timely manner.
Sustainability: Are the benefits generated by the project lasting? The extent to which the net benefits
of the intervention continue, or are likely to continue. The benefits may be financial, economic, social
and environmental.
8. According to the Term of Reference, the following definitions will be considered for the coherence, coverage,
and coordination criteria, applicable in emergency contexts:
Coherence: How compatible is the intervention? The extent to which there is compatibility between
implemented interventions / services provided in a humanitarian environment, considering both
internal consistency (synergies and connections with interventions from the same institution) and
external consistency (regarding intervention from other actors). The criterion includes
complementarity analysis, harmonization, and duplication of efforts.
Coverage: The extent to which the population exposed to the highest risk / threat was covered or not
by the implemented interventions / provided services in a humanitarian environment.
Coordination: The extent to which policy instruments / tools were used to deliver interventions /
services in a cohesive and effective manner in a humanitarian context.
9. The evaluation criteria and evaluation questions (Table 1, Annex II) guided the entire evaluation process,
serving as a base for the construction of the interview scripts, for the definition of the preliminary structure
of the report and for the codification and interviewee discourse analysis.
10. The evaluation model in Annex III started from the definition of a participatory approach using mixed
methods for data collection and analysis. Through a qualitative approach, more than 70 documents were
analysed during the elaboration of the IR, including laws, Angola Government official documents, official
documents of the planning and monitoring of the Program advancements, administrative records and
consultancy reports of the Program, from partners and of partners. Additionally, 77 listening moments were
carried out during fieldwork, through semi-structured individual and group interviews. The profile and
number of interviewees are presented in Table 1, totalling 102 executed interviewees out of 189 initially
planned. At this point, it is worth mentioning that both numbers of interviews (predicted and executed) are
higher than recommended for conducting qualitative interviews and that the response rate was high.

11. In terms of interviewee gender representativeness, among all 102 interviews carried out, 76 were done with
men (75%) and 26 with women (25%), which denotes a gender imbalance in management positions.
12. Interviews were carried out by three people (an Angolan, a Brazilian and a Mexican) that used various tools,
such as audio and videoconference software and instant messaging apps. A portion of the interviews were
carried out through phone calls.
13. Bié, Cunene e Huíla4 were the provinces selected for this study, in which all profiles from C to I (Table 1) were
interviewed, and a portion of the interviewees were selected through the “snowball” method. In total, 49
interviews were carried out at a local level: 18 in Bié, 13 in Cunene and 18 in Huíla. Although the pandemic
has imposed the need for remote interviews, we consider the fieldwork successful for it has reached the
interview volume proposed in the IR, while maintaining the quality of the collected data in most cases.
Besides that, the last interviews clearly did not add any new relevant content, showing a clear saturation
point. During the analysis, it was perceptible that, as the analysis was reaching a local level, establishing a
communication link with interviewees, who sometimes showed some discomfort in answering questions,
appeared to be more difficult. This is probably the biggest analytical loss imposed by the pandemic.
14. It should be noted that interviewees’ opinions in this document are anonymous, respecting the agreements
that were established during the interviews. Besides that, the evaluation team values and recognizes the
local knowledge, especially from those people that were identified as key informants or that were directly
involved with the Program. Additionally, references to these opinions throughout the document do not imply
that contents were transposed to the report without any previous analysis, but rather were done so after
systematization, codification based on analysis and triangulation criteria, with relevant ideas contained in
different opinions being worked on to be inserted in this report. The analysis process of qualitative
information (interviews and documents) was carried out with the use of the software Atlas.ti. Whenever

4 Provinces were chosen through review of documents and UNICEF proposals. Choices were based in the following criteria: financial
investment by ACO in the last 5 years; concentration of initiatives implemented by the ACO in the last 5 years; emergency response
implemented by the ACO in the last 5 years; commitment shown by provicinal governments in the last 5 years; municipal poverty

possible, we used different sources for triangulation and in sections where opinions diverged from the data,
the evaluation team tried to clearly position itself in this regard. However, in situations in which there were
no other sources to contrast interviewees’ opinions, the opinion of the evaluation team was not
preponderant, for it violates the principles of equitable and culturally responsive evaluations, valued and
encouraged by UNICEF.
15. Regarding quantitative data collection, the evaluation team had access to reports of the Result Assessment
Module (RAM) – containing information regarding the goals and deliveries of the Program – and access to
aggregated budget and supply quantitative data. The latter could not be explored due to the lack of
relationship tables with the structure of the Program – as well as quantitative information from the Country
Office Annual Reports (COAR). Secondary data and statistics that compose the evaluation matrix were also
requested from various departments from the Education Ministry: Office of Studies, Planning and Statistics
(GEPE), National Directorate for General Education (DNEG), National Directorate for School Social Action
(DNASE, Direcção Nacional para a Acção Social Escolar in Portuguese ), National Directorate for Adult
Education (DNEA), National Institute for Research and Development of Education (INIDE) and National
Institute for Special Education (INEE). By the closing of this report, only DNEG has returned with information.
Observation scripts were elaborated to be filled out during school visits. However, due to the pandemic, the
questions in these scripts were instead asked during the interviews with school principals. The collected data
was used with caution during the analysis, considering the risks of a potential respondent bias.
16. As shown in the evaluation matrices (Annex IV), triangulation mechanisms were planned between
quantitative and qualitative data. Additionally, opinions from different interviewees’ profiles were
contrasted, identifying agreement and disagreement points. Dissonant and lonely voices on a given theme
were pondered and analysed in context to identify the relevance of the manifested opinion. Once the
perceptions of each interviewee were contrasted, we aimed to verify the relations of these with what
secondary data shows, including the Program statistics. Nonetheless, lack of data limited this triangulation
in many cases.
Criteria for province selection
17. After an in-depth analysis following the review of documents and proposals from the UNICEF Office, and
with the objective of accelerating the bureaucratic and administrative process of organizing work on the
ground, the choice of provinces for carrying out field work was the following: Luanda, Bié, Huila and Cunene,
based on the following selection criteria:
1) Level of financial investment made by the ACO in the last 5 years;
2) Level of concentration of initiatives implemented by the ACO in the last 5 years;
3) Level of emergency responses implemented by the ACO over the past 5 years;
4) Level of commitment / commitment shown by the provincial governments over the past 5
years;
5) Level of municipal poverty defined by INE.
18. As previously reported, these four territories are home to populations with high vulnerability rates and have
been the target of cooperation activities over the 2015-2016 period, reaching different stages of
implementation. The province of Huíla implemented several pilot projects that would later be replicated to
the provinces of Bié and Cunene. These territories have implemented both development activities and
activities in emergency contexts. Finally, fieldwork would necessarily need to include Luanda, the place where
the central government is based and where UNICEF maintains its office.
5
Potentialities and limits of the evaluation
19. Based on the limitation identified during the IR, on the changes in context that occurred between its approval
and data collection, and on the challenges that arose during fieldwork, we list the following limitations and
the efforts in overcoming them: 1) low access to educational statistics – as identified during the IR
elaboration, we noted a shortage in educational statistics, which were requested from the authorities with
a low rate of return, partially overcome with publications obtained through UNICEF; 2) fieldwork impaired
by the pandemic – the lack of face-to-face visits, especially in the cases of provinces, municipalities and
schools, made it difficult for the researches to get closer to the reality of the interviewees, making data
collection and analysis even more challenging; 3) some gaps identified during the IR were overcome during
the evaluation through access to planning documents, as well as from information given by interviewees; 4)
thanks to UNICEF’s efforts to facilitate contacts, the evaluation team has had access to a notable number of
former employees of the national government and from the organization itself, facilitating the task of
drawing a clear picture of the cooperation over time, despite changes in personnel and inconsistent
documentation - however, interviews with former UNICEF representatives and a former employee that was
frequently cited by interviewees could not be conducted, particularly at the subnational level; 5) on the
subnational level, however, interviews were limited to working employees; ; 6) in addition to low access to
education statistics, the evaluation team did not get access to various administrative reports requested from
the government, which present the number of beneficiaries for the different activities, thus limiting the
analysis and evidences.
20. Regarding the evaluation’s potentialities, it is worth highlighting their relevance for promoting
improvements for both UNICEF’s internal work as well as for its relationship and implementation with the
government and other partners. Therefore, it is fundamental that all findings here described are shared with
whomever might show interest and that spaces for internal reflection are created, so that the knowledge
herein may influence the development of all involved instances and thus contribute to accelerate the social
transformation desired in the new 2020-2022 CPC.
Ethical considerations
21. This evaluation followed UNICEF and the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEF) ethical recommendations.
The evaluation was carried out legally and with due respect to the well-being of all involved. In line with the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, our evaluators are sensible to issues of gender discrimination and
inequality and do everything that is in their power to consider them, also being sensible to local customs and
beliefs.
22. A rights-based approach was used during the evaluation process, especially during data collection, in which
a transparent positioning was adopted. Before the interview, all participants were informed about the
objective of the study. All interviews were carried out and recorded with each participant’s informed consent,
which is included in the recording. In compliance with all interviewee agreements, all sources of information
will be cited anonymously in this report and will be separated from the analysis of the research team.
23. The evaluation was conducted by a diverse team, composed exclusively by women, formed in order to
represent different perspectives. The team was formed by two Brazilians, a Mexican, an Angolan and a
Belgian. The presence of a local researcher has given the evaluation team a better understanding of the views
of the local population and the national context. Finally, the team was aware of the existing differences in
the priority population, understanding this population’s specific culture and the ongoing structures of
inequality reinforcement and, above all else, became personally aware of its cultural structures, assumptions
and individual prejudices.

2. MAIN FINDINGS OF THE EVALUATION
24. The presentation of the evaluation results is structured based on the seven evaluation criteria: relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability – in the case of development contexts – and coherence, coverage
and coordination – in the case of emergency contexts. In the corresponding development context sections,
we also address emergency-context interventions, whenever pertinent. For each criterion, learned lessons
are presented and the last section of the report consolidates recommendations.
2.1. Development Contexts
Relevance
25. Under the relevance criterion, the extent to which the Education Program, as represented in the inferred
theory of change, met national and subnational needs and the priorities of the Angola Government (GoA,
Governo de Angola in Portuguese) through activities developed in the 2015-2019 Country Programme (CP)
was examined. The evaluation team also analysed to which extent the cooperation was aligned with the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and UNICEF’s Global Planning agenda
26. In 2015, the 2030 agenda presents, through the SDGs, the commitment of nations with interconnected
ambitious goals, eliciting on the 4th goal, related to education: to guarantee access to quality, inclusive and
equitable education, and to promote lifelong learning opportunities for everyone. Although it predates the
SDG publication, UNICEF global strategic plan for 2014-2017 already incorporated discussion on the 2030
agenda, and focused on ensuring the rights of all children, especially the most vulnerable. In 2018, UNICEF
renewed its strategic plan in light of the SDGs e established five goals, three of which should guide the
Education Programme: every child survives and thrives, every child learns and every child has an equal
opportunity in life.
27. Aligned to global guidelines, in 2015 the ACO elaborated a joint operation with the GoA for the 2015-2019
period, with the education component being structured in three pillars (identified as outcomes in the
reconstructed ToC5): 1) the GoA has a reinforced environment favorable for increasing equal access to
schools, increasing enrollment of vulnerable children; 2) the GoA has national increased capacity for
improving the quality of teaching and learning, also improving learning results; and 3) schools have increased
managing capabilities, with parents’ effective participation. In 2018, the Education Program was reorganized
in two pillars: 1) more children from 0 to 5 benefit from early childhood services and low cost early learning
and 2) more children, especially girls, have access and effectively receive quality education in a safe and
conducive learning environment.
28. In the following pages the Programme is analysed, structured in line with international references, but also
adapted to national necessities.
Priorities and necessities defined by the Education Ministry (MED, Ministério da Educação in Portuguese)
between 2015-2019.
29. The GoA priorities for the education sector, during the cooperation period, are defined in both the 2013-2017
and 2018-2022 National Development Plan (NDP). For the first period, the government determined as the
objective of the educational sector to promote human and educational development, based on a lifelong
learning process to each and every Angolan. The following specific objectives are defined in the document:
1) to increase the quality of teaching in all levels, with special attention to training of teaching staff and the
system of evaluation and learning; 2) to attract people with an adequate scientific, technical and pedagogical
profile to all teaching staff levels; 3) to continue with the expansion process of school infrastructure and
improve the conditions of existing schools; 4) to move forward with the educational system consolidation
and with the ongoing reforms in different subsystems, and to permanently monitor its evolution through
devices such as training of teachers, curriculum management, learning evaluation system and the financing
5 Outcomes - 1) To increase access and retention in education services in an equal way, in all social strata, also regarding gender,
since early childhood; 2) to improve the quality of offered education; 3) to develop and implement a national educational monitoring
and evaluation system, with disaggregated data collection at least by gender, location and school stage
7
model; 5) to ensure pre-school education; 6) to ensure that education is free and compulsory until the 1st
cycle of secondary education (9 years of schooling); 7) to increase schooling rate in primary and secondary
education with the construction, expansion and equipping of existing schools and institutions; 8) to
reinforce the adult literacy program; 9) to increase technical education and preparation for work, through
formation centers managed in cooperation with business entities, in line with the necessities and priorities
of national development; 10) to increase the network of primary and secondary schools of the 1st cycle; 11)
to ensure the training and qualification of teachers and school managers; 12) to improve the organization
and administrative and pedagogical management of public and private schools; 13) to reduce social and
territorial asymmetries in access to the educational system.
30. In the second period, priority themes of the educational policy were maintained, and were organized inside
the first of six intervention axes – considered to be the central dimension of the plan – called Development
and Well-Being. The defined programs for the sector were: 1) training and management of teaching staff; 2)
development of pre-school education; 3) improving the quality and development of primary education; 4)
development of the general secondary education; 5) improvement and development of technical-
professional education; 6) intensification of literacy of young people and adults; 7) improvement of the
quality of higher education and development of technological and scientific investigation; and 8) social
action, health and school sports. The plan included in its strategic framework the SDG, signed in 2015.
31. Within national regulations, it is also important to highlight the importance of the ratification of the
International Convention on the Rights of the Child for the national education agenda. Based on it, the
Constitution of the Republic of Angola (2010) foresaw the protection of the child as an absolute priority of
the family, State and society. The document 11 Commitments to Children (2011) presented the agenda
adopted by the GoA, incorporated to the law on the Protection and Integral Development of Children (law n.
25/2012), detailing the State commitment to children throughout their life cycle. Commitments n. 4 and 5
in the document establish goals for early childhood education (30% of children aged 0-5) and for primary
education (universal education for the population aged 6 to 18). They also present secondary goals or
guidelines that operationalize the efforts to be undertaken. Regarding early childhood education, the focus
in on initiation classes, education for families and communities and training of educators. In primary
education, goals range from alphabetization, gender inequality, dropout rate, promotion, school kits,
management, and monitoring.
32. The two current national plans during the cooperation period in analysis make explicit the government’s
concern with gender inequality and set equity in the access to education as goals, as well as the need to
analyse the reasons for female school dropout. Furthermore, law n. 25/11 from July 14th, 2011; Presidential
Decree n. 124/13 from August 28th, 2013 regarding the Regulation of the Law Against Domestic Violence;
and the Presidential Decree n. 222/13 that approves the National Policy for Gender Equality and Equity, and
the Advocacy Strategy and Resources Mobilization for Policy Implementation and Monitoring, are current
legislative policies for gender defence in the country.
33. In the documents that were previously mentioned, it is possible to identify the continuity of the broad agenda
of the sector, to which the themes of the 2015-2019 CPC are aligned with. With the exception of the themes
that go beyond UNICEF’s agenda – higher, technical-professional and adults’ education – all themes were
covered under access, quality and management axes.
2015-2019 CPC in the Angolan context
1) Increase in access to basic education
34. The expansion of access to basic education, first pillar of the cooperation, is a central element in the priorities
of the education sector in Angola, according to the documents previously mentioned. This pillar is also
relevant when considering the populational increase dynamics (population from 0 to 19-year-old comprises
57% of the national total, and in the cooperation period it has increased 11.3%, according to the projections
of the National Statistics Institute of Angola (INE, Instituto Nacional de Estatística, in Portuguese) (Table 2),
8
the schooling net rate (in 2017 it was 74.2% for primary education and 23.4% in secondary6) and coverage of
pre-school education (only 31.5%).The specific objectives on both government plans aim to increase and
improve school infrastructure for the number of school places, as well as to improve failure and dropout
rates, and to remove barriers for inclusion. These themes were included in the cooperation, focusing on early
childhood (campaigns, service models – All United for Early Childhood project - TUPPI, Todos Unidos Pela
Primeira Infância, in Portuguese -, coverage diagnostics and financing); school dropout (primary education
and first cycle of the secondary); inclusion (special education and education for girls, traveling school); and
school conditions at Child-Friendly Schools (EAC, Escola Amiga da Criança, in Portuguese) (school meals and
water).

35. The low net schooling rate points to the challenge that the conditions and availability of infrastructure still
represent. Between 2012 and 2016, the number of schools of initiation to secondary education increased
32% in the country, with only secondary schools showing an increase rate of 85%7. Having a school close to
where you live is not yet the reality of all Angolan children, who generally travel long distances to study8 and
find schools in poor conditions. In primary education, for example, 15.3% of classes happen outdoors (Table
3).
36. Although there is no large scale direct investment in infrastructure within the cooperation, the theme was
addressed within the scope of the EAC project. With DNEG as a partner and the Water, Sanitation and
Hygiene (WASH) sections, access to water was improved in the 13 schools participating in the project.
Technical support activities were also structured for the situation diagnostics, which resulted in a brief survey
of 600 schools in the provinces of Cunene, Huíla, Bié, Luanda, Namibe e Huambo9 . The survey showed that
there are schools that still operate outdoors, with classes under trees or exposed to the environment and
with difficult access to water, whether piped or in reservoirs. Among the schools participating in the
diagnosis, 45% on average had access to water. The same diagnosis showed that although 76% of schools
had some type of sanitary installation, be it a bathroom or a latrine, many of those are not in operation, or
the hygiene conditions are not adequate. In this sense, it is noteworthy that the lack of water compromises
hygiene at school, and the dignity of children, especially girls of menstrual age, for without necessary
conditions they reduce their school attendance frequency.
37. School meals were part of the cooperation planning for the first three years, with support from the nutrition
section, as a factor that improves school conditions and contributes to maintaining children in school. On
this topic, the cooperation provided for the elaboration of studies to improve the school meal program,
elaborate the policy, and monitor its actions.

the rural population lived further than 40 minutes of the closest primary school.

38. Elevating the gross schooling rate and reducing dropout rates are goals under DNEG responsibilities. High
grade repetition rates and low rates of school transition are associated factors that are at the centre of the
government’s attention. In this sense, within the cooperation, technical support was provided for carrying
out situational analyses focusing on girls, definition of strategies and support for their implementation. The
Huíla province is present in the planning as a receptor of the technical support for studying and developing
strategies to fight school dropout. DNASE, for its part, deals with the theme thorough sport activities and
vocational guidance as strategies to fight school dropout also supported by the cooperation.

39. Inclusive special education, of great relevance to achieve universal access to schools, is a priority issue in the
public education policy agenda, as well as the design of services for itinerant communities, mainly on 2018-
2022 NDP, where priority actions for the theme are specified. The attention given to inclusive special
education responds to the need to adapt the educational system based on the ratification by the Angolan
government of the Salamanca Declaration in 1994. The main scope within the cooperation was the technical
support for the formulation of the national policy for inclusive education, including mobilization for its
approval, the elaboration of both a strategic and an action plan, and the support for its implementation in
selected provinces. In the case of itinerant schools, the cooperation provided technical support for research
and planning, for the elaboration of a conceptual note, for the formulation of the action plan and for its
implementation. Regarding education for girls, the focus of the technical support is on the secondary
education, where the highest dropout rates are observed, reaching 20%, as shown in table 4.
40. Still within the theme of expanding access, care for children during early childhood – to which the
cooperation presents activities for the elaboration of the national policy, mobilization and advocates for its
approval, service structuring, setting standards and educators training – is a priority both at the national
level, on government plans, and at a subnational level, as it was identified in the fieldwork. The relevance of
the theme is also evidenced by the creation of the National Directorate for Pre-Schooling Education (DNEPE,
Direção Nacional de Educação Pré-escolar in Portuguese) inside the Ministry of Education.
2) Quality on basic education
41. The second pillar of the cooperation, related to quality, is also aligned to the priorities of the GoA, which focus
in its national development plans on themes such as teacher training, learning assessment systems,
curricula, learning assurance and complete trajectory to all students in primary and secondary education.
The 2015-2019 cooperation congruently presents activities such as teacher training (training for inclusive
education, skills for life and sustainability, in all different educational levels), technicians and local
leaderships (both analysed later, in the management pillar), besides technical support and advocacy for a
national policy. In the national training policy we have the early childhood and inclusive education policies
as promoters of quality. The cooperation also includes the support to the development of assessment system
(for early childhood, Portuguese and Mathematics in primary education, early years and in the first cycle of
secondary education). Interventions in the school curriculum, although scarce, have a larger presence in the
planning for the end of the analysed period. Regarding early childhood, strategies that stand out to improve
10
quality are technical support for supervision, material production, support for design and implementation of
cost-effective models for parenting and early childhood learning (TUPPI).
42. In terms of planned activities for the quality pillar, teacher training is the priority strategy within the
cooperation. It should be noted that, as a result of the educational reform of 2001, teachers without any
pedagogical training were admitted due to the necessity of assuring school functioning. The 2013-2017 NDP
created the requirement to develop a National Teacher Training Program, including initial and continuous
training, and professional development, as well as teacher career management. This responsibility lies on the
National Institute of Education Staff Training (INFQE, Instituto Nacional de Formação de Quadros da
Educação in Portuguese). Additionally, the National Institute for Research and Development in Education
(INIDE, Instituto Nacional para a Investigação e Desenvolvimento da Educação in Portuguese), in its role as a
producer of teaching and training materials, also adopts the priority objective of improving the quality of
teacher training. Both institutions were UNICEF partners during the teacher training activities, which
included training events, technical support for training structure (content planning and development) and
technical support for the development of the national policy of teacher training.
“The quality of teachers that we train determines the future of a child”
(Subnational Government Official)
43. It should be noted that training is not the only teacher problem to be faced. Despite the number of teachers
having practically doubled during the educational reform10, and having admitted almost 30 thousand
teachers11 through the national competition between 2019 and 2020 alone, the system still lacks teachers
to meet the demand – in primary education in 2016, there was an average of 54 students per teacher (Table
4) – and the necessary material to assure the quality of the school environment, such as school and didactic
materials, and computer equipment. Both at the national and subnational level, there is still another
challenge: the difficulty for teachers to reach their workplaces due to road infrastructure problems, lack of
transportation and the great distance between the place of residence and workplace.
44. INIDE led the revision of the curriculum material in which subjects and study plans were revised, and the
skills in the teaching materials were reinforced. Within the cooperation, the planned action, causally related
to the theme, was the inclusion of the themes comprised in the framework “skills for everyone”. For example,
an education project for girls in secondary education was developed, addressing skills for life12.
45. Less directly, and not necessarily affecting the national curriculum, the EAC13 initiative offered training in
selected schools on school leadership, child-centered teaching and strengthening of school committees, thus
contributing to curricula strengthening in schools. Although there is no quantitative information for the
most recent years, the COARs showed that, in 2015, 404 teachers were trained in the scope of the EAC and,
in 2016, 247 teachers received this training in addition to 40 managers and 109 members of the Parents and
Education Guardians Commission (CPEE, Comissão de Pais e Encarregados de Educação in Portuguese).
46. Strategically, the Inspection Office must be considered an important partner within the cooperation,
considering its role as a supervisor of the public policy implementation14. Within the program, technical

13 The formative content meets EAC’s goal of creating and educational environment where all children can acquire positive learning
experiences with the participation of parents and the Community, in a rights-based, academically efficient, gender-sensitive, safe,
protective, and healthy environment.
14 The National Education Inspection Office aims to ensure pedagogical control and to correct non-higher education subsystems, also
overseeing the administrative and financial sector at the same level. It is responsible for supervising the application of educational
policies, study plans, programs, and guidelines for education systems; train the technicians responsible for inspection; oversee the
national exam tests; direct and control the execution of the budget.
11
support and training were provided to reinforce its staff with the objective of identifying the effective
implementation of the projects and curriculum guidelines in the Pedagogical Influence Zones (PIZ) 15.
47. In spite of 11% of boys and 13% of girls enrolled in primary education dropping out, and seeing this
percentage reach 20% of students in Cycle II (Table 4), no initiatives, with the exception of the technical
support for the formulation of school dropout diagnoses, were identified with the specific objective of
promoting permanence in school, although one can argue that the theme is a cross-cutting concern in the
cooperation. The lack of emphasis given by interviewees in the government (current and former employees)
to actions to promoting a learning assessment system, central to the diagnosis and planning of policies for
an education of quality, is noteworthy.

48. Within the theme of early childhood, in 2018 the MED, with UNICEF’s support, introduced the alternative
TUPPI model for pre-school education, which supports community development through an integrated
parenting program that guides families to offer early stimulation, nutrition, adequate water and sanitation
for 0 to 5-year-old children. Multisectoral teams composed of representatives from the Education, Health,
Social Action and Justice sectors were created in the province to monitor community facilitators, supervise,
and guarantee access to integrated services to support Early Childhood Development.
3) Strengthening of Management.
49. In the third pillar regarding support for school management, three fronts are identified. First, training of
school leaderships and managers, school principals, inspectors, and members of CPEE. Second, the
strengthening of local capabilities and alignment with province and municipal necessities through
decentralization of programs.
50. The third front of priority actions in the field of management deals with the consolidation of the educational
statistics system, SIGE, with the objective of producing information to support public policy decisions. The
main partner here was GEPE, responsible for providing statistical data for the design of public education
policies. The main challenges pointed out are the need to build technical capacity for survey and statistical
analysis at the central level, at the agency itself and at the institutes and directorates that make up the MED,
as well as in the provinces. Local strengthening actions are noteworthy, especially in Huíla, through the
consolidation of the School Charter, a local planning system developed with the cooperation technical
support, in partnership with local actors. Several governmental and non-governmental actors, at the local
and national levels, were trained and involved in data collection, treatment and analysis, among which stand
out the GEPE, Huíla province, and the Higher Institute of Educational Sciences (ISCED, o Instituto Superior de
Ciências da Educação in Portuguese) in the same province.
51. It is worth highlighting that the support for the development of the educational statistics system within the
cooperation ensured the alignment and the integration of the monitoring indicators of the SDGs – especially
the SDG 4 – in the GEPE surveys, in partnership with INE. Although data are not collected for all indicators,
subnational breakdowns, on a provincial level, and gender breakdown were guaranteed. Concerning fighting
15 PIZ are reference territories for organizing inspection efforts to effectively sample the territory, being organs for continuous
supervising, monitoring, and training.
12
inequality, according to GEPE, the monitoring and production of statistics for program planning also seeks to
present breakdowns and supply internal organs, especially the Directorate of School Social Action.
52. Finally, it is worth mentioning that, in the context in which the lack of financial resources to achieve
educational objectives is frequently addressed by interviewees of all profiles, the partnership within the
cooperation with the organizations Actions for the Environmental and Rural Development (ADRA, Acção para
o Desenvolvimento Rural e Ambiente, in Portuguese) and Mosaiko16 for the analysis of the participation of
the education sector in the General State Budget (GSB) gains relevance. According to the study, in 2019, the
public budget for the education in the country was 11.26% of the GSB – a drop of 0.86% from 2018 – with
the 2018-2022 NDP defining a target of 15% for the same year. Transparency of the GSB and its qualified
analysis is paramount to strengthen the management of education and to instrumentalize advocacy actions
for more resources for the sector.
53. Expanding advocacy actions by increasing the participation of education in the GSB is essential to ensure the
co-financing of cooperation actions, an essential assumption for enhancing their impact if we consider that
the average annual cooperation budget is equivalent to 1.1% of that of the MED for 2019 (Table 5).

Relevance, complementarity, and coordination between the ACO Education Programme and government
priorities and programs
54. As explained in the previous section, there is a good alignment between government priorities and
cooperation activities, and this conclusion is reiterated by informants of all profiles. UNICEF is considered a
partner always willing to collaborate with solutions to different problems, and in emergency contexts it
supports the resolution of urgent issues, such as the distribution of water in schools located in provinces
affected by drought.
55. UNICEF’s planning tools, and the dynamic of management and relationship are mentioned as important
elements that ensure the relevance and coordination in the cooperation. We can highlight the CP, designed
at the ministry level; the workplans; and the mid-term and end-of-year reviews, carried out with the
government. In addition to the instruments and the operational and programmatic alignment session, it is
16 ADRA is a non-governmental organization (NGO) working in favour of social, economic and environmentally sustainable
development, with activities at the municipal, provincial and national levels, and Mosaiko is an NGO that promotes human rights.
13
worth noting the importance of high-level meetings held with the participation of UNICEF’s national
representative and high authorities of the GoA, during which cooperation activities are validated and
prioritized, with added consolidation of the relationship of trust between the parties. The importance of
these moments of articulation is mentioned by the interviewees responsible for the cooperation inside
UNICEF.
56. The articulation capacity, technical support and resources invested by UNICEF are widely recognized by the
interviewees. The interviewees affirm that in the planning of interventions, the organization seeks to act in
a complementary way with public policies, and, in the implementation of those interventions, it seeks to
coordinate with national and subnational governments, who determine priorities and define guidelines for
technical support cooperatively, as will be presented in the dimension of effectiveness section. The
transparency and trust developed in the relationship with the government are considered by its members
and partners an important asset of the organization. UNICEF is also considered an important partner by the
academic sector, the third sector and international organizations. UNICEF is considered a reliable partner,
with technical capacity, and a privileged position to articulate the different actors and be a dialogue broker.
57. The analysis of the pillars of the Education Programme – improvement of access to and conditions in schools,
quality and school management – materialized in the activities described in the cooperation planning
documents (grouped in Annex V), in view of the priorities expressed in the national development plans and
in the interviewees’ evaluation, shows adherence to the main educational demands in the country.
58. It should be noted that the country’s educational needs require large national investments to expand the
service capacity and to improve the quality of education in the country. The technical support provided as
part of the cooperation supports the diagnosis and search for solutions in the education system, but public
resources are the main source for the implementation of public education policies. It should also be
mentioned that there are other priority challenges in various social spheres and, therefore, outside of the
scope of the Education Programme, which require investments and deserve attention, for they interfere with
educational results, such as the lack of road infrastructure - difficulting the transit of teachers and students
to the schools - malnutrition, teenage pregnancy, childhood marriage and low vaccination coverage. The
necessity and relevance of a greater intersectoral integration for greater effectiveness and efficiency will be
addressed in the corresponding sections.
Gender, equity, and children’s rights
59. The gender disparity in access to education, particularly in teenage years when girls drop out of school, was
a point of attention both in the government’s priorities and in the design of the cooperation. DNEG and
DNASE are the partners identified in planning for the actions focused on the causes of dropout.
60. Gender disparities are more accentuated in secondary education17, but the Education Statistical Yearbook
shows a situation of extreme inequality already in primary education. In 2019, 60% of those enrolled in
primary education and in Cycle I were boys, as shown in table 6. Due at least partially to increased data
collection, and the use of educational statistics made possible by the cooperation, the government was able
to generate data that allowed to diagnose and plan actions to fight inequality.
61. The academic literature18 offers strong arguments for the promotion of gender equity in education, including
to end the cycle of inequality, as the level of education of mothers is an important predictor of children’s well-
being in early childhood and school achievement.
62. Although UNICEF’s interviewees consistently expressed that children’s equity and rights are criteria that
guide the planning and implementation of all office activities and that there is recognition of the need to
address gender equity, few are the programmatic components of the cooperation that explicitly refer to
17 UNICEF (d.n)
18 Shirvanian, N.; Michael, T (2017)
14
these questions and which design specific actions for its promotion. Specific actions are described by
government interviewees as a yearning for the future rather than programs in the implementation phase.

63. The diagnosis of Water and Sanitation Conditions in 600 schools across 6 Angolan provinces (2016)19,
designed with an emphasis on gender issue and the situation of children with disabilities, showed that the
proportion of schools with bathrooms separated by gender only reached 20%. The study identifies a strong
socio-cultural barrier whenever boys and girls are forced to share the same facilities, compromising the
safety and dignity of girls when managing their own menstruation, which is understood as a major obstacle
to school attendance.
64. Within the 2015-2019 UNICEF’s cooperation cycle with the Angolan government, the program reinforces its
relevance in responding to these challenges of gender inequality, creating favourable conditions in the EACs
to avoid girls’ school dropout due to the lack of basic hygiene conditions. These conditions are created
through building bathrooms, water sources, and including in the teacher training process information on
gender equity and hygiene. Training was also promoted at EACs to reduce school and domestic violence. By
involving parents and the community, the training aimed to create a more protective school environment. In
the mid-term evaluation of the EAC, held in 2019, it was assessed that the Education Programme was
focused on gender and equity issues. However, according to the interviewees’ opinion, there was a necessity
to address the gender issue with greater depth and in a more inclusive way, especially in the most remote
areas (communes).
19 UNICEF (2016)

65. In addition to improving interventions related to gender equity and the conditions for access being addressed
in the National Special Education Policy, interviews in the curricular area highlight the need to develop a
curriculum and a service policy for students whose first language is not Portuguese. A broader diagnosis is
necessary to identify other areas of vulnerability like this one, which compromise equity and the assurance
of children’s rights.
66. The protection and assurance of children’s rights is especially relevant in Angola due to the age structure of
the population, in which children and young people up to 19-year-old represent 57% of the total population,
according to projections by INE for 201920. The access to basic services, such as education, birth certificate
and vaccination are still major challenges that require integrated action by different sectors in the social area.
UNICEF has been an important player in expanding access to the three exemplified services. Regarding
education, it is widely known as an important promoter of respect for free teaching.
67. The interviewees’ perception that UNICEF acts where it is most needed prevails – thus reducing inequalities
– and strengthening the capabilities of local communities and, in emergency contexts, promptly acting to
meet the needs of the most vulnerable. In fact, Bié, Cunene, Lunda Norte, Moxico and Cuanza Sul, provinces
where UNICEF has acted, are among the most vulnerable in the country according to the Multidimensional
Poverty Index of Angola (IPM-A, Índice de Pobreza Multidimensional da Angola, in Portuguese) (2020).
Conclusions and lessons learned in terms of relevance
• This analysis presents evidence that the Education Programme for 2015-2019 was relevant to the
education sector in Angola.
• Cooperation themes are aligned with national needs, the government’s priorities and with
international frameworks that guide UNICEF's global planning, particularly the SDGs. The
cooperation has focused on major national policies through advocacy and technical support, allowing
the Education Programme to contribute to the structuring of the national education policy in a
strategic and comprehensive way.
• UNICEF plays a strategic role in the articulation of interventions that support national priorities. This
coordinated work, even before the Programme’s actual implementation, is essential to ensuring a
good reach and relevance.
• Initiatives like EAC and TUPPI will be relevant models only if they effectively lead to the construction
of scalable service models, with government financial and human resources21.
• UNICEF performance at the local level is valued by subnational governments for the benefits in places
that received pilot interventions. Governments and school communities not only long for the
continuity of UNICEF funded interventions, but also maintain the expectation of greater investments,
which suggest the need to align expectations regarding local interventions.
• The economic crisis that the country faced and continues to face, and its recent rise to the category
of middle-income country, limiting the flow of donations towards it, created a scenario of budget
constraint that impacted on the cooperation, reducing the government’s22 expected co-financing
capacity. In future cooperation, it will be strategic to design mechanisms to guarantee co-financing
by the government in such a way that it is possible to effectively carry out the prioritized activities,
maintaining the relevance of the cooperation.
• Although the country provides young people with better conditions to improve their health and well-
being than a decade ago, many still lack access to essential information and quality services –
including sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. Despite youth policies, especially
20 INE (2016)
21 The mid-term evaluation of the EAC estimated the programme’s cost per student at R$17.28 (UNICEF, 2019). This cost should be
analysed in view of the government's budgetary possibilities, the results achieved, the applicability of the model in other contexts,
and also compared to other policy options to assess the programme's scalability. TUPPI has already emerged with the objective of
being a cost-effective service option, but it must also undergo a scalability analysis.

the strengthening of life skills within the education scope being a national priority and an
institutional priority at UNICEF, the theme was approached in a non-systematic way in the 2015-
2019 cooperation cycle, through poorly integrated curriculum development and teacher training
actions on the life skills theme, situational analysis on access, retention and the transition from
primary to secondary schools and education for girls in the first year.
Effectiveness
68. Under this evaluation dimension, the evaluation team analysed whether the intervention achieved the
expected results, and if it is possible to establish a causal relationship between the inputs, products and
results achieved. If, in terms of relevance, it was found that the expected results showed adherence to the
priorities and necessities of the country, under the effectiveness criterion one seeks to analyse to what extent
the interventions were carried out, products reached and if the expected intermediate results were achieved.
Reconstructed Theory of Change
69. Based on the cooperation planning instruments, the ToC detailed seven intermediate results associated to
the pillars of the cooperation: 1. National policies for early childhood development, inclusive education, and
policies for teacher training which are implemented (with respective action plans), instituted or in an
advanced stage of approval; 2. Leaderships (national and local) and strengthened and more articulated
families for the incidence through access and quality of education; 3. Service standards and school
curriculum, revised and improved; 4. School conditions – infrastructure (water and sanitation) and meals –
improved; 5. Professionalized Educational Management; 6. Inclusive Training Centers in operation; e 7.
Prepared plans for emergency situations.
70. Products or services (outputs) identified in the planning documents – whose analysis allows to check the
alignment with the intermediate results23 - were: 1. Education Managers sensitized for the creation and/or
qualification of policies and services; 2. Production of studies, diagnoses, research and documents of public
policies related to the access and quality of education, as well as to education in emergency situations; 3.
Creation of periodic spaces and moments for local and national articulation; 4. Educational Managers, local
leaders and families all sensitized for the importance of access to and quality of education since early
childhood, as well as education in emergency contexts; 5. School Managers, educational technicians and
teachers of the network implement and multiply the acquired knowledge with training; 6. Structural
reforms, purchase of equipment and school meals made possible; 7. Communication and awareness actions
for the importance of education (e.g. campaigns, events, dissemination of studies and researches).
71. The main interventions (inputs) – aligned with the products – aimed at achieving the objectives of the
program were: 1. Advocacy actions and intersectoral articulation in favour of access expansion and
improvement of education quality; 2. Technical support for managers, educational technicians and trainers
for: the development of guides, manuals and care standards on inclusion, skills for life, gender, early
childhood, emergency and teacher training; collection, production and systematization of educational
statistics; planning, monitoring and assessment; implementation of policies and programs; incorporation of
experience exchange (regional and south-south); 3. Training of school managers, teachers and school
community; 4. Availability of material resources for improvement of school infrastructure, as well as for
communication actions; and 5. Technical support for planning and acting in emergency situations resulting
from natural disasters, epidemics and migratory crises.
72. The chain of activities over the years is logical, evolving from the formulation of diagnoses to the
development of policies, national and subnational implementation plans, training, and development of
means and resources for implementation and monitoring.
73. It should be highlighted that the exercise of horizontal and vertical analysis of the program’s logical
framework, and the reconstruction of the ToC, were difficulted by the inconsistency in the previously
prepared matrices. The Action Plans of the Program have incomplete logical frameworks and with no

standardization that would allow to monitor the logic of the verified changes. According to the document
review, the logical framework for the 2015-2016 period does not have information on goals, assessment
means and periodicity / date of data collection. The logical framework for the 2016-2017 period does not
have information on assessment means and periodicity / date of data collection but does have goals. The
logical framework of the 2017-2018 period has no information on assessment means and periodicity / date
of data collection, and it only has goals for 2019. The logical framework of the 2018-2019 period is the most
complete, and it has information for the 2019 goals and means of assessment. The Action Plan developed to
meet the emergency context in the Province of Luanda Norte also does not have information of assessment
means and periodicity / date of data collection. Additionally, there is no standardization in the formulation
of indicators. As it will be detailed later, this precariousness in monitoring the Programme will generate
losses in effectiveness.
Theory of Change in practice
74. Annex VII provides an overview of the results achieved following the structure of the RAM report. The results
are presented below, following the structure of the theory of change, which organizes the initiatives under
five major expected results: 1) advocacy and technical support for the formulation and implementation of
public policies (including the result related to support for inclusion); 2) Strengthening leaders and families;
3) Professionalization of educational management; 4) Infrastructure and inclusion conditions; 5) Service
standards and school curriculum. The result regarding emergency contexts will be analysed in detail in the
corresponding evaluation dimensions.
1) Advocacy and technical support for the formation and implementation of public policies
75. The analysis of the information collected in the field confirms what the document review already pointed
out, and what the reconstructed theory of change suggested: technical support and advocacy (inputs 1 and
2) for the elaboration of studies and policy documents (output 2) contributed for the construction of national
policies for special education, for early childhood and for teacher training (result 1). As they fall within the
national education policy, in fundamental themes to promote access, quality and management, these results
are considered central, with great potential for impacting the well-being of children in Angola.
76. The National Policy of Special Education was approved in 2017, representing an important milestone for the
access of the most vulnerable children to education. Although early childhood and teacher education policies
have not yet been officially approved, advances in the development and involvement of the parties are
noteworthy. Regarding early childhood policy, a draft was widely discussed, and the text recognizes UNICEF’s
broad support of the initiative. However, the creation of the National Directorate of Pre-school Education
(DNEPE, Direcção Nacional de Educação Pré-escolar, in Portuguese) in 2018 in the MED, modified the
governance of the policy, previously led by the Ministry of Social Assistance and Reintegration (MINARS,
Ministério de Assistência e Reinserção Social, in Portuguese), and thus interrupting the ongoing decision-
making process. The initial design of the teacher training policy, developed within the scope of the
cooperation, is a reference for public managers in the responsible area, but has not yet been approved by the
Council of Ministers and it ceased to be followed up in the 2017 RAM reports. Thus, the program was effective
in contributing to the promotion of the necessary conditions for the approval of one of the three policies it
offered itself to support. Both in the case of early childhood policies and in the case of teacher training policy,
institutional factors outside UNICEF governance are confirmed by interviewees as causes for the delays, and
they also recognize the produced documents as a robust platform for the consolidation of the policy.
77. In addition to technical support and advocacy for the approval of the national policy for inclusive special
education, the interviewed national and subnational authorities highlighted the role of UNICEF on the
technical support for the implementation of the policy in partnership with the National Institute of Special
Education (INEE, Instituto Nacional de Educação Especial, in Portuguese), in the promotion and consolidation
of the Centre of Support to Inclusion (NAI, Núcleos de Apoio à Inclusão, in Portuguese), in the training of
public officers, and in the publication of awareness and dissemination materials (result 6). The trainings,
which included everything from the central government to schools, sought to transform the culture of
segregation of children with special needs, under the common understanding that only 5% of them require
attendance at educational schools. Together with INFQE and INEE, efforts were made to transform special
18
education schools in Special Education Reference Centers (result 6) for the preparation of trainers, under the
guidelines of UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the RAM report, 13 provinces
had these centers in December 201924. In addition to supporting the preparation of trainers, UNICEF also
supported the logistics of subnational training and financed teaching materials. Although there is no
evaluation of the implementation of the inclusion policy, provincial public officers and UNICEF employees
expressed in the interviews that despite initial resistance in schools, inclusive education was gradually
incorporated and the collection of statistics on this theme began. UNICEF’s work on the theme is exemplary
for having gone through the complete trajectory of policy design – evolving from technical support to the
elaboration of policy documents -, advocacy for its approval, and technical support for the design of
implementation actions.
78. However, the analysis of interviews with implementers in the provinces allows us to conclude that there are
still great challenges to be overcome. The interviewees at subnational levels estimate that institutional
support of Centres of Support to Inclusion25 (NAI, Núcleo de Apoio à Inclusão, in Portuguese) is not yet a
reality; training materials and activities have not yet reached schools; and teachers and schools are not yet
ready to promote inclusion in the school space. Even though 6 out of the 9 contacted schools informed that
they had enrolled children either with disabilities or with reduced mobility, we found no evidence that
schools were fully prepared to receive these students. This became evident in interviews with school
employees, mainly those located in rural areas, where employees mention that school spaces did not have
any conditions to receive children with disabilities. Some schools informed that they were building access
ramps, but only a few more adaptations were done to assist children with physical disabilities. One of the
interviewed employees pointed out that, even if the school were prepared, a student with a physical disability
would not be able to attend given the distance he or she travels from the community to the school, for the
baren land path presents great challenges for a person with reduced mobility to transit.
79. Regarding the national policy for early childhood, it is worth mentioning that UNICEF is recognized, in the
proposal itself26, as its coordinator together with the National Council for Social Action. Interviewed partners
recognize both the technical contribution, articulation actions and advocacy in support of the policy.
80. Partnerships with the MED and the Ministry of Family, Social Action and Women Promotion (MASFAMU,
Ministério da Acção Social, Família e Promoção da Mulher, in Portuguese) for the elaboration of the National
Early Childhood Policy emphasizes UNICEF’s position for the effective change of public policies. Interviewees
attribute the delay in approval to the governance divided among various ministries and to the political
timing, marked by the government transition. Nevertheless, they stress out that the policy is at an advanced
processing stage, with good chances of being approved. During the period under analysis, the former
National Directorate for Children of the former MINARS held, with technical and financial support from
UNICEF, the Training Seminar on Equipment Management for Early Childhood in the provinces of Huíla,
Huambo and Lunda-Sul (105 provincial technicians of Social Assistance and Reintegration trained), the
National Seminar on Training for Trainers of Managers of Early Childhood Care Institutions (50 national
trainers from all provinces trained to develop the skills of managers and pedagogical coordinators of Early
Childhood Care Institutions, respecting children's rights). UNICEF’s long term experience in early childhood
and its articulation capacity with actors is well recognized and valued among partners, who also highlight
the following actions: the holding of the First National Forum on Early Childhood Education; conducting
workshops for diagnosing the status and priorities of early childhood education; production of campaigns
and studies about coverage and service costs.
24 The interruption in the presential fieldwork prevented the research team from verifying the state and functioning of the centres
in all three provinces that make up the subnational sample.
25 The Centres of Support to Inclusion are spaces that aim to offer pedagogical support to the general education schools network
through continuous training, in-service training, material production and teaching of means and modes of communication. They
are composed of a multidisciplinary team, in addition to professionals who are part of the conventional administrative structure of
an educational institution.

potentialities through early stimulation”
(National Government officer)
81. As in the case of special education, UNICEF also supported the implementation of projects for early childhood.
In this case, from the cooperation of Cuba with the MED, and with UNICEF support, TUPPI is being tested in
Huíla, Bié, Moxico, Namibe and Uíge provinces, which is an alternative, non-institutional model for early
childhood care. Its strategy is to strengthen the skills and competences of families and the community about
how to provide early stimulation, nutrition, water, and sanitation for children aged from 0 to 5. The project
was an important component of the Education Programme, whose contribution was initially centred around
the development of the service model, but in face of the lack of resources from de GoA, ended providing
resources for its implementation in three provinces. In 2018, the programme benefitted 72 families and 115
children. In 2019, TUPPI grew from 4 to all 18 country provinces, benefiting 1.579 children and 676 families
in the provinces of Huíla, Bié, Moxico e Uige27 alone. In terms of early childhood, UNICEF contributed to the
training of 45 facilitators in 2016 and 120 in 201728.
82. The policy, when approved, will be an important promoter of access to education, because although the legal
framework in the country already presents a favourable environment for early childhood care29, the country
still needs to further address the challenge of implementing actions to promote development of children in
early childhood, currently limited by the low supply capacity in the country; the lack of qualified teachers; the
lack of information among families about the importance of development at this stage of life; deficient social
conditions; and educational spaces with precarious conditions; as well as the high costs that the existing
service formats imply.
2) Strengthening of leadership and families
83. The Education Programme also strengthened national and subnational leaderships (result 2), increasing the
potential impact of the civil society, and of MED itself, by expanding its capacity to monitor public resources
for education. Technical support for the preparation and publication of the study on the structure of the GSB,
and the identification of resources allocated to education, developed in partnership with ADRA and Mosaiko,
constitute an important result both in promoting expenditure transparency and in the strengthening of the
negotiation strategy to increase budget allocation to the education sector, in face of its necessities. Both the
civil society organizations and government actors that were interviewed said that they had improved
technically, for the acquired knowledge qualified the dialogue with the government, especially with the
Ministry of Finance (result 2). At the local level, interviewed actors were less familiar with the theme,
although some of them mentioned that there was a higher involvement and questioning by the community
on the priorities of expenditures. In terms of the potential impact on children’s well-being, although it is
possible to notice an increase in the percentage of resources destined to education in recent years compared
to the period prior to this investigation, this increase is still insufficient. According to the 2018-2022 NDP, in
2019 the education sector was supposed to receive 15% of the GSB. Yet, the 2019 budget was equivalent to
11.26%, below the 12.12% observed in 201830.
84. The training offered to school councils within the scope of TUPPI and EAC was praised by both school
employees and by council members themselves. Interviewees in municipal offices and schools mentioned
that they observed the effect of training in the form of greater involvement and improved participation of
27 UNICEF ACO (2018) and UNICEF ACO (2019)

the CPEEs, in the process of being approved.
"Giving voice to the communities is to support them so they can exercise their
citizenship, whether in terms of care, rights, education, health and other aspects".
(National Government officer)
85. It is worth highlighting that, in this context, advocacy and articulation efforts have also strengthened
leaderships and families to influence public policies by promoting the joint work of actors that, together,
could achieve better results. Partners from the third sectors that were heard, however, assessed that
UNICEF’s articulation potential is still not sufficiently explored, for even though it has promoted partner
organizations to reorient their strategies and started focusing their efforts for the strengthening of basic
education, a participative and robust network could not be articulated in order to support education policies,
and thus connecting partner organizations.
3) Professionalization of educational management
86. The cooperation also contributed for the professionalization of educational management (result 5) in itself,
through technical support and training for the development of acting models, development of the capacity
of producing and using statistics, and the adoption of methodological tools for planning, bringing togethers
international specialists and publicizing the state of the art in education public policies. The evaluation team
did not get access to administrative data on the number of employees involved in trainings. However, the
interviews confirmed that at the central level, UNICEF developed these activities in partnership with almost
all departments of the MED: DNEPE, DNAA, DNEE, GEPE, INIDE, INEE, as the internal planning instruments
detail. On the subnational level, the Education Programme developed capabilities in the provincial education
offices, in the municipal education directorates, in schools and even in the communities of the partner
provinces, as already mentioned.
87. It is worth noting that the development of capabilities at the national and subnational level demands
continuity, due to the high turnover rates of public employees, especially of employees in the provinces, due
to the lack of preparation of local staff for performing their tasks, for it is in the territories where actions are
implemented that problems should be identified and managed. It is worth mentioning that among key
informants of the central, provincial, and municipal governments, 32% had been in the position for less than
two year. With the frequent changes of these employees, both the acquired institutional capacity and
institutional memory are lost, as verified in the interviews.
88. UNICEF's contribution to teacher training went beyond the support for the formulation of the national
teacher training policy (result 1). It contributes to the strengthening of leaderships to act in favour of the
quality of education (result 2) and to a more professional management (result 5). UNICEF supported training
at both the national and subnational levels, focusing on a strategy of strengthening the capacity of
government actors, opting for the preparation of trainers (employees in central, provincial and municipal
offices, supervisors, school managers and teachers) and the training of people from local communities.
Training strategies varied between direct training, through national and international consultancies, and
preparation of trainers. However, UNICEF's efforts are limited by its financial capacity, which does not allow
it to reach national coverage. Some teachers, who received training in the scope of the EAC and were
interviewed during the field work, mentioned the training as one of the most important elements of the
initiative, with the greatest potential to help in the daily teaching activities. Some reported that the teaching
methodology learned during the training was reflected in the students, improving their school performance.
However, the lack of systemic learning assessments prevents this statement from being verified. Others
point out that the training has brought benefits not only for the teacher-student relationship and the school
environment, but for the whole community.
89. In terms of support of education management (result 5), it is worth noting the strengthened capacity for
collecting, processing, analysing and using data, one of the main action fronts in the 2015-2019 cycle of the
21
cooperation. The main partnership at the central level was with GEPE, for the development of the Education
Information and Management System (SIGE, Sistema de Informação e de Gestão da Educação, in
Portuguese), and at the provincial level with ISCED and with the provincial government of Huíla (Huambo
and Namibe being incorporated) for the development of the School Charter - a micro-planning tool using
statistics for the development of provincial plans.
90. With SIGE, data were no longer collected on paper - which made it impossible to collect data by municipality,
and with disaggregation for monitoring inequalities, for example - and started to be collected digitally. In the
GEPE statistical yearbooks - which gives recognition to UNICEF and the World Bank for their support in
structuring the SIGE, the data collection process and the training of technicians (60031 statistics technicians
at all levels, 343 at the provincial and municipal levels) - there is a good statistical picture of education in the
country, including data on enrolment, performance, composition of the teaching staff and students, and
infrastructure. All statistics are by province. It is noteworthy that the technical support on this front guided
the collection of disaggregated data that supported the monitoring of the SDGs. Thus, the yearbook data
presents data by gender, special educational needs, and school conditions, from initiation to secondary
education. A large part of the interviewees who discussed this topic see advances in data availability,
although data collection is not yet regular, and the editions to which the evaluation team had access (2015
and 2016 yearbooks only) show internal inconsistencies in disaggregated data totalization. In addition to the
need of improving the aforementioned data collection and analysis techniques, the difficulties faced in
accessing educational statistics, which should already be part of a systematic collection dynamic, point to a
challenge in the frequency of publicizing educational statistics and the governance required to make data
available for use, not only in planning by subnational governments, but also by society in a more broad way,
aiming at strengthening the demand for an education of quality in the country.
91. In this sense, it is worth noting that the World Bank will continue investing in SIGE as an essential element
for planning, implementing and monitoring the investments of the organization, and UNICEF is considered
an important technical partner. However, adjustments in scope and time for execution are considered
necessary to make the objectives of the two organizations compatible.
92. Within the 2018-2019 revision, a support activity is included not only for the collection, but also for the
analysis and treatment of data and in the preparation of national yearbooks in partnership with GEPE.
Additionally, the planning for 2019 presents the Data Must Speak32 initiative - launched in 2014 with the aim
of strengthening countries' capacity for more effective and transparent use of educational data for decision
making, at the management and school levels - with the aim of developing simple analysis tools to improve
the education sector planning. At the subnational level, in the province of Huíla, the School Charter also
presented a move towards consolidating itself as a planning tool. Despite these advancements, some
interviewees believe that the transparency in the data produced still needs to be improved, besides a
necessity of greater investment in infrastructure - including equipment and tools for connectivity that
enables the monitoring and sharing of important information - and training in the use of information.
4) Infrastructure conditions and inclusion
93. In the theme of expanding access, although resources to improve the conditions of schools are considered
among the inputs identified in the ToC, (result 4), the direct role of the cooperation in this area is restricted
to the EACs, which received interventions for the provision of water and basic sanitation, training for the use
and maintenance of the facilities, and hygiene awareness campaigns.
94. UNICEF does not have either a program aimed at building schools or any advantage compared with other
cooperation agencies. However, advocacy interventions and technical support, such as the elaboration of
national policies mentioned above, and other studies, may have an impact on Angolan children access to
education.
95. UNICEF has technically supported DNEG in the elaboration of the situational analysis of school access and
the determinants of dropout, bringing important subsidies for the removal of barriers. UNICEF facilitated a
31 Gesaworld S.A. (2018)
32 Jarousse, J., Prouty, R., e Rooke, B. (2019)
22
study on school dropout in the province of Huíla, managed by the provincial government, coordinated by
ISCED, with a technical team from the province. The study recommendations provided subsidies for the
provincial government to formulate an action plan and budget for 170,300 children aged 5 to 11, and 152,090
children aged 12 to 14 who are out of school, and strategies to address barriers in accessing primary and
secondary education. The diagnosis identifies as the main causes for the lack of attendance and the risk of
dropping out: the economic, sociocultural, and educational supply barriers. In terms of socio-cultural barriers,
the following elements were identified as the main barriers faced by children and teenagers from rural areas:
school failure, child labour, early age pregnancy and marriage, the rites of passage into adulthood and the
lack of social appreciation of education. The barriers in the provision of education refer to infrastructure
(precarious rooms and lack of conditions to receive children with special needs), and lack of school meals.
96. Together with DNASE, on the other hand, UNICEF has worked on the theme of sexuality and reproduction in
teacher training, and supported the development of learning material for students, to be used in
extracurricular activities. These two themes play an important role in the high drop-out rates among young
girls in Cycle II of secondary education. In this line of action, 494 teachers were trained, and 3,000 copies of
the produced material were distributed, focusing on the provinces of Luanda and Huíla, as there were no
resources to expand coverage33. There is no information available regarding the government's efforts to
escalate this action.
97. UNICEF's investment in the thirteen EACs distributed in the provinces of Bié, Huíla and Moxico, and more
recently in the province of Cunene, through the Porto Seguro project - which offers a service package for 10
schools in the municipality of Ombadja, including the installation of latrines and boreholes for water
collection - sought to create a quality service model that could be scaled. No data is available on the number
of trained teachers, managers or parents. The actors involved in the EAC at the local level express their desire
for the program to be scaled, for the structure of the EAC as a pilot program creates a situation of inequality
among the surrounding schools that causes discomfort amongst the interviewed participating schools. The
materials and training that EACs receive are not available to nearby schools and there is also no imminent
plan to match conditions in the short term.
98. In the EACs, actions were carried out to improve hygiene conditions (separate bathrooms for boys and girls),
access to water (mainly through a reservoir). Actions also were taken in schools located in municipalities
assisted in emergency contexts. In addition to infrastructure, UNICEF brought hygiene methodologies to
schools, focusing on the efficient use of water, and raised awareness on the importance of using latrines for
health promotion, through activities that included training and cultural interventions. The provision of tents
(provided for emergency situations, but became part of the permanent structure), and school materials by
UNICEF were valued in the interviews, especially at the subnational level.
99. School meals were part of UNICEF's aid package, but they do not constitute a permanent support line, despite
the fact that it is valued and that some actors signal that the situation of children in Angola still requires this
type of support. The Education Programme could start a joint action with the UNICEF nutrition sector to
address this demand, considering that food is a factor associated with learning. Finally, although the creation
of green areas in schools was part of the planning, interviews with employees and questionnaires applied to
school principals showed that this action was not effective mainly due to maintenance difficulties imposed
by drought, among other external factors.
100. The teacher shortage, although not in the focus of the cooperation, is a topic of relevance both for expanding
access and for guaranteeing the quality of education. It is a key element in the consolidation of favourable
conditions in schools for learning. To put in context, it is worth noting that the process to become a teacher
in the country, through a national public competition, leads to the recruitment of candidates from provincial
capitals, as they are usually the most well prepared. As a result, a large contingent of teachers travel long
distances to work, leading to recurrent absences and delays, as moving to a place close to work is not a real
possibility due to the precarious conditions of the most vulnerable municipalities. In an action outside the
initial planning, UNICEF, in partnership with the government and the community, built a teacher's residence
33 Source: government informant
23
in the municipality of Ombadja, in Cunene. The identified problem and the developed solution can be used
as something to reflect on, to develop scalable strategies that can change the situation at the national level.
5) Service standards and school curriculum
101. Little progress has been observed regarding school curriculum (result 3), although the training has brought
managers, teachers and parents closer to new concepts that may be integrated in curriculum proposals, such
as sex education, life skills - aimed at young people - and student-centred teaching. In 2015, UNICEF
supported INIDE in carrying out a study on the knowledge of students and teachers about Life Skills, analysing
the teaching strategies used by teachers. The results of this research were used as a basis for the curriculum
revision and the preparation of a manual for teacher training. In addition, a sex education guide and a
handbook developed in 2014 with assistance from UNICEF were used in the following years to train 60
facilitators and approximately 420 teachers in four provinces on life skills instructional methods34.
102. There is no evidence on the integration of the themes in the national curricular proposals, nor that these
contents were adopted in a comprehensive way in classrooms. In the fieldwork, some explanations were
raised for these obstacles: lack of investments from the central government, specifically from INIDE, contrary
to what the cooperation foresaw; the lack of human resources at UNICEF that would allow greater
involvement in the theme; the global redirection of UNICEF in the areas of transversal and life competences
that required adaptations; the excess of priorities and urgent matters attended to in detriment of long-term
efforts such as the construction of a curriculum proposal. UNICEF's most direct contribution to the theme
was the technical support for the development of the curriculum for alternative education, and indirectly
through consultancy to structure the national teacher training policy. At the school level, it was observed in
the interviews with school employees that UNICEF training and support for the elaboration of School
Educational Projects had an effect that was valued by the interviewees: “Before, they worked in an outdated
way. Now, they are very innovative educational plans”. The lack of face-to-face fieldwork due to the
restrictions imposed by the pandemic prevented the assessment team from having access to these
documents to corroborate this statement.
103. Although the documentation of the cooperation (and interviews with UNICEF employees) show the
importance of setting learning standards and the assessment of school management (result 5), the
interviewed government actors did not place the topic amongst the priority issues. The lack of progress in
the matter can be attributed, at least partially, to the institutional change that removed INIDE's responsibility
for the assessment of learning, transferring it to the newly created Directorate for Assessment and
Accreditation. Among the positive results, there are the assessment efforts undertaken mainly at the
beginning of the cooperation, covering language and mathematics in the early years of primary education,
and the perspective of Angola participating in the Southern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational
Quality (SACMEQ), with UNICEF promoting the articulation between the country and the consortium for the
assessment, which will require future monitoring. The results are considered only modest, as technical
support for curriculum evolution and the development of national learning assessments have not yet evolved
towards a curricular reformulation or towards the consolidation of an assessment system at the national
level.
104. Although advances in the expected results of the cooperation can be observed, the country scenario is still
worrying: it is estimated that, in 2018, 29% of children aged 5 to 11 did not attend primary school35; coverage
of pre-school education is still very low (only 31.5%, including initiation, within compulsory primary
education); the rate of transition from primary to secondary education is 71,9%, while the rate from the first
to the second cycle of secondary education is 66,4%. For girls in particular, the rate is even lower, 69% and
64% respectively36; although education has a greater weight in the GSB, investments are still low, especially
for pre-school education, even though the amount dedicated to this subsystem has been increased in the
34 UNICEF ACO (2015) and UNICEF (2015). Competências para a vida: Pesquisa sobre conhecimentos e habilidades de professores e

2020 SGB proposal when compared to 2019 SGB37. Although the initiatives analysed do not directly affect
this framework, it is part of the framework that cooperation seeks to impact.
Gender, equity, and children rights
105. As explained in the Relevance section, equity, especially gender equity, is a transversal factor in the successive
NDP, and the GoA has approved several legal instruments aimed at promoting Gender Equality and Equity,
in order to respond in a sustainable and multisectoral manner. The transversal priorities proposed by the
UNICEF program (early childhood development, teenagers, gender and humanitarian action), acted as
catalysts for equity policies.
106. The effectiveness of the response in the complexity of the humanitarian context is less evident, especially in
cases related to the defence of the girls and women rights, which require informed planning about risks, and
prevention systems. The response to multiple emergency situations (the analysis will be expanded in the
Emergency Context section) required integrative approaches, focusing first on immediate response to
affected populations, then on prevention and community development. However, there is no disaggregated
data to certify the results achieved. There are data in the reports that show that sanitation systems have
been strengthened, both for refugees and host communities – in the case of Lunda Norte –, as well as for
regions affected by drought. However, the assessment found no evidence of the achievement of any results,
nor did it find any disaggregated data.
107. Even though at the national level UNICEF plays a leading role as an advocate for gender equity, national
information systems need to be strengthened to collect, analyse and use data disaggregated by gender, to
ensure the integration of this perspective into the Programme’s actions.
108. The use of methods of communication with a gender perspective was reinforced in the programme's action
plans to ensure the active participation of children, young people, and communities, as well as a sustainable
behaviour change. However, there is no robust gender analysis or even priority strategies for change, which
are effective and evidence-based, in line with a gender action plan.
109. It is in the health sector that the theme of gender is most effective and emphasized, especially in the area of
maternal and child health, affecting early childhood development. UNICEF supported a baseline assessment
of integrated care for mother and newborn babies in four municipalities in the Huíla province, which helped
community participation in maternal and neonatal health, reducing the first childbearing delays in target
municipalities. For example, the community-based follow-up strategy of mothers and their new-borns in the
first week of life in two municipalities in Huíla (Caconda and Lubango), resulted from a participatory model
in which community development agents are used for communicating behaviour change, and community
participation was strengthened to improve maternal and newborn health. The design and implementation
of the programme supported women by addressing issues of power and authority (decision making), social
norms (who is valued and why), division of labour, as well as access to and control over resources. The
mothers who participated in the programme influenced others in their community to adopt healthy
behaviours and practices. The programme's activities focused on single pregnant women, who do not seek
health services, due to societal stigma.
110. UNICEF Angola conducted its first programmatic gender review in early 201838. Through training studies, the
program assessed that in Angola, less than 25% of children are registered before the 5th grade, and one of
the main barriers is unfulfilled parenthood. In response, advocacy campaigns were designed to highlight
responsible parenthood (positive masculinity) in promoting gender equality in Angola.
111. Moreover, the Programme did not explicitly describe the objectives of gender equality and empowerment,
including approaches that addressed cultural, social and political barriers to gender equality, in the context
of activity implementation.

External factors that influenced the achievement of the desired results
112. The main external factors that limited the reach of the results, according to the information collected in the
field, and documents review, were:
• Changes in government structure, particularly in the policies of early childhood, teacher training and
assessment;
• The low number and technical capacity of the employees responsible for implementing the initiatives
- although this capacity has been developed, and at the end of the cooperation a different scenario
can be observed;
• The high turnover of government officials, whether at the executive, decision-making level, or in the
positions responsible for implementation, and even in schools, with the consequence of needing
constant time investments in the reconstruction of alliances at the strategic and operational level;
• The reduction in UNICEF's fundraising capacity, but mostly from the government due to the
dependence on the oil economy (the projects were developed under a co-participation regime);
• The reduced size of the Education team, having even remained without a section head for about a
year, causing operational overload.
• The asynchrony between the GoA budget cycle and UNICEF’s planning process, generating a
mismatch impacting the priorities defined in the cooperation and their inclusion in the public budget.
• Infrastructure problems (school, sanitation and road) in the country;
• Insufficient number of teachers;
• Factors that are exogenous to the project, such as structural barriers and discriminatory social norms,
continue to impact gender equity, especially the improved access of girls and young women to
education. These norms continue to be reflected in practices such as early marriage, gender-based
violence, traditional seclusion practices that restrict school retention, continue to favour boys in
family investment in education, and the unequal gender division of domestic work.
More effective strategies for achieving these results, and other lessons learned
113. The analysis of the effectiveness section shows that the results with the greatest impact potential on the
situation of Angolan children were achieved through technical support and advocacy actions. In the case of
national policies for early childhood special education and teacher training, UNICEF provided technical
support for the formulation of documents, and used its ability to articulate with different departments
involved within the government, with international associations and with the civil society to negotiate the
regulation terms and its officialization. In the first two cases, the cooperation also invested in technical
support for the implementation of policies, in the Special Education Reference Centres, and in the TUPPI
project. Regarding the TUPPI project, a cost-efficient model was achieved, with prospects for adoption by the
federal government.
114. UNICEF could adopt its articulation capacity as a strategy in a more consistent way, also using it to promote
the design of intersectoral interventions, a view shared by several interviewed key actors . For this, there is a
need to first bolster the intersectoral work within the organism. Although the intention to reinforce
integrated approaches is present in the planning documents, and there are evidences of this trend in the EAC
and in the recent response to the emergence of COVID-19, the Education Programme needs to work
internally with other sectors as a premise, in a more systematic way. Internal planning and the formulation
of cooperation documents could, for example, integrate the results of the protection, WASH (Water,
Sanitation and Hygiene) and nutrition sections.
115. As previously mentioned, training actions and the investment of resources in direct interventions to improve
school conditions, have a limited scope considering the volume of resources available for cooperation, but
they are justified for creating service models. However, it is necessary that the innovative models which are
developed have as a premise their replicability and, ideally, are associated to a wide dissemination plan by
the government or other funding agencies. In order to gain continuity, both the training of technicians and
26
teachers, and the improvement of school conditions need to incorporate advocacy strategies to add
continuous training into the planning and in the public budget, while also keeping at hand the continuous
improvement of school conditions, including policies to reduce the teacher deficit.
116. Among the technical support actions, we highlight the investment in the development of the Education
Information and Management System (SIGE) and the School Charter as central strategies, an important
expected result in strengthening the pillar of education management at the central, subnational and school
levels. This result also has important consequences for the effectiveness of the outcomes related to quality
and access, since the success of any intervention depends largely on the organization of data for diagnosis,
planning and monitoring. However, as already mentioned, initiatives to promote the timely use and
dissemination of information must continue.
117. The scarcity of resources is a factor that must be considered when prioritizing the action strategies and the
results that are intended to be achieved. On the one hand, the cooperation could focus its efforts on the
fronts that will influence national educational policies, impacting the well-being of more children. Even so,
the cooperation planning could provide for specific public resources, as well as building partnerships with
other actors such as funding agencies, which provide the required investment capacity for pilot projects to
scale once they are tested.
Efficiency
118. The efficiency criterion analyses whether the results were achieved with the least possible expenditure of
resources (cost-efficient) and checks whether there are alternative - and less costly - ways to achieve the
results. Under this criterion, the tendency to efficiency or inefficiency of the Program will be verified from the
analysis of the interviewees' discourse. The possibilities of triangulation with quantitative data were limited
because there was neither access to actual costs, nor direct and indirect beneficiaries of each activity and its
alternatives.
119. The fieldwork confirms what was observed in the document review: consistent data and practices for
monitoring, evaluation, and adjusting the planning to improve the operation are lacking. The 2017 formative
evaluation had already pointed to the territorial and thematic dispersion of the Education Programme and,
nevertheless, the expected results were not adjusted. Some interviewees express the need to resize the
expected results, ambitious in the face of the available human and financial resources, and explain the
impossibility of making this type of adjustment within the organization's practices, as many resources have
specific expenditure allocation.
120. Within UNICEF, as presented in the COAR, the ACO sought greater efficiency and cost reduction in its facilities
by sharing common services among the different sections and updating equipments of the Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT) office. On the other hand, turnover and long periods without leadership
in the education section (between November 2016 and April 2018), compromised the efficiency of the
Education Programme.
121. As found in the interviews and reported in the Annual Reviews, UNICEF is perceived as a very flexible partner
and willing to meet unforeseen demands, adjusting the design of the projects and absorbing the financing
of actions. In some cases, this flexibility allowed achieving the results in the programs, especially in
emergency contexts39. According to employees and former employees of the UNICEF education section, the
Education Programme was sometimes consumed by urgent short-term demands and was unable to keep up
with long-term projects. The lack of a stable human resources structure in the Program was an additional
factor that corroborates this perception.
122. In addition to being effective, the public policy advocacy strategy is efficient, as it makes intensive use of two
of UNICEF's main strengths - its ability to articulate and provide qualified technical support - and holds a
potential for national impact. While the interviewees corroborate this assessment, some make pertinent
reservations: law approval or other regulations, or the greater allocation of public resources for education,
are not a guarantee of implementation in the territory, and it is necessary to follow up and design support
mechanisms for the implementation. Contrary to this view that focuses on public policies, there is another
39 UNICEF ACO (2015)
27
group of interviewees for whom action should take place as close as possible to schools, and in coordination
with other sectors. However, for this strategy to be efficient, it will be necessary to focus on interventions
aimed at the development of service models, such as TUPPI and EAC, and guarantee the conditions for
replicability, as previously analysed.
123. Intersectoral action is also presented as a strategy with the potential to increase the efficiency and impact of
UNICEF's actions. The COARs of the evaluation period show that UNICEF sought to implement its activities
in an integrated manner amongst its different sections. This integration is particularly visible when
responding to emergency situations, such as the El Niño phenomenon in 2016, when integrated
interventions were implemented in the education, health, nutrition and WASH sections. The Porto Seguro
initiative, implemented in 2019, is also an example of intersectoral action aimed at facilitating the transition
between development and emergency contexts. In the development context, TUPPI and EAC stand out as the
main integration initiatives at the different sections of UNICEF. However, it is necessary to pay attention to
the evaluation of some internal actors who manifest that this articulation requires a time of joint planning,
and also articulation for the harmonization of work plans that are not initially built together.
124. The strategy of trainer preparation, responsible for the expansion to the provinces - both in training for
national and subnational managers, as well as for teachers - met the efficiency criterion by building
competence in the system itself and incorporating the figure of the inspector into the framework, enabling
the replication of training in schools. The training of the members of the Commission of Parents and
Education Officers resulted in greater community involvement, according to the interviewed actors in
schools, which in turn led to greater prioritization of education by families, as well as improvements in the
conditions of schools thanks to the participation of parents, for example, in the construction of latrines, and
even improving housing and hygiene conditions in the school vicinities40, some of the premises of the
projects.
125. It should be noted that the initiatives that seek to consolidate service models such as EAC, TUPPI and Porto
Seguro, were designed and implemented following a model of integrated approaches, articulating the
different sections of UNICEF, the school community and local partners, as it is the case of World Vision. As
already explained, UNICEF is considered to occupy a strategic position for mobilizing actors: “UNICEF is a link
between governmental and non-governmental actors”, and the promotion of increasingly integrated
approaches may be a fundamental factor for the better usage of financial and human resources, and
achieving better results.
126. In terms of efficiency within the scope of the EAC, in the interviews it is recognized as a program that requires
a great deal of administrative time to guarantee the necessary conditions to operate the project in the 13
participating schools, which, in the opinion of some UNICEF employees, compromises the time that could be
spent on actions of greater impact on the system.
127. The change in the structure of the cooperation, prioritizing the theme of early childhood, is an important
adjustment because it focuses on an investment area with a greater social return. According to the academic
literature, investments made in the first years of life will have positive consequences for the rest of it,
improving not only future school performance, but also generating better health conditions, increasing
income levels and reducing involvement in risky activities. Moreover, these investments are able to promote
efficiency and equity simultaneously41. Additionally, the TUPPI project is considered a reference in efficiency
due to the low cost of the model developed for community service to the population in this age group,
justifying the prospect of expanding the model to all 18 provinces. In the emergency context, the efficiency
of the actions was a point of criticism of the interviewees, especially due to the delay in response, whose
causes will be discussed in the analysis of the coordination.
128. There are external sources of inefficiency that the Education Program must deal with. In partnership with
the central government, the main challenges to efficiency were the high turnover of public employees and
the lack of intragovernmental coordination. The lack of communication and articulation of efforts in the
different departments of the MED generated delays and loss of efficiency in the operation. At the subnational

interaction promoted by the programme.
41 UNICEF (2017); Denboba, A. D.,et al. (2014).
28
level, three factors of inefficiency with government partners that stood out were: high turnover; two offices
dealing with various positions – for example, office subordinate administratively to the provincial
government and technically to the corresponding national directorates and institutes; and limited local
technical capacity. Finding non-governmental implementing partners capable of carrying out local actions is
both a recommendation to increase efficiency and also a challenge because a local support network has not
yet been consolidated. Some partners also mentioned the need for UNICEF to increase its presence at the
subnational level to better understand its needs. Although this is desirable to achieve a broader and deeper
understanding of the Angolan context, opening the geographical focus of action is not recommended, as
previously observed. Consequently, other alternatives must be put in place.
129. The fieldwork confirms the conclusion of the document analysis: there is a possibility of increasing efficiency
in three areas: 1) adjustments in the implementation of activities (reduction of thematic and territorial
dispersion, monitoring and evaluation routines); 2) promoting efficiency in the design of public policies
(promoting greater coordination, application of the convergence model, monitoring of the GSB); and 3)
institutional adjustments (institutional reforms and the articulation between the Agency's Programmes and
other United Nations office - UN).
Conclusions and lessons learned on the efficient use of resources.
130. The Education Program must take advantage of its recognized and consolidated quality over the years as a
competent articulator, and seek to work more with partners, both internal and external, taking advantage of
the comparative advantages of each one.
131. The strengthening of the SIGE for the systematic collection and organization of national statistics on a single
platform, and the School Charter to support subnational governments in planning the implementation of
policies, are fundamental in promoting the adoption of a culture of using data and evidence for decision-
making in the design and implementation of projects for greater efficiency. This effort must be accompanied
by permanent training dynamics for the use of statistics in planning and its impact on public policies, be it
by local managers, school managers, or even families. Likewise, a predictable dynamic of periodic
dissemination of the collected data should be instituted, allowing its use for the diagnosis, planning and
monitoring of the education situation in the country, and also for the implementation of public policies. This
will also help to build a scenario of efforts convergence of actors at all levels, with the potential to achieve
better results more efficiently. Training for the use of data must be complemented with training for project
management, as mentioned by interviewed actors at the governmental and non-governmental levels.
132. It is also necessary to document decisions and improve monitoring of the cooperation implementation.
Although it is possible to verify in the ACO administrative documentation that periodic meetings were held
to monitor the implementation of the cooperation in meetings held between UNICEF and the Government
of Angola, the records of the decisions are not very objective. As mentioned earlier, the programme's logical
frameworks changed over the course of the cooperation and a cohesive monitoring system was not
established. The establishment of a monitoring system for the Education Programme may also reduce the
impact on efficiency imposed by high turnover in national and subnational governments by recording the
status of the implementation more clearly.
133. The impact on public policies (as in the case of policies for early childhood), and technical support that
incorporates the objective of developing capabilities at the national and sub-national level (as in the case of
the School Charter), also stand out as implementation strategies that promote efficiency because they have
the potential to multiply results. At this point, it is necessary to balance the hiring of external consultants,
capable of bringing new expertise and promoting innovation, with the hiring of national experts, who are
more accessible and with greater mastery of the local reality.
134. Faced with criticism from some partners about the lack of UNICEF presence at the subnational level, the
organization could bring the accumulated knowledge of these partners with local presence to the design
process of interventions, as well as improving the situation monitoring in Angola at the subnational level.
29
Sustainability
135. Under the sustainability criterion, one analyses to what extent the expected results will persist over time,
after the intervention ends. The programme’s sustainability will depend, among other factors, on the
guaranteed financial conditions, on the existence of regulations to ensure continuity (interventions as part
of national plans), on the capacity created within the government and other sectors involved, and on the
implementation conditions in the territories. Two factors in the Angolan context made the concern with the
sustainability of actions particularly relevant. First, during the period under review, Angola experienced
elections that led to a change of government. Although the new government maintained the social agenda
at the centre of its priorities, as detailed in the relevance section, the change was accompanied by a high
turnover of employees in key positions, generating the need to relocate cooperation activities among
government priorities, and to re-establish working links in different departments. Additionally, the country
faced a substantial drop in oil revenues, an important source of public resources, thus reducing the available
budget, including for the education sector.
136. Advocacy work for developing national plans and technical support activities for capability development at
national and subnational levels (and also in schools) represent important strategies for sustainability. In
advocacy, the publication of the national special education policy and advances in policies for early childhood
and teacher training, lead to the incorporation of priority themes of the cooperation in the national public
policy agenda through the normative. In the case of technical support for capability building in governments,
despite staff turnover, it incorporates knowledge into government structures. The articulation of actions
within UNICEF itself, with national and subnational governments, with other United Nations agencies and
other cooperation agencies, with civil society organizations (CSOs), with the academy, and with local
communities, in addition to increasing effectiveness and efficiency, promoted the sustainability of
investments by developing capabilities beyond the scope of direct action and specific contexts. The more
emphatic involvement of provinces and school communities throughout the cooperation, together with the
integration of new partners, are proof of this trend of greater articulation. The integrated design that is
already being practiced in the 2015-2019 cooperation - like the integration with WASH in the EACs - and is
structurally adopted in the 2020-2022 cooperation cycle, is also an important vector for sustainability.
137. Next to the concept of articulation, communication stands out as an important strategy for sustainability.
The awareness campaigns of managers and the population in general undertaken by UNICEF on the different
topics of interest are considered fundamental for the consolidation of changes. As an articulation and
awareness strategy, UNICEF Angola strengthened its digital communication with periodical publications
aligned with regional and global campaigns and programmatic priorities in the country. To increase its reach,
accounts on social networks were created to reinforce existing ones, such as the ACO's Facebook page.
Specific thematic campaigns were developed on social networks42.
138. The strengthening of the SIGE for management, and especially the development of the monitoring capacity
of the SDGs, supports sustainability by promoting the adoption of the transversal approach in the
development of the design and implementation of public policies. UNICEF has contributed to the
development of GEPE's capacity for the collection, processing, analysis, systematization and use of
information (Data Must Speak initiative). Nevertheless, it is still necessary to consistently incorporate these
systems at the subnational level in all provinces.
139. The studies on the public budget promoted within the cooperation and carried out by the ADRA organization
also have an important role for the sustainability of the actions on several fronts: it gave decision makers a
negotiation basis to expand the resources dedicated to the sector; it gave civil society organizations a
methodology as an advocacy platform for strengthening education policies; it sought to give transparency
to public spending and to provide conditions for society to take ownership of the debate. However, this action
took place only at the central level. Among the provinces that were part of the fieldwork, there is little
familiarity and perceived capability to influence resource allocation.
140. The strategy of training managers, teachers and community leaders, the preparation of trainers and the
involvement of training centres in planned activities, was an important promoter of sustainability in
42 UNICEF ACO (2017) and UNICEF ACO (2018)
30
strengthening the capabilities of decision makers, school systems and local communities. However, the high
turnover of technical staff and teachers is a risk to the sustainability of actions, and a threat to institutional
memory. There is a need to create conditions for those involved to take ownership of the acquired capabilities
and be able to replicate them. Some possibilities are the creation of training materials, such as publications
and videos, and their wide dissemination in electronic media (on a digital platform), with extensive access
capacity.
141. The search for low-cost models that can be replicated and supported by the government right from the pilot
implementation stage, the best example being the work carried out for early childhood care, is a strategy
that promotes sustainability, for the low level of investment required increases the likelihood of its adoption
as a public policy. It is desirable to adopt these premises (replicability and low cost) in the initiatives
developed in addition to, as pointed out by some interviewees, carrying out pilot projects anticipating an
expansion plan, and making room for adjustments in the model as it gains scale.
142. The participation of the school community and its integration into school activities are important factors for
sustainability, as observed in the training carried out within the scope of the EAC and TUPPI project, which
resulted in the incorporation of the community in carrying out activities such as the care for children in early
childhood, greater parental involvement in school activities (in the case of primary education), and work to
improve school conditions with the help of the local community.
143. Although the perception that investments in infrastructure, especially in the case of EAC, will continue over
time, prevails among the interviewees, it should be noted that these gains were occasional, that they did not
transform the school infrastructure of the country as a whole, and that no evidence has been found that its
maintenance has been guaranteed.
Challenges and risks to sustainability
144. The fieldwork confirms the relevance of some risks identified in the IR, ponders others and highlights new
challenges, which are: 1) finding alternatives to the lack of financial resources, both from UNICEF and from
governments; 2) continue to promote the strengthening of provinces and municipalities, supporting
operational and budgetary decentralization; 3) involve stakeholders in planning and defining resource
allocation; 4) improve the strategies for the multiplication of training courses to guarantee their reflection
in the classroom; 5) take advantage of UNICEF's comparative advantage for articulating actors and
expanding the effective performance of the civil society, one of the guarantors of sustainability; 6) promote
the systematization of experiences to ensure continuity in the face of high turnover of actors, maintain
memory, and support replication and scale gains.
145. There are still other factors that threaten sustainability and are outside the programme's governance, such
as family, social and economic conditions; the precariousness of the school infrastructure. As long as these
issues are a concern for the school community, the quality of teaching is unlikely to reach a crucial place of
importance.
146. It is worth mentioning that the approval of national policies for special education – as well as for early
childhood and teacher training, as foreseen - does not guarantee the implementation of public policies.
Although the legislation generates a certain degree of sustainability and continuity to policies, there is a need
to guarantee the material conditions for its execution. This is the case of the inclusive education policy,
guaranteed by law, but with major implementation challenges to effectively benefit Angolan children.
Technical support for implementation and advocacy for policy regulation are a basis for the continuity of
UNCEF's strategic performance and essential for the sustainability of its efforts.
147. Some interviewees mention the fight against inequality, especially gender inequality, as an essential factor
even for the country's economic development. The issues of gender, equity and children rights are a constant
in the design of UNICEF interventions, which work with a focus on the most vulnerable populations in the
country, and whose actions benefit minority populations, as in the case of the TUPPI project, which mobilized
the sobas.
31
Conclusions and lessons learned about the sustainability of results
148. The governments’ priorities are materialized in the public budget. In this sense, a fundamental lesson for the
sustainability of the actions developed is the need to create mechanisms that guarantee public financing of
the priorities defined within the cooperation between UNICEF and the GoA, during its implementation and
in the future. This assessment is corroborated by UNICEF and government interviewees who expressed that
the prioritized activities indeed received public funding and have positive continuity prospects. Such
examples are SIGE and TUPPI.
149. The government’s appropriation of cooperation projects - through implemented public policies – as well as
the organized civil society’s appropriation of these projects - through action fronts within the planning of
organizations - is also a foundation for the sustainability of the cooperation results. The projects that have
attracted more partners and that have gained strength and their own identity, ceasing to be “cooperation
projects with UNICEF”, are projects that will be kept alive, in the opinion of some interviewees. There is an
understanding, therefore, that the consolidation of a network of governmental and non-governmental
partners, working for education in Angola, is an important task to be consolidated for the benefit of the
results sustainability. During the period under review, partnerships were consolidated with ADRA, Mosaiko,
ISCED in Huíla and the World Bank, examples from which a broader support network could be consolidated.
150. A third lesson in the field of sustainability are the gains that can be made from an integrated planning. The
experiences of integrating actions with the protection, WASH and nutrition sectors can be analysed and
incorporated in a systemic way, in line with the proposal of the 2030 Agenda - main reference of the 2020-
2022 cooperation - which highlights the importance of intersectoral connections for development. The
sustainability of advances in the cooperation requires overcoming not only sectoral barriers but also those
among the MED offices themselves, as a premise to gain effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability.
151. While ensuring the sustainability of the cooperation results largely falls on the GoA, UNICEF must seek to
build a favourable environment through advocacy and technical support actions that strengthen the
government's legal framework, structure, and technical capacity.
2.2. Emergency Contexts
Coherence
152. Under the coherence criterion, we verified if there was alignment between the interventions implemented
in the contexts of humanitarian aid, and the interventions for development (internal coherence), as well as
with other interventions of the government(s) or other organizations (external coherence). Additionally,
under this criterion, we verified the Programme’s contribution to improving the performance of the MED in
these contexts.
153. Firstly, it should be noted that the logic of emergency interventions has undergone changes throughout the
program. Although the Education Programme planned ever since the first work plan for the 2015-2016
biennium, under result 1 (Output 1 on access), to develop activities in emergency contexts in partnership
with the central government (MED / DNEG and DNASE), it was only in 2017 that the theme gained
prominence as a singular expected result (separated from output 1).
154. During the 2015-2016 biennium, the Programme proposed to support training activities and the elaboration
of a national policy on the topic. In the revision of the work plan for the 2016-2017 biennium, the activities
focus on data collection, identifying opportunities for prevention and response and the inclusion of the topic
in at least three provincial plans, associating public resources for its execution. In 2017, the review proposes
the creation of a National Technical Group, the elaboration of a National Contingency Plan and the
preparation of trainers for WASH, focusing on the provinces of Benguela, Bié, Cabinda, Cunene, Huíla, Kuanza
Sul, Moxico, Namibe, Zaire and Luanda. Guidelines with minimum requirements on emergency education
have been created. This year, a specific front was also created for the 2017-2018 biennium in the province of
Lunda Norte, with the objective of purchasing materials and training teachers in the municipality of Lóvua.
In the review for the 2018-2019 biennium, actions in emergency contexts, in addition to the support of the
MED, incorporated the strengthening of the communities and their resilience in the municipalities of Cacula,
32
Quipungo and Gambos (Huíla), as well as the strengthening of reference systems for children affected by
violence.
155. Figure 2 below shows interventions in emergency contexts over time:
Figure 2 – Interventions in an emergency context
156. Within these strategies, the Program developed actions to face the main emergency situations that the
country faced in the last decade, among which we highlight the drought that started in 2011/2012 and
devastated the south of the country and led to the migratory crisis of Lunda Norte.
157. Regarding the drought, the Diagnostic data on the impact of emergencies and opportunities for readiness,
response and recovery in the education sector43 show that since 2011/2012, the southern region has been
experiencing a drought situation, having received sporadic rains during this period, but which were not
enough for the recovery of the provinces, which suffered the most severe drought in 35 years in 2015. The
report data shows that in 2016 there were 1,139,064 people affected by the drought, and in three southern
provinces the registered numbers were: 755,930 (Cunene), 205,507 (Huíla) and 177,627 (Namibe).
158. The migratory crisis, in turn, has affected the country since 1997, with an exponential increase in the number
of refugees in Angola, especially in the northern and north-eastern parts of the country. These refugees come
from the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (1996-1998), mainly from the Kasai and Katanga
provinces, which border the Lunda Norte province. In recent years, increased violence in the Kasai region of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has triggered many people to flee to Angola. 2017 data shows that
there were 80,698 refugees and asylum seekers in the country, including 35,000 registered in the Kasai region
of the DRC, of which 75% are women and children44.
159. In this context, the 2018-2022 National Development Plan, under which the Programme was aligned, aims
to guarantee the Angolan territorial integrity through a migration policy that safeguards national interests.
It aims to fight illegal immigration (namely from the Northern and North-eastern borders).

160. Considering these contexts, the evaluation sought to identify what was done by the Programme to mitigate
the effects of these crises on children, especially considering their equal access to an education of quality
(Annex VI). At this point, it is important to highlight that, as it was already observed in the IR, there is little
documentation on actions in emergency contexts. Interviewees attribute the fact to the reactive action in
the face of cyclical natural disasters and migratory phenomena. Considering the timing, the implementation
and decision-making processes of interventions in emergency contexts, this view seems consistent with the
reality and as will be detailed later, there are several factors that point to the lack of planning for emergency
actions.
161. Still, the UNICEF Angola Office Annual Reports provide a breakdown of what was done by the Programme in
the context of emergency actions. This information shows an alignment with the demands, contexts, and
priorities of the government. It also helps dimensioning the efforts undertaken.
162. The available documents show that support was provided mostly to improve access conditions by offering
classrooms (tents) and kits with training materials.
163. Concerning the strengthening of local capabilities, educators were trained at the national and provincial
levels, in response to MED requests, ensuring the alignment of interventions with specific demands. Data on
these training sessions are scarce, and the available consolidated records in the COAR show that in 2016
training on Disaster Recovery and Risk Reduction was held with 18 participating professionals, who trained
634 school teachers on the topic (COAR 2016). In 2018, training was given to school communities on Ebola
prevention in the provinces of Moxico and Uíge, reaching around 400 people (COAR 2018). There is no data,
however, on other training sessions, number of participants or information to help qualify these actions and
the results generated. However, in the interviewees' assessment, the training of some teachers on resilience
in emergency situations (between 2016 and 2017), for example, had good results and was well received by
local partners.
164. Furthermore, through document analysis, it is possible to conclude that the activities sought internal
coherence in relation to the agenda of other sectors (with special articulation with the UNICEF nutrition
section, whose actions are extremely relevant for facing the emergency situations faced), and in relation to
the development agenda. This emergency - development integration took place especially through advocacy
at the national level for national policies and plans, financing, training of professionals and school
communities. In terms of internal organization, the agency authorized the use of emergency response funds
to strengthen local capabilities. There is no information on who decided or how this decision was made, but
these issues are less relevant, in comparison with the result of this decision, which was necessary and
consistent with the guideline for strengthening local resilience.
165. On the other hand, there are different informants who share the view that greater efforts still need to be
made to promote effective integration between development and humanitarian interventions. According to
some key UNICEF informants, despite the agency having a strong command in emergency actions, efforts
still need to be made to value these actions which, due to the low volume of available resources, are marginal
in character, despite the fact that the country is in a permanent state of emergency due to poverty, migration,
prevalent nomadic culture, cyclical periods of droughts and floods. In this regard, the information available
from budgets shared with the evaluation team does not allow to distinguish the volume of resources that
were allocated for emergency actions in relation to the total budget of the Programme, and it is not possible
to ascertain to what extent this perception corresponds to reality.
166. There is, however, in an extensive group, which includes informants from different levels of government, the
expectation that a major event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may lead to the design of a cross-sectional
approach. Then, in this regard, there is a broad agreement amongst the different informants, who report a
change in attitude towards the pandemic, which highlights the need for consistent plans to deal with
humanitarian situations. During the pandemic, the need for coordinated action was made explicit and,
according to the interviewed informants, a government emergency committee was created that prepared a
contingency plan. UNICEF, as well as the World Bank, participated in the committee. The intention is that this
plan can become the basis for acting in emergencies and that it may be adjusted annually.
167. About valuing emergency actions, different interviewees emphasize the importance of coming into line with
the developmental actions, planning the transition from emergency to development, without leaving the
34
territories and the population fully exposed once the emergency is overcome. Even though interventions
such as the one carried out in Lunda Norte are deemed successful, the need to change the acting paradigm
for a methodology based on planning is also recognized. The COVID pandemic crisis in 2020 is mentioned as
an important event to transform the response around education, by imposing the real challenge of teaching
in an emergency situation and requiring articulated and planned action.
168. The recent implementation of Porto Seguro, in the province of Cunene, represents a positive initiative in order
to provide conditions for a gradual transition from the emergency to the development context, reducing the
vulnerability of the community and promoting resilience so that there are better conditions to deal with the
crisis. Although it was designed to respond to the severe drought situation in Cunene, helping ten schools in
the municipality of Ombadja, Porto Seguro, due to its integrated approach, in which different sections of
UNICEF, school community and local partners are articulated, indicates that this is a model to be expanded.
169. With respect to Porto Seguro (which means “safe haven”, in English), internal documents of the Project
highlight that its main long-term objective is to reduce the vulnerabilities of the Ombadja populations,
including children and adolescents, as well as to strengthen their resilience and adaptation to climate
change. The project also aims to strengthen the capacity of local state actors and offers operational models
for the functioning of social services during emergencies and extreme natural events, using schools in
remote areas as "safe havens". The focus is on strengthening the capacity of local WASH and education
systems in order to prevent water scarcity, severe acute malnutrition, child mortality and morbidity at the
local level, making sure that the population has access to clean water and basic sanitation, so access to
education and nutrition may be strengthened and that children are protected from all forms of exploitation
and separation from their families. The project then combines integrated interventions in WASH, Nutrition,
Health, Education, Child Protection and Communication for Development (C4D), all designed to prioritize the
needs of 12,000 children from 2,400 families in Ombadja. According to Project documents, the interventions
were planned to be coordinated with the government at the provincial, municipal, and collective levels and
guided through a system of systematic monitoring of the situation.
170. Thinking exclusively about the proposal and model adopted, the Project appears to be an alternative to serve
other municipalities that also suffer from drought, and can be replicated in other provinces. The ability to
replicate the experience is observed both by the characteristics of the Programme, which favour its
adaptation to the needs and possibilities of the context and start from a dialogue with the local structures
to define the services. In addition, there are other provinces that have similar social, economic and climatic
conditions where emergency situations occur cyclically. In those provinces, the Project will contribute to the
development of plans and help build responsiveness at the local level. A quote from one of the interviewees
at the provincial level is very representative of the common understanding about the scenario and the type
of intervention, so far: “(the crisis) being cyclical requires and allows for the preparation of timely assistance.
We must not wait for the crisis to happen, but instead prevent it from happening”.
171. In effect, the need to develop preventive actions and especially emergency planning is at the centre of the
discourse of the most critical people, who reinforce the importance of abandoning reactive interventions,
mainly because every year there are situations of climatic, sanitary and nutritional calamity in Angola. The
absence of planning, which was already mentioned, is evident not only by the large number of statements
made on this point, but also by the absence of documents that demonstrate that, in fact, these actions were
previously planned. A planned response would open up the possibility of reconciling the concrete needs with
the help offered. In the absence of this planning, what played out was an “emergency response and a report
on the number of beneficiaries of the emergency response, but not a contribution to the response strategy,
as it is the case with other programs”. Government informants say, however, that there were plans to
conduct a document review to develop an emergency education policy, but that this process was suspended
due to the departure of the UNICEF chief of education and the pandemic.
172. Still considering all limitations, the external coherence of the Programme was guaranteed by communication
with external actors, especially with provincial governments, particularly for the identification of needs and
the definition of measures to be taken. In addition, the actions were designed based on demands coming
from the government, which guaranteed this alignment. Different interviewees share this understanding
when they affirm that an open dialogue guided the relationship between UNICEF and the MED, whose
35
“demands reflect those demands from the provinces and municipalities, considering that they are
established based on what the municipalities report” (Representative of the National Government).
173. In this regard, the 2014 country Census was essential in obtaining a better diagnosis of the territory
knowledge, and for the definition of emergency policies in the country. The 2013-2017 National
Development Plan also included in its Social Program the assistance of families in vulnerable situations,
vulnerable groups and these groups in an emergency situation, with a basic food basket, with the allocation
of technical aids and means of transportation. According to the 2016 COAR, UNICEF also assisted the MED in
conducting a study on the impact of emergency situations on enrolment and attendance, and in formulating
strategies on how to continue education services in these circumstances. This study has also guided the
definition of the strategies to be adopted by the Programme.
174. Concerning the gender approach in emergency actions (as already mentioned), it is only possible to draw
comments based on what is seen in UNICEF guidelines and in the interviewees' discourse. The statement
below is very representative of the type of information offered by key informants during the interviews:
“Equity, gender equality and children rights are an essential part of UNICEF, so it would not be
possible to intervene without taking these aspects into account. There is a specific pre-established
criterion, and these are parameters that need to be followed.”
(Representative of UNICEF Angola)
175. On this matter, and according to government interviewees at the national and subnational levels, gender
and equity issues have always been taken into account in humanitarian actions as well. UNICEF
representatives say that prior to acting, an effort was made to identify the number of boys and the number
of girls in communities and schools. Additionally, it can be noted from the analysis of the documents made
available that it was not always possible to rely on previous studies, given the urgency of the situations.
However, the study carried out in 2016 on the impacts of emergency situations on the number of enrolments
and school attendance was carried out using a gender filter, and describes for each situation and in each
region the percentage of girls and boys affected. In this sense, the interviewees affirm that, based on this
information and on information offered by the government, it was planned the acquisition of materials and
identification of situations in which girls were out of school, followed by the development of compensatory
actions.
176. Yet, it was not possible to ascertain to what extent the gender perspective was, in fact, adopted in the
development of emergency actions or if what was foreseen was adequate and sufficient to meet the needs
of the girls. This gap in the Programme data, which does not explain the differences among the groups
served, makes it difficult to estimate these actions and, consequently, to make adjustments in the approach
aiming at promoting equity.
177. Finally, in addition to the study carried out in 2016 and the training offered, the evaluation team did not have
access to any other information that could demonstrate that the emergency actions aimed at increasing the
performance of the Ministry of Education and in providing services at the national and subnational levels in
humanitarian contexts. The key informants were also unable to offer common and / or qualified points of
view in this regard. However, in analysing only through the bias of what was actually done, the immediate
conclusion is that a large part of the actions (kits distribution, tents, etc.) were not intended to promote a
better performance of the MED in the provision of its services, but rather to fill a gap left by the State in
emergency contexts in which the essentials are lacking so boys and girls may have minimum conditions to
attend school.
Coverage
178. Under this criterion, the activities carried out by UNICEF in emergency contexts will be presented, analysing
whether the most vulnerable people received the necessary attention, seeking to answer the following
evaluative questions, which were partially addressed under the coherence criterion, especially about genre.
179. Also, under the coverage criterion, it is not possible to make strong statements since the Programme
monitoring data is scarce. There is no systematic, standardized, and accessible information that allows
36
checking how many and which people were served by the Programme. According to the information available
in all the different internal reports, the coverage data for emergency actions contains few numbers and
without any distinction of the beneficiary's profile, besides presenting many gaps:

180. That said, the coverage analysis is limited to the analysis of the local needs in the different Angolan territories,
in view of the geographical location and type of intervention carried out.
181. From the analysis of the actions carried out, it is noted that if on one hand some of the locations with the
greatest deprivation in the country were included, on the other the provinces of Kwando Kubango, Kwanza
Sul and Uíge – among the most vulnerable provinces in Angola45 - did not receive support.
182. In contrast, some interviewees referred to migratory and refugee movements from the Republic of Congo,
and the drought in the south of the country, as the most relevant calamities, a perception that is consistent
with the facts, as described in the context. In this case, all UNICEF sections were mobilized to articulate the
45 UNICEF (2015)
37
response, including the Education section, which implemented the activities described above to provide
affected children with conditions for learning, albeit through informal education.
183. Concerning the type of intervention carried out in the selected provinces as the focus of this assessment,
humanitarian intervention in Bié focused on the distribution of tents that served as classrooms for
vulnerable communities, victims of climatic disasters such as the torrential rains that destroyed the adobe
schools. In this regard, it should be noted that Bié is the Angolan province with the highest rate of severe
chronic malnutrition, with 54% of children chronically malnourished. To fight this situation, there was a set
of interventions including: 1) training of health technicians, of community agents and of mothers to identify
malnutrition among family members and, 2) distribution of therapeutic and nutritional products in large
quantities46.
184. In addition, as already mentioned, due to the drought in the southern region of the country, UNICEF
responded to emergency situations in the provinces of Huíla and Cunene. At Cunene, the focus was on
carrying out studies to identify potability and access to water, followed by the installation of tanks and wells,
and water treatment. Also related to the drought problem, malnutrition situations have received UNICEF's
attention. In the Cunene province, the Porto Seguro Project is widely recognized by interviewees, whether
they are from UNICEF or the government, as mentioned earlier. In the province of Huíla, also affected by
drought, UNICEF's interventions essentially focused on providing water on a regular basis to communities
and schools. In the area of health and nutrition, the training of technicians, active nutritional screening and
intensification of vaccines were promoted. During the emergency response, development activities
continued to be implemented.
185. Thus, by analysing the type of intervention carried out (such as the responses to migratory and drought crises,
as previously described), as well as considering the interviewees' discourse and this evaluation’s reference
documents, it is possible to state that UNICEF's actions, considering their possibilities and limitations, tried
to prioritize the most grave situations. There is evidence of the concern and actions to assist the most
vulnerable, both in actions for the development and in emergency contexts, be it in the selection of
geographic coverage or in the definition of the assisted population.
186. Nevertheless, it is notorious that "some people were left out and had no assistance". One way to expand this
coverage is to promote the strengthening of articulations and joint actions, either with the MED or with other
actors, even taking advantage of local resources to minimize implementation costs. Besides that, the strategy
currently underway, to perform a better planning of these actions, may even favour the dialogue with
decision makers, as it allows to be explained what is possible to be done within the temporal, geographical
and resource limits, even highlighting the populations that eventually remain without assistance and
coverage.
187. In the next section, which deals with coordination, the question about how the Education Programme
involved the MED, provincial and municipal governments in implementing activities for the most vulnerable
populations will be answered.
Coordination
188. Under this dimension, one analyses how the Program was coordinated with other actors in the same
locations, what mechanisms and instruments exist to promote this coordination and which internal and
external factors influenced these relationships.
189. Through the document analysis and the interviewees' discourse, it appears that there were several
mechanisms for UNICEF to coordinate its interventions with other actors, mechanisms that also aimed to
promote the improvement of the MED performance, however, neither from the analysis of the interviewees'
discourse nor from the document analysis it is possible to identify a standard coordination mechanism, pre-
established communication flows, systems for identifying partners or interlocutors within the institutions,
or pre-defined frequencies and formats for exchanging with partners. Apparently, this weakness comes from
46 UNICEF ACO (2016)
38
other weaknesses in the emergency response, such as the lack of planning and even the characteristics of
local structures, as one interviewee pointed out:.
“The intersectoral coordination structures are not yet strong enough. The lack of a 'network' makes it
difficult to respond quickly, because you have to start all conversations and find the key actors for
each answer.”
(UNICEF representative)
190. Although the planning documents point to the promotion of training, at the national level, of a national
technical group prepared to act in emergency situations, and show that the Programme technically
supported the efforts of the MED in the elaboration of a prevention plan (reduction of risks), readiness and
response to emergency situations, in conjunction with the affected provinces and municipalities, emerges as
a feasible perspective from the pandemic crisis of COVID-19 in the interviews, as a consequence of how it
was planned and developed at a national level.
191. As already mentioned, the Programme adopted a multisectoral approach to provide integrated access to
public services and to strengthen the resilience of communities affected by the various droughts and the
situation of social exclusion. Using funds from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) of the United
Nations, in partnership with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Health
Organization (WHO) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the NGOs World Vision, ADRA and
People in Need, UNICEF responded to the drought that hit the country’s south provinces of Cunene, Huíla,
Bié and Namibe. Another classic example of coordination was the signing of the agency's cooperation
agreement with the GoA, focusing the action in the Lunda Norte province as a result of the settlement of
refugees from the Republic of Congo (2017), integrating health and nutrition sectors, water and sanitation,
child protection, education and communication for development.
192. Besides that, UNICEF undertook important coordination efforts by promoting the collection of educational
statistics and the development of diagnoses for planning in emergency contexts. In the case of Lunda Norte,
UNICEF sent a plan and budget proposal to the MED, requesting access to formal education. UNICEF
supported public budget analysis efforts in partnership with the government, civil society organizations and
the academy, and advocated to increase the resources available for education in both development and
emergency contexts.
193. These actions point to an effort to promote coordinated actions, and UNICEF representatives reinforce that
the response to emergencies, given their nature, “have always been in coordination with other entities, such
as FAO, UNDP, WHO, because CERF funds were not exclusively for UNICEF ”. This statement corresponds to
the COAR data, which indicate the partners involved in the response and action for each year. Thus, it is a
premise of humanitarian actions to carry out coordinated actions, with different institutions being
articulated and following different protocols depending on the possibilities and needs of each context. In
addition to United Nations organizations, UNICEF's work in these locations was coordinated with provincial
governments, municipal and communal administrations, local and international NGOs, with local actors
acting on identifying areas, targeting audiences, screening, mapping the target audience, and UNICEF acts
to provide support and monitor the processes.
194. With what was exposed in mind, it is possible to state that there was integration to some level in the
response to the selected emergency situations, with interviewees from UNICEF, the Central Government and
the provincial governments stating that this coordination existed and facilitated the work, with a common
perception that this joint action was essential, as shown in the statement below:
“Governments will never have enough capabilities to deal with public calamities, as there are
numerous needs. Regardless of whether they are strengthened, government capabilities are
insufficient. You always need support from other forces”.
(Government representative)
39
195. A pattern identified in the form of coordination relates to the way in which local needs were identified. The
information gathered during the fieldwork, coming especially from interviewees of different profiles, allows
us to affirm that UNICEF interventions were determined according to the demands of the MED, with whom
UNICEF maintains a constant dialogue. The informants point out that this dialogue was expanded in the last
biennium, a period in which UNICEF was more open to dialogue on the allocation of resources, the result of
a change in the intervention strategy, reversing a posture that made the reallocation of resources overly
difficult.
The constant dialogue also served as a coordination mechanism with other actors during the
implementation, as stated by one of the UNICEF interviewees:
“UNICEF and other United Nations agencies held coordination meetings to find out where they stand [the
intervention], what each one does, so that there is no overlap between activities and initiatives, and to
maintain everyone aligned”. (UNICEF representative)
196. In addition to the national office in Luanda, there are UNICEF focal points in three field offices in the provinces
of Bié, Huíla and Uíge, where Planning and Monitoring Officers (PMOs) work, in addition to an Operations
Associate working in the province of Cunene. Despite this, a factor highlighted by some respondents as a
cause of delay in responses is the need to strengthen local structures in the education section, so that they
are able to diagnose the situation and promote greater engagement of local actors. However, it is not
possible to know how this articulation worked in practice. What is known is that constant meetings and
exchanges between partners were the predominant way of articulating efforts. UNICEF and other United
Nations agencies held monthly coordination meetings to find out the status of the intervention, what each
partner carried out, so to make sure that there was no overlap between activities and initiatives and for all
agencies to be aligned.
197. It should be emphasized that the absence of directors in the MED that are primarily responsible for
responding to emergencies poses challenges for work in the territories, in addition to being an evidence of
how these events tend to be naturally accepted and their consequences to be neglected. Given these
circumstances, there are those who believe that “UNICEF's most important job is to strengthen the system,
not only the capabilities, but the way the system works, including improving coordination among the
national, provinces and municipalities levels. The work needs to be linked to local needs and articulated with
provincial governments”.
198. Also for this reason, the perception of UNICEF respondents is that the articulation with other actors still
needs to be improved, as the structures of mitigation and harm reduction are not very developed yet, either
at the central level or in the provinces, there being no nor a structure to coordinate emergency planning, as
mentioned previously. The lack of a consolidated network creates a challenge in terms of starting the
articulation with each intervention, resulting in longer response times.
199. From UNICEF’s side, a need was expressed to define focal points prepared specifically to act in emergencies,
as a mechanism to improve the effectiveness of action. Considering the context, the mechanisms adopted,
the limitations identified in the response time and finally the articulation of the actions, this proposal seems
correct, especially because it would require few additional investments.
“Each board of directors should have a professional with experience in emergency education. People are
appointed when the emergency happens, when in fact they should be leaving for the execution”.
(UNICEF Representative)
200. Conclusions and lessons learned about the emergency context
• In terms of effectiveness, efficiency, coverage and gender approaches, and the promotion of equity,
it appears that the absence of consistent monitoring data on the emergency context seriously
undermines the qualification of the work conducted. This information gap leads to judgments based
on the impressions of the actors involved, who, despite being qualified and relevant, are not able to
40
provide details on the number of people affected, their profile, location etc. In this regard, if the
proposal to plan these actions is successful, monitoring indicators should be included, as well as a
structure, deadlines and means of measuring and obtaining information.
• Furthermore, in addition to the annual reports, where the achievements of the Programme are
recorded, it may be interesting to record and systematize the learnings for each cycle. The absence of
these records, coupled with staff turnover, leads to loss of institutional memory. In the case of the
emergency context, in which responses were designed and implemented to respond to critical
situations, it is normal that there is no space for that. However, the need for greater planning,
reported by all interviewees indicates a need for longer reflection times , which can be an opportunity
to create such moments of reflection and learning.
• About the activities themselves, the main lessons learned about operating in emergency contexts
refer to the importance of coordinated work, of coordination mechanisms at different levels
(interinstitutional, interagency) as an element that contributes to dialogue and joint decision making,
better planning, greater sustainability, greater optimization of resources, etc. These mechanisms
should take into consideration the government and civil society, as well as cooperation agencies, and
should also be promoted at national, provincial and municipal levels.
• The need for prior planning; and the importance of building resilience in schools and local
communities to increase efficiency and ensure service provision during the emergency period, can
also be considered as a lessons.
• Considering the cyclical nature of many calamities faced by Angolans, advanced planning is feasible
and can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the response. For that, it is necessary to work with
a medium and long-term perspective, designing actions to build the bridge between emergency
interventions and development projects. In this respect, the experience with the Porto Seguro project
in the province of Cunene proved to be very successful and can serve as an example of good practice
for the transition between an emergency intervention to be incorporated into development
initiatives.
• Based on what was exposed throughout the segment on the emergency context, whether due to the
challenges or the achievements of the education section, the lesson learned is that integrated
approaches tend to be more effective. It is worth highlighting the assessment of some informants
who believe that for integration to be successful, it will be necessary for partners to also be aware of
the benefits of multisectoral implementation and be willing to work under this new paradigm.
• As already explained in the case of development contexts, the consolidation of local partner networks
for emergency responses can generate important benefits, as agility is essential for an integrated
intervention to be successful. In the absence of such a network, there is a need for an articulation
time that precedes the action and which may compromise the results.
3. Conclusions and recommendations
201. The 2015-2016 UNICEF Education Programme was effectively guided by the national priorities defined in the
national regulations, by UNICEF’s global planning and by the Sustainable Development Goals, and sought to
act within the scope of the main difficulties evidenced by the national statistics. The cooperation activities
were adjusted when necessary to meet national and subnational emergencies and needs, without
compromising the logic of action reflected in the ToC, and were implemented in coordination with the
government, seeking complementarity in actions. The institutional performance of the MED was
strengthened, particularly from the activities of the management pillar, characterized by training and
support for the professionalization of national and local managers. On the other hand, the high employee
turnover rate, the low training of technicians and the insufficient resources for the continuity of
interventions are factors external to the project that significantly influence and limit the achievement of
results. However, some these aspects are beyond the control of the Programme and the Education Section
and therefore are not listed in the table of recommendations. Nonetheless, these externalities must be
41
accompanied by the Programme, which can make efforts to encourage political leaders to invest resources
to minimize these weaknesses.
202. The relevance and effectiveness analysis shows that the most comprehensive results with the greatest
potential for impact on the situation of Angolan children were achieved through technical support strategies
and advocacy actions. These strategies have been applied notably for the approval of national policies for
inclusive education, for early childhood and for teacher training (in the first case, the regulation has already
been approved and is being implemented, while in other cases the UNICEF contribution is recognized as an
important basis for future advances); to contribute mainly to the implementation of inclusive education
policies; for the development of service models (TUPPI and EAC), and for the consolidation of school
management systems (SIGE and the School Charter).
203. It should be noted that, although investments at the subnational level and in schools are justified by the
potential to create replicable service models at the national level, they generate expectations of expansion
in the areas, creating the need for alignment and better communication with local stakeholders. Additionally,
although there are indications of the TUPPI and EAC models replicability, it is necessary to design expansion
plans with expected resources in the GSB.
204. The Programme's efficiency analysis was limited by a lack of access to budget and expenditure information
that would have enabled the assessment of the Programme’s efficiency in terms of the use of resources. The
lack of consistency across time in the monitoring structure of the planned activities was as well an obstacle
that not only limited the evaluation team activities, but also limited the Programme´s capacity to reach
higher levels of efficiency.
205. An important component of sustainability refers to guaranteeing financial resources. The limited level of
resources for the cooperation suggests the need to: 1) outline an action strategy more focused on the results
with the greatest potential for impact; 2) create a governance system that guarantees government co-
financing; 3) act in an articulated way with other actors, which have financing capabilities and need technical
support. It must be assessed the necessity of synchronizing time dedicated to the planning of public policies
with time dedicated to UNICEF’s institutional planning.
206. In the case of interventions in emergency contexts, it can be concluded that, although the performance of
the Education Programme is recognized for its coordinated approach with other actors, and seeks to reach
those who need it most, the lack of response protocols and shared contingency plans compromises the
actions’ consistency, effectiveness and efficiency. The cyclical nature of calamities in the country makes
planning for emergency interventions absolutely feasible. The Programme lacks consistent records of
planning and monitoring actions in emergency contexts. The absence of consistent data prevents drawing
robust conclusions and undermines the qualification of the work performed. The analysis also shows the
importance of a coordinated and multisectoral action for greater effectiveness, as well as the need to
articulate a local network that can be activated.
207. The following are recommendations, organized into four topics: 1) results focused on national priorities; 2)
Efficient and sustainable implementation; 3) emergency contexts; 4) integrated approaches. Table 8
presents an overview of the different recommendations.
208. Recommendations for action and results focusing on national priorities
• It is unanimously recognized that UNICEF acts in accordance with national priorities, seeking to
respond to the needs of the most vulnerable. However, the analysis of internal planning and
monitoring (RAM, COAR reports, CPC records, annual reviews and mid-term evaluations), as well as
the interviews with actors of all profiles lead to the conclusion that the Education Programme needs
to review its planning and adjust the expected results to the volume of human and financial
resources available. It is also necessary to measure the size of the Education Programme team,
including the support team in the provinces.
42
• The previous recommendation is not without conflict. While key UNICEF informants and some non-
governmental partners recommend reducing the scope for better results and achieving greater
impact, among government partners, especially at the subnational level, prevails the desire to expand
funding capacity and the scope of UNICEF’s performance. Therefore, it is recommended that the
Education Programme develops a communication plan to inform interested parties about the
objectives defined in the cooperation with the Angolan government, and the resources available for
the execution of the plan.
• It is recommended to reinforce the commitment among the parties by strengthening the planning
of the cooperation activities in partnership with the government – as is already being practiced - and,
when doing so, also do the exercise of prioritizing the projects, making decisions on resources
allocation, and validating the underlying assumptions (such as government co-financing and
investments in areas outside the cooperation, without which results are at risk), as well as
permanently monitoring the implementation. In this regard, it is worth highlighting the relevance of
UNICEF's role not only in the design of the intervention plan, but in advocacy and social mobilization
that influences the government to implement it.
• The analysis shows that issues outside the focus of the cooperation - for example, improving school
infrastructure at the national level; providing road conditions to facilitate access for teachers and
students (especially those with mobility problems); ensuring sanitation conditions at the national
level; providing school meals; and improving the system of access to the teaching career - are relevant
factors to achieve the expected results to a certain extent. If, on one hand, in line with the previous
recommendation, UNICEF should better align expectations with its stakeholders and communicate
clearly that these are external factors that will not be modified within the cooperation, on the other
hand , UNICEF could contribute technically to the solution of these problems, by monitoring the
situation at the national and subnational levels, supporting the design of action plans to face these
difficulties in partnership with other internal sectors such as nutrition and WASH, and by providing
state-of-the-art knowledge to decision-making authorities on these themes, all within the scope of
the cooperation.
• In relation to national policies for early childhood and teacher education (both results partially
achieved) it is recommended to draw up an advocacy plan for approval. To expand the coverage of
children's centres, for example, strategies need to be identified and the feasibility of the different
options need to be validated among the programme partners. To this end, a suggestion pointed out
by the UNICEF team is to assess the feasibility of implementing orientation programmes for
neighbouring families, home visits, family groups and teachers who meet periodically and other
practices that allow placing these spaces at the centre of local interactions, in order to raise the
importance of these centres as reference points for families and communities.
• It is recommended that UNICEF develops advocacy strategies that lead to the periodic and timely
publication of national statistics - especially those systematized in the SIGE - for the monitoring and
evaluation of the Angolan education situation and, when necessary, UNICEF itself may carry out
surveys and studies that inform about the subject
• The operationalization of the data is also fundamental for the success of the Programme monitoring.
Training reinforcements are also of great importance, at central and provincial level, while also
focusing on the technical support for the maintenance and use of the databases in an effective way.
• There are two priority themes that are among national needs and are documented in UNICEF’s
planning documents, but have not received the necessary attention. It is about the curriculum
revision at the national level, and the consolidation of a national evaluation system, both initiatives
requiring a high demand for articulation and technical density. In spite of the importance of the
themes and the technical contribution that the Education Programme is capable of, considering the
knowledge built - particularly in the EAC initiative - and the efforts of advising and implementing
learning assessments, it is recommended to analyse the pertinence and scope of UNICEF's
participation in the theme, as well as to define the best participation strategies. For the education
sector, curriculum and assessment are structural and, therefore, strategic themes. It is recommended
43
to continue acting on the theme, designing an action strategy that relies on other partners, focusing
on modes or levels of education that are priorities, setting clear goals.
• Despite youth policies, especially the strengthening of life skills, being a national priority and figuring
on the UNICEF agenda, the theme was little explored during the 2015-2019 cooperation cycle. As in
the previous case, it is recommended to analyse the relevance and scope of UNICEF's participation in
the theme, as well as the definition of the best participation strategies, considering the possibility of
a more integrated action among UNICEF sectors.
• UNICEF must continue to reinforce its gender agenda, through strategies to accelerate results for
girls, teenager girls and women, while also reinforcing a robust investment to expand ongoing gender
action plans, renewing the focus on areas not addressed, such as Gender-Based Violence - GBV. The
new cycle program should focus on capacity building in the gender thematic area with national
partners and expanding multisectoral approaches. This option may allow UNICEF to continue as a
leading agency in partner capacity building to support awareness to reinforce gender equity.
209. Recommendations for a more efficient and sustainable implementation
• The issues related to the focus of efforts, described previously, are crucial in achieving greater
efficiency and sustainability. Concretely, the work of articulation and advocacy, and technical support
on selected topics, are lines of action that have had high impact results, with potential for national
transformation. It is recommended to adopt these two strategic lines as a priority.
• It is recommended to improve the documentation on planning, advancements and agreements in
the cooperation as an important mechanism for continuity in a scenario of high turnover, both in the
government and in the Education Programme itself.
• We also recommend undertaking systematic efforts to collect data and evaluate the various
initiatives within the cooperation in order to verify whether the objectives of improving access and
quality of education are being achieved based on the outlined strategies - particularly in terms of the
efforts made for the training of teachers, technicians and managers - as well as their repercussions
on learning and guaranteeing other rights, as was done with the EAC project.
• While acting at the local level is paramount, for it is the place where the implementation of public
policies and testing of innovative solutions happen, UNICEF's engagement in local initiatives - like the
EAC and TUPPI projects - requires financial and human resources for its management that are not
consistent with the reality of the organization. Additionally, these projects create among the
stakeholders the impression of incompleteness and, in the most extreme views, the impression of
exclusion, because they do not cover all schools and, therefore, create unequal conditions in the
provision of services in the same location, generating concern about their sustainability. No evidence
was presented to prove the government's commitment to the provision of resources for continuity.
In this regard, a few recommendations are presented:
1) reassess the limits and possibilities of direct action in the territories through a cost-
effective analysis of ongoing interventions that considers the non-monetary costs and
the opportunity cost of these resources;
2) seek solutions with clear perspectives of scalability, building technologies that can be
tested and adapted to other contexts (which are sensitive to local characteristics,
social practices, economic needs, climatic and geographical conditions,
contextualization of materials, etc.) and that are cost-effective (as in the case of
TUPPI);
3) build local partnerships, like the partnership with ISCED and ADRA in Huíla, together
with subnational governments;
44
4) design an implementation plan, and come to an agreement about it with the
government in advance, that may be scaled up after testing , when the interventions
show positive results;
5) the implementation plan may include support to seek funding partners who can
provide financial sustainability and scalability to the initiative;
6) in addition to the technical support for developing the initiatives themselves, build
local capabilities for project management through specific training;
7) flexibly strengthen local partnerships, incorporating their interests and supporting
them in overcoming local limitations.
• The strategy used to train managers, teachers and community leaders, as well as the strategy used
by training centres, should include the use of digital platforms with broad access to training material,
as a way of guaranteeing institutional memory, in the context of the high turnover of public
employees, technicians and teachers, and as a way to guarantee the sustainability of the actions,
providing conditions to replicate the actions.
210. Further on, some recommendations are presented to consolidate integrated approaches, considered another
important factor for the efficiency and sustainability of the Program.
211. Recommendations for acting in emergency contexts
• As reported, acting in emergency contexts requires, first of all, the organization of interventions in a
contingency and response plan. Considering the cyclical nature of the main calamities in the country
today, this pre-emptive articulation is feasible, in addition to being desirable, and was notably driven
by the pandemic of COVID-19, which brought a sense of urgency yet to be felt, because of schools
closing indefinitely. It is recommended to systematize the plan prepared to respond to the pandemic
by COVID-19 and making it a go-to response platform in response to climatic and biological disasters.
• For the contingency plan to be activated, there is also a need to invest in developing the capabilities
of governments to diagnose, plan, prevent and respond to emergency situations.
• A more practical recommendation, which mirrors the one made for a more efficient implementation
at the local level: UNICEF needs to identify local partners and materials to increase the speed of
response to emergencies and reduce costs. In addition, in order to bring efficiency and sustainability
to the interventions, there is a need to establish clear coordination mechanisms, to validate them, to
register them and to communicate them to all partners at national and local levels, as well as among
international agencies.
• It is recommended to strengthen activities with the aim of increasing resilience in the territories, as
currently any climatic disaster leads to the interruption of educational activities. The interventions in
Cunene and the Porto Seguro (Safe Heavens) program, that transforms the school into a reference
space during emergencies, offer recognized experiences that may serve as a reference.
• It is recommended to design plans for the transition from the emergency context to development
contexts, in such a way that communities are not left unattended after the calamity situation.
212. The multisectoral approach, or integrated approach, for which recommendations are presented below, is also
cited when it comes to improving actions in emergency contexts.
Recommendations for more integrated approaches
213. The design of more integrated approaches is one of the guidelines adopted in the cooperation cycle between
UNICEF and the GoA for 2020-2022. The adoption of integrated approaches may positively impact all the
evaluation dimensions contemplated in this report. In development contexts, the integration of sectors in
the social area might increase the likelihood of achieving the expected results, with less resources
45
expenditure and in a sustainable manner. By adopting the integrated approach in emergency contexts,
UNICEF will be working in a coordinated manner, increasing the coverage potential by pooling efforts. The
document review and the conducted interviews lead to formulating recommendations in several integration
dimensions:
• Consolidate systematic mechanisms for integrating the activities of UNICEF's internal sections along
the lines of the practice adopted at the EAC and TUPPI, that incorporated content and actions related
to sex education, nutrition, WASH, civil registration, and community strengthening into the
Education Programme initiative. The integration of the internal sections needs to materialize itself in
a more transversal way, using as reference these praiseworthy cases, thus developing strategies of
integrated planning, periodic monitoring, and communication between the areas.
• The fieldwork for this evaluation revealed that one of UNICEF's main assets is its capacity for
articulation, an essential component for the consolidation of integrating projects. Due to the strength
of its relationships, UNICEF can articulate national and subnational governments, civil society, and
experts. In the specific case of the Education Programme, it has also articulated the different
departments of the MED during the implementation of the cooperation projects. In this context, it is
recommended to explore this vocation in a more systematic and transversal way, consolidating
institutional networks to support basic education - such as the coalition formed around the policies
of inclusive education and early childhood education - that bring together governments, civil society,
international organizations and the academy around the agenda of priority themes. This network
could, for example, boost monitoring platforms and promote monitoring activities, political advocacy
and the production of knowledge necessary for the fulfilment of the Convention on the Rights of the
Child or National Development Plans, for example, including budget and effective expenditure on
public education policies.
• Joint planning with the government, including sharing budget allocation decisions with partners, is
a key factor for alignment. It is recommended to forecast this exchange in the planning process, in
order to welcome the interests and points of view of internal or external partners, without deviating
or expanding the organization's focus too much.
• It is recommended to strengthen the capabilities for documenting and monitoring work plans, and
agreements with the government. Clear indicators should then be included in the joint planning tools
to measure the progress of multisectoral interventions - the quantitative ones in terms of products,
services and the beneficiary population - in addition to demonstrating the added value of these
initiatives.
• In defining ways of working that incorporate more sectors and actors, attention is advised in defining
governance with clear lines of command and accountability, so as not to compromise results.
• Integrated action, although it can bring positive results in all evaluation dimensions, requires an
initial articulation effort that should not be underestimated. It is recommended to forecast this
dedicated time in the initial planning of the initiatives.

ANNEXES
ANNEX I. Theory of Change
Figure 1 – Theory of Change
53
Theory of Change - Narrative
According to the analysed documentation, the 2015-2019 cooperation cycle was designed based on the
importance of contributing to the elaboration of educational policies, programs and services with a view to
the full development and improvement in the learning of children and adolescents in Angola. The
cooperation was designed with the intention of addressing the problem that the structure of public policies
and programs in the area of education, as well as the availability and quality of educational services provided
in Angola, are still insufficient, compromising universal and equitable access and learning of children and
adolescents in the country, both in development and emergency situations.
The main assumptions around which the Programme is structured were divided into 3 blocks. The first
concerns the rights of children and adolescents, such as the right to full development, the right to access to
school and the right to quality education. The second block deals with the Angolan context, which points to
the need for management support for the structuring of educational policies, programs and services, as well
as presenting a great disparity in access to quality education among girls and boys, and between majority
and minority groups. The emergency situations resulting from natural disasters, epidemics and migratory
crises are also still quite vulnerable. The third block presents the assumptions related to the contribution that
UNICEF can make, with its knowledge, experiences and resources, to support the qualification of children
and adolescents’ education.
Based on the Program's documentation, it is possible to identify two phases, which are represented in a single
way in this Theory of Change. The initial phase, implemented between the years 2015 to 2017, was dedicated
to broadly supporting efforts to improve the quality, access and management of education, both at the
national and subnational level. In the second phase, which was from 2018 to 2019, the Program, while
continuing to act with what it had been working on since 2015, focused its efforts on early childhood
education and consolidated efforts aimed at creating an enabling environment for learning.
Based on available resources, UNICEF has structured a program designed to produce three final results
(outcomes): Outcome 1. Expanding access to and retention of education services in an equitable and gender
inclusive manner across all social strata, from early childhood onwards; Outcome 2. Improving the quality of
the offered education; and Outcome 3. Development and implementation of a national education
monitoring and evaluation system, with data collection disaggregated at least by gender, location and school
stage, as a central input for strengthening the system's management capacity. As mentioned above, in this
second phase, these three results would lead to a large consolidated result and wide visibility would be given
to early childhood development as the second final result. Despite the enormous importance that this life
period has, as well as its impact on the later stages of development, this reorganization may have imbalanced
the power destined for each of the fronts, compromising the results. The fieldwork should provide the
evaluation team with elements that allow an assessment of whether this was the case.
To produce each of these three final results, UNICEF expected the following seven intermediate results (IR)
to be achieved: IR 1. National policies on early childhood development, inclusive education, teacher training
implemented (with respective action plans) ), instituted or in an advanced stage of approval; IR 2. Leaders
(national and local) and families that are more articulated and strengthened for the impact of access and
quality of education; IR 3. Service standards and school curriculum revised and improved; IR 4. School
conditions - infrastructure (water and sanitation) and meals - improved; IR 5. Professionalized educational
management; IR 6. Inclusive training centers in operation; and IR 7. Emergency plans prepared. The
intermediate results include a broad educational agenda, covering the central points of Agenda 2030: access
from early childhood to quality education, with special attention to the most vulnerable; improvement of
infrastructure, considering conditions of accessibility and inclusion; teacher training. At the same time, it is
also necessary to improve management, at the national and local levels, including the budget and
expenditure theme. Finally, taking into account national specificities, performance in emergency contexts
stands out. In terms of the educational agenda, there is a lack of emphasis on education for young people,
except for projects related to sex education and a mapping of services in 2019. Finally, it should be noted that
intersectorality, key to success in educational goals, presents itself as a strategy at a more advanced stage of
cooperation, and mainly focused on activities in emergency contexts and activities for early childhood.
54
Seven immediate products / services (outputs) were expected to enable the achievement of intermediate
results. They are: Output 1. Educational managers sensitized to the creation and / or qualification of policies
and services; Output 2. Production of studies, assessments, research and public policy documents related to
access and quality of education, as well as education in emergency situations; Output 3. Creation of periodic
spaces and moments of local and national articulation; Output 4. Educational managers, local leaders and
families aware of the importance of access and quality of education from early childhood, as well as
education in emergency contexts; Output 5. School managers and educational technicians and teachers
from the network implement and multiply the knowledge acquired with the training; Output 6. Structural
reforms, purchase of equipment and school meals made possible; Output 7. Communication and awareness
actions for the importance of education carried out (eg campaigns, events, dissemination of studies and
research). These products, aligned with the expected intermediate results.
The main interventions (inputs) aimed at achieving the objectives of the program were: Input 1. Advocacy
actions and intersectoral articulation in favor of expanding access and improving the quality of provided
education; Input 2. Technical support for managers, educational technicians and trainers for: the
development of guides, manuals and standards of care on inclusion, life skills, gender, early childhood,
emergencies and teacher training; the collection, production and systematization of educational statistics;
planning, monitoring and evaluation; the implementation of policies and programs; the incorporation of
exchange of experiences (regional and south-south); Input 3. Training of school managers, teachers and
school community; Input 4. Provision of material resources for improving the infrastructure conditions of
schools, as well as for communication actions; and Input 5. Technical support for planning and intervention
in emergency situations resulting from natural disasters, epidemics and migratory crises. These
interventions or inputs also present a satisfactory alignment with the products described.
The chain of activities over the years seems to be well aligned, moving from assessment, to the development
of policies, national and subnational implementation plans, training and development of means and
resources for implementation and monitoring.
The analysis of the programs in the light of ToC also allows to identify the exceptions, periods in which the
program developed a specific activity, new or isolated. In 2015, the Education program integrated an internal
development pillar of the UNICEF section through a means and skills development activity. In 2017, the
Program integrated a specific pillar of EiE with the creation of knowledge about the impact of emergencies
in the Education sector to improve its response and preparedness. In 2018 and 2019, it introduced an
agreement for the geographical expansion of interventions for Lunda Norte.
With regard to the horizontal and vertical analysis of the Program's logical frameworks, it is possible to affirm
that the matrices previously prepared are lacking coherence and consistency. The Program's Action Plans
have incomplete logical frameworks and without standardization; and the activities, products and expected
results (outputs and outcomes) have changed over time. The logical framework for the 2015-2016 period
does not have information on targets, means of verification and periodicity / data collection date. The logical
framework for the 2016-2017 period has no information on means of verification and the periodicity / data
collection date and has targets for 2016 and 2019. The logical framework for the 2017-2018 period does not
have information on means of verification and periodicity / data collection date and has a target only for
2019. The logical framework for the 2018-2019 period is the most complete and has information on targets
for 2019 and means of verification. The Action Plan for Luanda Norte also lacks information on means of
verification and the periodicity / data collection date. Additionally, there is no standardization in the
formulation of the indicators.
In terms of risks and limitations, we highlight the fact that the Education team is small and that there were
challenging periods, without the necessary qualified staff (absence of head of section for about a year), with
an overload of the operational team. . There is no data available to monitor a central assumption for success
in capacity changes: the appropriation of resources and learning by partners, whose lack would constitute a
huge limitation to achieve results. The economic and political changes in the national environment during
the analyzed period also posed risks and financial limitations (the country's growth frustrated in the face of
falling oil prices, an important source of public resources) and policies (elections generated the need to build
new government alliances) which, in this case, turned out to be very favorable to the agenda).
