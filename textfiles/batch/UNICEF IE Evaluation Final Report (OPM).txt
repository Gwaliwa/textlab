The implementation of this study, ‘Inclusive education evaluation by using Big Data sources’,
would not have been possible without extensive contributions from a range of organisations
and people. We are grateful to the officials/experts of UNICEF Kazakhstan for trusting us
with this study and providing the financial support to undertake our research. We would like
to thank Tatiana Aderkhina and Raushan Ibrasheva for their input at the inception phase of
the project, as well as for their comments on the preliminary findings presentation. We are
also thankful to the Junction Bulgaria team, whose work on the formative evaluation
provided us with valuable insights on the inclusive education landscape in Kazakhstan. We
would also like to express our gratitude to the reviewers of the inception phase presentation
at UNICEF.
We are grateful to all the individuals and organisations who posted their perspectives on
inclusive education in Kazakhstan on publicly accessible social media platforms, without
which this research would not have been possible.
We would also like to acknowledge the contributions of OPM staff members Varun
Vashistha and Vladimir Imnaishvili in managing the administrative and financial aspects of
this study. We would also like to thank Matilda Eriksson for assisting us with operational
details of Meltwater, which was used for analysing one component of social media data in
the study.
All opinions expressed, and any mistakes in the report, remain the responsibility of the OPM
team.
Figure 1: Conceptual difference between exclusion, segregation, integration, and
inclusion
Exclusion: No recognition of the right or capacity of
children with disabilities to education, and consequent
denial of access to education in any form.
Segregation: Placement of children with disabilities in
separate environments designed or used to respond to
particular or various impairments, in isolation from
children without disabilities.
Integration: Placement of children with disabilities in
existing mainstream educational institutions, as long as
the child can adjust to fit the standardised requirements
of such institutions.
Inclusion: A process of systemic reform embodying
changes and modifications in content, teaching
methods, approaches, structures, and strategies in
education to overcome barriers. It requires a

commitment to changing the system to fit the student.

We also pay attention to measures that are not specific to inclusive education, but which can
contribute to an enabling environment for inclusive education, such as measures to prevent
disability, for early identification, and to protect children from violence and abuse in the
education system.
This evaluation is important for a variety of reasons. First, it complements a formative
evaluation commissioned by UNICEF that is ongoing at the time of writing and that seeks to
assess how state education programmes have contributed to improving the inclusive
education landscape in Kazakhstan. We refer to this parallel formative evaluation as the
‘Junction Bulgaria study’. Second, instead of focusing on specific programmes, this study
uses innovative analytical methods to compile and synthesise publicly accessible social
media and online news information from two key stakeholder groups, whose perspectives
are categorised into two text corpora and analysed. The first group of stakeholders
comprises of the general online public in Kazakhstan, and includes parents, teachers, and
youth overall. The second stakeholder group caters to the views and institutional knowledge
of organisations active in inclusive education activities in Kazakhstan. Third, the use of non-
traditional data and analytical methods provides a space for experimentation and
engagement with different viewpoints, some of which may be difficult to observe and are
thus often left out of traditional methods and approaches.

Executive summary
Introduction
To better understand the inclusive education landscape in Kazakhstan, the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) commissioned the present study with the objective of
understanding different stakeholder perspectives as expressed via social media and online
news media, using social media listening (SML) tools. This research is expected to generate
insights for UNICEF and the Ministry of Education, Government of Kazakhstan, to inform
future strategies and policies in this area. The findings provide insights for leading scientific
institutions in Kazakhstan actively working in the field of inclusive education. Other
development partners such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the
World Bank, as well as multiple other non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working and
supporting investments in education in Kazakhstan, are also likely to benefit from these
findings.
Evaluation purpose, objectives, and scope
The primary research objective is to use SML tools and quantitative text analysis tools to
understand the perspectives of individuals and organisations, as expressed in text online, on
inclusive education in Kazakhstan. By quantitatively analysing non-traditional online news
and social media sources of data, we present insights and formulate recommendations
based on viewpoints from different stakeholders that might otherwise be difficult to observe.
Our research complements an ongoing formative evaluation (the Junction Bulgaria study).
This evaluation aims to answer three evaluation questions (EQs) for both stakeholder groups.
1. What is the content of social and online media discussions on inclusive education
in Kazakhstan? We interpret ‘content’ to relate to what these discussions ‘look like’, i.e.
what is being said, where, by whom, and when. Note that we purposefully only deploy
quantitative text analysis techniques to answer this question. This means that
descriptions of this ‘content’ rely on quantitative analytical techniques.
2. What do people mention as factors ‘holding back’ (barriers) inclusive education?
We interpret ‘barriers’ broadly, in the sense that we try to find out what is being
mentioned online when problems and issues with improving access and promoting the
rights of children to inclusive education are discussed. As above, we deploy quantitative
text analysis techniques to answer this EQ.
3. Do people mention state programmes at all? Here, we search for a predefined list of
state programmes.
This study was designed to be formative and descriptive in nature and is thus a part
of a broader formative evaluation exercise. The focus is on describing online news and
discussions on inclusive education in Kazakhstan rather than on evaluating an ‘object’.
In the inception phase, detailed discussions were undertaken with UNICEF to define
and operationalise ‘inclusive education’ in the context of this study. Based on these
discussions, children under 18 years of age with disabilities were identified as the target

group of interest. This includes children with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or
sensory impairments, which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their effective
participation in society on an equal basis with others. This approach integrates the medical
and social model of disability in our conceptualisation of disability (UNESCO, UNICEF, &
FCDO, 2021).
A vital component of operationalising inclusion relates to the level of education where this
inclusion occurs or is desired. In this study, we focus on children in preschool as well as
those receiving primary and secondary education. Due to multiple considerations, as
mentioned later, we also limit our study to the relatively recent past, from the beginning of
2022 until May 2023, where our data is restricted to cover conversations and posts online
captured by our online text scrapers.
Methodology
To study the EQs from different perspectives and triangulate insights, we focused on two
primary stakeholder groups, whose publicly accessible social media data were organised
into two different text corpora (collections of text data). We summarise each below.
1. Text data in Corpus 1 represents discussions of the general online public. This was
created using Meltwater, an online platform which offers scraping and analytics of
social media and online news data.
As a first step in building a search query for Corpus 1 in Meltwater, we identified multiple
subtopics within the broad topic of inclusive education through a literature review and expert
discussions. For each subtopic, we created a combination of keywords in Russian and
Kazakh that accurately described the chosen topic and considered the specifics of each
language and the different groups of interest. Once our subtopics and keywords were
defined, we initiated search queries, scraping online discussions on inclusive education in
Kazakhstan. In our search queries, we limited the geography to Kazakhstan by including a
‘Location’ query that specified our results must mention locations within Kazakhstan. To
ensure the quality of this search, we repeatedly validated queries by human review.
2. Text data from accounts and websites of specific organisations active in the inclusive
education space in Kazakhstan were collected as part of Corpus 2 and built using
self-programmed scrapers.
Through a purposive research design, we identified multiple organisations and their publicly
accessible social media handles and websites, which were scraped via a self-written
programme using Python that downloaded publicly accessible text. A major component of
Corpus 2 came from Instagram channels, Telegram groups and channels, and web sources
such as blogs and news outlets.
Findings
For EQ 1, we summarise key characteristics of the social and online media discussions on
inclusive education in Kazakhstan as follows.
1. Inclusive education in Kazakhstan is a topic of ongoing discussion, albeit a small
one compared to general discussions on education online. Analysis of Corpus 1 and
Corpus 2 shows an overall increasing trend in discussions on inclusive education.
© Oxford Policy Management iv
However, we estimate that inclusive education discussions in Corpus 1 make up only
about 3–6% of all online text on education more broadly.
2. The general public’s online engagement (Corpus 1) with inclusive education is
higher on news sites, blogs, and Facebook than on other social media sites.
Organisations working on inclusive education (Corpus 2), however, mostly use platforms
like Instagram and Telegram.
3. Analysis of top news by reach in Corpus 1 shows that the Government of
Kazakhstan is successfully promoting its active measures to develop inclusive
education with the introduction of modern technologies, the creation of
feedback channels, and initiatives aimed at protecting the rights of children with special
educational needs (SEN). This shows that the government’s messaging has a wide
reach, and that they are successfully highlighting and promoting these activities.
4. Spatial patterns of online conversations from Corpus 2 show that these
discussions are mostly concentrated in large urban cities like Astana and Almaty,
even after accounting for their higher population densities. This is suggestive of relatively
higher engagement on inclusive education in these areas.
5. Negative news in Corpus 1 often focused on the lack of protection of the rights of
children with SEN, as well as on the quality of their education. Meanwhile, positive
news highlighted measures taken to support children with autism, to prevent disability
in newborns, to increase the capacity building of teachers, and for social protection.
6. A hashtag analysis in Corpus 1 shows that autism and cerebral palsy are the most
widely discussed disabilities. Also, the adoption of testing for children with SEN is
actively discussed, as indicated by the United National Testing (ЕНТ) hashtag. Among
non-profit organisations, work of the Bulat Utemuratov Foundation has received
attention and positive discussion for its contribution to education for children with autism.
7. Analysis of the most frequently used words from Corpus 2 shows discussions
emphasised the capacity building of teachers, specialists and measures to support
inclusive education. As before, autism was the most discussed disability.
8. Topic analysis on Corpus 2 identified the most common themes of discussions,
and again features the capacity building of teachers, school education content
and pedagogy as prominent topics. Simultaneously, early diagnosis and treatment,
social support and opportunities for children, were also vital themes of discussion.
For EQ 2, our key findings are as follows.
9. An analysis of ‘Rights and Barriers’ from Corpus 1 reveals that incidents of abuse,
violence, and bullying in kindergartens, schools, universities, and families are
being mentioned as major issues affecting adequate access to inclusive
education. We understand that these have been identified by the Government of
Kazakhstan, which has made efforts to address quality issues, improve standards, and
establish minimum safety requirements in early childhood education.
10. In Corpus 2, the need for improved teacher training and the capacity building of
teachers and specialists who can support the SEN of children feature prominently
as major barriers to be overcome.

11. In discussions on inclusive education online, girls are significantly
underrepresented. With an eye on assessing differences in how inclusive education
discussions make references to boys and girls, we check if girls or boys are
disproportionately represented in discussions on inclusive education when compared to
discussions about education with no mention of disability. We find that the share of
messages that mention boys and girls across the corpora of ‘education and
disability’ and ‘education’ is comparable. However, the share of messages that
mention boys in such discussions is about three times larger than girls and accounts for
about 75% of the overall discussions. This suggests that girls, and possibly their specific
needs, are underrepresented in such discussions.
For EQ 3, our key finding is as follows.
12. We find limited mentions of specific programmes on inclusive education in
Corpus 1 and Corpus 2. In the latter, we do find mentions of ‘Educated Nation’
(Образованная нация) and ‘Comfort School’ (Комфортная школа). This is not to say
that these programmes are not important, but it indicates that specific issues, rather than
government programmes, are being discussed more widely on social media. It may also
imply that the government is not able to promote programmes in a way that they are
picked up in social media discourse around inclusive education.
Key policy recommendations
1. Timing and choice of broadcasting platform for key messages: We find that
engagement with inclusive education rises with the start of the academic year and tapers
off gradually. It is sensitive to initiatives such as the month of raising awareness about
autism. Similarly, general public’s online engagement is higher on news portals and
blogs, whereas social media engagement on Instagram and Telegram is higher for
organisations working on inclusive education. This information can be leveraged by the
Government of Kazakhstan, particularly by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of
Information and Communications, to relay key messages on inclusive education using
varied platforms for different stakeholders. In this context, evidence shows positive
effects of such media messaging on children’s education (Keefer & Khemani, 2014).
2. Focus on enhancing the accessibility of preschool, primary, and secondary
education facilities via accessibility audits: Despite positive perceptions around the
increased investment on upgrading school infrastructure and introducing modern
technologies, the Junction Bulgaria team found that there is a requirement for even
higher investment in physical infrastructure. Accessibility audits can help prioritise
necessary modifications and ensure compliance with accessibility standards to enhance
physical access to educational facilities. Certain relevant voluntary initiatives have
already emerged—notably Accessible Kazakhstan—and could provide guidance for the
Government of Kazakhstan to institutionalise this model for educational facilities.
3. Investment in human capital: Our findings across corpora indicate a perception of lack
of capacity building for teachers. Provision of training and professional development
opportunities for teachers and staff members on inclusive education practices, disability
awareness, and accessibility guidelines will enable educators to better support students
with disabilities and create a more inclusive learning environment. It could also contribute
towards a more individual approach being taken to students with SEN.

4. Coverage of social media dark areas: The social data media data on which this
analysis is based comes from larger cities like Astana and Almaty. However, more
research is needed to understand perceptions of, and barriers to, inclusive education in
other parts of the country.
5. Gender-sensitive assessment of educational needs: Our results show that girls are
relatively underrepresented in online discussions on inclusive education in Kazakhstan,
suggesting a lack of attention paid to the differential needs of girls in the educational
system. This calls for a collection of indicators disaggregated by gender within the
education sector in order to identify gender-specific factors limiting access to inclusive
education. It also calls for a general focus on gender-sensitive messaging on the needs
of girls in inclusive education.
6. Early childhood interventions: Early diagnosis and treatment of disability is a recurring
topic in our corpora. Early prevention and identification of disabilities, as well as provision
of services for early childhood development for children with SEN, are crucial to ensure
their educational needs are addressed from the outset. Positive news online indicates
some progress has been made in measures taken to prevent disability in newborns and
young children, including through better equipping of perinatal centres. These initiatives
should be expanded in coverage and coupled with correctional support to prepare young
children with SEN to study in public schools.
7. Adaptation of standardised testing: The ЕНТ hashtag appeared commonly in our
analysis, showing active discussions around the need to adapt standardised tests to the
needs of children with SEN. Our findings from top news in Corpus 1 indicate that the
Government of Kazakhstan has provided an additional 40 minutes for children with SEN
during such tests, showing that progress on this issue is already underway. Further
adjustments could be made to adapt testing materials, for instance for children who
cannot see the text.
Key recommendations for future use of SML in evaluations
1. Designing EQs based on what SML can and cannot answer: As against traditional
impact evaluations that are focussed on causal impact of an intervention, SML is better
suited to address descriptive questions that are intended to capture the perspectives of
stakeholders on a specific topic of online discussion.
2. Validation of online data: Building search queries should be iterative and based on
expert discussions. The list of keywords should account for linguistic or cultural
sensitivities, while being simple enough to ensure a sizeable text corpus for analysis.
3. Accounting for exclusion and inclusion bias: Inequalities in access to social media
may exclude certain groups from online discussions, thereby limiting the
representativeness at the national, or regional level. Bias from extreme views on social
media than in person also highlights the need for expert discussions to validate the
relevance of online posts.
4. External Validity: As online discussions are not necessarily representative of the entire
population and in some cases the number of posts is small, the evaluation should clearly
state whether the results can be generalisable.

1 Introduction
Kazakhstan is a relatively young country: close to 34% of its population is below the age of
18, of which over 188,000 children have SEN, a number that is growing every year (Ministry
of Education, 2023).1 In 2020, the total number of children with special educational needs
identified by the Psychological, Medical and Pedagogical Consultation (PMPK) stood at
about 161,826 individuals, which accounts for about 2.6% of overall children population. The
share of children with SEN is particularly high in age groups of 7–10 years (32.7%), 3–6
years (30%), and 11–15 years (26.6%). In terms of the geographical distribution, the highest
number of children with SEN resided in the Turkestan region (12%), followed by the East
Kazakhstan region (9.6%), Almaty region (9%), and Karaganda region (8%), respectively
(Ministry of Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan, 2021).2 To better understand the
inclusive education landscape in the country, UNICEF commissioned the present innovative
study with the objective of understanding different stakeholder perspectives on inclusive
education using SML tools.3
The analysis aims to assess and identify perspectives, discussions, and opinions on access
to inclusive education in the country. The innovative approach gives a voice to stakeholders
who may otherwise be left out of traditional survey-based studies. Importantly, with close to
61% of its population having presence on different social media platforms,4 Big Data
research using organically generated social media data provides a unique opportunity to
conduct rigorous research and support conventional evaluation approaches that use in-
person data collection methods. The study generates insights that could be used by UNICEF
and the Government of Kazakhstan to identify existing gaps in the inclusive education
landscape and provide evidence to inform future strategies and work in this area. The
present study complements a separate formative evaluation undertaken by the Junction
Bulgaria team to assess how state education programmes have contributed to improving the
inclusive education landscape.
1.1 The object of the evaluation and defining ‘inclusive
education’
Unlike other evaluation exercises, which evaluate an ‘object’ such as a programme
intervention, this study was designed to be a formative and descriptive evaluation product
and is therefore a part of a broader formative evaluation exercise. The focus here is on
describing the broader topic of online news and discussions of inclusive education in
Kazakhstan, rather than to conduct an evaluation of an ‘object’. Importantly, and as agreed
during the contracting phase, this study does not have a conventional Evaluation Matrix or a

2 According to Kazakhstan's legislature, children with disabilities receive financial assistance from the
government. According to data from the National Statistics Bureau, the number of children with disabilities
receiving such assistance as of 2021 was 98,254 https://bala.stat.gov.kz/chislennost-detej-invalidov-

3 At an earlier stage, this project also had a spatial data analysis component to disaggregate regional variation in
inclusive education outcomes across different levels of schooling. During the contracting phase, UNICEF and OPM
together decided to restrict the scope of the study and exclude this component.

Theory of Change (ToC). This is because we do not explicitly test the validity of a ToC within
this study. However, a draft ToC applicable to the formative evaluation was made available
at the inception phase and can be found in the corresponding Annex (Figure 34).
Importantly, the study design ensures that the EQs (Section 3) are mapped to the objectives
of the study, as mentioned in the Terms of Reference (ToR) (Annex A), via rigorous
methodological tools that are consistent with the relevant literature on SML.
During the inception phase of the project, detailed discussions were undertaken with
UNICEF to define and operationalise ‘inclusive education’ in the context of this study. Based
on these discussions, children with disabilities below 18 years of age were identified as the
target group of interest. Children with disabilities include those who have long-term physical,
mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, which in interaction with various barriers may
hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.5 This
approach integrates the medical model and social model of disability in our
conceptualisation of disability (UNESCO, UNICEF, & FCDO, 2021). While the medical
model is based on the characteristics of diseases and disorders, the social model
acknowledges that disability is multidimensional and that the complex interaction of health
and contextual factors may enable or restrict children from participating in education and
learning effectively (Box 1).
Box 1: An example of the medical model versus the social model of disability
Aigul is a secondary school student whose eyesight is deteriorating because of diabetic retinopathy, a common
complication of diabetes. The medical model sends her to a clinic, but there is no treatment to halt the
progressive damage to her sight. It becomes more difficult for her to get to school using public transport, and
her parents are trying to find extra money to afford taxis. Aigul is excluded because she cannot read texts or
afford the extra transport costs. She is very worried that she will have to drop out of school.
The social model finds out what assistance she needs to continue attending school and to keep up with her
studies. This means finding solutions to overcome the barriers to her inclusion. For example, her teachers and
the Department of Education could lobby IT developers to make scanner apps for blind and visually impaired
users available in her language. At the same time, the occupational therapist can work with Aigul, her teachers,
and classmates to find, and practice with her, the most practical route to school by public transport. Aigul can
also apply for a disability allowance to cover the additional disability-related costs.
Aigul has an impairment (deteriorating eyesight) which limits her functioning (reading textbooks and using public
transport) until the participation restriction is lifted (by having access to the state-of-the-art scanner apps and
access to support to learn new skills for independent travel).
An important component of operationalising inclusion relates to the level at which this
inclusion occurs or is desired. We consider children in preschool, as well as those receiving
primary and secondary education. Importantly, inclusion here means more than ‘just’ being
physically present at school and recognises there are important distinctions between
exclusion, segregation, integration, and inclusion. These terms are discussed below and
outlined in Figure 1. This overall conceptualisation of inclusion informs our interpretation of
results in Section 4.

1.2 Inclusive education in Kazakhstan
Inclusive education in Kazakhstan is an evolving process guided by several national
programmes and projects.
According to the 2007 Law on Education, inclusive education is defined as the process to
ensure equitable access to appropriate educational training for students with special
individual abilities. The 2015 Conceptual Approaches to the Development of Inclusive
Education in the Republic of Kazakhstan, a Policy Note endorsed by the Ministry of
Education, further elaborates that inclusive education is a transformative undertaking within
the education system, grounded in the principle of equal rights to quality education for all
individuals.
In 2022, the categories of children with SEN were extended via Decree 6 of the Ministry of
Education to three categories: first, children with behavioural and emotional problems and
unfavourable psychological factors; second, children with barriers of a socio-psychological,
economic, linguistic, and cultural nature; and third, children with developmental disabilities.
In this study, we focus on the third component. The first two categories are included only
when they are related to mentions of disability and education.
Further, the development of inclusive education in Kazakhstan is guided by a series of
national programmes and projects. The State Programme for the Development of Education
in the Republic of Kazakhstan (2011–20) and the State Programme for the Development of
Education and Science (2016–19) have played significant roles in shaping educational
policies and initiatives. These programmes were followed by the State Programme for the
Development of Education and Science (2020–25), which transitioned to the national project
‘Educated Nation’ in 2021. The Concept of Education Development of the Republic of
Kazakhstan (2022–26) provides a strategic framework for future educational reforms at all
levels of education.
Despite these efforts, challenges persist in fully implementing inclusive education in
Kazakhstan. A shortage of qualified personnel and inadequate infrastructure in the
education sector pose significant barriers (Junction Bulgaria, 2023). Additionally, attitudes
and misconceptions about disabilities need to be addressed to foster an inclusive culture
within the society (UNICEF, 2019; Allan & Omarova, 2021). Progress in the education sector
has also stalled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and children with disabilities are
some of the most affected by sectoral challenges (Marteau, 2020). Progress towards
achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4, Quality Education, is off-track regarding the
participation rate in pre-primary organised learning and in terms of the net primary enrolment
rate (Sustainable Development Report, 2023). To tackle these challenges, the government,
educational institutions, and NGOs are working on allocating more resources, improving
© Oxford Policy Management 3
infrastructure, and promoting awareness about the importance of inclusive education
(Junction Bulgaria, 2023).
The findings from our SML research (Section 4) align with the context of inclusive education
in Kazakhstan. As we will see in subsequent sections, our research indicates an overall
increasing trend in discussions about inclusive education throughout the academic year
(schooling calendar). The government's active measures to develop inclusive education,
including the use of modern technologies, feedback channels, and initiatives to protect the
rights of children with SEN, have been recognised and discussed on various online
platforms used by the general online public.
Negative news coverage often focus on the lack of protection of the rights of children with
SEN and concerns about the quality of their education. Conversely, positive news stories
highlight measures taken to support children with autism, prevent disability in newborns, and
improve inclusive education in Kazakhstan, including the capacity building of teachers and
the introduction of social protection initiatives. Among types of disability, autism and cerebral
palsy are the most widely discussed in the context of inclusive education.
According to our hashtag analysis, NGOs receive attention and positive discussion as a
result of their contributions to education for children with autism. Discussions also
emphasise the importance of addressing barriers to inclusive education, including the need
for dedicated centres, protection of rights, and improved teacher training and pedagogy.
The research findings from analysing the perceptions of organisations working in the
inclusive education space highlight that these discussions are mostly concentrated in large
urban cities like Astana and Almaty. While social media engagement varies across regions,
this concentration suggests higher engagement in these urban areas. The findings also
indicate a gradual increase in discussions involving organisations working in inclusive
education since 2022, with specific platforms like Instagram and Telegram groups being
utilised for public discussions by these organisations.
In conclusion, while challenges persist, the findings from our SML exercise research
demonstrate a growing awareness of, and engagement with, inclusive education. These
findings reinforce the importance of addressing barriers, promoting capacity building for
teachers, protecting the rights of children with SEN, and fostering a more inclusive culture.
The commitment of the government, in collaboration with various stakeholders, is essential
in advancing inclusive practices, supporting teachers, and providing the necessary
resources to create inclusive learning environments in Kazakhstan.
1.3 Evaluation stakeholders
This evaluation provides valuable evidence for several key stakeholders involved with issues
of inclusive education, as follows.
Ministry of Education: The Ministry of Education is the main government body responsible
for developing and implementing education policies, including inclusive education. They
develop regulatory acts that define strategic priorities and standards for inclusive education
and coordinate the activities of other educational units.
National Academy of Education named after I. Altynsarin: This leading educational and
scientific institution in Kazakhstan is actively involved in the development and
implementation of educational programmes and research in the field of inclusive education.
© Oxford Policy Management 4
The Academy organises scientific conferences, seminars, and training events aimed at
enhancing the competency of teachers and specialists in inclusive education.
National Scientific and Practical Centre for Special and Inclusive Education
Development: The centre is a leading scientific and methodological organisation involved in
the development and dissemination of practical recommendations and methodologies in the
field of inclusive education. It provides educational resources, conducts research, and offers
advisory and methodological support to teachers and specialists in inclusive education.
The Office of Psychological and Pedagogical Correction: This is an institution where any
child with SEN and his/her family can receive qualified assistance from specialists such as a
speech pathologists and therapists, psychologists, typhlopedagogues, social pedagogues,
physical therapy instructors, and music rhythm teachers. There are the offices all over
Kazakhstan, funded by the government.
Specialists involved in psychological, medical, and pedagogical consultation: One of
the types of special educational institution examines students for developmental disabilities
and develops recommendations on education and training for parents and teachers. The
main task of the consultation is to identify a child's capabilities and developmental disorders,
as well as to determine the educational programme and special conditions for education in
accordance with the individual needs of the child.
UNICEF: UNICEF in Kazakhstan actively supports the development of inclusive education.
The organisation collaborates with the government and other partners, providing financial
and technical support to projects related to inclusive education. UNICEF monitors and
evaluates the implementation of programmes in this area.
Other development partners: UNESCO, UNDP, and the World Bank are among several
development partners supporting investments in education in Kazakhstan that will also
benefit from the research findings.
NGOs: NGOs, especially those representing parents and caregivers of children with
disabilities, play a crucial role in supporting and advocating for the rights of children with
SEN and disabilities. They monitor the implementation of inclusive education, provide
consultation and support to parents, and participate in projects aimed at improving the
quality of, and accessibility to, inclusive education, as well as the social integration of
children into the society.
Among the organisations that operate in the inclusive education area in Kazakhstan, the
following are key non-profits.
DARA Foundation: The Foundation actively works towards creating equal opportunities for
all learners, including children with SEN. The Foundation conducts training programmes and
workshops for educators, develops specialised teaching materials, and ensures access to
adapted learning materials and technologies. It also actively supports the implementation of
inclusive practices in schools and contributes to the creation of a friendly and barrier-free
educational environment. The Foundation has initiated a system of support for inclusive
education in general education schools through a network of Inclusive Education Resource
Centres in almost all regions of Kazakhstan. These centres are based inside schools and
have been created to help teachers implement the principles of inclusion in the learning
process, as well as to create a barrier-free and friendly classroom and school environment
for children with SEN.
© Oxford Policy Management 5
Bolashak Corporate Foundation: The Foundation plays an instrumental role in promoting
equal access to education for all individuals, including those with diverse needs and
backgrounds. The Foundation actively supports initiatives that foster inclusive practices
within educational institutions, such as providing resources, training programmes, and
infrastructure enhancements. Through its partnerships and collaborations with the
government, business, NGOs, and parents, the Bolashak Corporate Foundation helps
create an inclusive educational environment that empowers students to thrive and reach
their full potential.
Parents’ community: Parents are important stakeholders in the field of inclusive education.
They play an active role in advocating for their children’s right to equal access to education
and participate in the related decision making processes. Parents provide support to their
children, collaborate with teachers and school administration, and engage with government
bodies and NGOs.
Business: One of the largest quasi-state donor organisations is the Samruk-Kazyna
National Welfare Fund of Kazakhstan that provides annual funding to charitable and social
initiatives, including the improvement of inclusive education via its Samruk-Kazyna Trust
Corporate Fund and the Qazaqstan Halqyna Public Foundation.
There are also several NGOs in Kazakhstan run by businesses. Among them is the Bulat
Utemuratov Foundation, which endorses 11 ‘Asyl Miras’ autism centres across
Kazakhstan. Their mission is to recognise challenges and address gaps in social,
communicative, and practical abilities among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
under the age of 15. The Foundation has established a resource centre, which engages in
ongoing training and development in the realm of ASD child interaction. This extends to
specialists at the Asyl Miras centres, NGO employees, medical institutions, and state
correctional institutions, with roles as described above.
We describe the role of specific stakeholders in our evaluation in the next section, and
describe stakeholder participation in Section 3.5.
1.4 Evaluation management and governance
On behalf of the Government of Kazakhstan, UNICEF Kazakhstan contracted the project,
entitled ‘Inclusive education evaluation by using Big Data source of information (descriptive
analytics)’, to Oxford Policy Management (OPM) on 29 December 2022.
The key deliverables, as per the ToR (Annex A), included:
1. the inception report, delivered to UNICEF as a PowerPoint presentation on 12 March
2023 (a revised version incorporating suggestions was shared on 28 March 2023);
2. the present final descriptive report (called the digital ecosystem analysis report in the
ToR), which serves as the main technical report and includes results from all key
analyses; and
3. the final ‘package’, including the final methodological note and tools.
OPM assembled an exceptional team of experts to implement this assignment. The team
structure was as follows.
© Oxford Policy Management 6
• Paul Jasper was the team leader. Given his extensive experience with innovative
data approaches in evaluations, including geospatial analysis and text analytics,
he provided technical leadership to the rest of the team.
• The data science team was composed of three key members:
o Arseniy Gurin, the Senior Data Scientist, who provided technical data
science and data engineering oversight; and
o Udayan Rathore and Ida Brzezinska, quantitative data analysts, who
implemented most of the data processing and analysis (Udayan was also
the project manager).
• Zhanar Zhaxylykova was the National Evaluation Expert. As a Kazakh national and
experienced education consultant, her input ensured that the evaluation was firmly
grounded in the local inclusive education context. Zhanar is based in Kazakhstan and
also served as our local contact point.
• Elayn Sammon, was our Senior Inclusion Policy Expert. Her input ensured that
evaluation objectives and findings were relevant to the promotion of inclusion in
education in Kazakhstan.
The overall oversight of the contract sat with the UNICEF Kazakhstan Team, as the main
client and holder of the contract with OPM. Regular meetings between the UNICEF Team
and OPM provided a forum for discussing the evaluation approach and draft outputs and
reporting on progress and challenges. Within the OPM team, the team leader and project
manager were responsible for delivering the project to the expected quality and to budget,
with ultimate accountability for the project sitting with the Data Innovations Hub at OPM.
The OPM team also undertook periodic consultation meetings with key stakeholders to
ensure strong engagement, collaboration, and coordination, which translated into improved
stakeholder ownership and will hopefully facilitate more effective implementation of
recommendations from this study. This includes representatives from UNICEF Kazakhstan,
with whom extensive consultations were held through the life cycle of the project, especially
at the inception phase. Also, feedback was sought from the officials at the Government of
Kazakhstan and the Ministry of Education on the preliminary findings at an interim
presentation, based on which the analysis plan for the project was finalised. The OPM team
also spoke to three Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) in Kazakhstan with more than
five years of experience of working in the social services delivery to children and young
people with special educational needs.6
The evaluation was subject to a three-layered quality assurance (QA) process to ensure the
robustness and integrity of our results:
6 To promote active participation, the participants were promised that their identify would not be revealed and
have hence been anonymised.

1. A systematic human validation process was done to double-check that social media
data scraped from the internet was relevant, in line with Principle 4 of ‘validate,
validate, validate’ (Grimmer & Stewart, 2013).
2. All research products went through a round of internal peer review (i.e. within OPM),
conducted by a senior evaluation expert.
3. A presentation on interim findings to UNICEF and the government counterparts was
made on 12 July 2023. At the end of the project, research products will finally be
reviewed by stakeholders, which in this case means UNICEF (via UNICEF’s QA
process) and government counterparts, if possible. Comments from key stakeholders
will provide an external ‘sense check’ on the findings and the relevance of
recommendations made.

2 Evaluation objectives, framework, and
EQs
2.1 Purpose and objectives
The general purpose of the study is to generate insights which can be used by the
Government of Kazakhstan to identify existing gaps in the inclusive education landscape
and provide evidence to inform future strategies and work in this area. The findings from the
study are expected to feed into the next education policy framework and contribute to the
implementation of the national project entitled ‘Educated Nation’ 2021–25. This will be
achieved by answering EQs that were finalised at the inception phase and listed in Section
2.1.
This research contributes to identifying the existing gaps and challenges faced by children
with SEN, which require improvement. This information will help foster collaboration, engage
stakeholders in the policymaking process, address their concerns, and effectively allocate
resources to develop targeted initiatives that address the identified gaps. All these elements
will feed into the policy cycle, which is discussed in Kazakhstan’s context.
More specifically, the primary purpose of this research is to use SML and quantitative text
analysis tools to lend a voice to, and analyse the perspectives of, individuals and
organisations—in particular parents, teachers, youth, and the general online public—on the
status of inclusive education in Kazakhstan. We postulate that, by quantitatively analysing
non-traditional, online news and social media sources of data, we will be able to gain
insights and formulate recommendations based on viewpoints from a number of different
stakeholders that are otherwise difficult to observe or neglected when studied through
traditional methods and approaches.
2.2 Policymaking cycle in Kazakhstan
The policymaking cycle in the field of inclusive education in Kazakhstan involves several key
stages.
It starts with the initiation of new legislation or a normative legal act specifically focusing on
inclusive education. A working group consisting of representatives from the Ministry of
Education, education experts, and other stakeholders is formed to develop the new
legislation or normative legal act. They conduct research, gather data, and analyse existing
practices to inform the development process.
Once the new legislation or normative legal act is formulated, it goes through stages of
coordination and expert review. This includes seeking approval and support from relevant
government bodies, such as public councils, local executive bodies, the Ministry of
Education, and other ministries, as well as parliament. The new legislation or normative legal
act is also published on open legal platforms for public discussion and feedback.
Amendments or consultations with various stakeholders may be necessary before the new
legislation or normative legal act is officially adopted.
After adoption, the new legislation or normative legal act moves into the implementation
stage. This involves translating the provisions into specific steps and allocating resources,
© Oxford Policy Management 9
including funding and personnel, for effective implementation. Mechanisms for monitoring
and evaluation are established to assess the effectiveness and outcomes of the new
legislation or normative legal act. This stage includes data collection, research, and the use
of relevant indicators to evaluate the progress made in achieving the goals of the new
legislation or normative legal act.
Based on the findings from the monitoring and evaluation stage, periodic reviews of the new
legislation or normative legal act are conducted. These reviews allow for adjustments,
improvements, and revisions to the policy. Feedback from stakeholders, experts, and
interested parties is taken into account to ensure that the new legislation or normative legal
act continues to meet the changing needs and challenges of the field of inclusive education.
2.3 Groups of interest in this present study
As noted previously, in parallel to the present evaluation study, a formative evaluation to
assess the contribution of different state education programmes in promoting inclusive
education is already underway (the Junction Bulgaria study). Our research complements this
work and provides evidence on the inclusive education landscape in Kazakhstan by using
information from publicly accessible social media and online news media sources with
particular focus on two groups of stakeholders:
1. the general online public, which includes parents, teachers, and youth overall;
and
2. organisations active in inclusive education activities in Kazakhstan and
which possess institutional knowledge on inclusive education in Kazakhstan.
For both these groups of interest, we analyse text that they post or interact with online on
inclusive education, identify how they discuss potential barriers, and check if there are any
specific policies or programmes that are more frequently mentioned than others. This study
also offers a valuable addition to the growing body of literature that uses Big Data to inform
policy debates in Kazakhstan. Such Big Data studies have been previously supported by
UNICEF.7
This research also presents a methodological contribution by synthesising the emerging
evidence on the use of innovative analytical methods, such as use of text and sentiment
analytics in evaluations. Importantly, in addition to answering specific EQs (listed in next
subsection), this study intends to complement the ongoing formative evaluation being
undertaken by the Junction Bulgaria team, which can assist the Government of Kazakhstan
in identifying existing gaps in the inclusive education landscape in Kazakhstan. This is in
tandem with the SDG 4 goal of ‘Ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all’.
These insights are expected to be useful for the Government of Kazakhstan, which has
previously committed to ensuring access to inclusive education and has ratified international
agreements that safeguard the rights of children with disabilities, including the right to
receive quality inclusive education. For example, in 2015, Kazakhstan ratified the
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, whose mission is to create conditions
where individuals with disabilities can participate in society on an equal footing with others,
without any discrimination. Moreover, the Government of Kazakhstan has developed and
implemented measures as part of the National Plan to uphold the rights and improve the
7 Earlier studies have, for example, studied connectivity disparity across schools using Big Data, and were also
supported in this endeavour by UNICEF: Unicef Giga Kazakhstan (accessed 11 July 2023).
© Oxford Policy Management 10
quality of life for individuals (including children) with disabilities by 2025. This plan
represented a significant step towards providing equal opportunities and inclusion.
2.4 Evaluation scope
In terms of the scope of this evaluation, this study focuses on children with development
disabilities and relies on a comprehensive definition and conceptualisation of inclusive
education (Section 1.1). As the social media footprint and the nature of discussions are likely
to vary across groups, we study the perspectives of two vital stakeholders: the general
online audience, such as teachers, parents, and students, and specific organisations
working in the space of inclusive education in Kazakhstan. Here, we focus on inclusive
education at the pre-primary, primary, and secondary level.
The evaluation does not cover an assessment of state programmes as this work is
already being catered to in the parallel formative evaluation. Wherever possible, we
present geographic insights, but we do not undertake disaggregated analyses across
geographies. This is because our experience tells us that geolocations are not always
available in the social media data and are often masked by users due to a variety of
considerations, such as privacy. As a result, social media data can often not be
disaggregated meaningfully to provide heterogeneity analysis by geographic units.
Importantly, these results are restricted to represent the views and perspectives of
those who participate on social media and online news media and are therefore not
representative of the general population at the national level. For example, if
smartphones are the predominant medium through which people access social media,
ownership of such a device becomes an important criterion influencing inclusion or exclusion
from this study. If these devices are unaffordable to a section of society, some perspectives
will not find a place in this research, and this needs to be complemented with other
conventional studies.
Some other important features of the scope of this research are as follows.
1. As explained subsequently, we limit our study to the relatively recent past, from the
beginning of 2022 to May 2023. This is primarily because multiple social media
platforms provide recent data ranging from one to two years.
2. The scope of our study is also limited by the features of how we collect data; in other
words, we only ‘see’ conversations and posts online that are captured by our
scrapers.
3. In our search queries, we limit the geography to Kazakhstan in the evaluation
framework and EQs by including a ‘location’ query that specifies our results must
mention locations within Kazakhstan. This includes discussions about inclusive
education in Kazakhstan, both from current residents in the country and from the
Kazakh diaspora living outside Kazakhstan’s borders.

2.5 EQs
Based on detailed discussion with UNICEF during the inception phase, this study focuses on
three EQs.8 Each is tackled for the two stakeholder groups listed above, the general online
public and specific organisations. The EQs we look at are as follows.
1. What is the content of social and online media discussions on inclusive
education in Kazakhstan? We interpret this to be a broad descriptive question
that tries to understand what social and online media text relating to inclusive
education looks like, i.e. what is mentioned online and where (e.g. the most-
mentioned words, themes, sentiments, etc. in related text, and who is posting
about this). We exclusively and purposefully use quantitative text analysis
techniques to describe these text corpora.
2. What do people mention as factors ‘holding back’ (barriers) inclusive
education? We interpret this as relating to social and online media discussions
regarding issues that affect access to inclusive education negatively in
Kazakhstan. Again, we interpret this as a descriptive question about online text
related to these issues. We interpret ‘barriers’ broadly, i.e. relating to factors that
affects access to education and rights to education for children with disabilities.
3. Do people mention state programmes at all? We interpret this to relate to the
question of whether specific spate programmes are mentioned in online
conversations, news articles, social media posts, etc.
We use a variety of quantitative analytical tools and descriptive analysis methods to
answer these EQs. The detailed discussion on how this analysis was undertaken is
provided in Section 3 on methodology. Broadly, to capture and study discussions and posts
from different stakeholders, we scraped and analysed data separately for the general online
public and for specific organisations working in the inclusive education space. Corpus 1 was
collated using automated scraping offered by Meltwater.9 For Corpus 2, we created self-
programmed scrapers that manually pulled discussions on inclusive education from publicly
accessible social media platforms.
Table 1 provides a snapshot of methods used to answer each EQ for both text corpora.
Overall, we use a range of descriptive analyses ranging from analysing trends in mentions,
identifying most used words, algorithm-based identification of positive and negative news
stories for Kazakh and Russian, and sentiment and hashtag analysis to inform our analysis.
Each of these is discussed in detail in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 respectively for each text
corpus.
Importantly, we acknowledge that some conversations online might be gendered. For each
of the text corpora, we therefore try to undertake an analysis taking this into account. We try
to verify if descriptive analyses vary depending on which gender one pays attention to. It is
important to highlight that this does not correspond to a comprehensive analysis of how
inclusive education access or barriers vary by gender – but does give us a sense of how
different genders are referred to in the context of inclusive education. We are constrained to
8 It should be noted that these evaluation questions diverge slightly from the scope described in the Terms of
Reference to this technical report (see Annex A). This scope was re-negotiated and limited purposefully, together
with UNICEF, during the inception phase of this evaluation.

© Oxford Policy Management 12
perform more comprehensive analyses by the fact that identifying the gender of authors of
online text is (mostly) not possible. (See caveat 8 in section 4.4 on this.)
Although we acknowledge DAC criteria for evaluations,10 it is important to emphasise that
we do not explicitly use them to structure this study. In this study, we present descriptive
findings of online discussions on topics that are relevant for inclusive education
programming. Thus, this research represents a formative study, which provides evidence on
opinions of different stakeholders—as expressed online—on the inclusive education
landscape in the country, which can aid the relevance of future programmes.
Simultaneously, we acknowledge that the findings of this report only represent the views of
those participants who posted their perceptions on publicly available social media platforms,
and thus may not be generalisable to the entire Kazakh population. The results presented in
this report hence need to be understood within this narrow scope of our study.

3 Methods
3.1 Scraping and processing text data from the internet
To answer our EQs from Section 2.5, we relied on SML and quantitative text analysis tools.
We applied two approaches, depending on the stakeholder group whose online discussions
we wanted to capture, resulting in two text corpora (i.e. two different collections of text data).
i. Corpus 1 was created using Meltwater, an online platform that offers scraping
and analytics of social media and online news data. This collection of text data
was intended to capture the discussions of the general online public on
inclusive education in Kazakhstan. We explain how we scrape—i.e. ‘collect’—text
data using Meltwater in Section 3.1.1.
ii. Corpus 2 was built using self-programmed scrapers and pulled only media
discussions of specific organisations active in the inclusive education space
in Kazakhstan. We explain how we gained access to these data in Section 3.1.2.
Through these complementary approaches analysing similar EQs from different
perspectives, we triangulated insights and contrasted these findings across different
stakeholders.
3.1.1 Corpus 1: Using Meltwater
As a first step in building a search query in Meltwater, we identified multiple subtopics within
inclusive education through a literature review and expert discussions (Figure 2). For each
subtopic, we created a combination of keywords in Russian and Kazakh that accurately
described the chosen topic and considered the specifics of each language and different
stakeholder groups. When compiling our keywords, we took into account declination and
conjugation in Russian and Kazakh to encompass all possible variations of words frequently
used in media dialogues. An example of keywords for Subtopic 2, ‘Physical disabilities’, is
shown in Box 2.
Figure 2: Subtopics within inclusive education
1. Public policy around disability
2. Physical disabilities
3. Mental disabilities
4. Intellectual disabilities
5. Sensory impairment disabilities
6. Required school education infrastructure
7. Special education teaching tools and resources
8. Perceptions on stigma and discrimination
9. Commonly used terms (colloquial terms)
10. Education categories

Box 2: Keywords for Subtopic 2: Physical disabilities
Wheelchair user, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, diseases of the musculoskeletal system, lameness,
dwarfism, epilepsy, poor physical coordination, chronic pain, physical handicap, diseases of the central or peripheral
neurological systems.
Once our subtopics and keywords were defined, we initiated search queries within the
Meltwater platform, scraping online discussions on inclusive education in Kazakhstan. We
used the ‘combined search’ option, which allows us to combine multiple categories of search
queries in Meltwater using Boolean operators, i.e. words and symbols such as ‘AND’ and
‘OR’, that expand or narrow the search query according to specific parameters. For instance,
if we were interested in running a search that includes both Categories 1 and 2 from Figure
2, we combined two sets of keywords using the ‘AND’ operator. The specific keywords, as
well as the use of the Boolean operators in Meltwater, are illustrated in Figure 32 and Figure
33 in the Annex. Meltwater covers the following sources: news sites, blogs, Facebook,
Instagram, Twitter, Forums, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, RSS, TikTok, Twitch, and YouTube.
Importantly, in the context of Instagram, Meltwater does not allow extracting the whole text
of each post. Thus, this exercise was undertaken as part of Corpus 2, discussed in Section
3.1.2.
As part of the validation process, we initially ran our search queries for a period of 90 days
only and assessed the relevance of our results to the topic. To ensure accuracy, we
randomly selected a portion of the results and read each of those randomly selected posts
or news item thoroughly, classifying them as either ‘relevant’ or ‘not relevant’ to the topic of
‘inclusive education’. If too many results were considered to be irrelevant, we amended the
search query to increase the relevance of results. Multiple iterations of the search queries
were conducted to achieve a high percentage of relevant outcomes. Through this process,
we were able to increase the number of relevant results in our validation sets from 30% to
77% in the case of searches in Russian, and from 6% to 80% in the case of searches in
Kazakh. Once a high level of relevance was attained, the finalised search queries were
utilised to collect data over a one-year period, specifically 01 May 2022 to 01 May 2023.
Our final search queries were divided into two categories, both of which were run in Russian
and Kazakh. The breakdown of specific subtopics contained within these categories is
shown in Figure 3.
1. Inclusive education: These combined queries related to subtopics of ‘disability’ and
‘education’. These queries incorporated relevant keywords that specifically covered
Topics 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 from the list of subtopics in Figure 2. To limit our analysis
to results in Kazakhstan, we also included a ‘location’ query that specified our results
must mention locations within Kazakhstan. To enhance the quality and relevance of
our data, we implemented the ‘exclude’ function, specifically designed to filter out
spam websites. Finally, the ‘NEAR’ operator ensured that all relevant keywords were
within a specific proximity to each other, for instance no more than 50 words apart.
2. Rights barriers: This contained the subtopics of ‘disability’ and ‘education’ within
Kazakhstan, but additionally included queries specifically focusing on Topic 8,
‘Perceptions on stigma and discrimination’, from Figure 2, defined as the ‘rights and
barriers domain’ search in Figure 3. This category covered keywords relating to
stigma and discrimination, as well as violence and violation of rights, to gain insights
© Oxford Policy Management 15
into potential challenges and barriers faced by children with spatial educational
needs. The slight differences in how our ‘rights and barriers’ query was defined in
Russian and Kazakh emerged from the validation process, as in each iteration we
selected the query that gave the highest proportion of relevant results. Importantly,
as this category was built within the topic of ‘disability and education’, some of the
themes that featured prominently as topics of discussion may, by construction, refer
to barriers in inclusive education. We revisit this point in Section 4.

Furthermore, we incorporated queries specifically focused on gender, which were not
included in the previous topics. These queries consisted of separate searches for gendered
keywords associated with girls and boys within Meltwater. However, we discovered a low
relevance of the collected publications regarding gender issues, as these publications did
not contain specific information or substantial insights related to gender in the context of
inclusive education in Kazakhstan.
The number of results in our final search queries for all four categories from Figure 3 are
shown in Table 22. Query 2, run in Russian, yielded the largest number of mentions of the
topic of inclusive education, with a total of 1,200 mentions. Query 1, run in Kazakh, was
mentioned within online discussions 515 times. Given ‘rights barriers’ is a more specific
search intended to pick up discussions focusing on stigma, discrimination, and violation of
the rights of children with SEN, we see a lower number of mentions than for inclusive
education. As shown by Queries 3 and 4, the topic of rights barriers has more mentions in
Russian than in Kazakh, with 326 and 258 total mentions respectively.

3.1.2 Corpus 2: Using self-programmed scrapers
In addition to capturing perspectives of general public, we also looked at specific
organisations working on inclusive education in Kazakhstan. By virtue of their experience
and institutional knowledge on inclusive education, their perspectives may differ from those
of the general audience and are thus an integral part of the study.

Through a purposive research design, we identified multiple organisations and their publicly
accessible social media handles and websites (Annex, Table 6), which were scraped via a
self-written programme to create Corpus 2. This means we wrote a computer programme
using the programming language Python, which accessed the social media sites and
websites and downloaded publicly accessible text. A major component of Corpus 2 came
from Instagram channels, Telegram groups and channels, and web sources such as blogs
and news outlets. Importantly, this ‘manual’ scraping approach was also beneficial, as the
Meltwater approach presented above did not scrape most of the above sources except for
Instagram. Manual scraping of Instagram channels also allowed us to extract the whole text
of each post, facilitating a more in-depth analysis.
To account for the exclusivity of discussions, we classified each source as either ‘dedicated’
or ‘not dedicated’. Dedicated sources undertook discussions exclusively on disability and
education, whereas the second category shared perspectives on other topics as well. As
manual scraping allowed for data extraction over longer periods of time, messages posted
between 01 January 2022 and 30 April 2023 were included in the analysis, which meant
this timeframe was slightly different than for Corpus 1. Moreover, we only selected and
scraped channels and sources identified as part of the purposive design. We applied the
following scraping processes to each of the data sources for Corpus 2.
Instagram: Here, we used an external tool called Apify (link) to perform data scraping.
Instagram is a closed platform, requiring specialised tools to undertake data extraction,
which is often difficult. These data were provided in JSON format. We then extracted
selected fields, such as the post text itself, the location of the post (when available), the
message, and the author. We anonymised any identification information after analysis.
Telegram: We downloaded these data using the Telegram desktop application. The
application does not distinguish between a channel or a group, so we applied the same
scraping method as for Instagram. We saved the data to the disk in an HTML format, which
were then processed to extract each individual message and the message date.
Web sources: Since online sources vary considerably in their structure, we wrote a
separate scraper for each of the web sources. For each source, we first extracted all articles,
i.e. all text published on the website. As a second step, we extracted the actual article
content together with the article date.
It should be noted, again, that all data scraped using the above processes were publicly
available text data. This means we did not scrape any private messages or text published in
private groups (Section 3.3).
Once we had completed the data scraping, we saved the results in a local file and further
processed it. This involved filtering the entire text corpus by date and translating all the text
content into Russian.11 We used the Yandex translator API for this task (link).
To keep the analysis consistent across the two text corpora, we applied the same queries as
in the Meltwater search to each record. In particular, this yielded the following filter: a record
was considered relevant for the analysis if it came from a dedicated source or included
mentions of both disability and education. From a total of about 12,000 records, about
11 Due to the purposive selection of sources, the text data was in commonly used languages in the region (either Kazakh or
Russian). The decision to translate into Russian was taken because further processing steps required a trained Natural
Language Processing (NLP) model to exist for the language. Unfortunately, the library we were most familiar with in this context
(Spacy: link) did not include a model for the Kazakh language, and a model could not be found in other common libraries.
© Oxford Policy Management 17
10,500 were deemed relevant by using this filter. We also identified about 2,300 and 3,400
key searches on Disability and Education, respectively. Importantly, following these steps,
we identified 750 search queries on barriers to inclusive education (Table 33). While for
Corpus 1, search queries determined the resulting records themselves, in Corpus 2 search
queries were used to select a subset of already-scraped documents. Since analysis on
Corpus 2 was only performed in the Russian language, there was no need to specify the
language: if the original document was not in Russian, we translated it first and then applied
the query.
Next, we applied the NLP model to remove stop words and lemmatise words in the text. This
was necessary to perform the next steps of data processing. Wherever available,
geographical locations mentioned were extracted from the text.

3.2 Data analysis
3.2.1 Corpus 1
As the text data from Corpus 1 was collected using the Meltwater platform, we relied
primarily on analytical tools available within Meltwater to conduct data analysis. For both our
general search query on inclusive education, as well as the specific query analysing the
rights and barriers of children with SEN (Figure 3), we used the following methods.
1. Mentions trend: This showed how the volume of posts mentioning our topics of
interest evolved over time (for instance, monthly) during the study period. This
method allowed us to identify spikes of mentions at a time when online discussion on
inclusive education in Kazakhstan was especially active, or (conversely) quiet, and
associate them with particular events.
2. Top publications by reach: Reach estimates the potential viewership of any
particular article based on the number of monthly unique visitors to the specific
source. This feature allowed us to analyse which publishing sites had the largest
number of viewers, giving us insights into where the most widely viewed discussions
on inclusive education were hosted, as well as the ownership of this source.
3. Top news: This allowed us to see the content of posts that had the largest reach,
and thus to identify the most widely read online publications relating to inclusive
education.
4. Top sources: This feature displayed the most popular sources for our search
queries and included all platforms covered by Meltwater, i.e. news sites, blogs,
© Oxford Policy Management 18
Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Forums, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, RSS, TikTok,
Twitch, and YouTube.
5. Sentiment analysis: Using Meltwater’s NLP algorithm, this method allowed us to
determine whether publications had a negative, positive, or neutral tone. We could
also combine this feature with Method 3, ‘Top news’, and display top news stories
that had been assigned a particular sentiment.
6. Hashtag analysis: This method allowed us to view the most commonly used
hashtags, as well as the number of posts tagged to each hashtag.
7. Keywords: This allowed us to view the most commonly occurring words, together
with their frequency. We manually excluded ‘stop words’, such as ‘and’ or ‘the’, which
did not add any meaningful context to our results.
8. Gender analysis: To check if references to one group (girls or boys) had a
disproportionately higher representation over the other in discussions on inclusive
education (disability and education), we compared the shares of messages referring
to each group across two text repositories of ‘education and disability’ and
‘education’ respectively. The latter category did not include ‘disability’ and thus
served as a reference or baseline category. For example, if shares of messages and
text referring to girls were lower for ‘disability and education’ vis-à-vis ‘education’, we
could infer that issues relating to the experiences of girls were getting lower
representation in discussions on inclusive education (disability and education) when
compared to discussions on education with no mention of disability. To check for any
differences in sentiments across references to boys and girls, we also conducted a
sentiment analysis by gender for both text corpora (Section 4.1.3).
3.2.2 Corpus 2
We used multiple quantitative analytical methods to study the text in Corpus 2 extracted
from specific organisations working in the inclusive education space in Kazakhstan. These,
alongside their purpose, are listed below.
1. Number of messages per date as trend: Similar to the mentions trend above,
these facilitated studying trends of discussion on topics of inclusive education and
how they varied with the academic session.
2. Word frequency analysis: This analysis provided a visual snapshot of 50 most
common meaningful words that featured in discussions on inclusive education.
3. Topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation: Topic modelling is a statistical
exercise that allows us to identify cluster of similar words within a body of text. This
analysis cannot be executed on Meltwater and so was exclusively undertaken for
Corpus 2. It allowed us to identify the underlying topics in the corpora of documents
and provided a way to represent each document as a distribution over the identified
topics.
4. Topic evolution over time: An extension of the approach above, this method
reflected how discussions under each thematic area varied over time.
© Oxford Policy Management 19
5. Messages per country or region normalised by population: In cases where
geolocations could be identified, this analysis provided a geospatial view of the
engagement on these discussions.
6. State programme mentions: To check if certain programmes were being discussed
more than others on social media, we prepared a comprehensive list of active
programmes and checked if they were mentioned in the text corpus. This analysis
was specifically used to tackle EQ3 as listed in Section 3.
7. Gender analysis: As for Corpus 1, we undertook a gender-based analysis in Corpus
2 (Section 4.2.4).
Importantly, to study barriers impeding inclusive education, we again used the methods
stated above but against a different set of data, that was scraped using a modified search
query to incorporate barriers to inclusive education (Section 3.2.1, Figure 3).
3.3 Ethics
As a values-driven organisation, OPM is always respectful of the rights of the participants of
its research projects, and has a policy to ensure complete adherence to research ethics.
We follow a set of ethical principles in conducting all fieldwork based on our own experience
and as per the United Nations Evaluation Group evaluation policy. This study also adheres
to international best practice standards in evaluation, and is consistent with the OECD DAC
framework, even though we do not evaluate specific programmes. We did not conduct any
primary data collection as part of this project, but publicly available online data were scraped
from the internet. Ethical considerations for using these online data were taken into account,
with a particular focus on privacy protection, while again noting that all text we access online
is publicly available. This also means that we anonymise the identities of individuals but
keep the posts of organisations working on inclusive education in Kazakhstan, as these
were posted through their official public social media handles.
As part of OPM’s internal protocols, we considered the core principles outlined by the
Government Social Research on the use of social media data (2016). Moreover, as per our
discussions with UNICEF, we checked again with the Guidance and Evaluation Specialist
from ECA regional office that an ethical clearance would not be required for this project, as
we were only using publicly accessible social media and news data, as well as anonymising
any personal-level identifying information.
3.4 Human rights, gender, and equity
Consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly Article
28, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, particularly
Articles 24, 29, and 30, we adopt a human rights-based approach to this study. Here the
focus of our research is on equal opportunities for disabled children in accessing pre-
primary, primary, and secondary education institutions.
In terms of the legal framework, there is no separate law on inclusive education in
Kazakhstan but there exists a President’s Law on amendments and additions to some
© Oxford Policy Management 20
legislative acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan that relates to inclusive education.12 As per the
earlier version of Law on Education (2007), children with special educational needs were
defined as “persons (children) who experience permanent or temporary difficulties in
obtaining education due to health, who need special, general education programs of
additional education”. Thus, this definition of children with special educational needs led to
understanding that inclusive education was interpreted and identified only with respect to
children with disabilities. However, in 2021 the definition of children with special educational
needs was changed: “persons (children) with special educational needs – persons (children)
who have permanent or temporary needs in special conditions for obtaining an appropriate
level of education and additional education”. This corresponds to a broader understanding of
inclusive education. This 2021 law has become an important document for providing children
with special needs with equal access to quality education. The law regulates the activities of
psychological and pedagogical support services for children with special educational needs
in general education schools, flexibility of curricula, programs, as well as the system for
evaluating student achievements depending on the characteristics of their development.
This report explicitly focuses on barriers to inclusive education through different approaches,
trying to identify discussions or text posted online that tackles and refers to aspects
impeding equitable access to education (Sections 4.1.2 and 4.2.2 on findings). We also
check for gender-based differences in our analysis. We check if one group gets a
disproportionately higher voice over the other in discussions on ‘education and disability’
when compared to discussions in the reference category of ‘education’. These aspects are
outlined in Sections 4.1.3 and 4.2.4 respectively.
3.5 Stakeholder participation
At the inception phase, we held stakeholder consultations with UNICEF and the Junction
Bulgaria team. During these consultations, the EQs and the scope of the analysis were
finalised. Throughout the implementation of the study, regular biweekly catchups were held
with the UNICEF Kazakhstan Team to share project updates and gain regular feedback. As
this work stream was expected to complement the formative evaluation, we interacted with
the Junction Bulgaria team to gain insights into the progression of their work, and reviewed
their preliminary report to identify the intersections between the two workstreams. These are
detailed in Section 4.3. Importantly, preliminary findings from our work were presented to
UNICEF and the Ministry of Education at a joint workshop on 12 July 2023. This provided us
with an opportunity to get input and comments from different stakeholders on the direction of
this research and the preliminary findings.
3.6 Methodological limitations
We apply innovative SML tools as our main methodology for undertaking this evaluation.
While the use of Big Data offers an opportunity to include online discussions that would not
feature within traditional survey-based evaluations, this approach carries its own
methodological limitations. In particular, we note the following.
1. Instagram and Facebook search queries in Meltwater: There are limitations to the
breadth of search queries for Instagram and Facebook in Meltwater, possibly due to
12 Закон Республики Казахстан от 26 июня 2021 года № 56-VII «О внесении изменений и дополнений в
некоторые законодательные акты Республики Казахстан по вопросам инклюзивного образования»
(zakon.kz) (Last accessed March 28, 2023).
© Oxford Policy Management 21
the data privacy policies of these social media platforms. In the context of Instagram,
we were only able to view the posts of business accounts that we specifically
tracked. These could be added by manually selecting up to 30 hashtags and up to 30
accounts. For Facebook, we were able to view all public discussions, including
comments. However, if we wanted to track the activity of specific pages, there was a
limit of 100 accounts. Therefore, it is possible that only a very small subset of the
discussions on these platforms was picked up by Meltwater. We address this
limitation in Corpus 2, where we use self-programmed scrapers to access Instagram
posts directly.
2. Meltwater analytical tools: While the online platform offered a wide range of
analytical capabilities, outlined in Section 3.2.1, it did not allow the user to download
the raw text corpus from its online searches or view the post in full, limiting our ability
to conduct independent analysis. As a result, the analysis undertaken on Corpus 1
had to be restricted to the tools offered by Meltwater, with no ability to validate the
results using our own methods. This was particularly limiting in the context of gender
analysis for Corpus 1, where we were restricted to adding keywords associated with
boys and girls to our search, as opposed to methods such as dictionary search,
which would have been possible had we had access to the raw data corpus.
3. Geolocation: Given the location of most posts was unknown or not disclosed by the
user due to a variety of considerations, including privacy, we relied on keywords
mentioning locations within Kazakhstan to ensure that the online discussion
concerned inclusive education in Kazakhstan specifically. For the same reason, we
were limited in our ability to carry out an analysis of the spatial distribution of online
conversations on inclusive education within Kazakhstan. Despite this, we provide a
map of locations of all posts that were geotagged for Corpus 2.
4. Relevance of results: We relied on a validation process during which a human
expert drew a random subsample of results from our search queries and determined
what percentage could be considered relevant to the discussion on inclusive
education in Kazakhstan. Given that reviewing several hundred posts individually
was unfeasible, we drew conclusions on relevance on the basis of this subsample,
rather than the full Corpus. An alternative approach might have been to train a
machine learning algorithm to identify the concept of ‘inclusive education in
Kazakhstan’ in text, and classify all posts as either relevant or non-relevant.
However, this method came with its own set of considerations, such as bias and
accuracy in the algorithm, as well as requiring a large training sample.
5. Language translations: For Corpus 2, we used a pre-trained NLP model to clean
the raw text scraped from the web, as well as to perform topic modelling. As the
Kazakh language was unavailable in the Python library that we were most familiar
with (SpaCy), and as it could not easily be found among other libraries, we relied on
the Yandex translator API (link) to translate all Kazakh content into Russian before
analysis. As a result, slight differences in meaning, particularly concerning
vocabulary that has a specific cultural connotation, might have occurred.

4 Findings
4.1 Corpus 1: discussions by the general public on inclusive
education online
4.1.1 What is the content of social and online media discussions on
inclusive education in Kazakhstan?
The results from this subsection refer to the first of our two main search queries, Query 1
and Query 2 on inclusive education in Figure 3, and are presented in both Kazakh and
Russian. This search encompasses topics relating to disability and education in Kazakhstan
and is intended to capture online discussions of the general public on the topic.
We first consider the mentions trend for our two main searches in Russian and Kazakh to
see how the volume of online discussion on inclusive education in Kazakhstan changes over
time. Figure 4 shows the total number of social media posts that mentioned inclusive
education per month for our analysis period (01 May 2022–01 May 2023). The number of
mentions varied monthly for both queries, with a dip in mentions in late 2022 and a rise at
the beginning of the academic year in September 2023. There was also an increase in April
2023, likely related to the month of raising awareness about autism.
Figure 4: Mentions trends—Queries on inclusive education
Query 1: Inclusive education KZ Query 2: Inclusive education RU
Overall, the number of mentions during our study period was 515 in the case of Query 1 and
1,200 in the case of Query 2. In order to get a sense of the size of the absolute volume of
this discussion, we compare these total numbers of mentions to the number of mentions we
get from a simple query on only education keywords, covering the same time period. When
we run such a query, we get 45,700 mentions for the Russian query and 8,560 mentions for
the Kazakh query. This means that the inclusive education query represents
approximately 3% or 6% of the total discussion online on education in Kazakhstan.
Inclusive education therefore does not appear to be a very commonly discussed topic.
Another metric of interest is top publications by reach. According to Meltwater resources,
reach estimates the potential viewership of any particular article based on the number of
monthly unique visitors to the specific source, indicating which publications likely reached
the widest audience. As seen in Figure 5, Informburo.kz could be considered the top source
for news on inclusive education in Kazakh. For search queries in Russian, Tengrinews.kz
and Informburo.kz appear as the top sources for news on inclusive education.
© Oxford Policy Management 23
Both platforms are non-governmental news sources that play a significant role in the media
landscape in Kazakhstan, with a substantial audience and influence in the country. This
suggests a noteworthy interest in inclusive education among well-known media sources in
the region. Our results also show that online posts with the largest number of viewers are
likely to be trustworthy and coming from reputable news sources. Both Tengrinews.kz and
Informburo.kz have the ability to reach a wide range of readers and generate significant
public awareness and engagement around the issues of inclusive education. These news
platforms could serve as influential channels for disseminating information and shaping
public opinion on inclusive education topics.
Figure 5: Top publications by reach—Queries on inclusive education
Query 1: Inclusive education KZ Query 2: Inclusive education RU
We also look at the top news stories included in the results of our main queries. Top news
stories were identified from spikes in mentions trends where the news story with biggest
reach was classified as being the top news item. Top news stories in Kazakh (Figure 6)
mentioned that the Government of Kazakhstan was taking measures to develop inclusive
education by introducing modern technologies, creating feedback channels, and protecting
the rights of children with SEN. This shows government news has a wide reach, and that the
government is successfully highlighting and promoting these actions. This does not
necessarily mean these activities are being undertaken at scale by the government. For all
the figures in the results section, relevant translations in English are provided as footnotes.
According to top news posts in Russian (Figure 7), children with SEN receive attention and
support in Kazakhstan, including the provision of housing, improvement of school conditions,
the organisation of charity events, and state support through private and public funds.

Figure 7: Top news—Query 2: Inclusive education RU14
An analysis of top sources provides an indication of what types of online sources host the
largest volume of discussions on inclusive education in Kazakhstan. As seen in Figure 8, the
topic of inclusive education in Kazakhstan is actively covered in news portals and blogs and
on Facebook, with very few results drawn from other popular social media sites such as
Instagram and Twitter. Overall, the low number of posts coming from social media is
perhaps surprising given that civil society organisations working on inclusive education in
Kazakhstan primarily use platforms such as Instagram to share their content. However, this
result could be explained by the fact that Meltwater can only track specific hashtags and
business handles on Instagram that need to be added manually and has a limit of 30
accounts. These limitations are addressed in the analysis of Corpus 2, where we directly
scrape Instagram, gaining an insight into discussions among organisations working in the
inclusive education space in Kazakhstan.

Top news stories with the largest audience reach could also be analysed by sentiment, i.e.
the overall tone of mentions determined by Meltwater’s NLP algorithm. Sentiment can be
either positive, negative, neutral, or not rated if it cannot be adequately classified according
to previous categories. Figure 9 shows top news stories in Russian that have the largest
audience reach and have been assigned a negative sentiment. Negative news stories reflect
discussion on the insufficient protection of the rights of children with SEN and the quality of
their education. On the other hand, top positive news stories in Russian, shown in Figure 10,
reflect discussion of measures taken to support children with autism and to prevent disability
in newborns.

Top positive news stories in Kazakh, shown in Figure 11, reflect discussion on various
aspects of inclusive education in Kazakhstan, including the professional development of
teachers, various activities aimed at supporting and developing children with SEN, and
issues of social protection and support for people with disabilities. Meltwater did not identify
any news stories with a negative sentiment in Kazakh.

The overall sentiment analysis, shown in Figure 12, tells us the proportion of all posts within
the two searches by sentiment. In the case of the search query in Russian, 66.2% of news
stories appeared to be positive, while only 3.3% had a negative tone. The remaining 29% of
posts were neutral and 1.5% could not be classified and thus were not rated. For results in

positive tone, and none had a negative tone. This is consistent with there not being any top
news stories with a negative sentiment in Kazakh.

As part of our hashtag analysis, we tracked accounts of specific organisations working in the
inclusive education space in Kazakhstan through their Instagram and Facebook handles.
The full list of those stakeholders can be viewed in Annex Table 6. According to the top
hashtags, shown in Figure 13, autism and cerebral palsy seemed to be the most widely
discussed types of disability in the context of inclusive education. Use of the EHT
hashtag could demonstrate an active discussion of the issues of adaptation of testing for
children with SEN. In terms of the activity of specific organisations, social media users
discussed the opportunities and initiatives of the Bulat Utemuratov Foundation, its
contribution to inclusive education for children with autism, and the results of its work. For
context, some examples of news stories on autism and cerebral palsy are discussed in Box

We supplement our analysis of a broader online discussion on topics related to disability and
education in Kazakhstan with a specific analysis of Queries 3 and 4, which consider the
rights of children with SEN. This subsection will focus on results from search queries that
identify particular barriers to inclusive education in Kazakhstan, including discussions around

The total monthly mentions in Kazakh showed a decreasing trend throughout the year
(Figure 15). There were two spikes in September and March coinciding with messages from
the President of Kazakhstan mentioning support to people with SEN. The mentions trending
in Russian followed a similar pattern (Section 4.1.1), with variation throughout the year and
an increasing trend over the academic year, starting in September. Similarly, the increase
in April coincided with the month of raising awareness about autism.
Overall, the total number of mentions during our study period was 326 for Query 3 and 258
for Query 4. This is roughly one-quarter of total mentions during the same period for the
broader query of inclusive education in the case of Russian, and around one-half the
number of mentions in the case of Kazakh. When compared to a broader search concerning
education in Kazakhstan, posts relating to rights and barriers accounted for 0.7% of results
in Russian and 3% of results in Kazakh. Therefore, discussions on stigma,
discrimination, and violence against children with SEN constitute a very small portion
of the online conversation on inclusive education in Kazakhstan, and an even smaller
portion of the discussion on education more broadly.

Query 3: Rights barriers RU Query 4: Rights barriers KZ
Top news stories from our search on rights and barriers are shown in Figure 16. Top posts
in Kazakh mentioned child abuse in kindergartens 17 times. Consistent with this theme,
another post mentioned that the Government of Kazakhstan had discovered cases of
violence and bullying against children and youth at schools and universities, as well as in
families, using digital technology (a telegram bot). Because children with disabilities are
disproportionately more affected by violence and abuse than their peers without disabilities,
their safety at school is critical for adequate inclusion. In response, the Government of
Kazakhstan intends to address quality issues, improve standards, and establish minimum
safety requirements to ensure the wellbeing and development of children in early childhood

education. This is being done by improving kindergarten standards regarding the
qualification of staff members, introducing a licence to run a kindergarten, tightening
government contract requirements, and improving the content of early childhood education
programmes. These points also feature in the new education concept released by the
Ministry of Education.
Top posts in Russian stated that the Government of Kazakhstan was putting in effort to
provide inclusive opportunities in sports and recreational activities for children with
disabilities, as well as to create stricter safeguards and monitoring mechanisms in
educational settings to ensure their safety and wellbeing. Another post reported a growing
inclusion of children with autism in regular classrooms, highlighting the importance of
comprehensive support systems and raising awareness to foster positive attitudes towards
inclusive education.

Top negative news stories in Russian, shown in Figure 17, reflected discussions of
the challenges of inclusive education, highlighting incidents of abusive treatment and
safety violations in educational settings. On the other hand, top positive news stories in
Russian (Figure 18) reflected a positive trajectory in Kazakhstan's inclusive education
landscape (accessible school buses, autism centres, and charity awareness events). Autism
centres here function with the main objective of identifying ASD and helping children
improve their social, speech, and household skills. Honing these skills sets prepares them
for being mainstreamed into schools and fosters inclusive education. Meltwater did not

Analysis of top keywords (Figure 20) reveals a growing focus on inclusive education
in Kazakhstan over the last few years. Increased attention has been paid to the
requirements of children with SEN with the establishment of inclusive schools and efforts to
provide care and support. The analysis of popular words in Russian shows that the term
‘limited opportunities’ was commonly utilised when referring to children with SEN, despite
its offensive nature, even in official documents. As discussions on stigma, discrimination,
and violence against children with SEN constituted a very small portion of the online
conversation on inclusive education in Kazakhstan, initiatives aimed at the use of inclusive
language in official communications and correspondence may help normalise these
conversations in the rest of the country.

4.1.3 Gender analysis
Existence of gender disparity, which is prominent globally, can cause differentiated access
to inclusive education. To check if girls or boys are disproportionately represented in
discussions on inclusive education, we compare the shares of messages mentioning each
group across the two text categories of inclusive education and education without any
mention of disability. For example, if the share of messages regarding girls is lower for
‘disability and education’ than for ‘education’, we can infer that girls are getting lower
representation in discussions on inclusive education (disability and education) when
compared to discussions on education with no mention of disability.
When comparing the share of messages on education and disability with the share of
messages on only education for both boys and girls, we find these shares to be comparable,
with about 75% of the messages representing boys. This suggests the discussion on
inclusive education, which focuses on children with disabilities, does not accord higher
importance to one group vis-à-vis the reference category. Having said this, it is important to
note that, at an absolute level, the volume of messages across time caters to boys (~75%)
more than girls (~25%) (Figure 21).
Figure 21: Gender analysis (Corpus 1)
© Oxford Policy Management 36
Next, we check for any differences in the sentiment expressed by gender in the education
discussion compared to the discussion on education and disability (Figure 22). For both
kinds of message, we find that the positive sentiment is expressed more frequently in the
context of boys, whereas the neutral sentiment is expressed more frequently in the context
of girls. The negative sentiment, which appears to be expressed slightly more commonly for
girls vis-à-vis boys on education, is expressed less frequently and becomes equal to that of
boys for messages on education and disability.

4.1.4 Summary of key findings
Inclusive education in Kazakhstan is a topic of ongoing discussion. However, it represents
only a small portion (3–6%) of the general discussion on education in Kazakhstan, making it
a relatively uncommonly discussed topic. Average monthly mentions vary, but there was an
overall increasing trend over the academic year 2022–23. The increase we observed in April
2023 coincided with the month of raising awareness about autism in Kazakhstan. Analysis of
top news stories shows that the Government of Kazakhstan is actively taking measures to
develop inclusive education, including through the introduction of modern technologies, the
creation of feedback channels, and initiatives aimed at protecting the rights of children with
SEN. This shows that the government’s messaging has a wide reach, and that they are
successfully highlighting and promoting these activities. In terms of the sources of online
discussion, news sites, news portals, and Facebook are actively covering the topic of
© Oxford Policy Management 38
inclusive education in Kazakhstan. Discussions on other social media relating to inclusive
education were relatively limited.
Negative news stories often focused on the lack of protection of the rights of children with
SEN and the quality of their education. On the other hand, positive news stories highlighted
measures taken to support children with autism and to prevent disability in newborns, as well
as various aspects of inclusive education in Kazakhstan, including capacity building of
teachers and measures for social protection. Autism and cerebral palsy were the most
widely discussed types of disability in the context of inclusive education.
Hashtag analysis shows that autism and cerebral palsy seemed to be the most widely
discussed types of disability in the context of inclusive education. The adaptation of
testing for children with SEN was actively discussed, as indicated by the ЕНТ hashtag.
Among non-profits, the Bulat Utemuratov Foundation and its initiatives received
attention and positive discussion for its contribution to education for children with autism.
The most widely used topics in discussions included an increase in the number of children
with disabilities potentially linked to better diagnostics, and the equipping of perinatal
centres to prevent disability in newborns.
An analysis of ‘barriers’ reveals that incidents of violence and bullying in kindergartens,
schools, universities, and families have been identified by the Government of Kazakhstan,
emphasising the need for measures to protect children and youth. Consistent with earlier
results, we found that the Government of Kazakhstan has made an effort to address quality
issues, improve standards, and establish minimum safety requirements in early childhood
education. However, in comparison to a broader search on education in Kazakhstan,
conversations on stigma, discrimination, and violence against children with SEN
constituted a very small portion of online discussions. Positive news stories reflected
progress in inclusive education, such as improving accessibility of school buses, autism
centres, charity events, and efforts to promote sports participation and improve school
accessibility for children with disabilities. Autism centres here help children improve their
social, speech, and household skills for mainstreaming children into schools. The presence
of hashtags relating to charity and support indicates community involvement and efforts to
enhance the wellbeing of, and opportunities for, children with SEN. Although these charity
events can be seen as paternalistic, in the context of Kazakhstan they also play an important
role in integrating children with SEN and disabilities into society and are important in
changing the existing mindset and how these children are viewed. Inclusive education in
Kazakhstan has attracted growing attention, including the establishment of inclusive schools
and efforts to address diverse needs, such as visual impairments, within the framework.
Finally, the use of the term ‘limited opportunities’ when referring to children with SEN is
common but considered offensive, highlighting the need for more inclusive language in
official documents.
When analysed by gender, we find shares of messages for boys and girls across the
corpora of education and disability and education to be comparable. However, the share of
messages regarding boys in such discussions was about three times as large as that of
girls, accounting for about 75% of the overall discussions.

4.2 Corpus 2: Online discussions by organisations focusing on
inclusive education in Kazakhstan
4.2.1 What is the content of social and online media discussions on
inclusive education in Kazakhstan?
We now discuss the findings from Corpus 2, based on the perspectives and experiences of
organisations actively engaged in inclusive education issues in Kazakhstan (see Section
3.1.2 and Table 6 in the Annex for a description of how we built this text corpus and the list
of organisations and websites included here). This analysis serves two purposes. First, it
allows us to identify commonalities and differences with the online discussions undertaken
by the general online audience in Section 4.1. We can thereby compare findings, assess
whether the approach to Corpus 1 missed important topics, and identify the themes that are
most important to all stakeholders. Second, as these organisations possess institutional
knowledge on inclusive education and regularly engage with the Government of Kazakhstan,
insights into what these organisations accord importance to is vital to understand how the
inclusive education is being discussed and might evolve in the country.
As organisations are more open to geotagging their locations than individuals, we first
analyse spatial patterns in online discussions on inclusive education.25 Figure 23 displays
the number of messages per 1,000 population, both in the map (left-hand panel) and the bar
chart (right-hand panel).26 These discussions are found to be concentrated mostly in large
cities of Astana and Almaty. Even after accounting for higher population densities in larger
cities, predominant social media engagement on inclusive education is higher in these cities.
Figure 23: Spatial concentration of messages on inclusive education
We use the same combined search query on disability and education as we did for Corpus 1
to identify time trends in the volume of online discussion on inclusive education. Consistent
with what we found earlier, the number of messages rises as the academic session starts
(around September) and tapers off gradually. Since the beginning of 2022, the trend in the
volume of discussion appears to be rising. Organisations active in this space mostly use
25 Only messages that have a geographical reference are included in this analysis.
26 Population numbers for each region were taken from the Kazakhstan Bureau of National statistics (link).
© Oxford Policy Management 40
Instagram and Telegram groups for public discussion (Figure 24). Importantly, unlike for
Corpus 1, there was no uptick in mentions in April, the month of raising awareness on
autism. However, as we show below, there are significant mentions and discussions
regarding autism among organisations engaged in inclusive education in Kazakhstan.
Figure 24: Mentions trends for Corpus 2
Next, we analyse the top 50 most frequently used words in the text corpus, not by the
frequency of their appearance overall but by the number of documents or messages that
contain these words. In this way, we account for varying document lengths and identify
common areas of discussion on inclusive education. In terms of types of disability, autism is
the most frequently discussed type of disability. Analysis also shows common mentions of
terms like ‘special courses’ and ‘support’. This suggests that a big part of the discussion we
are observing relates to the capacity building of teachers and specialists and measures to
support special education (Figure 25). Next, we use topic modelling algorithm to classify
these discussions into a set of common and independent themes.
© Oxford Policy Management 41
Figure 25: Most common discussion words
To identify common themes from Corpus 2, we undertake topic modelling, which classifies
the most common words into broader topics of discussion. This is done in the following
manner:
1. we specify the number of different topics needed to the topic modelling algorithm—
for topic modelling analysis in this section, we consider seven most-discussed topics;
2. the algorithm then provides a list of words associated with the seven topics; and
3. based on what words or phrases feature in each topic, we provide a broad label to
this category, which is also cross-verified using ChatGPT.27
We now analyse the list of 10 most-used keywords for each topic identified in this way. In
Table 4, we provide the English translation of the original Russian topics, which are provided
in Annex Table 7.28
The findings show a focus on the quality of education, with the capacity building of teachers
(Topic 1) and school education content and pedagogy (Topic 2) being the most prominent
categories. Importance is also accorded to diagnosis, treatment (Topic 6), and social support
and opportunities for children with disabilities (topic 7).

To quantify how often these topics are mentioned in relation to one another, we analyse the
number of total messages per topic (Figure 26). We find that the capacity building of
teachers is the most important topic, and that the number of messages on this theme (3,400)
is close to twice as large as the second most-discussed topic (school education content)
(1,900).
Figure 26: Messages per topic
Next, we check how mentions of these topics change over time by analysing the prevalence
of topics per month (Figure 27). We find that the importance of certain topics, such as the
quality of education and the capacity building of teachers, is sustained over time and that
there are no strong seasonal patterns. However, the time series length may be too short for
this analysis, and patterns may become apparent when using longer intervals.

4.2.2 What barriers are mentioned?
As we did for the general online public, we now identify barriers to inclusive education from
the point of view of organisations active in inclusive education landscape in Kazakhstan.
Here, we find that, out of close to 10,500 relevant records, about 640 (6.4%) mention
barriers to inclusive education (Figure 28). To identify topics mentioned as barriers, we
undertake topic modelling on these relevant records. This is discussed next.
Figure 28: Mentions of rights barriers (Corpus 2)
Topic modelling on the 640 documents yields three main topics of discussion on barriers to
inclusive education among organisations working on inclusive education: the need for
assistance, such as dedicated centres to address the SEN of children with disabilities;
© Oxford Policy Management 44
protection of the rights of children with disabilities; and training of teachers and pedagogical
support for children with disabilities (Figure 29). These themes resonate with the topics
identified for the overall Corpus 2 regarding disability and education, as discussed in the
previous section.
Figure 29: Topics of rights barriers (Corpus 2)
To better comprehend the topics presented in Figure 29, we provide the keywords that
feature within these broad topics of discussion (Table 5). As in previous section, we provide
English translations for the Russian topics and keywords, which are presented in Annex
Table 8.

Next, we look at the most cited words on barriers to inclusive education from these
messages and documents to check for terms that have not yet appeared in the analysis on
Corpus 2. These terms show that ‘child’, ‘year’, and ‘development’ are the three most
common words of discussion (Figure 30).
© Oxford Policy Management 45
Figure 30: Most cited words on barriers (Corpus 2)
4.2.3 Are specific programmes being mentioned?
For the third EQ, we did not find mentions of any specific programmes using the automated
scraping and analyses offered by Meltwater. To check further for any relevant mentions that
may have been excluded from the automated analytics in Corpus 1, we created Corpus 2
using self-programmed scrapers that manually pulled discussions on inclusive education
from publicly accessible social media platforms. In our selection of close to 10,000
documents, we found few mentions of any specific programmes. The most common items
featuring in this category were the projects ‘Educated Nation’ (Образованная нация) and
‘Comfort School’ (Комфортная школа), which were mentioned in the analysed text corpus.
‘Educated Nation’ 2021–25 aims to transform Kazakhstan into a knowledge-based society
equipped to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. The specific
programme objectives relating to inclusive education include the aims to facilitate access; to
ensure equity in education; to create favourable conditions and an environment for learning;
and to improve the quality of education. Meanwhile, the pilot national project in education
‘Comfort School’ aims to eliminate hazardous facilities, to implement three-shift education,
and to address the shortage of student seats in secondary education institutions.
This suggests that the discussion on inclusive education overwhelmingly focuses on topics
and themes that resonate with the general online public, as well as with organisations
working in this space. In comparison, mentions of specific programmes, a focus of EQ 3 of
this research, are limited. However, this does not imply that these programmes are not
important. It only suggests that, in discussions on inclusive education, issues are discussed
more prominently than specific policies or programmes, which are often broad and
encompass a variety of aims and objectives.

4.2.4 Gender discussion
As discussed in Section 4.1.3 for Corpus 1, in Corpus 2, also we find that the absolute
number of messages, both for education and disability and for only education, is higher for
boys than girls (Figure 31). However, the total number of discussions on gender are much
smaller here than in Corpus 1. Thus, to avoid any bias emerging from a small sample, we
rely on the findings on this theme from Corpus 1.
Figure 31: Gender analysis (Corpus 2)
4.2.5 Summary of key findings
The findings from the analysis of Corpus 2 shed light on key areas of discussion on inclusive
education in Kazakhstan among organisations most active in this area in Kazakhstan.
Spatial patterns of online conversations show that these are mostly concentrated in large
urban cities like Astana and Almaty, even after accounting for higher population densities.
This is suggestive of higher engagement on inclusive education in these areas. Social media
access may also be a function of economic wellbeing, as a result of which such engagement
is lower in other areas of the country.
As seen in results for Corpus 1, the volume of messages rose as the academic session
started and tapered off gradually. However, since 2022, there does appear to have been a
gradual increase in discussions involving organisations that work in inclusive education. In
contrast to the results from Corpus 1, where the online engagement of the general public
with inclusive education was higher on news sites, blogs, and other portals, these
organisations mostly use platforms like Instagram and Telegram groups for public
discussion. Thus, even though general online public and specific organisations working on
inclusive education discuss multiple common issues, their preference in voicing these
perceptions differs in terms of their platform of choice.
In terms of types of disability, and as seen in Corpus 1, autism was the most discussed.
Moreover, there was a significant focus on the capacity building of teachers and specialists
who can support the SEN of children. Simultaneously, issues regarding the protection of
© Oxford Policy Management 47
rights for children and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment were also widely
discussed. The importance of these topics also appears to be deeply entrenched, and there
is little variation seen in their relative mentions over time.
The abovementioned themes also featured prominently as major barriers against inclusive
education, where the need for dedicated centres to cater to the SEN of children, the need to
protect their rights, and improved teacher training and pedagogy were widely discussed. We
find few mentions of specific programmes on inclusive education. This is not to say that
these programmes are not important, but this indicates that specific issues, rather than all-
encompassing programmes, are being discussed more widely. On analysing these results
by gender, although we find that the total number of messages on both the themes of
education and disability and of education only are higher for boys than for girls, the overall
sample for this analysis is small and thus prone to small sample biases. To account for this
possibility, we rely on a similar analysis undertaken for Corpus 1, which reveals similar
results.
4.3 Our findings in the context of the broader formative
evaluation and implications for inclusive education
policymaking in Kazakhstan
An important objective of this evaluation was to study the complementarities of this
workstream alongside the formative evaluation of the Junction Bulgaria team. Together,
these independent studies are expected to generate evidence to inform the inclusive
education landscape in Kazakhstan. Despite different evaluation focus and methodological
approaches, some findings are mutually reinforcing and are listed below.
First, despite the efforts of the Government of Kazakhstan to broaden the popular
understanding of children with SEN, most stakeholders continue to identify this group as
children with physical and mental disabilities. Using SML tools, we also find that the most
popular discussions on inclusive education are on the rise in reported cases of children with
disabilities and measures for its prevention. Analyses of both text corpora reveal that autism
and cerebral palsy are widely discussed. This suggests that the medical model, which
focuses on characteristics of diseases and disorders, continues to dominate the view of
inclusive education. Although discussion on specific conditions is important, a narrow focus
on the medical model over the medium- and long-term undermines the social model of
disability, which may impede unconditional and equitable access to education, especially for
those diagnosed with these conditions.
Second, both studies identify early identification and childhood support for disadvantaged
children as an important area of intervention. Our findings regarding the top news stories
and the most-mentioned words in Corpus 1 show active discussions on measures taken to
prevent disability in newborns and young children, with topics such as equipping perinatal
centres to prevent disability featuring commonly in online discussions. The qualitative data
used in the formative evaluation also show that the parents of children with SEN are
dependent on scarce and expensive options like special kindergartens, private centres, or
homeschooling, which can be exclusionary. Our analysis in Corpus 1 finds positive mentions
regarding aspects such as autism centres, charity events, and efforts to promote sports
participation and improve school accessibility for children with disabilities.
© Oxford Policy Management 48
Third, in the context of large geographical distances to reach schools and issues of social
stigma around these conditions, we also found that the government recognises the task of
addressing early childhood interventions as a major challenge. Our analysis of top news
stories among the general online public shows that the Government of Kazakhstan has been
taking active steps to introduce modern technologies, creating feedback channels and
introducing initiatives aimed at protecting the rights of children with SEN. Moreover, our
analysis of ‘rights and barriers’ reveals that incidents of violence and bullying in
kindergartens, schools, universities, and families have been identified by the Government of
Kazakhstan as an important area of intervention. We also find evidence of positive news
stories on aspects such as accessible school buses, which can tackle inaccessibility arising
from large geographical distances.
Fourth, despite these positive steps, the formative evaluation’s analysis on heads of
education expenditure reveals that a predominant share of funding has recently been
prioritised for upgrading facilities like classrooms and buildings. In comparison, lower
provisions have been made in favour of teacher training, methodological support, and
digitisation. Importantly, it appears that the government is aware of these issues and is
moving to address them. We find capacity building of teachers and specialists is an
important area of discussion. This topic appears in the top positive news stories in Corpus 1
and is the most-mentioned topic in Corpus 2. Importantly, positive sentiments here may be
indicative of steps being taken in the right direction. Analysis of top news stories in Corpus 1
also shows that the Government of Kazakhstan is already taking measures to introduce
modern digital technologies to foster inclusive education.
4.4 Caveats, gaps, and limitations
We now turn to discussing the caveats that must be kept in mind while interpreting the
above findings. We also state the gaps and limitations that exist in this study and how they
can shape a research agenda for the future.
1. This study complements the formative evaluation, which focuses on the role of
different state education programmes in promoting inclusive education. Instead of
looking at specific government programmes, we provide perspectives of different
stakeholders on the inclusive education landscape and conduct a sentiment analysis
of these stated opinions by using publicly accessible social media sources.
2. As these perspectives are unknown a priori and come from publicly accessible social
media data that are different from data collected via traditional survey-based
methods, we worked with previously determined EQs but deliberately stayed away
from the discussion on effect sizes that emerges from specific hypotheses central to
conventional quantitative evaluation studies.
3. For all the benefits that SML tools have to offer, our ability to analyse publicly
available information on social media is constrained by socioeconomic factors, as
well as by the conscious choice made by individuals and institutions to engage with
social media platforms. Thus, the findings emerging from our study, although helpful
in understanding multifarious perspectives on inclusive education, are not
representative of the country or of any subgroup level. Thus, this stream of research
needs to be juxtaposed with studies that lend a voice to those stakeholders of the
inclusive education landscape who are unable to air their views on social media
platforms.
© Oxford Policy Management 49
4. As most social media platforms only keep digital records for a limited period, the
analysis is restricted to slightly more than one year. Thus, we are unable to provide
insights into how these social media discussions have evolved over the medium- to
long-term. As the social media footprint in Kazakhstan grows, this, in our opinion, is
an exciting research area that needs support.
5. For reasons discussed earlier, the scope of the study covers children with disabilities
in pre-primary, primary, and secondary education institutions in Kazakhstan.
However, we believe that, as the first study of its kind in Kazakhstan, this report sets
the foundation for broadening this research area in future.
6. Even though the evaluation targets school-age children, we cannot be assured of
their participation because children with disabilities often have less access to
information and communication technology (ICT) compared to their non-disabled
peers. These barriers can be attributed to various factors: for example, devices,
software, and platforms may not be designed with accessibility features that cater to
the specific needs of children with disabilities; they can be costly; and teachers,
parents, and caregivers may not have sufficient knowledge or training on how to
incorporate ICT effectively for children with disabilities.
7. Our ability to analyse social media data across geographies depends on whether the
data being scaped online are geotagged. As many users online hide or mask their
locations, these aspects may be beyond the scope of the study. We nevertheless
provide spatial insights from Corpus 2 of the analysis. This comes from organisations
working in the inclusive education landscape, which are more likely to share their
geolocations than individual stakeholders.
8. Knowing that barriers faced by different groups in accessing inclusive education may
differ systematically, we provide some insights into the results through a gender lens.
However, our ability to meaningfully disaggregate analyses by different groups of
interest using social media data is constrained by the difficulty in identifying the group
or individual identity of the account posting social media posts (for example, if a
tweet is posted by a man or woman) and by the difficulty in identifying whether a post
talks specifically about gender barriers (for example, if a view is posted is general or
talks about challenges faced by women or men in accessing inclusive education).
These challenges have been pre-empted, which was why no disaggregation as part
of the EQs or indicators was committed to at the inception phase.
9. Although the evaluation has taken care to include researchers with Kazakh, Russian,
and English skills, data analysis and reporting across three different languages that
involve formal and colloquial terminology (and which are impacted by socio-cultural
norms) can affect the interpretation of results.

5 Conclusions and recommendations
5.1 Conclusions
The analysis of the social media data of different stakeholders, as undertaken through
Corpus 1 and 2, provides valuable learning to advance the knowledge of the inclusive
education landscape in Kazakhstan. Lessons learned are listed below and categorised
under the relevant EQs.
5.1.1 EQ1: Content of social and online media discussions on inclusive
education
1. While there is engagement on vital themes of inclusive education across multiple
social media platforms among both the general audience and specific organisations
working in this domain, this represents a relatively small share of the overall
discussion on education. A lot more could be done to promote such discussions
across different stakeholders. Our results show that certain themes may have greater
engagement at different points of the year, as in the case of a spike in discussions on
autism in April, the month for raising awareness on the issue. This may be leveraged
from a policy point of view to facilitate greater cooperation among various
stakeholders, promote synthesis of existing evidence, and advance deliberations with
the Ministry of Education and other relevant government departments to promote
specific policy action.
2. Analysis of general social media discussions show news portals, blogs, and
Facebook actively covers topics on inclusive education. Discussions on other social
media platforms among this group are, however, relatively limited. In contrast,
analysis of social media discussions among organisations active in the inclusive
education space shows much higher engagement on Instagram and Telegram
groups for public discussions. Thus, when using secondary sources of information
such as SML, it is paramount to consider not just different stakeholders but also
varied social media platforms to provide a fair representation of different groups of
stakeholders.
3. From Corpus 1, which represents discussions among general audience, positive
news stories highlighted support for children with autism, prevention of disability in
newborns through early diagnosis and treatment, and aspects such as capacity
building of teachers and enhanced social protection. Simultaneously, negative news
stories focused on the lack of protection of the rights of children with SEN and the
need to focus more on the quality of education. Analysis from Corpus 2, in tandem
with what we have seen for Corpus 1, identifies common mentions of words like
‘special courses’, which is tied to the capacity building of teachers and specialists
who may then be able to support children’s SEN. Thus, in addition to the inclusive
physical infrastructure being prioritised by the government, there has been an
increased emphasis on the need to support human capital investments.
4. The volume of messages is found to increase as the academic session starts but
declines over time, and thus varies with the academic cycle. Moreover, the social
media discussions, especially among organisations working on inclusive education,
are concentrated in the major cities of Astana and Almaty. This suggests urban areas
© Oxford Policy Management 51
have higher engagement with topics on inclusive education and that there is a need
to support studies focusing on the inclusive education landscape in those parts of
Kazakhstan that have a small digital footprint, especially on social media platforms.
5.1.2 EQ2: Barriers to inclusive education
1. Violence and bullying in what should be seen as safe spaces—the home,
kindergartens, schools, and universities—feature as an important barrier to inclusive
education. Given the discouragement these instances may have on students, this
needs constant monitoring and quick redressal. As our findings reflect, the
Government of Kazakhstan, through measures such as establishing minimum safety
requirements, is already taking proactive measures to protect children and youth. As
implementation of rules, within legal frameworks or otherwise, often presents a
continuous challenge these instances need to be closely monitored. Social media
platforms can be an important medium for tracking such incidents. These may be
further supported by helplines to assist victims and their families seeking time-bound
resolution to their complaints.
2. Our findings show concrete efforts to overcome barriers to inclusive education and to
promote the mainstreaming of children with SEN. This is being achieved through
measures such as improved bus services, sports events, and setting up special
centres to help children improve various skills. In this respect, we found evidence of
how charity events and community involvement can assist objectives of improving
the wellbeing of, and opportunities for, children with SEN. For example, we have
found evidence of a positive reception for work undertaken by non-profits such as the
Bulat Utemuratov Foundation, which works with autism. This provides a case for
potential synergies between the Ministry of Education and non-profits to overcome
resource barriers to transcend financial constraints and include specific
competencies that some of these organisations may have honed over time.
3. On differentiated barriers to education by gender, we document that, as seen in
social media discussions on education, most gendered discussion on inclusive
education is dominated by males, with issues relevant to females finding relatively
fewer mentions. As viewing each social media message through the gender lens is
not feasible, this remains an important theme for future research. We reiterate that
these limitations were foreseen at the inception phase where, based on our
discussions with UNICEF, it was decided that no disaggregation as part of the EQs
could be committed to.
5.1.3 EQ3: Checking for mentions of any state programmes
1. We built a comprehensive list of state programmes to identify mentions of any
relevant state programmes that were independently vetted as part of a validation
exercise. As Meltwater lacks the flexibility needed to analyse mentions of such
programmes, a manual dictionary-based search query was built and executed on
Corpus 2 using self-programmed scrapers. It is important to note that, even though
we did not find mentions of any specific state programmes, we do document the
government's active role in factors furthering improvements in inclusive education in
Kazakhstan. Two vital illustrations have been elaborated in Section 4, and further
instances include the introduction of modern technologies to create feedback
channels, initiatives aimed at protecting the rights of children, and efforts made to
address quality issues, improve standards, and establish minimum safety
© Oxford Policy Management 52
requirements to reduce incidences of violence and bullying in kindergartens, schools,
universities. This does not necessarily mean that specific programmes are not
important, but may suggest that discussions on social media mainly pertain to
specific issues on inclusive education, the multiple facets of which may not be
captured in all-encompassing programmes.
5.2 Recommendations regarding inclusive education in
Kazakhstan
The recommendations emerging from the conclusion and lessons learned in the previous
subsection are as follows.
1. Timing and choice of broadcasting platform for key messages: The analysis of
the results for the general online public (Corpus 1) and organisations working in the
area of inclusive education (Corpus 2) shows that engagement with the theme of
inclusive education rises with start of the academic year and tapers off gradually.
Specifically, engagement of the general online public is found to be sensitive to
initiatives such as the month of raising awareness about autism in Kazakhstan.
Similarly, engagement with the general online public is higher on platforms like news
portals and blogs, whereas social media engagement on Instagram and Telegram is
higher for organisations working on inclusive education. This information can be
leveraged by the Government of Kazakhstan, particularly by the Ministry of
Education and the Ministry of Information and Communications, to relay key
messages on inclusive education using varied platforms for different stakeholders.
Evidence suggests the positive effects of such media messaging on children’s
education, which is mediated via parental behaviour (Keefer & Khemani, 2014). This
may also have larger spillover effects on how society perceives inclusive education,
and provides an opportunity to nudge the discussion on inclusive education from a
view dominated by the medical model to a view dominated by the social model.
2. Focus on enhancing accessibility of preschool, primary, and secondary
education facilities: Despite positive perceptions around the Government of
Kazakhstan’s and the Ministry of Education’s increased investment on upgrading
school infrastructure and introducing modern technologies, the findings from the
Junction Bulgaria report show that there is a requirement for even higher investment
in both physical and human infrastructure and resources. Accessibility audits will help
prioritise necessary modifications and ensure compliance with accessibility standards
so that physical accessibility can be enhanced.
• For example, wheelchair-accessible classrooms and bathrooms, improved
lighting in classrooms and common areas, and enhanced digital accessibility
are some areas these audits can focus on. Investment in equipping schools
with appropriate assistive technologies can support students with disabilities
in accessing educational materials, participating in classroom activities, and
effectively engaging with technology. Incorporating Universal Design for
Living principles will promote the use of diverse instructional strategies,
multiple means of representation, and varied forms of assessment to
accommodate different learning styles and abilities. Provision of training and
professional development opportunities for teachers and staff on inclusive
education practices, disability awareness, and accessibility guidelines will
enable educators to better support students with disabilities and create a
more inclusive learning environment. Involving parents and caregivers and
© Oxford Policy Management 53
establishing open lines of communication to address their concerns will
further encourage collaboration on improved accessibility.
Our findings shows that some of these aspects already feature as top positive news
stories in Corpus 1 and Corpus 2, which reveals that the government is aware and
moving to address these challenges. We propose scaling up these action points to
fast-track these gains. Certain voluntary initiatives conducting accessibility audits for
public facilities have already emerged—notably Accessible Kazakhstan—and could
provide guidance for the Government of Kazakhstan to institutionalise this model in
the context of educational facilities.
3. Investment in human capital: Based on repeated mentions of teacher training and
skill upgradation, we recommend providing training and professional development
opportunities for teachers and staff members on inclusive education practices,
disability awareness, and accessibility guidelines to enable educators to better
support students with disabilities and create a more inclusive learning environment.
Training could also contribute towards a more individual approach being taken to
students with SEN. Involving parents and caregivers, and establishing open lines of
communication to address their concerns, will further encourage collaboration on
improved accessibility. These training programmes should include modules on the
identification and prevention of bullying and violence against children with SEN, and
should focus on building inclusive language to minimise the use of potentially
stigmatising vocabulary.
4. Coverage of social media dark areas: As acknowledged previously, we would like
to state again that the social media data on which this analysis is based come from
larger cities like Astana and Almaty. However, more research is needed to
understand perceptions of, and barriers to, inclusive education in other parts of the
country. This can then guide policy action that would be best suited to advancing the
inclusive education goals and aspirations of Kazakhstan’s population.
5. Gender-sensitive assessment of educational needs: Our results show that girls
are relatively underrepresented in online discussions on both education and inclusive
education in Kazakhstan, suggesting a lack of attention paid to the differential needs
of girls in the educational system. This is in tandem with Junction Bulgaria’s
formative evaluation findings, which show that state education programmes do not
mention measures taken to reduce gender disparities in educational outcomes, not
least because of the scarcity of available data. This calls for a collection of indicators
disaggregated by gender within the education sector in order to identify gender-
specific factors limiting access to inclusive education, including the potential impact
of early marriage and teenage pregnancies. Such an analysis could inform more
gender-sensitive policies within the inclusive education sector.
6. Early childhood interventions: Early prevention and diagnosis of disabilities, as
well as the provision of services for early childhood development for children with
SEN, are crucial to ensure that their educational needs are addressed from the
outset. Positive news stories online indicate some progress has been made in
measures taken to prevent disability in newborns and young children, including
through better equipping perinatal centres. These initiatives should be expanded in
coverage and coupled with correctional support to prepare young children with SEN
to study in public schools. Positive news stories also mention the role of social
protection programmes, which could be used to cover disability-related costs, as well
as any expenditure on correctional support.

7. Adaptation of standardised testing: The ЕНТ hashtag appeared commonly in our
analysis, showing active discussions around the need to adapt standardised tests to
the needs of children with SEN. Our findings from top news stories in Corpus 1
indicate that the Government of Kazakhstan has provided an additional 40 minutes
for children with SEN during such tests, showing that progress on this issue is
already underway. Further adjustments could be made to adapt testing materials, for
instance for children who cannot see the text. Once those adjustments have been
made, the government should provide information for parents of children with SEN to
inform them of their rights during the test and motivate them to pursue the EHT,
which is a key pathway into college and university education.
5.3 Recommendations for the future use of SML in evaluations
The rising volume of social media discussions presents a unique opportunity to leverage
publicly available Big Data sources of information in a variety of evaluation contexts. At the
same time, this innovative approach differs from traditional survey-based evaluation
methods and carries its own set of considerations. Based on our methodological approach,
the following recommendations for future use of SML in evaluations emerged.
1. Construct EQs carefully and be conscious of what questions SML can and cannot
answer: Traditional impact evaluations using quantitative data are often concerned with
causal questions, such as estimating the causal impact of an intervention on a set of
outcomes. SML is better suited to address questions that are more descriptive in nature
and are intended to capture the perspectives of stakeholders on a specific topic of online
discussion. Examples of questions SML can answer include: 1) Landscaping: What is
the online debate in-country about a specific topic? 2) Actor analysis: What is the online
influence of the stakeholder group of interest? 3) Longitudinal study: How has the debate
on a topic changed over time?
2. Validation of data pulled from social media is key to ensuring relevance: The
process of building search queries should be iterative and based on expert discussions.
The set of keywords needs to take into account any linguistic or cultural sensitivities,
while being simple enough to ensure a sizeable corpus. Once a search query is built,
results should be analysed by experts and changed iteratively until a satisfactory level of
relevance is reached. Note that this process can often be very sensitive, as one word
can skew the analysis significantly. Thus, we recommend running multiple versions of
the search query on a particular topic.
3. Exclusion and inclusion biases must be accounted for: Depending on the evaluation
context, inequalities in access to social media can result in certain groups being
excluded from online discussions, often limiting the potential of studies using SML tools
to be representative at the national, or even regional, level. The social media coverage
in-country, as well as factors potentially limiting access, should be considered to identify
an appropriate stakeholder group whose online discussions will be analysed. Bias can
also arise from the fact that people tend to be more extreme on social media than in
person and are more likely to engage with controversial material. This further highlights
the need for expert discussions to validate the relevance of online posts.
4. External validity should be considered: Given that online discussions are not
necessarily representative of the entire population and that in some cases the number of
posts is small, the evaluation should clearly state whether the results can be
generalisable. While an online debate on a particular topic is unlikely to be a true
© Oxford Policy Management 55
representation of an actual debate in-country, it is an interesting and complementary
analysis that offers additional insights that are not captured by traditional surveys.
5. Meltwater vs self-programmed scrapers: There are advantages and disadvantages to
the use of online platforms relative to self-programmed scrapers, depending on the
stakeholder group and the EQ at hand. While SML tools such as Meltwater cover a wider
range of social media sources and allow capturing discussions of the general public,
their analytical tools can be limited, for instance the inability to download raw social
media data and carry out independent analysis. On the other hand, self-programmed
scrapers allow us to access discussions of a specific stakeholder group, such as a
Telegram chat for organisations working in the inclusive education space in Kazakhstan,
and enable us to conduct our own NLP analysis, although this needs to be written for
every social media source separately.

PART I
Purpose of Assignment Inclusive education evaluation by using Big
data source of information (descriptive
Location of Assignment aRneamlyottiec s)
Duration of contract 7 months
Start period (estimated) From: December 2022 To: 31 July 2023
Reporting to: Raushan Ibrasheva, CRM Specialist
Budget Expiry Date 31 December 2022
A.1 Objectives, Purpose & Expected Results
The purpose of the formative evaluation is to examine the public opinion (parents/
caregivers/ teachers) on to what extent the state education programmes in Kazakhstan
implemented within the period of 2011-2021 have been contributing to inclusion of children
of different levels of ability in the education system in the country as well as to examine the
enabling conditions and bottlenecks which will require further improvement. Internet public
opinion can be disseminated by e-mail, forum, blog and other means of social media
interactions. Public opinion information appears in the form of network comments, but
network comments include spam comments, subjective comments and objective comments.
The classification of these comments needs to extract the user's feelings. Subjective
comments involve a large number of user ideas, rather than subjective comments containing
incorrect opinions and lack of emotional statements. It is meaningful to get subjective
comments from a large number of online comments. This particular assignment will serve as
a good addition to the formative evaluation and provide the Government of Kazakhstan and
UNICEF with sound evidence and conclusions to inform planning the future strategies and
work in this area.
Within this framework, the evaluation will have the following specific objectives:
1. Through the analysis of the perspective of individuals, in particular parents, teachers and
youth and overall public opinion
1.1. Assess some of the immediate results and good practices of what is working, for whom,
and what is not working, from the perspective of parents and general public opinion in the
inclusive education.
1.2. Identify existing challenges, barriers and gaps in the education system and provide
strategic recommendations aimed at creating an inclusive and resilient learning environment
for every child.
1.3. develop recommendations for future strategies in sustaining results and good practices
and addressing existing challenges and barriers.
