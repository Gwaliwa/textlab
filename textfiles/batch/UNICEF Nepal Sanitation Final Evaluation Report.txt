Executive Summary
Access to water and sanitation is recognized by the United Nations as a human right;
fundamental to everyone’s health, dignity, and prosperity. In accordance with the key
priorities of Country Program Action Plan (CPAP), the main purpose of UNICEF
Nepal’s sanitation programme for 2018-2022 was to ensure people access to basic
sanitation facilities for 500,000 people. 70 percent of the target population hailed from
Madhesh Province and the rest of the target population resided in Province 1, Bagmati,
and other provinces. During the period 2018-2020, UNICEF and the Government of
Nepal reached 547,643 households that were provided access to basic sanitation
services. The number of people reached were more than 500,000 as planned in
UNICEF’s country programme for 2019-2022. The total fund utilized for achieving
access to basic sanitation facilities was US$ 2,210,000, including technical assistance
of about US$ 1,000,000. In supporting the government’s efforts to end open defecation
UNICEF’s major activities included coordination and collaboration with the WASH
stakeholders working in the districts for joint planning, facilitation, triggering, social
mobilization, monitoring and review of the sanitation status at district and palika levels.
The main purpose of the evaluation was to utilize the crafted lessons and
recommendations for more effective future plans and interventions for sustainable
ODF Nepal. Specific objectives of the evaluation were:
• To evaluate the performance of the sanitation programme in their relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability.
• To assess and compile good practices and lessons learned and to draw a
comprehensive situation overview.
• To provide practical and feasible recommendations with strategic direction towards
sustainable outcomes.
The evaluation was undertaken between April - May 2022 by CLTS Foundation Global,
based in Kolkata India and Citizen Development Solution (CDS) based in Kathmandu
Nepal.
Through the application of a valid sampling approach and covering a representative
sample, the evaluation accessed multiple and diversified data sources. The evaluation
team was composed of a gender-balanced, multi-disciplinary team of international and
national experts of core consultants and twenty-six (26) survey enumerators who were
engaged in the data gathering process. For the collection and gathering of data and
information both secondary and primary sources were explored. Using a participatory
and mixed method approach, the gender and age disaggregated multiple methods of
primary data collection were applied. The evaluation covered a total of 3,042
respondents amongst which 40 percent were Dalits, other vulnerable and
marginalized population groups. In addition to conducting a household level
Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) survey, the evaluation conducted a total of
eighty (80) qualitative data collection activities through application of Focused Group
Discussion (FGD), Key Informant Interview (KII), Semi Structured Group Interview
(SSGI), Direct Observation, Province level Validation and Lessons-Learnt session,
4
and a National-level validation session. Most data gathering activities involved a multi-
stakeholders participatory group-based approach, which not only eliminated biases
but also ensured continued validation, transparency, data authenticity, and reliability.
The methodology included analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data; gathered
from both primary and secondary sources. Triangulation was done both in quantitative
and qualitative parameters to verify opinions and ideas provided by different
stakeholder categories.
The evaluation found the project strategies and interventions were relevant to convert
OD practising communities into ODF but were inadequate in making post-ODF follow
up to address the issues that led to slippage to OD again. The elements of sustained
behaviour change were not addressed adequately. Post ODF follow-up was very
weak. Despite the lack of systematic gender mainstreaming into the programme cycle,
one of the main strengths of the programme was the active participation of women
and girls in promoting improved sanitation and hygiene services in their communities.
In terms of effectiveness, the evaluation confirms that the interventions delivered by
the project are credible in building thousands of new household toilets. The project
has successfully created desired output in creating access to basic sanitation services
for a population of 580,956. The programme also made remarkable achievements in
developing the capacity of the sector to legislate, plan, and budget for the improvement
of WASH systems, including mainstreaming disaster risk management. However, the
evaluation divulges that increased access to sanitation facilities did not produce
desired outcome of reducing the practice of OD. Although access to basic sanitation
on a larger scale was promising but drilling down to the status of toilets and their
usages revealed a more complex picture. Although 78.8 percent of households having
their toilets but 37.30 percent of those toilet pits are already filled with sludge and have
therefore been rendered useless. It was recognized that 15 percent of these
households built new latrines, but 22 percent went back to the practice of OD. Further,
69.40 percent of households having person(s) with disabilities (PWD) did not build
toilets that provide access and services to PWDs.15 percent of household toilets did
not have a drop-hole lid to cover the pit, which led to emission of foul odour and
infestation of flies. 36.8 percent of households rarely cleaned their toilets resulting in
faeces often being visible in the toilet pan and on the floor. As the JMP 2021 estimated
unimproved sanitation facilities in Nepal were 3 percent thus this percentage in the
category of unimproved latrines was greater than the national average. Percentage of
the population practicing Open Defecation were 16 which increased to 22.7 percent
during the time of this evaluation. Similarly, there was little effect on hand washing
practices at the household level. The findings revealed that 54.70 percent of
households’ (HHs) latrines did not have hand washing facilities and 44.2 percent of
the HHs had no hand washing stations alongside the toilet. While 60 percent of the
population used soap to wash hands then 40 percent had water only for hand washing.
Regarding efficiency, due to the emergence of COVID-19 the programme faced grave
difficulties in delivering interventions which were further aggravated by the non-
functional mechanism of WASH-CCs at different levels after federalization. Despite
these gigantic operational challenges, the programme has been able to achieve high
operational efficiency. With the Project Direct Investment (PDI) of US$2,210,000, the
programme was not only credited with providing 580,965 people access to basic
sanitation but also humanitarian WASH services to a population of 383,353. Further,
5
the PDI not only catalysed counterpart financial support by the federal government to
Palikas but also catalysed construction of thousands of toilets by the community
members who invested on an average of about US$100 per toilet. Unfortunately, in
terms of transformation of costs and inputs into sustained ODF outcomes, the cost-
effectiveness of the programme has diminished. However, the evaluation firmly
recognizes that the policy guides and Management Information Systems (MIS) that
have been developed and operationalized would have continued utility value in the
long term and added value to the fund invested.
The Sanitation and Hygiene Master Plan (Master Plan 2011) of the Government of
Nepal described the following indicators/criteria for an ODF area (a village, ward, and
municipality).
• There is no OD in the designated area at any given time.
• All households have access to improved sanitation facilities (toilets) with every
member of the family using it and being responsible for its repair and maintenance.
• All schools, institutions, and offices within the designated areas must have toilet
facilities.
Following the above-stated criteria, a large percentage of villages and wards achieved
ODF status during the period 2018-2019. However, those villages and wards were
unable to sustain the ODF status at a later stage. Due to several constraints such as
access to toilets, proper usage, maintenance of facilities, and sustained improved
hygiene practices, a significant proportion of the population returned to the practice of
OD. In all the ODF declared municipalities, including three Dalit communities, the
evaluation team intensively observed 19 villages and found that 15 villages failed to
retain the ODF status. Internal factors that affected the retention of ODF status are:
• Inadequate intervention towards sustaining the achievement of ODF status and
steering the progress further.
• Weak monitoring of processes and changes.
• Lack of post-ODF interventions.
• Inadequate interventions for collective behaviour change.
• Inadequate attention to address the special needs of Dalits.
• Inefficient faecal sludge disposal.
• Inadequate rolling out of the process at the Ward WASH-CCs after
federalization and addressing the legacy of WASH-CC has become weak.
• Inadequate inputs for capacity development.
Besides the emergence of COVID-19, other external factors affected the retention of
ODF status are:
• Low investment capacity of 50 percent HHs to obtain and maintain government
prescribed latrines.
• Lack of access to water in hilly regions.
• Negative impact of an unhygienic and dirty toilet in schools and other public
institutions.
• Lack of clarity in the roles and responsibilities amongst the staff of the three
tiers of government.
6
In relation to making the sanitation programme more effective and to create
sustainable ODF outcomes, the evaluation put across the following strategic lessons:
• Creation of a sustainable sanitation outcome requires an equal emphasis on
building synergistic ties between all stakeholders including the local government
and civil society etc.
• Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) strategy must focus on sanitation as a
public good.
• Inclusive and equitable sanitation demands strategizing elimination of
discrimination of caste and other vulnerable groups.
• Cost effectiveness could be enhanced by equally emphasising collective behaviour
change and sanitary hardware.
• Deliberate intervention is required to reverse the prevailing perception that
sustenance of ODF status is directly dependent on external funding.
• Communal sanitation facilities will not serve the purpose unless strategies and
mechanisms of maintenance are introduced beforehand.
• Programme designs need to explicitly include Gender Equity and Social Inclusion
(GESI), Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA).
• It is important to have a strong and systematic programme monitoring system
capable of taking corrective measures while monitoring ODF sustainability.
• Based on the principles of collective behaviour change training and capacity
building of local government / WASH CCs is essential.
• To promote ownership within the local government/municipalities it is essential to
allocate a dedicated budget.
• Existing human resource at the relevant government departments and local
government is extremely inadequate to facilitate the Participatory Assessment
Planning Implementation and Review (PAPIR) process with the communities. For
collective behaviour change and community empowerment, it is essential to
engage local NGOs as partners for Palikas.
Based on the findings and lessons stated earlier the evaluation recommends the
following for the future programme to be more effective:
• Training and Capacity Building at all levels need to be based on the principles
of collective behaviour change process which does not exclude the outsiders.
• Addressing sociocultural variations through Institutionalizing Participatory
Assessment, Planning, Implementation and Review (PAPIR) process at the
villages/wards as the way forward.
• Ensure dedicated budget allocation, action plan and ownership of local
government to sustain the already achieved ODF status in Nepal by 2030.
• Encourage local NGOs, CSOs, Users Committees, Cooperatives, and
Women’s Self-Help Groups etc. to get involved as equal partners in addressing
the human resource needs of Municipal WASH- CCs.
• Intensify interventions through formulation of well-defined strategies for
maintenance of sanitation facilities and usage.
• Adopt a clear and systematic mechanisms for sustaining and managing the
sanitation services safely
• Apply the policy of positive discrimination for gender and inclusion
7
• Systematize programme monitoring.
The evaluation team concludes; most communities, wards, and municipalities in the
programme- focused districts achieved ODF status in 2019, could not retain the status
as they slipped back to the practice of OD. The key lesson learnt is that “an external
agency-led social movement coupled with free/ subsidised sanitation hardware supply
driven approach could be successful in achieving ODF status temporarily but may not
necessarily retain the same without a collective behaviour change ingrained amongst
the local communities”. The local communities must learn the essential need to stay
away from the practice of open defecation forever. For many reasons, as explained,
sustaining the improved hygiene behaviour change among members of the community
depends on prevailing conditions, including the well-being of the entire community.
Inability to cope with time and move up along the sanitation ladder in time needs
individual household investment or support from the government/external agencies.
This is more relevant for the poor families living in remote areas. It appears that it
would be extremely difficult to achieve sustainable ODF status without empowering
the communities in collective action-reflection, along with taking action to improve their
sanitation status within their communities. This requires a shift in the role of WASH-
CCs from implementers to facilitators, working to empower communities to improve
their sanitation and realize the right to live in an ODF environment.

Glossary
Leave no one behind (LNOB): is a concept that is grounded on inclusive and rights-
based development and is embedded in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Leave No One Behind prioritizes “putting the last first”, i.e., the most disadvantaged,
most underserved, most left behind. The definition of who is “left behind” in society is
left to be defined according to the context (Gender Equality and Social Inclusion
Strategy of the Health Sector, 2018).
ODF: means Open Defecation Free, whereby no faeces are openly exposed to the
environment/air (Sanitation and Hygiene Master Plan, GoN, 2011).
Total Sanitation: is a range of facilities and hygiene behaviours that lead to the
establishment of a sanitized condition in any designated area. The first significant step
toward ending Open Defecation is an entry point of making efforts to change
behaviour. The next steps include all the arrangements leading up to sustainable
hygiene and sanitation behaviours (Sanitation and Hygiene Master Plan, GoN, 2011).
Improved Sanitation Facilities (Toilet): according to the Joint Monitoring
Programme (JMP) of UNICEF and WHO, an improved sanitation facility is defined as
one that hygienically separates human excreta from human contact (Sanitation and
Hygiene Master Plan, GoN, 2011).
Stakeholders: all the members of the National Sanitation and Hygiene Steering and
Coordination Committee (NSHSC, NSHCC), as well as the provincial, district,
municipal level WASH coordination committees, local government bodies, schools,
child clubs, user committees, and any other agencies that play a role in water and
sanitation promotion (Evaluation team, Evaluation of Sanitation Programme Outcome
Nepal, 2022).
Joint Plan: a provincial and municipal level strategic plan/plan of action which the
central government, local bodies, donors, and international/non-governmental
organizations (I/NGOs) follow to promote total sanitation (Evaluation team, Evaluation
of Sanitation Programme Outcome Nepal, 2022)
Universal Sanitation Coverage: cent-percent sanitation (toilet) coverage in each
area.
Universal Access to Sanitation: all possible users have access to a toilet in any
given area.
Sustainability: refers to the ability to maintain or support a process continuously over
time.
Efficiency: refers to the peak level of performance possible when the least number of
inputs are being used to achieve the highest amount of output. Efficiency requires
14
reducing the number of unnecessary resources used to produce a given output,
including personal time and energy.
Behaviour Change Communication: is an approach to hygiene promotion that uses
an in-depth understanding of people’s behaviour to design persuasive communication
(BCC Guidelines, SNV 2016).
Behavioural determinants: are the factors that may influence whether an individual
has the opportunity, ability, and motivation to engage in each hygiene or sanitation
behaviour. Behavioural determinants can either facilitate or inhibit the behaviour of
interest among a certain population and can be internal or external (Sani-FOAM
Framework, WSP, 2009).
Motivational drivers: are strong internal thoughts and feelings that motivate
behaviour. They can be positive or negative and can stem from unmet physical,
emotional, or psychological needs (Sani-FOAM Framework, WSP, 2009).
Communication channel: is a medium through which a message is transmitted to its
intended audience, such as print media or a broadcast.
Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over the
determinants of health, and thereby improve their health. This definition is based on
the World Health Organization Ottawa Charter 1986.
Hygiene education: involves activities aimed at raising awareness and conveying
knowledge of the links between hygiene practices and health.
Hygiene promotion: is a planned approach that aims to reduce the incidence of poor
hygiene practices and conditions that pose the greatest risk to the health of children,
women, and men (WHO, Ottawa Charter, 1986).
Inclusive Governance: governance is inclusive when it effectively serves and
engages all people; takes into account gender and other facets of personal identity;
and when institutions, policies, processes, and services are accessible, accountable,
and responsive to all members of society.
Person with disability refers to persons with physiological, intellectual,
psychological, or sensory impairment and functional limitations which constrain their
full and effective participation in society on equal terms with non-disabled people
(GESI Strategy of the Health Sector, GoN, 2018).
Disability: is the exclusion of people with impairments, due to social and
environmental discrimination that acts as a barrier to their participation (GESI Strategy
of the Health Sector, GoN, 2018).
15
Disabled-friendly services refer to the provision of facilities and support to enable
people with disabilities to use services on an equal basis as those without disabilities.
This may include the provision or adaptation of infrastructure so that it is accessible to
people who are physically disabled such as ramps, lifts, specially designed toilets, and
the provision of assistive devices such as wheelchairs. It may also include the
provision of transportation or waiver of fees in recognition of the physical and financial
barriers people with disability face in accessing health services (GESI Strategy of the
Health Sector, GoN, 2018).
LGBTQIA; Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex and Asexual
(LGBTQIA) communities are made up of diverse individuals. Communities included
within this commonly used umbrella term have distinct experiences and needs, and
different histories of collective identity and organization
(https://rainbowhealthaustralia.org.au/).
Disaster: A serious disruption in the functioning of a community or society involving
widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts, which
exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own
resources (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster)
Disaster Risk: The potential disaster losses, in lives, health status, livelihoods, assets
and services, which could occur to a particular community or a society over some
specified future time period (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster)
Gender equality and social inclusion means changing the unequal power relations
between women and men and between different social groups. It focuses on the need
for action to rebalance these power relations and ensure equal rights, opportunities,
and respect for all individuals regardless of their social identity (GESI Strategy of the
Health Sector, GoN, 2018).
Equality: refers to the provision of equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities to
all as recognised by the Constitution. The pursuit of equality by the State of Nepal
requires the adoption of policies and development of inclusive systems, institution and
programmes that enable disadvantaged populations to exercise their rights,
responsibilities, and opportunities (GESI Strategy of the Health Sector, GoN, 2018).
Equity: is an ethical principle related to human rights. Health equity means that people
are not disadvantaged from attaining their full health potential because of social
constructs such as gender, socioeconomic status, religion, caste/ethnicity or location
(GESI Strategy of the Health Sector, GoN, 2018).
Social inclusion: is a process that ensures that those at risk of poverty and social
exclusion gain the opportunities and resources they need to participate fully in
economic, social, and cultural life and to enjoy a standard of living and well-being that
is considered normal in the society in which they live. It ensures that such populations
16
participate in decision making on matters that affect them and achieve access to
resources, opportunities and services to enjoy their fundamental rights (GESI Strategy
of the Health Sector, GoN, 2018).
Gender equality and social inclusion mainstreaming is the process whereby
barriers and issues faced by women, poor, and excluded people are identified and
addressed in all functional areas of the health system: policies, institutional systems,
work environment and culture, programme and budget formulation, service delivery,
monitoring and evaluation, and research. It also involves evaluation of the institutional
capacity to mainstream GESI, and the responsiveness and work environment of health
agencies to be gender equal and socially inclusive. Evaluation is necessary to inform
continuous improvement and bolster ownership and commitment to GESI (GESI
Strategy of the Health Sector, GoN, 2018).
GESI-responsive policy and programme: refers to policy and/or programmes that
are designed to be sensitive to and address the determinants of gender inequality and
social exclusion. GESI responsive policies and programmes include an assessment
and analysis of GESI in their formulation and implementation, the inclusion and
participation of women, the poor, and excluded people in each stage of development
and implementation and ensure that the outputs and results of the policy and
programme measure and aim to benefit target groups.
Community Led Total Sanitation: is an innovative methodology for mobilizing
communities to completely eliminate open defecation (OD). Communities are
facilitated to conduct their own appraisal and analysis of open defecation (OD) and
take their own action to become open defecation free
(communityledtotalsanitation.org).
School Led Total Sanitation (SLTS): The school led total sanitation is an approach
that emphasizes the complete elimination of open defecation from the catchments of
the schools as a pre-requisite for improving hygiene and sanitation (Adhikari,K. School
Led Total Sanitation: Principles and Practices, 2010).

1. Object of the Evaluation
Often perceived as a Himalayan gateway, Nepal is a landlocked country with diverse
ecology and culture. According to the 2021 Nepal Census1 the country has a
population of 29,192,480 people organized into 5,643,945 households and 6,761,059
families. Nepal is home to 125 ethnic groups, which historically had uneven access to
basic services, resources, and opportunities2. Nepal aspires to graduate from least
developed country status to developing country status by 2022 and as per UNDP
further to a middle-income country from 20263. Even though Nepal has made
significant progress in decreasing poverty, two-thirds of all children are still deprived
of at least one of the seven basic needs. The Nepal Human Development Report
(2022)4 states, Nepal's Human Development Index value for 2021 is 0.602 — which
put the country in the Medium human development category, positioning it at 143 out
of 191 countries and territories. In addition, there are significant disparities within the
country in terms of wealth, region, language, education, caste, ethnicity, gender, age,
disability, and income. The Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI5) 2021 report states
that 17.4 percent of Nepal’s population is yet to overcome poverty. Across provinces,
Karnali Province has the highest MPI (39.5 percent of people) followed by 25.3 percent
in Sudarpashchim Province, and 24.2 percent in Madhesh Province. Nepal has a more
than 20% socially- and economically marginalized Dalit6 population who for
generations have been treated as untouchables and excluded from many spheres of
social life. Furthermore, the MPI 2021 shows that nearly 3.2 percent of the population
lives in households where at least one of its members has a disability and is usually
excluded from access to sanitation. Although detailed data is yet to come there is a
,
rough estimate that 900,0007 people in the LGBTQIA community are living in the
country and are also excluded from many spheres of social life including access to
sanitation.
Although Nepal has made significant progress, in addressing challenges but there is
substantial room for improvement across the spectrum of children’s rights, including
addressing disparities in levels of achievement and access to resources. In 2017,

Nepal moved from a unitary to a federal system. This has resulted in three tiers of
government at the federal, provincial, and local levels and many government functions
related to children are yet to be developed at the local and provincial levels. The new
governance structure presents opportunities for public actions to improve the situation
of children in response to their local situation. For this, substantial efforts are needed
to formulate relevant policies and systems, and to strengthen capacities at different
levels.
Sanitation is important, and is also necessary for health, nutrition, education, tourism,
and the holistic development of children. Sanitation is one of the most important
aspects of community well-being because it protects human health, extends life spans,
and is documented to provide benefits to the economy. Although Nepal has made
significant progress in its sanitation situation over the last few decades, the JMP
(2021) estimates that 77 percent of the population has access to at least basic
sanitation; 11 percent has access to limited/shared facilities; and 10 percent
population is without sanitation facilities8. Children, women, and socially marginalized
lower caste communities are particularly affected by poor sanitation, as are those in
the LGBTQIA community and persons with disabilities (PWDs). As stated in the
UNICEF Nepal website, 20 percent of the government schools lack improved water
and sanitation facilities, with an additional 19 percent lacking separate toilets for girls
and boys and menstrual hygiene management facilities. Sanitation in government
offices and public institutions also deserves attention. Nepal’s socio-culturally
implanted, and deeply rooted caste-stratified power structure dictates a crucial need
for a sanitation approach that weaves in appropriate strategies to ensure active
inclusion and participation of historically marginalized Dalits and other vulnerable
groups.
In Nepal, sanitation promotion formally started after the commencement of the
International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade (1981-1990).9, Later, National
Sanitation Policy 1994 expanded the scope of sanitation, not only for the construction
of toilets but also for promotion of sanitation and hygiene and for the improvement of
public health. The School Sanitation and Hygiene Education Programme and National
Sanitation Awareness Campaign have been promoted in Nepal since 2000. Since
2000, with the support of UNICEF, Nepal has been implementing the School
Sanitation and Hygiene Education (SSHE) programme. The SSHE programme was
designed to promote water supply and sanitation facilities in schools, to transform
student behaviour through raising awareness, and to promote community sanitation
through child club mobilization. During the period 2003-2004, Nepal applied the
Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS)10 approach. However, before the

systematization and scaling up of the CLTS approach beginning in 2005, Nepal
conceptualized and started to apply the School Led Total Sanitation (SLTS)11
Approach. The basic assumption of the SLTS approach was that schools could act as
an entry point for sanitation improvement in the communities if it is triggered and
facilitated. Students of a triggered and ODF school worked as agents for changing
their catchment VDCs to ODF. The SLTS approach was developed by combining
elements of the SSHE programme and CLTS triggering tools. Despite severe
inequalities12 regarding school and education access among Dalit children, SLTS was
applied as one of the predominant approaches in Nepal.
With the worldwide celebration of the International Year of Sanitation (IYS) 2008, the
promotion of the sanitation program gained new energy and momentum in Nepal as
well. The Government of Nepal (GoN) formulated and implemented the Nepal Country
Plan for IYS 2008 and put sanitation and hygiene at the forefront of its development
agenda. In the same year, formulation of a master plan was initiated and the Sanitation
and Hygiene Master Plan (SHMP) 201113 came into being. The central focus of this
master plan was to ensure Open Defecation Free (ODF) status with universal access
to toilets in both urban and rural areas in Nepal using the total sanitation approach. It
provided the following strategic direction:
• Empower local bodies to lead participatory planning processes,
implementation, and monitoring of hygiene and sanitation programme.
• Apply gender-sensitive participatory approaches to sanitation improvement
intervention.
• Intensify hygiene and sanitation promotion initiatives.
• Establish well-coordinated participatory and coherent programs, planning and
implementation systems for multi-stakeholders.
SHMP 2011 adopted the “one household-one toilet” sanitation campaign model with
the goal of making Nepal an ODF country. An inter-sector participatory structure of
coordinated implementation was created from the central to the local levels. WASH
Coordination Committees (WASH-CCs) were formed at each tier with the participation
of relevant stakeholders including NGOs, CSOs, and private organizations. With the
objective if attaining total sanitation through ODF, the Total Sanitation Model Village
Promotion Programme was formulated and implemented in 2012. The new
Constitution14 of Nepal (2015) acknowledged sanitation as a fundamental right.
Nepal’s Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Sector Development Plan (2016-2030)15 has
the goal of achieving prosperity through development of the Water, Sanitation and
Hygiene (WASH) sector. Similarly, a Total Sanitation Guideline was formulated and
implemented in 2017 to sustainably maintain ODF status. Suggested strategies of the
SHMP-2011 with a huge leap of investment and support from UNICEF accelerated an
approach called Sanitation Social Movement (SSM)16, which had already been

launched by the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage Management (DWSSM)
and UNICEF in 2015. Under the leadership of local government institutions, thousands
of WWASH CC members from the districts and municipalities (including police and
military) actively engaged in SSM to create community motivation and mobilization to
build and use individual household toilets. For this purpose, partnerships from various
organizations, such as local government institutions, development partners, various
sectoral stakeholders, students, teachers, media personnel, civil society, and private
entrepreneurs were mobilized. Besides intensifying message dissemination and
raising awareness, material incentives were provided to marginalized households for
the construction of improved toilets as prescribed by the government. SSM were
tremendous in fostering construction and use of toilets in cent-percent households and
working to reduce open defecation practices. On 30 September 2019, the Government
of Nepal declared the Country ODF with the assumption that all districts and local
governments had declared ODF based on the following ODF criteria described in the
SHMP 2011:
• There is no open defecation in Nepal at any given time.
• All households have access to improved sanitation facilities (toilets) which are
being used by all members of the family. The operation and maintenance of the
toilet is also managed by the respective families and a high standard of
sanitation is ensured.
• All the institutions, including schools and offices, should have toilet facilities.
Anchored on the National Sanitation and Hygiene Master Plan (2011) the key priorities
of UNICEF Nepal in the Country Programme Action Plan for 2018-2022, include
ending open defecation and ensuring equal access to basic sanitation for all children.
The main goal of the UNICEF country programme for Nepal for the period of 2018-
2022 is to provide 500,000 people with access to basic sanitation facilities. 70 percent
of the 500,000 people live in Madhesh Province and the rest of the target population
reside in Province 1 and Bagmati.
According to government data, Nepal had 95.4 percent sanitation coverage at the end
of 2017, while 45 districts had still not declared themselves to be open defecation free
(ODF). Out of UNICEF’s ten priority districts, all the eight in Madhesh Province, Mugu,
and Kapilvastu had not been declared ODF. UNICEF provided technical and financial
support to the government of Nepal through the treasury and a direct funding modality
for 10 more districts in Madhesh Province: Jhapa, Morang, Sunsari, Ramechhap,
Dolakha, Kavre, Kathmandu, Dhading, Nuwakot, and Kailali.
The findings of the UNICEF survey conducted in 2018 showed that basic sanitation
coverage in Madhesh Province was at 51 percent and limited sanitation coverage was
at 2 percent. According to government data, access to sanitation was at 86.5 percent
in Madhesh Province at the end of 2017. Another study conducted by the National
23
Sanitation and Hygiene Coordination Committee in 2017, covering 7 districts of Nepal,
including one affected by the Gorkha earthquake (Bhaktapur), found that 96.5 percent
of the households used toilets. Out of this, 87.4 percent used improved and not shared
(basic) toilets and 9 percent used shared toilets. 3.5 percent were still practicing open
defecation.
According to the 2019 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) carried out by the
Central Bureau of Statistics with support from UNICEF, 94.5 percent of the population
had access to improved sanitation facilities while nearly 80 percent of the households
had access to basic sanitation (improved toilet, not shared); 15 percent used shared
toilets; and 5 percent practiced open defecation. In Madhesh Province, the proportion
of the population using toilets was 84 percent (73 percent using at least basic
sanitation) and 16 percent were practicing open defecation. 11 percent of the
population were using shared toilets while 27 percent were yet to build household
toilets as a means to achieving basic sanitation access.
Major activities by UNICEF supported government efforts to end open defecation. This
includes coordination and collaboration with WASH stakeholders working in the
districts to accomplish joint planning, facilitation, triggering, social mobilization,
monitoring, and review of the sanitation status at both district and palika levels.
UNICEF also supported the government in reaching the poorest households, providing
easy latrines through sanitation marketing, and mobilizing youth to support
construction of toilets for households. This also includes monitoring and follow up with
households on the usage of toilets.
During the period from 2018 to 2020, UNICEF and the Government of Nepal reached
a population of 547,643 who were being provided with access to basic sanitation
services. The number of people covered was more than 500,000 as planned in the
UNICEF country programme for 2020-2022. The total fund utilized for achieving
access to basic sanitation facilities is US$ 2,210,000, including technical assistance
of about US$ 1,000,000. In addition, some households built their own toilets and
contributed an average of US$ 100 per household.
The summary results framework of the WASH component presented as the Nepal
Country Programme Action Plan (CPAP), 2018-2022 (page 54) has been synthesized
in the following logical framework to convey the Theory of Change (ToC) that was
undertaken in the programme.

The programme applied the following intervention strategies and inputs to get the
desired outcome:
• Facilitating multi-stakeholders (Gov-NGO-CSO) partnership and joint planning
at federal, province, district, and municipal levels.
• Capacity building of all actors engaged in the programme,
• Facilitating triggering, mobilizing, and engaging different stakeholders such as
CSOs, local networks, journalists, youth group, etc.
• Direct monitoring and review of programme by UNICEF staff.
• Fostering access to latrines through sanitation marketing.
27
The ‘change path’ of the programme was conceptualized with the following
assumptions:
• If open defecation practices are stopped, then children and their families would
be able to have improved and equitable access to safe and sustainable
sanitation services, improved hygiene practices, and ensured usage. The direct
target for input delivery is not the children but their families and institutions (i.e.
schools, public places, and offices). If all adult members of the family and
institutions change, it will impact the well-being of the children in terms of health,
education, and other related aspects.
• Open defecation practices can be stopped/reduced AND sanitation and
hygiene behaviour practices of community members and institutions can be
improved substantially if:
❖ Sector-stakeholder capacity to provide increased access to safe and
sustainable sanitation and hygiene facilities at homes and institutions is
augmented.
❖ National legislation policy encourages and provides an enabling
environment for systematic multi-stakeholder partnerships, planning, and
implementation processes at both the central and local levels.
❖ Federal, provincial, and district administrations are systematically
empowered to decide and act on improving sanitation based on the local
context.
❖ Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction is systematically integrated
within the sanitation programme.
❖ Deliberate efforts are made for inclusion of vulnerable groups, including
LGBTQIA.
❖ Participatory sanitation planning, implementation and review process is
facilitated by multi-stakeholders.

2. Purpose and Objectives of the Evaluation
The purpose of the evaluation was to contribute to the enhancement of UNICEF
sanitation programmes in Nepal. The ToR stated, “the evaluation will deliver
comprehensive analysis, also reviewing lessons learned to help in foresight planning
and designing interventions for sustainable ODF Nepal”. The specific objectives of the
evaluation were to:
• Evaluate the performance of the sanitation programmes in their relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability.
• Assess and compile good practices and lessons learned and draw a
comprehensive situation overview.
• Provide practical and feasible recommendations that guide strategic direction
towards sustainable outcomes.
In accordance with the goals stated above, criteria for the assessments assigned were
relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability in which gender inclusion was
a cross-cutting criteria.
Figure 2: Assessment criteria of the evaluation
Criteria-specific key evaluation questions were:
Relevance: the extent to which the sanitation programme met the needs of children,
women, and their families; the most vulnerable and marginalized groups including
persons with disabilities.
• To what extent did the sanitation programme meet the needs of children,
women and their families, persons with disabilities, and others in the most
vulnerable and marginalized groups during the period 2018 - 2020?
• To what extent did the sanitation programme interventions address the
sanitation needs of the population in their households and local public spaces?
29
Effectiveness: the extent to which the sanitation programme achieved its intended
results.
• To what extent did the sanitation programme achieve its intended results and
how did it contribute to reducing open defecation in the target areas?
Efficiency: the extent to which inputs allocated for the programme contributed to
achieving the planned outcomes.
• To what extent did the inputs and monitoring of the sanitation programme
contribute to achieving the planned outcomes in a timely and cost-efficient
manner?
• Were the financial and human resources of the programme sufficient for
implementing the planned activities?
Sustainability: the extent to which the targeted locations under the sanitation
programme are capable of remaining ODF.
• To what extent are the targeted locations under the sanitation programme
remaining ODF after implementation?
• What internal and external factors can affect the sustainability of the sanitation
programme?
• The evaluation of programme sustainability will also involve experts who will
assess sanitation facilities, and check standards and quality in the target
locations. The exercise will involve assessment of durability, quality, and the
likelihood of sustainably maintaining the facilities by users over the long term.
Gender and inclusion: To what extent are gender and inclusion issues being
mainstreamed in the programme?
• Has the programme integrated gender and inclusion aspects in each step of
the programme management?
The evaluation covered the UNICEF sanitation programmes during the period 2018-
2022. The major focus of the evaluation was on 8 districts of Madhesh Province, where
UNICEF interventions benefitted more than two-thirds of the target population. Mugu
in Karnali Province, Kapilavastu in Lumbini Province, Kavre in Bagmati Province, and
Kailali Sudurpashchim Province were also part of the evaluation.

The following set of principles were applied to carry out the assessment:
Appropriate methods and tools must be participatory, gender inclusive, and
responsive. In order to facilitate simultaneous learning, the evaluation applied a
participatory evaluation approach. Although the type of participation varied at different
levels depending on the methods and tools used to elicit data, the overall spirit of
evaluation was mainly participatory in nature. Furthermore, primary data collection and
consolidation was done in a disaggregated manner looking into age, sex, and special
vulnerability groups. The spirit was to learn how to improve the quality and
effectiveness of future programmes that have a similar nature.
Mixed method: The methodology included analysis of both quantitative and qualitative
data that had been gathered from both primary and secondary sources.
Triangulation: The evaluation accessed multiple and diversified data sources. A
gender-balanced, multi-disciplinary team of core consultants, plus twenty-six (26)
survey enumerators, were engaged in the data gathering process. Data was collected
through the application of various methods and tools. In the analysis and findings,
triangulation was done to verify opinions and ideas provided by different stakeholder
categories, both in quantitative and qualitative parameters.
In order to ensure objectivity, adherence to evaluation criteria/questions through desk
review of project documents the evaluation design proceeded through the preparation
of evaluation framework (Annex 1), using the following template:

regional geographic characteristics. Parameters for selection consideration were:
• Programme coverage and types of interventions provided.
• Geographic and settlement character urban vs. rural.
• Population size.
• Sanitation coverage, percentage of HH with toilet and without toilet.
• OD and ODF status.
• Types of support provided by UNICEF.
• Socio-economic and cultural context.

For the primary data collection, the evaluation covered a total of 12
municipalities/palika, among which 6 were rural and 6 were urban. In addition to
visiting and observation at 8 schools, the evaluation covered a total of 18 urban and
18 rural wards.
In order to gain perspectives, ideas, and opinions from those in disaggregated groups
based on gender or other vulnerabilities, the application of multiple methods for
primary data collection included 1,863 male; 1,031 female; 23 LGBTQAI; 34 boys; and
91 girls. The evaluation covered a total of 3,042 respondents.
With a focus on the lowest rung of caste groups, a total of 1,601 respondents in the
study were Dalits or other vulnerable and marginalized people. This comprised about
40 percent of the total respondents in the study.

Sampling and coverage of household by KAP survey: For determination of sample
size for the Household KAP Survey, EPITOOLS software
(URL: https://epitools.ausvet.com.au/oneproportion)
was utilized and the following calculation formula was applied:
n = (Z2 x P x (1 - P))/e2
Where Z = value from standard normal distribution corresponding to desired
confidence level (Z=1.96 for 95% CI); P is the expected true proportion; and e is the
desired precision (0.05).
Using the formula above, a total of 2,430 households was determined to be the
scientific sample size.

In each of the sample districts, two strata were formed from the latest urban-rural
definition (Municipality and Rural Municipality) and samples were independently
obtained. The sample size of each stratum was calculated using the power allocation
with a power value of 0.2 using the following formula:

A two-stage sampling strategy was applied. In the first stage, wards from districts were
selected using the Systematic Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) method. In the
37
listing operation, the age and gender of each household member aged 18 years and
above was collected. Individuals then became the Secondary Sampling Units (SSUs).
Big Primary Sampling Unit (PSU) was split into segments containing approximately
300 households starting from the northeast corner block.
After the listing was complete, frames were prepared: an adult male, an adult female,
and 25- 25 persons were selected from each group, respectively, using systematic
sampling after sorting the frame according to age ascending order. In order to exclude
more than one respondent per HH, sampling intervals calculated using the following
formula for selecting the respondent:
1) The following formula was used for each category calculation:
38
S a m p l i n g I n t e r v a l ( S I ) =
N
n
here N= number of persons listed in the category and n= number of units to be
sampled (25)
2) We rounded the number obtained in (1) down to get the random start using a
table of random numbers. This is the first sample unit.
3) To obtain the subsequent samples the following formula was used:
S a m p l e i = R o u n d e d v a l u e o f ( r a n d o m s t a r t + ( i - 1 )  S I )
For this purpose, a table of random numbers was used to obtain the random start. To
do the sampling, an excel worksheet was provided for the survey enumerators who
were equipped with hands-on training and orientation.
Consisting of women and men in each household the survey successfully covered a
total of 2,468 households. Sample province, district, municipally and ward wise
coverage of samples households by number by percent is presented below in table 9.

Sampling for qualitative data: The theory of saturation and the grounded theory
approach were applied for respondents of the qualitative study (KII, FGD, and SSGI).
Applying a purposive sampling approach, a total of 29 key informants were interviewed
at the federal, provincial, and district levels. As stated in Tables 1, 2, and 3 these
included a number of urban and rural locations. A total of 35 FGDs and SSGIs were
conducted covering a total of 545 respondents, applying a gender- and age-stratified
random sampling approach in purposively selected municipalities.
For the collection and gathering of data and information both secondary and primary
sources were explored. Secondary data and information were extracted through in-
depth reviews of both project documents and relevant literature. A list of the
documents reviewed can be found in Annex 3.

Household Sanitation KAP17 survey: The KAP survey method was applied to generate
and collect demographic profile, gender, and age disaggregated qualitative and
quantitative data on awareness, behaviours, and perceptions surrounding sanitation.
For efficient data collection of comprehensive information the survey included multiple-
choice questions in addition to open-ended ones. It also added a household roster to
gather demographic information to analyse the data through the equity lenses.
Focus Group Discussion (FGD): Consulted in randomly selected wards/villages in
sample municipalities. In order to generate gender-, age-, and vulnerable group-
specific ideas and opinions, FGDs were conducted separately with men, women,
boys, girls, and members of the LGBTQIA community.
Key Informant Interview (KII): Senior NGO staff engaged with sanitation workers,
senior citizens, PWDS in villages, and teachers in schools together with key staff
members of relevant government departments at the national, provincial, district, and
municipal levels.
Semi Structured Group Interview (SSGI): Conducted with WASH Coordination
Committee (WCC) at districts and municipalities.
Direct Observation: Direct observation included household toilets, communal toilets,
sanitation, and hand washing facilities at schools, government offices, open defecation
sites, water testing labs, tube wells and wastewater drainage, flood resilient tube wells,
ponds used for both bathing and cleansing. Based on structures, guide the survey
enumerators conducted observation and physical verification of a total of 2,323
household latrines. As part of the qualitative data gathering activities, evaluation team
members visited about 100 households and 5 communal latrines. Two other Municipal
WASH Plans were also observed.
Province level validation and Lessons learnt session: Consultation in Madhesh
Province was done with the provincial WASH coordination committee, chaired by the
Chief Secretary of the province. During the session, the evaluation team shared its
preliminary observations and findings (on evaluation criteria) about the province, the
soliciting of participant feedback, and lessons learned. The validation workshop
uncovered the key gaps, which were shared by the evaluation team in relation to
inclusive WASH facilities, mobilization of WASH-CCs, and OD practices.
National-level validation session: On 27 June 2022, a national-level validation session
was conducted in participation with national WASH-CCs and key programme staff at
UNICEF Nepal. In this session, the evaluation team shared its observations and
findings (on the evaluation criteria) on the evaluation, the soliciting of participant
feedback, and lessons learned.
In addition to conducting quantitative data generation through the HH-KAP survey, as
presented in the following Table 10, the evaluation also conducted a total of eighty

All data quality control measures were adhered to, including a review of the study
tools, translation into local language, field practice oriented hands-on training for local
enumerators, review of evidence, usage of ICT tools functionality, regular supervision
of data collected from survey, etc. The administered tools were checked regularly for
correctness, completeness, and consistency.
To ensure data quality, the consultant team prepared and introduced a guide for
consolidation that was used by the evaluation team members and survey
enumerators. The survey questionnaire and observation checklist for the enumerators
were translated into the local language with codification for automated entry purposes.
All data tools were finalized after incorporating the feedback received through pre-
testing.
An equal number of male and female enumerators who had previous experience was
selected. The enumerators were provided with hands-on training on data collection (in
compliance with ethical standards of research). All evaluation team members and
enumerators participated in a 3-day hands-on residential training in which they were
thoroughly briefed on the objectives of the evaluation, importance of selecting
respondents at various levels in conformity with accuracy, completeness, and the
privacy rights of individuals. Additionally, orientation focussing on the following
important aspects was provided:
• Voluntary participation and flexibility of individuals regarding privacy rights for
participating either partially or completely in this process.
• Maintaining data confidentiality for all individuals.
• Reactions of participants by the researchers.
• Behaviour and attitude of enumerator.
Most data gathering activities involved a group-based approach by multi-stakeholders,
which not only eliminates biases but also ensures continued validation, transparency,
data authenticity, and reliability.
Furthermore, immediately after completion of data collection, all evaluation team
members participated in the Lessons-learnt Workshop where lessons and
recommendations were consolidated.
To protect the dignity, rights, and welfare of participants and respondents, the
evaluation team fully complied with the research ethics and principles, including the
National Ethical Guidelines for Health Research in Nepal, 2019. Special attention to
complying with the ethics of involving children was also adhered to.
All members of the evaluation team and survey enumerators obtained consent for their
data collection from all subject/respondent categories. Informed Consent (IC) included
a clear and simple invitation to participate, an explanation of what the subject will be
expected to do, and reasons why they are being recruited. The purpose of the
evaluation was presented in a simple, age, education, and culturally appropriate local
42
language. IC clearly stated that participation is voluntary, and subject may choose to
not respond to any or all questions and may withdraw at any time without
consequences. Children from the age group 6-16 years participated in separate FGD
sessions and IC was obtained from their guardians. The IC document was prepared
in an age- and culturally appropriate manner for them to provide written or verbal
consent. IC materials also advised subjects to keep focus group discussions (FGD)
confidential and not share with anyone outside the group. All IC materials and activities
described protocols for the safety of the subjects throughout data collection, analysis,
storage, and dissemination. Data analysis and reporting procedures ensured subject
anonymity and security.
In recruiting the study respondents, UNICEF Nepal facilitated the evaluation team by
providing information from its roster; privacy and confidentiality was maintained.
While the names of participants were recorded in conducting the KIIs and SSGIs,
‘identification of individual subject’ was always omitted in data consolidation and
reporting.
Except for a few virtual KII, most data collection activities were conducted in-person
and all COVID-19 safety protocols were strictly followed during the data gathering.
This included wearing face masks, hand sanitization, and social distancing.
It was well understood by the evaluation team that in the cultural context of Nepal,
male evaluators would not be suitable for discussions with girls and women on some
topics such as defecation, menstrual hygiene, and management practices. These
sensitive interviews and discussions were conducted only by female members of the
evaluation team.
The evaluation study did not require information relating to any illegal activities it was
applied for the selection of study subjects/respondents. Tit was thoroughly discussed
with the evaluation team members that the study samples were not at risk for issues
such as: violence, torture, abuse, kidnapping, sexual exploitation, harassment,
prostitution or pornography, female genital mutilation, reproductive or sexual issues,
sexual orientation, child, early or forced marriage suicide. Furthermore, no subject of
the study was known to be involved in slavery, including the sale and/or trafficking of
children, forced labour, servitude, forced recruitment to armed groups, war or armed
conflict, illegal activities, production or trafficking of drugs, economic exploitation, work
that would be damaging to health or safety, removal of organs for exploitation.
Although the evaluation team understood the probability and magnitude of anticipated
harm or discomfort was negligible, the following ordinarily occurring encounters had
to be anticipated for defining and applying risk mitigation strategies:
a. Persons with disabilities might have difficulties with free movement. In hilly and
mountainous terrain, elderly people and pregnant women may face difficulties
in movement and attending the FGD meeting.
b. There could be a possibility of real data suppression or instances of false
information being provided by interviewees for their own hidden interest. Such
suppression of real information might create problems in getting the true
picture. Examples of depicting a family who was better off as poor to the
43
external enumerators was a common phenomenon in many development
interventions in the past. Families who were better off tried to grab the
government donation and subsidies allocated for the poor and very poor.
c. Domination of male over female and upper caste over lower caste may prohibit
spontaneous sharing of opinions and ideas by the marginalized. Often
gatekeepers prohibit the community members from sharing their frank opinions.
These gatekeepers often come up and speak on behalf of the community
claiming that they are community representatives themselves.
d. Upcoming national election campaigns and rallies may disrupt data gathering
activities.
e. If a new episode of COVID-19 emerges, planned activities may have to be
changed/suspended.
To minimize domination of male over female participants, gender segregated FGD
sessions were conducted. In the case of domination by members of the upper caste
over lower-caste participants, evaluators had to exercise their freedom to conduct
separate interviews with respondents belonging to a lower caste.
Regarding gender, ethnicity, or other demographic characteristics for grouping of
subjects, the nature of the sanitation programme did not involve any direct conflict of
interest. The contact section of the IC document advises subjects to inform the lead
consultant by phone or email in any situation of abuse. This was not mandatory but
optional.
To ensure data security, the KAP survey data was collected using a tab-based
electronic questionnaire. Once the questionnaire was filled in, it was automatically
forwarded to the Kobo depository that had an access control mechanism so that
unauthorized access would be denied. Similarly, reports of FGDs, KIIs, as well as
notes of observations were prepared in an electronic version which was deposited in
a designated password-protected, web-based depository. Appropriate care (E-cloud
mechanism) was taken to reduce any risks due to data damage, loss or theft, fire,
flooding, or other disasters. Data files were properly archived and saved in a secure
place which included a back-up system.
The evaluation team prepared the following criteria-specific points of analysis to serve
as a guide for data analysis and development of objectives:

inclusion
To understand the achievements and shortfalls, the analysis examined achievements
and accomplishments, which were then compared with the expected outcomes of the
programme. In examining the Theory of Change processes, contextual factors, and
causality were looked at. From the perspective of a rights-based approach, the
analysis also focused on how the project intervention was able to advance the
sanitation rights of the targeted population, especially marginalized and traditionally
excluded groups.
Quantitative data was generated though household the KAP survey and exported into
the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for tabulation. Descriptive statistics
including the frequencies, median, Inter Quartile Range (IQR), percentages, and
45
proportions were used in the analysis. Wherever necessary, cross tabulations were
used to measure variations in the information among different groups of respondents.
Regarding the qualitative data compilation report and notes from KIIs, FGDs,
interviews and observations, these were synthesized through post-field consolidations
and the Lessons-learnt Workshop with the evaluation team. Each of the field teams
conducted their presentations using the consolidated FGDs, KII, and SSGI reports.
Commonalities and differences in opinions and ideas provided by the different
stakeholder categories were reviewed, and lessons/recommendations were drawn up
per assessment criteria through participatory discussions.
In order to better understand associations between categorical variables, cross
references and co-relations were solicited between the quantities data tables and
qualitative opinions/ideas gathered from the various respondent categories and
documents. Triangulation of various sets of information eventually confluenced to
determine similarities, differences, and general patterns towards drawing lessons,
recommendation, and conclusions.
National-level scope may not have been achieved: In Nepal, although Dalits and
others in lower caste populations constitute about 20 percent of the total population,
only about 40 percent of the respondents in this evaluation study came from the
disadvantaged, caste/ethnicity group sector. The findings of this evaluation are
therefore mostly relevant to the focused provinces of programme interventions; and
do not necessarily convey the national sanitation status of Nepal.
Inadequate number of targeted respondents for KII attending at the federal level:
The evaluation intended to have 10 KIIs at the federal level. Targeted key informants
were executive staff of the Ministry of Water Supply, DWSSM, Ministry of Education,
Science and Technology, Centre for Education and Human Resource Development,
Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration/Department of Local
Infrastructure, and development partners from the sanitation sector, such as UN-
Habitat, SNV, FEDWASUN, Helvetas, etc. Most of the targeted key informants (KIs)
attended the introduction meeting held at Himalaya Hotel in Kathmandu for the launch
of the data collection. Based on a proposal by the participants, it was decided that a
list of key questions would be sent to each participant by email, and they would then
revert back to the designated member of the evaluation team. However, only one
respondent worked on these questions and sent their responses. 6 KIIs were later
conducted, among which 3 were face-to-face and the other 3 were conducted online.
Instead of the 10 targeted KKIs, the evaluation team could only reach 9, including KIIs
with elderly citizens in the community.
Attendance by LGBTQIA and PWD at the FGDs in communities was low: A
separate meeting with 5 people from the LGBTQIA community at Sarlahi District was
conducted. There was no access to LGBTQIA persons at the community level FGDs
or district and municipal level SSGIs. Despite deliberate efforts to find those in this
category during the evaluation mission, only 5 people represented the LGBTQIA
community as subjects of the qualitative data collection, while 15 participated in the
46
household KAP survey. Similarly, very few persons from the PWD community came
out to attend the community-level FGDs.
Challenges faced by Team 1 for reaching Mugu: Due to unavailability of flights, not
all of the team members in the first attempt could attend. Only one evaluation expert
was actually able to fly to Mugu for the evaluation. The rest of the team, led by the
Team Leader, waited for a couple of days in Nepalgunj for the second attempt but that
flight was also unsuccessful.
No application of Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools: Although it was not
deemed essential, the evaluation team had wished to utilize some of the relevant
Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools18 for creating visual qualitative data. This,
however, was not possible due to a lack of availability of time.
Provincial-level validation and Lessons-learnt Workshops held only in Madhesh
Province: Although validation and the Lessons-learnt workshop had been planned for
all five sample provinces, it was only conducted in Madhesh Province and not any of
the other provinces. Due to a recent changeover to Federal in the unitary governance
system, most provincial WASH-CCs were in an inactive state and were yet to have
received concrete policy directives and the complete sanitation programme. The
provincial WASH-CCs had become non-functional. In this transition phase, the
evaluation team had to put in significant efforts to make the event possible in Madhesh
Province but doing the so was crucial because the four focused districts of the province
had been covered in the evaluation sample and the findings from the workshop can
be seen as representative of the province. For the other four provinces, one district
per province was covered as a sample. Thus, the evaluation team decided not to
present and validate the findings to the provincial WASH-CC of these provinces as the
gathered information from one district could not be justified as representative of any
particular province.
Inability to find and interview LGBTQIA persons living in households and
families: Although the evaluation team was able to conduct FGD with a group of
LGBTQIA persons in a district office of Blue Diamond Society, none of them were
actually living in their homes. Separated from their families, most LGBTQIA persons
live in district towns. In order to understand how LGBTQIA persons are treated within
their families with regard to sanitation services access, evaluation team members tried
their best to find rural LGBTQI persons living with families in order to discuss the
situation, but failed to find even one person.

4. Findings
The key applied approach of the programme was to make communities (Toles, Wards)
Open Defecation Free (ODF) . The programme interventions, therefore, had inclusive
targeting of all categories of people in the community, including children, women,
persons with disability (PWD), elderly, LGBTQIA persons and others in the most
vulnerable and marginalized groups.
A major period of the programme was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In order
to sustain relevance, the programme made timely modifications to some of the
interventions.
Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) intervention for safe disposal of child faeces
and hand washing was very relevant in addressing the needs of mothers and children.
In Nepal, one-fifth of the population belongs to lower castes. These groups of people
and their children are culturally alienated19. Years of cultural oppression has not only
disempowered the lower caste population but also severely lessened their self-
confidence in their ability to change the situation. The evaluation finds, in terms of
achieving sustainable ODF status, the context of the Dalit and lower caste
communities are distinctive thus, warrant integration of intervention for their
empowerment. Issues and needs for sustainable sanitation improvement stated by the
Dalit and lower caste community members noted are:
• Changing sociocultural norms in order to allow their access to and use of
communal water and sanitation facilities.
• Household land ownership (some reported landowners would not allow the
toilet to be upgraded).
• Leadership and participation in WASH governance.
• Livelihood and additional income for proper maintenance of sanitation facilities.
• Favourable policy and technical support for enabling them to empty pits of their
household toilets that have filled up and proper on-site management of sludge.
• Transforming their oppressed mind-set and raising their collective voice fin
order to realize their sanitation rights.
• Transforming the mind-set of the upper-caste population so as to stop all forms
of discrimination against the Dalit and lower-case communities.
The programme lacked deliberate intervention strategies to address the above-stated
issues of empowering Dalits and other lower caste groups.
The evaluation team randomly visited 8 schools in ODF-declared wards and villages
to observe the school sanitation situation in areas that had been given the ODF stamp.
Except for one primary school supported by UNICEF, there is a massive need even

today to improve the school sanitation situation in all of the other seven schools. In a
group discussion with the school children, the evaluation team learned that students
were not using the toilets because they are filthy and smelled bad. Instead, the
students used the back wall of the toilet area as a common urinal. Many defecated in
the open just outside the fencing of the school. Please see the plight of school toilets
(page 76) as there was a horrible smell wafting throughout the entire place. The plight
of the girl students was even more pathetic with many adolescent girls using the
doorway of the school toilet for urination and sitting on the floor when relieving
themselves. It was nearly impossible to walk inside the toilet for anything because of
the strong smell of ammonia, a terribly foul odour. In case of an emergency, the
children would go to the bush to defecate. Many adolescent girls used to go home to
relieve themselves. In the process, many never returned to school after the sanitation
break. In one such instance, at a school in Rautahat, the evaluation team observed
that not even a single toilet was in use, nor was there any drinking water or hand
washing facilities for more than 2,500 students studying at the higher secondary
school. The evaluation team randomly visited the eight schools and found that at all of
the schools they visited several needs were yet to be addressed to fulfil the criteria
necessary to attain ODF status. This does not mean that the WASH interventions in
schools had no ultimate significance – including its value to those affected. However,
the interventions were not adequate in terms of addressing the magnitude of needs to
be found. Although the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-2020 to
January 2022 caused severe periodic closures at schools in Nepal, the choice of the
three-star approach was absolutely relevant in addressing the needs of school
sanitation. Interventions to address the special needs of older persons, PWD, and
LGBTQIA persons, however, were definitely inadequate.

The picture shows 5 transgender women who responded to the team’s invitation and
participated in the meeting at Blue Diamond Society. Blue Diamond Society is an
NGO working exclusively for the LGBTQIA in the district of Saptari, in the town of
Rajbiraj. According to them, there are 6,000 people who officially identify as
LGBTQIA but there are many who have still not publicly identified as such. This is a
very high figure and needs to be ascertained in other districts of Nepal as well.
Although the social department of the municipality is supposed to maintain all
relevant data on the LGBTQIA community, there was no data available from the
municipality. It has been reported by LGBTQIA members that they have never been
invited to any meeting related to WASH. Moreover, they reported that there are no
convenient facilities in any public or private institutions and as a result, they must
resort to going to the bushes or forests to relieve themselves. This is a very strong
example of negligence against a distinctly prominent group of humans in the
municipal township society and it falls short of the UN SDG motto of “Leave No One
Behind!” No district can become ODF if 6,000 people still have to relieve themselves
in the open, simply due to lack of access to any kind of sanitation facilities. The
community also reported they have often been denied access to a male or female
public toilets and there is no exclusive toilet built for their use. There have also been
incidences where some of them were manhandled and beaten up while using the
normal toilets. As a result, they have no other choice but to relieve themselves in
the open.
Information on the performance progress shared by UNICEF Nepal mentions that
against a target of 40, the program successfully installed basic WASH services in 49
health care facilities. This intervention was also absolutely relevant and based on clear
needs.
The evaluation team found out, however, that the programme had no planned and
conscious intervention in place to address the crucial need for improving sanitation
and hygiene in government offices in the districts and municipalities. During their visits,
the evaluation team found that due to poor operation and maintenance, toilets and
sanitation facilities in most districts and municipal level offices were in a pathetic state.
The programme’s target to develop the WASH plan by integrating strategies and
activities related to climate reliance and DRR in sanitation was absolutely relevant to
sustainable sanitation outcome needs, however, it would have been better if the
planning process had been imputed by findings drawn from the systematically
conducted sanitation disaster risk assessment rather than having the evaluation put
forward strategies for integrating climate resilient sanitation in the municipal WASH
plan. Nevertheless, we’ve been informed that WASH Plan Development Guidelines
issued by the federal government have provided a focus on climate change within
WASH, and this includes sanitation. Palika WASH Plans are expected to be updated
in the medium term to integrate intervention related to climate resilient sanitation.

The evaluation firmly recognizes that it is not possible for a programme to address all
needs within a limited period of time and with a limited range of resources. However,
addressing the following needs was possible and that is what makes the programme
more relevant:
• Building toilets in homes and public spaces that are adapted to persons with
disability (PWD) and involving them in Municipal WASH-CCs to make a clear
effort to include their special needs in Municipal WASH plans.
• Building LGBTQIA-designated toilets in public places by developing community
awareness and deliberate inclusion into Municipal WASH-CCs.
• Facilitating citizen-led advocacy on land ownership for landless Dalit
households, thus encouraging them to build their own household toilets.
• Raising community awareness and technical support for onsite sludge
management; especially emptying household toilets that have filled up.
• Introduction of proper maintenance mechanisms for WASH facilities created in
the schools. We learned that UNICEF had provided caretaker training to the
support staff, but most of the schools that were visited lacked clear policies
/management guidelines, finds, and resources for proper maintenance.
• Introduction of MHM material, counselling, and changing facilities in schools.
• Capacity building of municipal WASH-CCs so they could conduct assessments,
planning, and implementation of sanitation efforts in their wards.
• Institutional triggering and follow-up toward the improvement of sanitation and
hygiene situations at government offices in districts and municipalities.
Strategies and interventions, especially community mobilization, local led approaches,
and support within the community were relevant to sustaining ODF status, yet
inadequate in making post-ODF community level interventions or addressing issues
that lead to slippage from ODF to OD20 . These are described in detail in Section 4.4
(Sustainability).

follow up action which we have been engaged. However
it is not intensive as ODF movement rarely did they get

to assess, plan, and work for the sustainability of the ODF environment. This is also
reflected in poor maintenance status of sanitation infrastructure created in schools,
public places, government offices, etc. Repair, maintenance, and cleanliness did not
seem to be anyone’s responsibility. Like the paternalism seen in the traditional
development approach, local communities expected everything from the
government/outside agencies who helped them to ensure access to sanitation for all.
What was lacking was the advanced preparation for households and institutions to be
able to maintain the infrastructure by themselves. As a result, the filthy unused facilities
are being abandoned in many institutions. It was stated earlier that except for a primary
school supported by UNICEF, all the other 7 schools visited showed their reluctance
to proper maintenance of existing sanitation facilities. Similarly, survey findings convey
that among 37.3 percent of household latrine pits ended up filled in; and 14.5 percent
were either deluged, new toilets were built, and the rest were abandoned. Opinions
gathered though discussions and interviews with households, schools, and
52
government offices in districts and municipalities convey that everything including
post-construction repair and maintenance was expected to be the government’s job.
No systematic arrangements were made to prepare local communities to receive
sanitation infrastructure and successfully maintain it for their own use. While this did
not happen, sanitation infrastructure created with the good intention of ensuring
access to safe sanitation turned out to be a potential source of spreading foul odours
– an unhygienic, unpleasant example of a failed government initiative. In a truly
community-led programme, that is community planned and managed, the ODF
monitoring and maintenance mechanism develops naturally. This monitoring structure
may or may not follow the same style and system of monitoring as is seen in externally
planned monitoring systems. A community-managed monitoring system will have its
own uniqueness which is often innovative in the local context. The monitoring and
supervision committees that are formed by the community are often much more
diverse and non-conventional in nature. For instance, a young housewife may lead
the entire monitoring mechanism in which there could be aged, experienced, and
powerful men who generally dominate any such village-level initiative. This is a distinct
variation from the traditional mechanism whereby control of power is in the hands of
older men. However, when monitored by the community, very peculiar and unforeseen
indicators might emerge which can often surprise us. Another important gap relating
to the relevance of the programme was lack of appropriate intervention strategies for
addressing the needs of cross-border issues. The programme had inclusive targets
for all categories of people (children, women, PWD, the elderly, LGBTQIA, and those
from the most vulnerable and marginalized groups), it overlooked a peculiar and
location specific cross-border issue near the Indo-Nepal border which was unique. For
example: OD practice was found along the international border in the Terai regions.
Friends and relatives of many families live on both sides of the border between Nepal
and India along Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (UP) who has strong family relationship living
in both sides of the border. Cross border migration (both short- and long-term)
between the families is very common during marriages, festivals, and family
gatherings. Crossing over to Nepal or India in the Terai belt is not only very common
but in many places they share the same property, including croplands, orchards, and
livestock grazing areas. There is no fencing or strict border security to prevent such
movement because of the good political relationship between the two countries and
ethnic and linguistic similarities between the people on both sides. It is very common
for these people to visit the neighbouring country in the morning and return home in
the evening with harvested grass, tree branches, and leaves for feeding livestock or
working as labour for wage earning. In such a scenario, when ODF in many Nepali
villages along the border, the practice of OD was still common on the Indian side of
the international border. There had been many incidences of conflict when community
members in Nepali villages chased people who were visiting their families and
relatives on the Nepal side because they were practicing open defecation on Nepali
fields. Without asking for a toilet facility the visiting relatives used to go to the field to
53
relieve themselves in the morning. This practice was not only stopped among locals,
but ODF communities would not allow anyone else to defecate in the open either.
Such small conflicts along the Indo-Nepal border even reached officials in the local
Nepali government, previously called VDCs now wards. Official requests were made
by the local government authorities of Nepal to the panchayats in the Indian sides to
convince their people to discourage them from practicing OD while visiting their
relatives in the ODF villages of Nepal. In fact, the practice of OD was still common in
the villages of Bihar and UP along the Nepal border when such practice was
completely prohibited in the villages of Nepal. This, of course, influenced some
households on the Indian side to construct toilets and stop the practice of OD. Since
the availability of work on the Indian side of the border is greater, landless people not
only from Terai but also from the mountain regions, come for work during the lean
agricultural season. Poor people also visit to collect food like mushrooms, seeds, and
to catch fish, etc.
The ToR-assigned key evaluation question was “to what extent did the sanitation
programme achieve the intended results and how did it contribute to reducing open
defecation in the target areas?”
The evaluation team did not visit any health care facilities and cannot, therefore,
actually judge what the effects created were. With regards to attainment of other output
indicators the evaluation team begins with the following brief overview of progress:
• Improving access to basic sanitation services at the household level was
satisfactory.
• Prevalence of hand washing behaviour-change programmes was satisfactory.
• Achieving school sanitation services at the three-star standard was medium
satisfactory.
• Local government with WASH Plans was highly satisfactory.
• Developing policy guidelines for improving WASH governance was satisfactory.
On one hand, the project has been successful in building thousands of new household
toilets but on the other hand, a greater number of previously built toilets have become
unusable. This has caused a portion of the population to slip back to OD practices.
We also noted that proper maintenance of sanitation facilities by a certain percent of
households is lacking and that toilet sludge is being disposed of in open spaces.
Access to basic sanitation services at the household level: In terms of creating
access to basic sanitation services, the programme has been satisfactory because by
the end of 2021, against a target of 500,000, the programme made a significant
achievement by providing access to safe sanitation services for 580,965 people.
However, household survey findings show that there are differences in the use of
latrines for defecation among various age groups of population. Figure 7 shows that
54
only 2.6 percent of the population within the age group below 20 years old use latrines
for defecation. The highest percentage (23.1 to 27.7) of population groups use latrines
is within the age group 20-49. The percentage for population using latrine for
defecation again declines starting from the age 50, with only 8.4 percent of the 60+
population use latrine.

Further, there are also gender differences in the use of latrine. Figure 8 reveals that in
terms of gender categories percentage of population do not use latrine for defecation

Information drawn out from the household survey convey that during the time of
evaluation: an average of 21.3 percent and 22.7 percent of households in Madhesh

Sudurpaschim District, (Kailali Province); 18.5 percent in Kavre District (Bagmati

the evaluation clearly identified that while at the baseline23 41.6 percent households
in Madhesh Province had no toilets, project interventions were able to reduce this to
22.7 percent. This finding is supported by another UNICEF-commissioned End Line

The evaluation confirms that the interventions that were delivered by the project are
absolutely credible in increasing access to toilets in accordance with the set output
indicators.
Hand washing behaviour-change programmes: Against a baseline of 39 hand
washing programs, the project targeted 256; and by the end of 2021, the project
reported to have 157 programs total. The triggering and awareness campaign has
created positive effects with regard to increased hand washing practices among
community members. Findings of the household survey conducted as part of the
evaluation (Table 5.2 in Annex 4) clearly identified that project interventions increased
the percentage of household toilets with hand washing stations providing water and
soap to 67 percent, as opposed to the baseline which had 63.3 percent of household
toilets with hand washing stations providing water and soap. This finding is also
supported by the end line survey commissioned by UNICEF (August 2022)25 that was
conducted in Madhesh Province and found the percentage has further increased to
72.2 percent.

It seems however, that the increase of hand washing facilities did not equally correlate
to an increase in proper hand washing practices among the population. While 60
percent of the population use soap and water for hand washing, 40 percent of the
population is hand washing with only water (Table 3.7 in Annex 4).

School, Shivraj Municipality, Kapilvastu
that against a target of 288, the project
established WASH services in 117 schools
that meet the three-star standard, including menstrual hygiene management, by the
end of 2021. In August 2022, UNICEF conducted its End Line Survey for the
ACCELERATING SANITATION AND WATER FOR ALL (ASWA – II) project. In
Madhesh Province, it was determined that against a baseline of 66.7 percent, 90.9
percent of the schools had usable toilets; against a baseline of 0 percent, 30 percent
of the schools now have a dedicated budget allocation for school WASH programmes.
This is a great achievement indeed but is in contrast with the evaluation findings.
In Madhesh Province, the evaluation team randomly visited 4 primary and 4 secondary
schools. Among these, 1 of the primary schools had received support from the
programme to build WASH facilities including a hand washing station, separate toilets
for boys and girls, and an incinerator for burning waste. A female teacher received
orientation training from the project and served as the designated person for the
WASH activities at the school. The evaluation team observed school toilets were clean
but did not have soap for hand washing. Among the 10 water taps at the hand washing
station, 4 taps were broken. These were repaired by the head teacher using his own
resources. The incinerator showed no signs of being in use since its installation.
The head and assistant teachers of the school reported that supervised hand washing
had not been regular because the school has no budget allocation for buying soap or
maintaining WASH facilities. The school had not been supervised by local government
59
institutions or the Municipal WASH-CC. The head teacher requested the
accompanying field staff of UNICEF to provide financial support for maintenance of
the WASH facilities. No visible excreta were observed in and around the school. In
each of the other 7 schools visited (which had not received support from the project)
there were very few usable toilets or provisions for MHM. The evaluation team was
informed that female students of secondary schools were provided with sanitary pads
free of cost by the local government.
Sanitation in Health Care Facilities (HCF): The target of the project was to establish
basic WASH services in 49 health facilities. By the end of 2021, a total of 21 HCFs
had received these facilities. As the HCFs were not a target sample in the evaluation
design, the evaluation team did not visit any HCF and is not in a position to evaluate
the effectiveness.
Local government with WASH Plans: At the inception of the project, only two of the
Municipal WASH-CCs had a plan for improving WASH in their municipalities. The
project intended to develop WASH plans integrating climate resilient development
and/or risk management for another 81 municipalities. It has been reported that a total
of 58 municipalities had developed their plan for improving WASH by the end of 2021.
With regard to initiating a sustainable process and coordinated bottom-up institutional
development for WASH, the evaluation team firmly put this across as one of the
significant outputs created by the project. The evaluation team visited 12 municipalities
and conducted FGDs with each of the Municipal WASH-CCs. While two municipalities
shared their documented/printed hard copy of the Municipal WASH Plan with the
evaluation team, other municipalities could not because the draft plans yet had to be
finalized. Institutionalization of such a bottom-up planning process is complex and
takes time to be systematized. In spite of some weaknesses observed (such as the
inability of most municipal WASH-CC members to explain their plan and the kind of
intervention strategies they decided upon for improving the WASH situation), initiation
of the process is certainly a positive effect created by the programme.
Capacity development for effective WASH governance: Regarding the
improvement of WASH governance, the outputs created by the project are:
• Development and operationalization of 5 national /sub-national WASH sector
policies, instruments and guidelines. (For example: Guidelines on WASH Plan,
HCF, Water Quality Monitoring, Water Safe Community, and Sustainability).
• Development and operationalization of 7 WASH sector information and
management system MIS.
• Establishment of functioning cluster coordination mechanisms for water,
sanitation, and hygiene in humanitarian situations in the provinces and
municipalities.
The evaluation team did find, however, that the project would have had a better effect
if policies, strategies, and guidelines for sludge management had been developed and
rolled out.
Humanitarian response: Another positive output of the project was to provide a
humanitarian WASH response to a population of 383,353.
60
The above findings definitely convey that the interventions of the project created the
desired outputs in accordance with the long-term framework of the programme.
Even though the data on access to basic sanitation on a larger scale is promising,
drilling down to the status of toilets and their usages reveals a more complex picture.
Although 78.8 percent of households now have their individual household toilets,
37.30 percent of those toilet pits are already filled with sludge and have therefore been
rendered useless. 15 percent of these households built new latrines but 22 percent
went back to the practice of OD. Further, 69.40 percent of households having
person(s) with disabilities (PWD) did not build toilets that provide access and services
to PWDs.15 percent of household toilets don’t have a drop-hole cover to cover the pit,
which led to foul odour and infestation of flies. 36.8 percent of households rarely clean
their toilets (Table 4.1; Annex 4) resulting in faeces often being visible in the toilet pan
and on the floor. This percentage in the category of unimproved latrines is greater than
the national average, as the JMP 2021 estimated that unimproved sanitation facilities
in Nepal is 3 percent.

Findings of the household survey (Table 3.1 in annex 4) convey that 21.3 percent
households do not have latrine facility. In addition 28.9 percent survey respondents
(Table 4.6; Annex 4) reported that their toilet26 pit was already filled up and could no
longer be used anymore if not emptied. The evaluation team conducted FGDs in 19
wards/communities in ODF-declared municipalities. On completion of each of the
FGDs, the team undertook a transect walk and randomly visited some household
toilets, hand washing facilities, bushes and jungles, roads/river/canals in and around
the communities. Except for four of the communities in Durga Bhagwati, a rural
municipality in the Rautahat District of Madhesh Province, in all other 15 communities
the evaluation team still observed human excreta in many places: bushes, roadsides,

canals, riversides, filled pit toilets, toilet pans and on the floor. This qualitative
observation of the evaluation team co-relate with the survey findings that a certain
percent of the population to revert to OD practices, resulting in reducing the
percentage of ODF communities.
Although the average percent of households practicing OD is 21.8, it is significantly
higher among disadvantaged groups. According to the survey findings, the highest
rate (31.2 %) of OD prevails among the disadvantaged non-Dalit Terai population27 ,
followed by Dalits (28.6), and then religious minorities (27.4 %).
Figure 14: Caste-wise distribution of households practising OD and ODF
Another reason ODF status was jeopardized was disposal of sludge into open fields.
The household survey findings revealed that 49 percent of households dispose of toilet
sludge in open fields. This practice does not meet ODF criteria.

The evaluation puts across three critical issues that emerged:
• About 20+ percent of households are yet to build their toilets.
• There is a need to de-sludge household pit toilets that have filled up.
• There is a need for proper maintenance and use of household toilets.
Based on the survey findings and notes from the FGDs conducted, the evaluation
compiles the following reasons behind the issues mentioned above:
Why 20+ percent of households did not build toilets?
On the multiple response option of the survey (detail in Table 3.4; Annex 4), the
highest ranked option stated by respondents is presented in the following figure:
Figure 16: Reasons for not constructing household toilets
63
Why households did not de-sludge toilet pits that had filled up?
Two main reasons stated by the respondents are lack of finances and an unwillingness
to pay (for detail survey Table 3.3; Annex 4).
Figure 17: Two main reasons for not evacuating sludge from full household toilets
Why 84 percent of households did not take any action to improve their toilets?
On multiple-response options, the top reasons for not improving the toilets were non-
availability of cash, high cost of materials (77.1%), no land to build latrine (40%), no
material (22%).
Figure 18: Three main reasons for not improving household toilets. (Details in Annex 4 in Table 3.8)
Other reasons noted through the FGDs are:
a. Breakage of rings while emptying the filled pit.
b. Tenants were not allowed to build latrine beside the landlord’s home.
c. Lack of land ownership for Dalit community.
d. Newly constructed houses did not have money left to build latrines.
e. Unwillingness of elderly people to break old habits and use toilets.
64
g. Existing cultural taboos about the father-in-law and his daughter-in-law not
using the same household toilet.
Based on the findings detailed above, the evaluation team summarizes that despite
the challenges faced by the project due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic
and the transition of unitary political administration into federal, the project has
successfully created the desired output of creating access to basic sanitation services
for a population of 580,956. Although the project made contributions to extending ODF
communities and areas, the percentage of ODF communities did not actually increase
but decreased due to slippage of previously declared ODF communities. While the
household survey findings convey about 22 percent, the population has gone from
ODF to OD practices. The evaluation team then visited 19 previously declared ODF
communities and observed that 4 communities were retaining their ODF status while
15 communities dropped out. This conveys that about 80% of previously declared ODF
communities have failed to retain their ODF status. As it is stated earlier, the
household survey result (Table 3.1 in annex 4) inform 21.3 percent HHs do not have
latrines thus they are practicing OD.
The programme made remarkable achievements in achieving its intended outputs for
developing the capacity of the sector to legislate, plan, and budget for the improvement
of WASH systems, including mainstreaming disaster risk management.
The efficiency attribute aims to determine the economic cost efficiency, operational
efficiency, and timeliness of project interventions. In order to do so, the following key
questions were raised:
• To what extent did the inputs and monitoring of the sanitation programme
contribute to achieving planned outputs and outcomes in a timely and cost-
effective manner?
• Were the programme’s financial and human resources sufficient for the
implementation of the programme’s planned activities?
The evaluation looked at both operational and cost efficiency as well as cost
effectiveness. The evaluation team held the view that the project’s cost efficiency is
high, operational efficiency is above average and the cost effectiveness is low.
Operational efficiency: A review of the achievements against KPI (reported by UNICEF
Nepal) shows that in order to improve sanitation and hygiene behaviour of the
community (Outcome 1) by the end of 2021, against a target of 500,000, the
programme made a significant achievement by creating access to safe sanitation
services for 580,965 people.

implementation faced by the programme due to COVID-19. Given the current rate of
progress, however, there is reason to believe that by the end of 2022 the programme
will be able to achieve a 100 percent achievement for targeted KPIs.

The original KPI 2018-2022 for the attainment of Output 3 was reviewed and a revised
KPI was prepared for the period of 2020-2022. The revised KPI discarded two
interventions related to capacity development28 and included KPI for humanitarian
WASH services in emergencies with two other KPIs, shown in Fig. 19 and 20 as well.
The programme was credible in providing timely humanitarian WASH services to a
population of 383,353. Achievement on the other KPIs (shown in Fig. 18 and 19) is
also remarkable.

The evaluation team was able to visit only one UNICEF-supported primary school
(Adarsha Rastriya Gajendra Primary School in Kanchanroop) where the programme
has established standard physical WASH facilities, including hand washing stations,
separate sanitary latrines for boys and girls, and an incinerator for burning contagious
waste. Further, the programme also provided orientation training to school teachers.
The school campus and surroundings were observed to be neat and clean without any
visible human excreta. Among the 10 taps at the hand washing station, three were
found to be broken and repaired by the head teacher with his own money. The head
teacher explained that the school was yet to have standard operating procedures and
mechanisms for finance, maintenance, supply of required materials and MHM
response preparedness at the school for female students. These would enhance utility
efficiency of the constructed infrastructure.
For effective and efficient implementation of WASH plans, the Municipal WASH CCs
need to develop their capacity for financing, human resources, and programme
management. Although replacement of capacity development intervention with
emergency WASH response for COVID-19 was an unavoidable need, this could lead
to inefficiency in the implementation of municipal WASH plans in the future.
The major gap in the programme’s operational efficiency was the absence of
systematic internal monitoring. Operational efficiency of any programme largely
depends on systematic internal monitoring; designed and conducted based on a well-
defined monitoring framework and plan. Of course, there were independent monitoring
events conducted by donors (such as DFID), but the key focus of the monitoring was
on the results trying to be achieved by the programme rather than on the processes
that would actually lead to those results. Monitoring the quality of implementation was
also weak. The evaluation finds that even though by the end of 2019 the pits of
household toilets started to fill and usage of those toilets started to reduce, the existing
monitoring system failed to monitor and provide this information to the programme
management so that the necessary actions could be taken in a timely manner. Of
course, periodic external study, assessment, review, and evaluation help but they
67
cannot replace the crucial role of internal programme monitoring, which continuously
informs the programme management in order to maintain implementation standards
and to take measures needed for rectification. In some areas, being a rush to declare
a municipality ODF, some local governments provided subsidized materials to
marginalized populations so they could build household toilets. Further, in some
municipalities, the local government applied coercive strategies, such as deploying
the police to keep watch that people did not defecate in open spaces or cancelling
citizenship cards (Nagarik card). All of these would have been prevented if systematic
monitoring of implementation processes had been in place. It would also have yielded
systemic data and information on the financial, labour, and material contributions by
the community, government, and other actors engaged. It was only by the end of the
project that a post-project evaluation was finally done (the present evaluation). As a
result, there was no scope for any mid-term corrections based on the ongoing project
evaluation. The evaluation which is being conducted by CLTS Foundation and Global
and Citizen Development Solution seems to be the End of Project Evaluation, where
there is no opportunity to incorporate corrective mechanisms for fine-tuning the focus
of implementation towards attending to the objectives of the programme. For instance,
in this case, whatever recommendations the evaluation team put forward can only be
applied to similar such programmes in the future. There is no scope for incorporating
the evaluation findings as a means of improving the efficiency and outcome of these
projects – simply because the project is now over. The evaluation can only leave
recommendations for a future programme, but during the life of this project there was
no evaluation whatsoever for improving the efficiency any part of the programme. This
deprived it of the opportunity for any changes while it was going on. Many issues which
had to be amended at the end of the project could have been identified before the
project finished to improve the efficiency and outcome of the project. UNICEF has
implemented the project over the last five years and there was no systematic
evaluation of the work done by the project.
Cost efficiency: Project Direct Investment (PDI) came to US$ 2,210,000. In terms of
cost vs output creation, the output of 580,965 people getting access to sanitation
justifies the high-cost efficiency of the programme. However, the evaluation team
recognizes that cost efficiency of a programme cannot be judged only on PDI, but
must also take into consideration the amount of money, materials, and time invested
by the communities, the government, and all the other actors engaged. The evaluation
team was informed by ERG members that for building a household toilet, an
approximate cost of US$100 would need to be invested by the household, which
brings the community investment to the approximate amount of (100,000 X US$100)
US$100,000,000. It was also reported by the community that they received monetary
and material donations from people and businesses, which enabled economically
marginalized households to build toilets. Partial financing from the relevant
government ministries, departments, and local government organizations was also in
place. Better judgment on cost efficiency could have been made if the project
monitoring had recorded the complete cost data and information on financial, labour,
and material contributions made by the community, government, and other actors
engaged. Although a better analysis on cost efficiency could have been made if the
evaluation team had complete cost data and information on financial, labour, and
material contributions made by the community, government, and other actors
engaged, the evaluation team would like to designate the programme as high cost
efficient. With the project direct investment (PDI) of US$2,210,000, the programme is
68
not only credited with providing 580,965 persons access to basic sanitation but also
humanitarian WASH services to a population of 383,353. Further, the PDI not only
catalysed counterpart financial support by the federal government to Palikas but also
catalysed the construction of hundreds of thousands of toilets by community members
who invested about US$100 per toilet.
Cost effectiveness: Unfortunately, in terms of transformation of costs and inputs into
sustained outcome, the cost-effectiveness of the programme has diminished. In
comparison to the situation that prevailed in the year 2019, the number of ODF
communities did not increase but slipped back to OD instead (Figure 24). However,
the evaluation firmly recognizes that the policy guides and MIS systems that have
been developed and operationalized will have continued utility value in the long term
and will thus be a value addition for the money invested.

municipality selected and
applied locally relevant appropriate implementation strategies based on their own
contexts. They were able to use the same approach for mobilization and delivery of
inputs from various stakeholders, including financial and material donations from
businesses.
The third contributory factor was the popularization of a focused motto: One
Household One Toilet. This motto channelled major efforts and inputs into a one-
dimensional direction and achieved fast-tracked coverage.
The fourth contributory factor was the prescribed standard for slab and pan used to
build pit toilets at households. Although this factor prohibited the creation of multiple
innovations and Pygmalion29 effects regarding ownership, it did reduce time
consumption for local innovations.

70
Though it is counterproductive to sustainability of outcomes, the fifth factor that
contributed to the efficiency was the deployment of police and youth to prohibit open
defecation and to help vulnerable households build toilets.
The sixth contribution to efficiency was positive conditioning, such as making
sustained ODF status the main criteria for a community to eventually be eligible to get
tube wells and make themselves a water-safe community.
The seventh contribution was fostering access to materials through sanitation
marketing.
The eighth factor was the engagement of local NGOs and local government people as
implementing partners to create community awareness accretion, implementation,
and monitoring of community-level activities.
Next, the direct monitoring and review of the programme by UNICEF staff stationed at
province level contributed to efficiency.
Last – but not least – the tenth contributory factor was the Government of Nepal’s
sincere commitment to improving the country’s sanitation situation. This greatly
expedited development and operationalization of relevant sector policy guides and
systems.
Hindering factors to cost effectiveness: It was stated earlier that cost-effectiveness is
the measure of costs and transformation of inputs into a sustainable outcome. In some
cases, a contributory factor for cost-efficiency can also be a hindering factor for cost-
effectiveness. The key hindering factor to cost efficiency is the unsustainability of ODF
communities.
The evaluation concludes that the programme was cost efficient with regard to
achieving the stated output and outcomes of the programme, but due to a slippage at
previously declared ODF communities, it ultimately failed to increase ODF
communities. After 2019, the number of ODF communities started declining as
compared to the situation that prevailed up to 2019. This was reflected in the declining
personal- and community-level hygiene practices that reduced the cost effectiveness
of the programme. Data on the reduction of ODF communities has been presented in
the Sustainability section.
The following evaluation questions have been framed to check the sustainability of the
programme:
• To what extent are the targeted locations under the sanitation programme
remaining ODF after implementation?
• What internal and external factors affected the sustainability of ODF status?
71
The following box describes the ODF criteria stated by UNICEF and the Government
of Nepal:
ODF Criteria
UNICEF’s Global WASH strategy emphasizes ending open defection, which
implies halting the incidents of depositing adult or children’s faeces (directly or after
being covered by a layer of earth) in the bush, open field, mountain slope, or other
open areas including the disposal of the same in drainage channels, rivers, or other
water bodies as well. Accordingly, the Sanitation and Hygiene Master Plan (Master
Plan 2011) of the Government of Nepal describes the following indicators/criteria
expected to be present in the following designated areas before declaring the area
ODF:
• There is no OD in the designated area at any given time.
• All households have access to improved sanitation facilities (toilets) with every
member of the family using it and being responsible for its repair and
maintenance.
• All schools, institutions, and offices within the designated areas must have
toilet facilities.
In addition, the following aspects should be promoted along with ODF declaration
process:
• Availability of soap and a soap case for hand washing in all households.
• General environmental cleanliness, including management of animal waste,
solid, and liquid waste management in the designated area.
Retention of ODF communities and location
A good percentage of villages (toles), wards, and municipalities that became ODF
during the period 2018-2019 did not retain its status and returned back to the practice
of OD. All in ODF declared municipalities, including three Dalit communities the
evaluation team visited and intensively observed following 19 communities/ villages
(toles) among which while 4 villages in Durga Bhagawati municipality are maintaining
ODF status then other 15 villages failed to retain the ODF status as per the criteria
stated in the national sanitation master plan. Not all households and members of these
communities changed their behaviour in stopping open defecation. Some households
in each village were found with no more usable pit latrine and members using open
space for defection, some households found with useable latrine but not all members
using it, some households showed visible human excreta around the latrine, there
were visible human excreta found in nearby jungles, road /river/canal sides, members
of some households using toilets for defection but not properly washing hands after
defection. Shared communal latrine visited in Dalit communities were not properly
maintained and most members of targeted household were not using it but defecting
in open spaces.

Population’s access and proper use of improved latrines is one of the determinants of
ODF. For data comparability and the programme’s major focus with Madhesh
Province as an example, it was found that while 16.5 percentage30 of households were
practicing OD in the year 2019, it increased to 22.7 percent (see Survey Table 1.6;
Annex 4) during the period of the evaluation (May 2022); a net increase of 6.2 percent.

With the exception of Madhesh Province where 4 districts were covered in the
household survey, just one district was covered for each of the other 4 provinces.
Although a survey that covers only one district as the sample may not be
representative of an entire province, findings presented in Survey Data Table 1.6
(Annex 4) show that Lumbini District in Kapilavastu Province has the highest percent
(23 percent) of the population practicing OD.

The above information triangulates by providing reasons for the 6.2 percent increase
in OD practices. The table shows that 21.8 percent of households had usable latrines
before32 but by the time of the evaluation they have become non-functional/unusable.
Members of these households have returned to OD practices, though about 35 percent
of these household members reported using a neighbour’s or relative’s latrine (Survey
Data Table 4.6; Annex 4).
Access and use of a latrine is one of the key determinants for ODF but not the only
ones. Another determinant of ODF is the proper maintenance of required facilities and
hygiene practices. The following information table generated through the survey
convey that a certain percentage of households/populations are neglecting to comply
with other supportive ODF criteria.

Referencing the MICS 2019 Equity Decision Tree and other documents, the
evaluation team were able to collect comparable data on the percentage of
households/population practicing OD. However, they could not access the percent of
clusters / villages / wards that were ODF before the inception of the project.
As stated previously, the evaluation team visited and intensively observed 19
communities in eight sample districts (all in ODF-declared municipalities) and eight
schools (all in Madhesh Province). The evaluation team conducted FGDs, visited toilet
and hand washing facilities, led transect walks in bushes, gardens, roadsides,
riversides, and canal sides, and observed that except for 4 communities in the Durga
Bhawati Municipality of Rautahat District, all other 15 communities had failed to retain
their ODF status.

The evaluation team observed open defecation spots, where human excreta was
visible, in ODF-declared wards and municipalities. In some municipalities (e.g.,
Malangwa) communal toilets constructed for Dalits were not adequate nor was there
any regular maintenance being done. Construction of most toilets was incomplete and
there were no doors. Toilets became filthy and unusable very soon. In such cases,
people opted to return to the practice of OD. The practice of OD triangulates with the
household survey finding which shows that 64.1 percent of children under the age of
5 were suffering from diarrhoea for the last 15 days from the date of the data collection
(Survey data table 2.2: Annex 4), very high in comparison with national data provided
by NDHS-2016 and MICS 2019 which is 8 percent and 10 percent respectively.
Nonetheless, the household survey findings (table 3.1 in annex 4) inform 22.3 percent

All of the 8 schools in Madhesh Province (4 primary and 4 secondary) were randomly
visited. With the exception of one primary school that had received UNICEF support
to construct WASH facilities, the sanitation situation in the rest of the other 7 schools
was observed to be pathetic. Sanitation facilities created in the schools were not
maintained and were totally unusable. Toilet pans were broken and filled with faeces,
floors were wet and dirty. Facilities for hand washing with soap and/or potable drinking
water were lacking on the school campus. Any tole/village /ward having a school with
this kind of pathetic sanitation situation cannot be considered ODF. In order to be
considered as an ODF community/ward, all schools in the community or ward must
also have proper sanitation situation supportive to be ODF. The evaluation team does,
however, recognize that most of the schools visited were being opened after a long
closure and this may have been the cause for these negative effects on the overall
sanitation situation.

Toilets at the Saraswati Secondary School in Pipara, Rautahat were not operational
over the last two years where the students were compelled to go out into the field
to relieve themselves, including open defecation. There were no facilities for hand
washing with soap or potable drinking water on the school campus which had 2,500
students.
Plight of sanitation facilities created in the school (visited)
The programme conducted WASH in Schools training for teachers and facilitators, and
MHM was one segment of the content. While municipal offices distributed sanitary
pads free of cost to adolescent girls in all the senior classes free there was no room
where they could change the sanitary pads in private. The girls often threw the used
sanitary pads outside the window, where they accumulated behind the wall and were
burnt openly. As there was no specific changing room in the school, most girls found
it very difficult to manage the inconveniences they faced during their menstrual period.
It was reported that they had to go to the bush or hide somewhere to change their
sanitary pads. Although there was an incinerator found in one of the schools visited, it
was non-functional. Through FGD with municipal WASH-CCs, the evaluation team
came to know that the procedure for sanitary pad distribution and its management
holds the respective local government responsible for making sanitary pads available
to the girls. Funding for this comes from the federal government.
79
Sanitation facilities in the district and municipal offices and institutions were even
worse. The evaluation team visited more than 25 toilets in local and district
government institutions however, they found that not a single toilet was usable and all
were unsafe and unhygienic. There was also no soap or detergent solutions for
washing hands.
The picture above shows the plight of toilets in Mahagadimai Municipality, beyond
use by any humans. Although sanitation facilities were established, there was no
regular maintenance. When this is the deplorable state of standard municipal toilets
it is meaningless for that same municipality to be spreading messages of safe
sanitation, hygiene behavior, and safe toilet maintenance to its citizens. This
municipality was declared Open Defecation Free two years ago.
For the prevention of COVID -19, hand washing facilities were installed at local
municipal offices but were no longer in use at the time of the visit.

Factors affecting the sustainability of ODF status:
With regards to sustainability, the programme has contributed to making Palika
WASH-CCs active and functional by initiating Palika-based planning and
implementation systems. Although financing by the federal government is not
sufficient for the continuation of proper implementation of Palika’s plans for sanitation,
the federal government has provided funding directly toward intensifying the sanitation
social movement and making Palika areas ODF. The available five frameworks and
tools of the WASH sustainability assessment International Water and Sanitation Centre
(IWSC)33 states that there are five factors for sustainability: 1) financial; 2) institutional;
3) environmental; 4) technical; and 5) social. The evaluation team holds the view that
most of the existing assessment frameworks have left out one important factor, which
is the relationship between the outcome and the process, including the mechanism of
sustaining ODF status. Sustainability of ODF status cannot be seen as a one-time
static achievement marker. It must be a continuous process of collective action
undertaken by the local communities and institutions located in the communities long
after the program has ended. Nonetheless, the process of continuous action in order
to sustain ODF status is supported when people realize the good impact it has on their
life.

It was earlier stated that a major percent of villages and wards became ODF during
the period 2018-2019 but they were unable to sustain that ODF status. The following
internal and external factors affected the retention of ODF status:
Figure 29: Factors affecting retention of ODF status
Internal factors
Weak monitoring of processes and changes: Sustainability of ODF depends on the
way it has been achieved. Application of appropriate tools and processes that make
communities realize on an emotional level that becoming ODF and sustaining it,
benefits everyone greatly in terms of health, dignity, livelihood, economy, education,
and peace. This makes the sustainability potential high. This is where the crucial role
of process monitoring comes in to ensure application of the appropriate tools and right
processes through which community members realize and take collective self-help
actions. As FGDs interacted with community members and Municipal and District
WASH-CCs, the evaluation team learned that in most cases triggering and post-
triggering follow-up had not been done using the participatory tools and processes. As
stated earlier, some municipalities jumped the gun and declared ODF too soon while
some municipalities used their own resources to provide subsidies but were not
concerned about following the ‘do no harm’ principles in the course of making the
communities ODF. The internal monitoring system of this programme was weak, and
thereby could not ensure application of the proper processes for achieving ODF status.
Further, internal programme monitoring of changes for the output being created and
continuous information feeds to management are also crucial to taking the relevant
measures for sustaining ODF. Many household pit latrines constructed before 2018
are becoming full and therefore unusable. The household survey finds that among the
portion of households (37.3 percent) whose pit latrine is already filled, the highest
82
percentage of completely filled latrines was in Mahesh Province in the Terai region, at
66.8 percent ( see Figure 30). If an effective internal programme monitoring system
had been put in place this change would have immediately been captured and the
issue could have been discussed so that relevant measures could have been
undertaken.

Inadequate intervention equilibrium toward sustaining past achievements and
progressing further: Sustaining ODF status demands the application of
simultaneous interventions for both sustaining the past achievement and progressing
even further onward. This means that besides the delivery of any intervention aiming
to extend coverage and access to improved sanitation facilities and services, equal
emphasis must be given to delivering interventions that will contribute to sustaining
the coverage that has already been achieved and additional progress. These kinds of
interventions may include:
• Strengthening Ward WASH-CCs in planning and review; integrating
sustainability of already achieved improved sanitation facilities and services.
• Participatory benefit-sharing exercise of having improved sanitation facilities in
households, schools, and other public institutions.
• Participatory impact assessment of being ODF.
• Community-based assessment and follow-up of sanitation resource, facilities
and services.
• Horizontal sharing of good practices through planned excursions and exchange
visits.
Most interventions of the programme were geared towards extending new sanitation
facilities and services in households, schools, and health care facilities. Due to a lack
of intervention for facilitating and encouraging communities and institutions to maintain
83
the facilities and services they had already created upright, a certain percentage of
households ended up returning to OD practices.
Lack of post-ODF interventions: Sustaining ODF status demands deliberate
intervention strategies such as: the formation of a sanitation committee, the building
of linkages between relevant stakeholders, support mobilization, marketing facilitating,
a participatory sanitation technology development, community-led sanitation
marketing, community-led sanitation, disaster-risk reduction, and the promotion of
community-based livelihoods and primary health care. The revised KPI of the
programme did not include any explicit output or performance indicator on the
retention of ODF status for toles, wards, municipalities or districts. A project or
programme plan is a logical frame of the means-end relationship. As the programme
did not include any explicit KPI for measuring ODF status, it was unable to define and
apply intervention strategies34 for ODF sustainability.
Inadequate interventions for collective behaviour change: Although adequate
interventions ensure collective behaviour change is the essential element of ODF
sustainability, the “One household, one toilet with permanent structure” approach for
fast tracking access to sanitation facilities consumed most inputs and efforts for
building hardware facilities. As a result, little input and energy were left to strengthen
local community participation and sustainable behaviour change.
Inadequate attention to address the special needs of Dalits: Although Nepal’s
Census 2021 is yet to provide very detailed data, some documents state that the figure
for the Dalit population in Nepal is more than 20% of the country’s population35. For
generations Dalits have been treated as untouchable and thus discriminated against
and excluded from many spheres of social life. Although the Constitution and laws of
Nepal abolished untouchability and other forms of caste-based and cultural
discrimination it continues as a deep-rooted tradition even today. Dalits suffer from
discrimination and disadvantages across all spheres, including social, cultural,
political, economic, and religious aspects of life. They are often denied their basic
human rights. Being Dalit is a condition characterized by caste-based discrimination
in socio-cultural and economic spheres. Because the society places them in a lower
position of society, they have been subject to all kinds of exploitation and intimidation
by upper caste categories36. Most Dalits and lower caste households do not have their
own land on which to construct a decent house and latrine. Furthermore, Dalit children
are commonly exposed to negligence and are ridiculed. As a result, they often drop
out of schools and discontinue their education. UNICEF Nepal has stated
(https://www.unicef.org/nepal/education) that there has been inequity in the education
sector as only 12 percent of children from the lowest wealth quintile were
developmentally on track in literacy and numeracy as compared to 65 percent from
the highest wealth quintile. Thus, children of these communities do not get much from
school sanitation. Although sustaining ODF status for the Dalit population requires
different needs, no specific intervention strategy was targeted to address these special
needs for this marginalized population.
Inefficient faecal sludge disposal: A community, ward, or a municipality cannot
sustain its ODF status if untreated faecal sludge is disposed of in the open
34Such as post ODF follow-up, organizational development of sanitation committee, facilitating community based PMEL systems for moving up to sanitation
ladder, linkage building of sanitation committee with relevant stakeholders for support mobilization, facilitating Participatory Sanitation technology

environment after being collected from HHs latrine pits. Such inappropriate practices
of sludge disposal directly and indirectly jeopardize ODF status for the whole
neighbourhood, village, or town. The evaluation found there is no uniform policy to
guide households in safe disposal and management of sludge. In some municipalities
private groups empty sludge and charge 500 NPR per ring for a pit latrine. The
perception of those in economically marginalized households is that having a pit latrine
brings an extra financial burden and it is thus better to stick to practicing OD. Different
municipalities have taken on different policies and hold different ideas about how to
empty household latrines. While one municipality would like to give this service to
households free of cost, another has decided to charge money for the service.
Inadequate rolling out of the process at the Ward WASH-CCs after federalization
and addressing the legacy of WASH CC has become weak: In most of the
municipalities visited in focused districts the Ward-CCs were not active. However, the
evaluation team found that in one district (Rautahat), the local NGO partner had
facilitated both male and female WASH committees at the ward and tole level in order
to monitor and review sanitation-related activities and local actions. As a result, much
better performance and eventually ODF status was maintained. This puts across the
message that ODF sustainability is directly linked to the presence of functional ward-
and tole-level community organizations.
How ODF communities in Druga Bhawani Municipality Retained ODF Status
In Durga Bhawati Municipality of Rautahat district both male and female sanitation
committees were formed in wards to help assess, plan, and review sustainability of
ODF status and to address any issues which emerged. These sanitation committees
mobilized local sources to support vulnerable households to maintain their latrines
properly. It is important to note active presence of women committee members who
raised their voice to address any issues specific to women and sanitation. Functional
male and female ward sanitation committees are systematically connected with the
municipal WASH-CC. The municipal WASH-CC then consulted with all these
committees and included their suggestions in the development of the Municipal
WASH Plan. Durga Bhawati Municipal Government not only covered 50 percent of
the budget for the Municipal WASH plan but also provided pit desludging services.
Dalits and other vulnerable communities received a special focus and attention for
inclusion of their views in the plan. The sanitation programme continued enhancing
confidence of the stakeholders on different levels. As Ward WASH-CCs were
facilitated, the evaluation found all four of the villages that were visited successfully
retained their ODF status.
Inadequate inputs for capacity development: The evaluation put forward that the
programme had inadequate input to develop the capacity of ward, municipal, and
district WASH-CCs with which the organizations could facilitate and manage the
programme in a sustainable manner.
External factors
85
Low investment capacity of 50% HHs to obtain and maintain government
prescribed latrine: The household survey findings revealed that the average
expenditure in about 50% of the households was greater than their average monthly
income (Survey Data Table 1.4; Annex 4). This population included Dalits and other
lower caste people. It was difficult for this category of households to invest, construct,
and maintain government-specified models of pit latrines or to properly follow the
recommended hygiene practices. The survey data presented below shows that money
and material crisis were some of the major reasons for not owning or maintaining
latrines properly.

Figure 31: Reasons for not having a household latrine (N=537)
Floods: The household survey findings reveal that 12 % of household latrines were
affected by floods (Survey Data Table 3.6; Annex 4). This also adversely affected the
population with regard to retaining its ODF status. The evaluation team got an
opportunity to validate this survey finding while conducting FGD in a community of
Rajdevi Municipality in Rautahat District. Some households of this community are
settled in low lying areas and inundated by flood water caused by heavy rainfall which
caused pit latrines to collapse. Due to active initiatives of Ward WASH-CC, the
households repaired the latrine but did not raise the floor plinth above the flood water
level. The programme had inadequate intervention strategies to enable the population
to consider flood risk beforehand and build flood resilient latrines.
Lack of access to water in hilly regions: While the population in the Terai Region,
which is in the plains, has fairly easy access to water through the installation of tube
wells, this is not possible for the hilly regions. A water-sealed pit latrine requires a good
volume of water to push excreta through the pit. Fetching water from the river or
natural spring is also very hard for the households settled in hilly areas. Difficulties in
access to water in hilly areas is also a challenge for sustaining ODF status.
86
Negative demonstration effects by schools and public institutions: Schools,
municipal, and district government offices played the role of change makers in the
sanitation social movement. Unfortunately, they themselves could not improve
sanitation facilities in schools and institutions, most of which were not functional or
well maintained. This unhygienic sanitation situation in institutions and organizations
failed to convey any motivational input to the committees on the dire need of sustaining
ODF status.
Lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities among the three tiers of government:
The master plan suggested systematic joint planning, implementation, and review by
VDCs (now ward), municipalities, and districts. However, due to federal transition and
lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities among the three tiers of government, the
programme did not apply strategies and interventions to link district and municipal
WASH-CCs. This reduced the scope of institutionalizing the sustainable process of
maintaining ODF status. As stated earlier, after federalization the legacy of WASH-
CCs was not addressed and thus, all the district-WASH-CCs that were visited have
become inactive. Although under the direct support of the UNICEF programme,
targeted municipal WASH-CCs prepared their plan, this did not materialize in non-
focused district.
Emergence of COVID-19 pandemic: For a period of about 24 months the programme
had to redirect most of its efforts and energies to provide an emergency WASH
response for preventing the spread of COVID-19. During this whole period, it was
impossible for the programme to conduct in-person meetings at any tier, on-spot
follow-ups, or mobilization activities. Further, COVID-19 adversely impacted the
livelihood and income of marginalized and disadvantaged groups of the population.
All of these factors adversely affected ODF sustainability.
It is clear from the analysis of the sanitation profile for intervention areas that ODF
status had been achieved earlier but could not be sustained. Due to several
constraints such as access, proper usage, maintenance of facilities, and sustained
improved hygiene practices, a significant proportion of the population returned to the
practice of OD. Thus, the number of communities that had earlier achieved ODF status
declined.
The key factor affecting the sustainability of ODF status is the lack of self-mobilized
community participation (Self-mobilisation: People participate by taking initiative
independent of external institution to change systems. They develop contacts with
external institutions for resources and technical advice they need but retain control
over how resources are used. Such self-initiated mobilization and collective action
may or may not challenge existing inequitable distribution of wealth and power).
Although, community participation is a word used widely for different types and forms
of participation, true or genuine participation is different from the lighter forms of
participation. Participation could be as ordinary as: see annex 5.
In a genuine or true participation, outsiders do not mobilize or rigorously convince the
recipient community (often referred to as beneficiaries) to participate in an outsider
driven project. On the contrary, the insiders solely decide whether to participate in a
project based on the suitability on their needs and requirements
87
In order to learn how gender has been mainstreamed in the municipal level sanitation
programme the evaluation team conducted in-depth consultations with the Municipal
WASH-CCs, local NGO partners, male and female groups at wards, teachers, and
male and female students at schools. The findings are as follows:
Gender assessment and analysis: The evaluation found that in most cases WASH-
CCs conducted informal consultations with both male and female members of the
wards/toles to gather ideas and opinions on the felt need for improved sanitation
situation in the municipality. For understanding the felt needs at schools and health
centers, WASH-CCs did not facilitate any structured consultation but listened to the
staff from the education and health engaged as members of the WASH-CC. However,
the main gap of the consultation was the lack of focus in trying to understand issues
around inequality reasons behind it.

The evaluation suggests that gender assessment and analysis is the first and most
important step in identifying gender inequality issues in sanitation as well as
determining appropriate interventions to be integrated in the programme plan.
Although a consultation was conducted with women and girls on their sanitation needs,
the programme did not facilitate WASH-CCs to do systematic gender assessment and
analysis. A systematic wellbeing grouping would certainly unpack the facts embedded
in the bottom of society. There are issues related to higher and lower caste, landless
and marginal farmers, landless living on somebody else’s land as tenant or bonded
labour/ landowner’s mercy. The rules of tenancy/occupation are heavily tilted towards
the landowner where the norm of occupancy is determined by the landowner and not
by the tenant/occupant allowed to live on mercy. Despite all the social harassment
faced by women they have so many other issues to deal with so this becomes a gender
compromise for women and children. For example, a landless person has no other
option but to defecate on somebody else’s agricultural land because he or she has no
land to construct a pit latrine even though he/she wants to. In such cases Common
Property Resources or local government land, bushes, embankment of rivers and
roadsides are used as defecation ground. Often there are unwritten norms set and
followed by all those who practice of OD. For example: left side of the road is used by
women and the right side is for children.
88
In the context of Nepal, irrespective of caste and wellbeing categories, any work
related to cleanliness in the home is generally the role of women. The programme
design lacked interventions to develop new norms, values, and attitudes, changing
unjust gender division of labour, develop women’s and girls’ leadership skills to
promote gender equality in sanitation and MHM.
In terms of participation and addressing the felt needs, the programme design did not
include deliberate interventions for those who identify as LGBTQIA. Similarly, the
Municipal WASH plan has inadequate perspectives and intervention strategies for
challenging discrimination that happens as a result of a gender-based power structure
between women and men, girls and boys. The programme seems to be mainly
designed to improve the conditions by which women and girls can access and practice
improved sanitation and hygiene protocols.
Gender in programme implementation, monitoring and evaluation: Despite the
lack of systematic gender mainstreaming into the programme cycle, the evaluation
finds one of the main strengths of the programme is the active participation of women
and girls in promoting improved sanitation and hygiene services in their communities.
As one input included addressing the special needs of women, they were consulted
before developing the Municipal WASH Plan. Formation and facilitation of women’s
sanitation groups was one the vital strengths of the programme. Further women
triggers, school teachers, and women cooperative members were mobilized to
respond to COVID-19. As for weaknesses, women’s participation in municipal WASH-
CCs is weak. Lack of participation by PWDs, those who identify as LGBTQIA, and
seniors was also found to be a weakness. Sanitation facilities created at households
and institutions were less responsive to the needs of the elderly, PWD, and LGBTQIA
community members. The physical toilet facilities built in schools do not provide
adequate privacy provisions for girls so they can tend to their sanitary needs, including
MHM. Assessments, monitoring, evaluations and learning processes were not in place
for gender and vulnerable group disaggregation. At the municipal level there were no
indicators for monitoring Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) under the M&E
system. These were yet to be developed and included in the WASH plan. However,
despite lack of systematic gender mainstreaming into the programming cycle, the
evaluation found active participation of women and girls in promoting improved
sanitation and hygiene services in their communities – this was one of the main
strengths.
89
5. Conclusions and Lessons Learned
Nepal was declared an ODF country in 2019. After two years, as seen during the
evaluation, all eight districts where many municipalities had earlier achieved ODF
status are now slipping back into the practice of OD. The key lesson the evaluation
uncovered is that “an external agency-led social movement coupled with “free or
subsidised sanitation hardware/infrastructure-centered approach” to establishing ODF
can be successful for the time being, but it may not sustain the necessary collective
behavioural change among local communities so that they stay away from the practice
of open defecation forever. There are many instances all over the world where
sanitation infrastructure created by external agencies remained unused or was used
for a different purpose than what it was built for. The intervention areas were no
exception to this.
Unused toilets in Sarlahi district
For many reasons, as explained, sustaining the improved hygiene behaviour change
among members of the community depends on prevailing conditions, including the
wellbeing of the entire community. Inability to cope with time and moving along the
sanitation ladder which needs individual investment or support from the
government/external agencies is not always accessed by poor families living in remote
areas. It appears that it would be extremely difficult to achieve ODF status without
empowering the communities in collective action-reflection, along with taking action to
improve their sanitation status within their communities. This requires a shift in the role
of WASH-CC’s from implementer to facilitator, working to empower communities to
improve their sanitation and realize the right to live in an ODF environment. In relation
to the socio-cultural and institutional context of Nepal, the evaluation presents the
90
following strategic lessons: consideration of what could make the sanitation
programme more effective in creating a sustainable ODF outcome.
Creation of a sustainable sanitation outcome equals emphasis on creating a
social movement around sanitation and community empowerment: The
Sanitation Social Movement (as applied in Nepal) is a powerful approach to fast-track
safe sanitation coverage and population’s access to sanitation services. But if the
movement is not focused on empowering communities to take care of their own
sanitation problems and solve them, it may not guarantee a sustained behaviour
change, this was proved again and again in different locations/ ODF communities
visited by the evaluation team members though they were not truly within the
intervention area. For instance, monitoring the retention of ODF status from outside
would not be possible unless the local community decides to do it on their own. This
is self-mobilization as explained earlier. For collective behavior change and its
sustainability the social movement must have strategies and interventions for local
community empowerment. Disadvantaged groups of population in Nepal especially
the lower castes reported several socio-cultural, economic and landownership issues
in improving their sanitation situation and realizing their rights to sanitation. Resolving
these issues will not get proper attention by the relevant government and other duty
bearers if they are not empowered to raise their united voice to demand services. Be
it a village, community, or school students and teachers or patients of health care
facilities without empowerment of these primary stakeholder in demanding appropriate
sanitation services from the relevant duty bearers won’t make sanitation social
moment approach effective enough to have improved and sustainable sanitation
outcome. The evaluation put forward a lesson that if the final goal is to promote
collective behavior change and its sustainability then a sanitation programme should
have equity of intervention strategies that not only enable responsible
organizations/duty bearers (relevant departments, WASH-CCs, NGOs) to perform
their roles but also to empower community to claim their rights and duties Even if the
national or regional policy of the government is totally focused on community
empowerment with clearly laid down and written sanitation policy, it may not yield a
satisfactory outcome at the community level unless the implementing missionary is
trained, exposed, and geared up for performing the same job in a different mode
particularly with no subsidy bottom-up participation. A sudden shift from top down,
subsidized/ free sanitary hardware focused approach to no subsidy bottom-up
approach with full community participation demands massive input on training,
capacity building and awareness creation of the implementing missionary at the
ground level.
Behavior Change Communication (BCC) strategy must encompass emotional
domain of learning; focusing sanitation as Public Good: The survey findings
convey that about 85 percent adult members of the communities are aware about bad
consequences of OD and good effects of the practice of improved hygiene behaviour.
Despite of this awareness many of them are returning to the practice of OD. One of
the main reasons being the temporary nature of low-cost latrines build by the poor,
very poor and landless during the campaign. However, in course of time these
homemade pit latrines soon get filled in with sludge; start collapsing after a few months
and years as they were unable to move up along the sanitation ladder in terms of
improving the substructure of the toilet, adoption of pro poor improved technology etc.
(for example: from homemade pit latrine with ring and slabs, from direct pit latrine to
91
off-set pit latrine, septic tank, pour flush with septic tank or connecting the toilet with
the central sewerage system etc.) the reasons were many. A. Landless and marginal
members of the community were allowed by the landlords to construct temporary
toilets only and stop the practice of OD. They were not allowed to make any permanent
construction with brick, cements etc. in order to avoid any future claim of the land by
the user. B. the tenants or temporary/seasonal occupants of the land were not always
interested to invest in constructing a permanent toilet on someone else’s land.
Community awareness raising thoughts and dissemination of messages alone is not
enough to change/sustain sanitation and hygiene behaviour without changes in
affective/emotional domain of awareness as well as creating supportive conditions to
apply their awareness. As seen in many countries the trend of traditional self-help
practices of supporting each other to achieve a central goal in this context is an ODF
environment which is strengthen by Parma. Parma is the term used for self-help
(helping each other in the neighbourhood) for achieving a cross cutting central goal of
no open defecation focused towards attaining an outcome focused public health. No
matter whether a family has a toilet or not, he/she is not out of danger unless everyone
in the community stops the practice of open defecation totally. The chain of faecal oral
contamination through different means cannot be eliminated unless the entire village
environment is free from open human excreta. If everyone lived in an ODF
environment the faecal oral contamination from open defecation and poor hygiene
practices comes to an end. This would simply have a significant effect on the clean
village environment (no stinks, less flies, visually clean) and a positive health outcome
on reduced incidences of diarrhoea and diarrheal diseases, under nutrition, stunting,
malnutrition and reduced number of diarrheal patients in the hospitals and health
centers37.
Inclusive and equitable sanitation demands for a caste and other vulnerable/ excluded
groups (PWDs, older persons, LGBTQIAs) disaggregated strategies: In many parts of
Nepal particularly in rural parts of the area the socio-cultural gap between the higher
and lower caste, rich and poor, landlord/ landowner/zamindars and tenants etc. are
quite prominent where a different political construct primarily governs the rules of
engagement of people from different strata. For example: A brahmin and higher caste
families generally lives in the best (cleanest and central part of the village) who
generally walk to the periphery of the village to defecate in the open in the morning.
The poor (could be Dalits, untouchables and other poor minority caste) live around the
periphery/outside of the village. While these are the dwelling neighbourhood of the
lower caste it is used as defecation area for the rich upper caste. The lower caste
families often keep pigs and other scavenging livestock for their livelihood. Often the
justification of the rich is that the excreta left behind by the better off is used as food
by the pigs. Further, in traditional rural Nepali family in some places the father-in-law
would generally avoid using the toilet used by his daughter in law or similar other
relation. The preference would always to have an exclusive separate toilet for the use
of elders of the family. Physical inability of old people who never used a sanitary latrine
might find it difficult to squat on the footrest of a squatting plate and adjust himself/
herself to drop the excreta in the right place. The first-time users of such who practiced
open defecation throughout his/her lifetime would find it difficult to get used to a toilet
within the four walls of a modern latrine. It takes time for them to get mentally adjusted
with the practice which is new to them. In this context inclusive and equitable sanitation
37 http://resources.cwis.com.s3.amazonaws.com/evidence/files/3-2300-16-1439734509.pdf
92
demands for a caste and other vulnerable/ excluded groups (PWDs, older persons,
LGBTQIAs) a disaggregated approach. Further due to caste and ethnic stratification
achieving and sustaining ODF status of one community to another is very different and
diverse in nature. It is difficult to address those with pre-set common intervention of a
project/programme without taking participatory planning, review and learning
processes down to the community/wards/toles. The Dalits and other lower castes
constitute one fifth population of Nepal. A small percentage of school children from the
lower caste communities who attends school are affected with the improved
appropriate sanitation message and approach taught/ promoted through the schools.
The reasons could be many out of which the most important reason is the non-
availability of toilets at their homes. While they use toilets at the school and understand
the importance of using, not using toilet and stopping the practice of OD, every
member in the family including their parents is surprised to hear about such messages
from their children. Most of these families are practicing open defecation across
generation which is the social norm. This do not mean that the children cannot
influence their parents or other members of the family to stop the practice of OD at all.
Cost effectiveness is high if emphasis is equally distributed to collective
behaviour change along with sanitary hardware construction: The Local
Municipal Government as political entity is more interested in creation of physical
facilities than community mobilization and behaviour change. While the municipalities
were found to be very focused in making their cities and towns sustainably ODF area
they emphasised more on hardware constructions. As explained earlier, if the
emphasis is equally distributed to collective behavior change along with sanitary
hardware construction it would encompass many who may not be able to
construct/afford sanitary latrine outright. In such cases the sharing of latrine,
maintaining community latrines clean and dry with shared responsibility and cost
sharing are common. It has also been seen that a latrine block with several latrines is
maintained properly and kept under lock and key. Families who use a particular latrine
knows about it and are responsible for its operation and maintenance. All the user of
that particular family maintains or keep a copy of the key to the latrine door. Like this,
there could more local example of community managed latrines. Although the
counterpart funding by the municipal council is significant in general but major part is
spent for water supply and little for sanitation. Most of which is invested for
construction of facilities and infrastructure but little for community mobilization and
behavior change. For example: India, Bangladesh, Timor Leste, Ghana, Kenya and
Madagascar etc. However, there are countries like Kenya there is a separate ministry
or directorate exclusively working on Hygiene Behaviour Change and monitoring
outcome of sanitation programme as the on public health. Traditionally, the
responsibility rests solely on the ministry/directorate which are only concerned with
creation of sanitation infrastructure for example: public works, public health
engineering etc. in such cases there is often a disconnect between investment on
infrastructure and the positive health outcome if the ministry of health is directly
involved it is easier for them to monitor the reduction in number of patients suffering
from diarrhoea and other enteric diseases reporting in the health centres of ODF areas
and the variation in number with non ODF areas.. Having a national policy guide for
spending certain percent of the budget for sanitation is often ignored. Again, a
municipal council do not have adequate human resource strengths to facilitate
community level process of planning and implementation. Therefore, the need for local
community participation in supporting the municipal council to manage and discharge
93
the function of planning and implementation is very important and which needs to be
addressed through formation of local community team, training and capacity building
of the volunteers who are interested and willing to support the municipality.
The deigning of programme must consider the whole sanitation chain in assessing
needs and planning: One of the important factors for ODF sustainability commonly
reported is the effective and appropriate system of FSM in place; thus, planning must
consider the whole sanitation chain.
Deliberate intervention is required to reverse the prevailing perception that
sustenance of ODF status is directly dependent on external funding: Although
improvement of sanitation situation reduces disease and cost, promotes livelihood,
improves health, nutrition and education, common perception prevails among the
community members as well as members of WASH-CCs is that sustenance of ODF
status and moving up along the sanitation ladder requires fund and resources. There
is a need to reverse the prevailing perception that sustenance of ODF status is directly
dependent on external funding. There are many instances globally were public
contribution, shared responsibility by private sector participation, international donor
funding and institutional lending from the financial institutions e.g.: The World Bank,
Asian Development Bank, Plan International, World Vision etc. there are examples of
joint funding and Private Public Partnership arrangements. Some of these could be
explored and appropriately selected by the different municipalities.
Communal sanitation facilities do not serve the purpose if maintenance
strategies and mechanisms are not introduced beforehand: Without proper
maintenance strategies and mechanisms in place construction and extension of
communal sanitation facilities at communities, schools and public institutions soon
become non-functional and dirty and unusable thus reducing the efficiency and
effectiveness of sanitation programme.
For example: Sulabh Sauchalya in India is a bright example of participation of the user
cost sharing, repair and maintenance by the users and the organisations managing
them. The system of large scale ‘pay and use’ toilet facilities was introduced by Sulabh
International. Sulabh Sauchalaya have crossed the boundary of India and have been
adopted by many countries outside.
Integration of Gender Equity and Social Inclusion (GESI) and Climate Change
Adaptation (CCA) in Programme design demand for explicitly stated objectives:
The overall programme design and WASH plans developed at municipal councils did
not include explicit objective, outcome and indicators related to GESI and CCA.
Mainstreaming gender and climate resilience in sanitation requires explicit inclusion of
objectives outcome and indicators for M&E specific to GESI and CCA; without which
integration of gender and CCA in sanitation is non-systematic, anecdotal, and
ineffective.
Periodic assessment by externals helps for learning but systematic internal
monitoring is essential for damage control: If the programme would have
systematic monitoring based on well-defined M&E framework then the
SUSTAINABILTY criteria and its indicators would be part of the design and plan. If this
were the case, then information related to issues of sustainability would enter into the
94
project Management Information System (MIS) and then and there appropriate
measures could be undertaken.
6. Recommendations
The recommendations were developed through an analysis of the evidence gathered
from the analysis of key findings and conclusions from the evaluation. To ensure
utilisation, recommendations were developed with a key focus on what UNICEF could
do. Based on the findings and lessons stated earlier the evaluation recommends the
following for the future programme to be more effective.
Training and Capacity Building at all levels needs to be based on the principles
of collective behaviour change process which does not exclude the outsiders:
to initiate the collective behaviour change process amongst the community the outside
facilitators should also change the style of communication from a teaching/preaching
style to a more participatory mode ‘let’s do it together mode’. For this to happen the
facilitator should also adopt the same attitude and body language as that of the
community. Unlike teaching (teacher and student relationship- uppers and lowers) it
has to be transformed into participatory training mode. The concept of ‘teaching by
doing’ and ‘learning by doing’ is crucial here. See the picture below. For example: The
Swachh Bharat Mission- Grameen (SBM- G) in India underwent a radical
transformation from its focus on sanitary hardware construction during Rural
Sanitation Programme in 1986, followed by Total Sanitation Campaign in 1999 and
Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan in 2012. The SBM- G was different from previous sanitation
programmes as the main focus was on behaviour change process.
In any community meeting outside facilitators should share the same floor with the community in order
to avoid the unequal relationship (uppers and lowers). This empowers the local community as equal
partners in a project.
One of the strategic lessons the evaluation draw is the merit of Sanitation Social
Movement (SSM) approach in generating enormous inputs towards achieving fast
access to sanitation facilities and services. If the dimension of community
95
empowerment for collective behaviour change process is integrated well then
achieving sustainable sanitation outcome would be much more effective and efficient.
Until the concerned functionaries are made accountable to ensure collective behaviour
change on principle, enhanced sector capacity and extended access to sanitation and
hygiene facilities at home and institutions may not necessarily ensure into ODF
sustainability. Achieving collective behaviour on a sustainable basis is not possible
unless the local participation is high and spontaneous. It is important to mention here
that community participation can vary from a most ordinary type to a strong community
driven and community owned process. The most ideal form of participation would be
self-mobilization meaning that local community will understand the need for collective
behavior change and need for ODF environment. If the entire tole (village) is not ODF
for some reason or the other some people are exposed to the danger of eating each
other’s faeces. A highly motivated and aware community would always ensure that
everyone including the poor and landless have access to basic sanitation facilities.
Otherwise, everybody would be exposed to the danger of faecal oral contamination.
Communities sustainably maintaining ODF status across all over the world are taken
care of their poor, very poor and disabled on the traditional principle of self-help. For
example: Parma in Nepal.
The evaluation highly recommends for developing sector capacity development
strategies and deliver interventions based on the principles of collective behaviour
change process. If trained and capacitated with the needed knowledge and skill of
facilitating multi- stakeholders participatory planning and facilitating village/ward
WASH CC/ palika based participatory assessment, planning, implementation and
review process the local government organizations at municipalities and districts can
act as an effective institution to facilitate the ODF communities to move up along the
sanitation ladder. Due to differences in roles capacity development of WASH- CCs
needs to be planned and implemented based on systematic needs of WASH- CCs or
WASH in institutions whatever the case maybe it would be essential to setup to deal
with the institutional mechanism which would act as WASH unit at different levels in
full collaboration and cooperation of NSHCC at the national level. The training and
capacity building intervention needs to be designed strictly on the outcome of the
needs assessment carried out across all levels of WASH-CCs. Any capacity building
intervention should have a strong balance with the local needs which might vary in
different geographical regions, biophysical and socio-economical context, and time.
Addressing sociocultural variations through Institutionalizing Participatory
Assessment, Planning, Implementation and Review (PAPIR) process at the
villages/wards as the way forward: Achievement and sustenance of ODF status is
very different and diverse between one community to another due to caste and ethnic
stratification. It is difficult to address those with one common intervention for all
throughout the entire project/ programme “one size doesn’t fit all”. Challenges of
sludge management, establishing equilibrium of interventions for sustaining past
achievement and making additional progress, cooperation for sharing local resources
for the marginalized households cannot be addressed by the delivery of a common
set inputs but by institutionalizing village/ward based participatory assessment,
planning, implementation, and review process, as an approach for community
empowerment. Hence, it would be essential to institutionalise such a process in all
future interventions as the way forward. It is evident that the situation of those village
is much better wherever the community level sanitation committee are active e.g.,
96
Rajdevi of Rautahat. The sanitation status is much better in villages of Rajdevi,
Rautahat as compared to similar other villages. The evaluation recommends for
ensuring resource provision and support in Palika plans to institutionalize the process
of village/community-based assessment, planning and review process through the
Ward WASH-CCs. Institutionalization of this PAPIR process will have multiple positive
effects for sustainability. First of all, depending on the situation of a community/ward it
will decide and implement locally preferred action relevant to both pre and post ODF
interventions. Second it will serve as a powerful strategy of action- learning oriented
BCC that will encompass emotional domain of learning, focusing sanitation as public
good. Third and most importantly, if participatory impact assessment is conducted
then people realize the importance of investment in sanitation in reducing household
as well as national financial losses, enhancing income and overall national prosperity,
which will serve as deliberate intervention to reverse the prevailing perception that
sustenance of ODF status is directly dependent on external funding. Fourth for
addressing local needs in the relevant context it can generate appropriate actions and
innovations out of the box. Improving sanitation by Dalit communities might look as
advocacy for securing land ownership. Sixth it will sever as community based informal
school hygiene education.
Ensure dedicated budget allocation, action plan and ownership of local
government to sustain the already achieved ODF status in Nepal by 2030:
Although the counterpart investment by the palika/ local government is significant in
general, major part of the investment goes to water and a very little is allocated for
sanitation. For example, Rupani Municipality has allocated 96% for drinking water, 3%
for institutional sanitation and 1% for capacity building out of total budget US$ 632060
for the FY 2020/21.38 Major amount of the investment budget is used for construction
of physical facilities and infrastructure but very little goes for community mobilization
and behavior change. While facilitating planning ensure the Municipalities allocated
dedicated fund for sanitation; include activities for encouraging and fostering
community led initiative and rewarding elected local bodies for spearheading
successful initiatives.
Encourage local NGOs, CSO, Users Committee, Cooperatives, Women’s Self-
Help Group etc to get involved in addressing the human resource needs of
Municipal WASH- CCs as equal partners: At present Municipal WASH-CCs do not
have dedicated human resources capable of facilitating community level participatory
process. For addressing human resource constrains and bottlenecks involve local
NGOs and other formal and informal entities mentioned above as partners for
community facilitation with the local government body.
Intensify interventions though formulation well defined strategies for sanitation
facility maintenance and use: Without proper maintenance strategies and
mechanisms in place, construction, repair and maintenance of communal sanitation
facilities at schools, public institutions and communities become non-functional, dirty
and unusable quite soon. Before constructing communal sanitation facilities plan
proper repair and maintenance to ensure that the investment in creating public facility
is not totally wasted. Stand- alone implementation of sanitary pad distribution or
creation of handwashing station does not serve all the purpose of three-star approach
38 Municipal WASH Plan, Rupani Rural Municipality
97
and MHM in schools. Facility and mechanisms for MHM at schools needs to be
established appropriately in consultation with the user groups. In three-star approach
there are four indicators related to facility and three each for behaviour and
institutionalisation this needs to be built into the strategy itself. If required the experts
from the government, UNICEF and CSOs may be invited for consultation and
recommendations. CLTS Foundation can also extend necessary help and support in
such interactive discussions which has been done in many other countries. Facilitate
schools in mobilizing funds for the proper maintenance of continuing WASH facilities
in the school. Trigger and follow-up government offices at the municipalities and
elsewhere for the proper maintenance of sanitation facilities in office premise. In case
of public toilet ensuring proper maintenance is more complex as it is not the
responsibility of any one individual or organisation. In other words, it is a facility used
by everybody and not maintained by anybody due to lack of any defined and clear
accountability. Since the responsibility of maintenance lies on the municipalities,
government, or other local bodies, due to lack of availability of recurring expenditure
on cleaning, maintenance, and repair. To overcome this challenge, models of user
participation and pay and use toilets have been used very successfully. This not only
generates revenue for maintenance and repair but generates local employment as
well. The huge capital investment in constructing toilet units is not wasted due to lack
of maintenance in protecting the toilets from being filthy and dirty. The strategy should
also include rural and urban context specific appropriate interventions towards safe
onsite and offsite sludge management. The evaluation recommends for formulating
strategies through stakeholder consultation.
Adopt a clear and systematic mechanisms for sustaining the service chain
whatever is available for managing sanitation services safely: As it is clear from
the overall findings of the evaluation that the sanitation infrastructure and technological
options available/used by the households are too primitive and meagre for maintaining
the ODF status sustainably. However, there is a high level of awareness and interest
amongst the sector actors to improve and modernise the checks and balances to
systematically monitor the ODF sustainability and its impact on public health. This one
area where institutional help and support could be of immense help and be welcomed
by the municipalities and other sector players. There were no clear and systematic
mechanisms for sustaining the service chain whatever is available for managing
sanitation safely. As a result, it was evident that municipalities who have attained ODF
status run the risk of losing the status. The following reasons are very important to be
addressed by the municipalities or the civil society failing which a very few
municipalities would be able to retain their ODF status:
• Although underground sewerage system with appropriate treatment facility is
considered as most safe and convenient mechanisms in city life with higher
population density deprived from modern technology. It is not used in all the
towns and cities of Nepal. While it is one of the most efficient sanitation systems
used for big towns and cities including metropolitan cities, this system is
expensive and financially dependent on external/government contribution
partially. Government contribution is essential for smooth functioning of the
sewerage systems. Depending on the efficiency of municipalities the amount
collected as tax varies from municipality to municipality. It is generally not easy
to collect/expect any tax from poor or very poor settlements within the
municipality. Moreover, there are settlements of people who migrated/
98
displaced or shifted from other places for various reasons. Often the most
important reason being wider livelihood options and access to many facilities
and welfare support from the government. This is just an example of a
government support to extend basic infrastructure and technology to villages
and remote areas. This initiative of the government would not be possible
unless there is wholehearted cooperation and total participation from the local
communities. It has been seen that the level of participation in the government
initiatives is remarkably high in ODF villages as compared to other villages. For
instance, in the meeting of ward councillors in the mayor’s (Mr. Nirpa Odha)
office in Dhangadhi (sub metropolitan city) during the evaluation, the ward
councillors were represented from 19 wards of the municipalities. They reported
that no tax is being collected for sanitation. Due to shortage of land, safe
disposal of human waste and waste product remains a constant issue.
• Mechanisms for sustaining the safely managed sanitation services: Enhancing
the income of municipality for providing sanitation services to people of
municipality. Free sanitation service can only be provided to a certain extent,
beyond which it could only be maintained by tax revenue earned, user fees
collected and matching contribution from the institutions and agencies receiving
municipal services. The unit cost of sanitation service needs to be calculated
on at no profit no loss basis. Subsidized services cannot be provided all
throughout by the municipality unless the said municipality receives any grant
or donation from funding agencies, donors, or the central government. Most
municipalities and city corporations in the world have introduced service tax
user fees for water supply and other basic services. Traditionally, the basic
needs of the people like water, municipal services, repair and maintenance of
roads, drains and sewerage systems were the direct responsibility of the
government, more and more these services are being provided on cost basis.
This is introduced in many towns and cities across the world because of
increase in cost and population pressure on the unit area of towns and cities.
Moreover, rural urban migration both seasonal and daily visits by people from
the suburban areas puts a huge pressure of garbage, solid and liquid waste
removal from the busy towns and cities. According to the global forecast of
population growth three fourth of the global population would live in towns and
cities of the world within a century. Already there are countries in the world
where the urban population has exceeded the rural population significantly for
example Iran. In Nepal, Eighty-six percent of the migrants are rural-urban
migrants. Thirty-five percent of all rural–urban migrants in the country are in
KMC (Kathmandu Metropolitan City)39.

Figure 31: Population growth trend of Kathmandu Valley (Source: Adapted from KVDA, 2016)
• As a result, developing safely managed sustainable sanitation services is a new
challenge. Many experiments have been conducted globally to tackle this
problem. In-situ disposal of human waste is no longer feasible in towns with
rapidly growing population. Periodical emptying of toilet pits and overflow of pits
constructed with ring and slab is a most common problem as seen in Nepal.
Attempts of engaging private companies for excavating the filled-up toilet pits
using suction pumps and tankers found to be useful in some parts of the city
but it did not work well in densely populated slum areas. The suction pump
mounted tankers could not be moved to dense congested areas to narrow or
very narrow roads of towns and cities. It is only the private vendors who come
with a portable suction pump and empty the toilet pit by releasing the untreated
raw excreta in open ditches and ponds nearby which creates another
environmental problem with stink and flies for some time. Even the tankers with
suction pipe empty their tanks in the river, khads (manure), open spaces not
too far from the towns and cities. This untreated sewerage often gets into the
natural water streams and rivers with rainwater and create a health hazard far
away down the stream. These are also environmentally dangerous. While
construction of treatment plants and treating the raw sewerage before
discharging it to the open environment is the only solution, it is a challenge for
the municipalities to bear the cost of establishing such a treatment plant.
Although a few municipalities informed the evaluation team that they are in the
process of receiving grants and loans and subsidized infrastructure for creating
such facilities. It still remains a challenge for small municipalities to raise and
provide the matching contribution required to create such infrastructure. This
again raise the question of public contribution and pay and use system of safely
managed sanitation.
Apply the policy of positive discrimination for the gender and inclusion: Upper -
lower caste power relations, socio-cultural construct and governance structure in
Nepal is controlled and influenced by the upper caste. Discrimination in employment
has both direct or intentional and indirect aspects. For example, the low employment
rate of Dalits in the government sector can largely be attributed to their low level of
education, which again is related to their Dalit status in society. This form of
discrimination can, therefore, be seen as indirect discrimination. At the same time, it
also has elements of direct discrimination in the sense that the government sector is
dominated by ‘upper caste’ people, who tend to favour candidates belonging to their
100
own castes when the matter concerns hiring or promoting personnel40. Although, the
situation is changing it has to go a long way.
In such situation disaggregated approach for inclusive and equitable sanitation is
needed with equal participation of all caste and vulnerable/ excluded groups including
PWD, older persons and LGBTQIAs etc. The evaluation recommends for the
application of policy of positive discrimination to ensure participation of Dalit, PWDs,
LGBTQIA and Older persons and any other vulnerable groups. Deliberately include
person with disability, Older Persons and LGBTQIAs in the Municipal and Ward
WASH-CCs. While facilitating Municipal and Ward WASH planning deliberately
include interventions for addressing special needs of these vulnerable groups of
population.
Systematize programme monitoring: The governance structure of Nepal is divided
into three distinct layers of administration there are 7 provinces, 77 districts and 283
municipalities. There should be a very clearly defined and functional management
information system that connects all the three tiers reflecting the status of sanitation
at each level. This data would be useful in monitoring the sanitation, SLWM and other
important aspects of municipalities. A district or a provincial level monitoring
officer/team would be able to categories all the 283 municipalities as Category 1
(cleanest), Category 2 (moderately clean) and Category 3 (not up to the mark) and
colour code them with green, yellow and red. In other words, for example if the federal
level monitoring board shows eighty-three green, hundred seventy yellow and thirty
red ( numbers are hypothetical as an example) in the month of July 2022 that means
the performance of thirty red municipalities are below standard and not at par with
other municipalities. Such poor performance of thirty municipalities pulls Nepal back
to a non ODF municipal nation. Logically, the intervention of the district and the federal
level should be more at those thirty red municipalities to bring them up to the standard
of yellow status and eventually to green status. With the enhanced intervention and
interaction with the municipal authorities of these thirty municipalities it might so
happen that twenty five out of thirty move up to yellow and green level in the month of
August. In other words, they strengthen the municipal administration and improve the
sanitation status. For carrying out such monitoring an inter municipality evaluation
team along with the members of district and federal level needs to be formed who
would periodically visit all the thirty municipalities and review their performance on a
commonly agreed list of indicators. As a result, the names of today’s red municipality
might turn into yellow or green after a couple of months. Therefore, such periodic
monitoring visit should be organised by the inter disciplinary inter municipal team from
time to time. The result of the evaluation visit should be exhibited at the municipal
headquarters at the respective district and the federal level. Kalyani municipality in
West Bengal, India is one example where such ward level evaluation chart was
presented at the municipal Chairman’s office on every month. The performance of the
wards continued to change every month as a result of their performance result
published in the display board of municipal Chairman’s office. During the monthly
meeting of all ward councillors this was discussed. Some councillors were very happy
some tried to hide their face out of shame but determined to change and improve their
status before the next meeting. Such periodic assessment by externals helps in
evaluating performance from a neutral perspective and adds value for onward learning
40 https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@asia/@ro-bangkok/@ilo-kathmandu/documents/publication/wcms_112922.pdf
101
and technical backstopping. Therefore, a systematic internal monitoring mechanism
should be developed in each municipality to sustain their high level of performance.
The evaluation recommends for systematization of programme monitoring based on
a well-defined framework and plan. Sustainability checking must be a criteria to be
included in the M&E framework which should include relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency, coherence, Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI). The system
should monitor both the processes and outcomes. The programme can explore
possibilities of creating and operating a municipal wide digital monitoring dashboard
of OD and ODF communities/tols/villages/ward including following categories such as:
A. Not triggered and OD continues
B. Triggered but yet to be ODF
C. ODF status achieved and sustained
D. Was ODF could not sustain the status but slipped back to OD again
Accordingly consolidated structure of the dashboard can be taken up at the province
and national level.
In several countries (such as Ethiopia, Ghana) sanitation programme supported by
UNICEF applied similar approach of multi-stakeholder coordinated sanitation planning
integrating the approach of community self-assessment, monitoring, evaluation and
learning. This system prove to be very effective in behaviour change and sustainability
of ODF status. UNICEF supported sanitation programme in Nepal may consider self
M&E by communities/palikas/ WASH-CCs as a vital strategy in its M&E approach of
the programme.
In relation to the introduction of functional information management system, based on
well-defined policy and roles of the relevant government entities, the programme
should have framework of software that facilitates the collection, storage, organization,
and distribution of information to the stakeholders.

FOR FGD
Your child is invited to take part in a FGD session as part of a study on the Summative Evaluation
of Sanitation Programme Outcomes. This is a programme evaluation commissioned by UNICEF-
Nepal and jointly being conducted by CLTS Foundation India and CDS –Nepal. The FGD session
will take approximately 60 minutes to complete and will take place in the suitable place in your
ward/community.
If you permit your child to be in this discussion meeting, this is what will happen:
• He/she will participate in a discussion meeting together with another 8 to 10 children
of your community/ward.
• We will ask him/her to give opinions and ideas on the questions we will pose related
to sanitation programme.
• He /she may have to do some interesting group exercise such as drawing, scoring, walking
together and observe the sanitation situation in your community.
• If you and your child agree then we can also take photographs and do audio –video
recording of discussions

participation, and you can stop them at any time. Your child’s participation or refusal will not impact
any benefits or services received.
BENEFIT
You or your child will receive no direct benefits from participating in this evaluation study. However,
your child’s responses may help us learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of the
programme as well as drawing lessons and recommendations for making the programme more

Typology of participation: How people participate in development programmes and projects.
(Priyanka take it as annex as commented) Source: Pretty (1994), adapted from Adnan et al.
(1992):
TYPE CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH TYPE
1. Passive People participate by being told what is going to happen or has already
Participation happened. It is a unilateral announcement by an administration or project
management without any listening to people's responses. The information
being shared belongs only to external professionals.
2. Participation in People participate by answering questions posed by extractive research
Information using questionnaire surveys or similar approaches. People do not have the
Giving opportunity to influence proceedings, as the findings of the research are
neither shared nor checked for accuracy.
3. Participation People participate by being consulted and external agents listen to views.
by Consultation These external agents define both problems and solutions and may modify
these in the light of people's responses. Such a consultative process does
not concede any share in decision making, and professionals are under no
obligation to take on board people's views.
4. Participation People participate by providing resources, for example labour, in return for
for Material food, cash, or other material incentives. Much on-farm research falls in this
Incentive category, as farmers provide the fields but are not involved in the
experimentation or the process of learning. It is very common to see this
called participation, yet people have no stake in prolonging activities when
the incentives end.
5. Functional People participate by forming groups to meet predetermined objectives
Participation related to the project, which can involve the development or promotion of
externally initiated social organization. Such involvement does not tend to
be at early stages of project cycles or planning, but rather after major
decisions have been made. These instructions tend to be dependent on
external initiators and facilitators, but may become self-dependent.
6. Interactive People participate in joint analysis, which leads to action plans and the
Participation formation of new local institutions or the strengthening of existing ones. It
tends to involve interdisciplinary methodologies that seek multiple
perspectives and make use of systemic and structured learning processes.
These groups take control over local decisions, and so people have a stake
in maintaining structures or practices.
7. Self- People participate by taking initiative independent of external institution to
Mobilization change systems. They develop contacts with external institutions for
resources and technical advice they need, but retain control over how
resources are used. Such self-initiated mobilization and collective action
may or may not challenge existing inequitable distribution of wealth and
power.
