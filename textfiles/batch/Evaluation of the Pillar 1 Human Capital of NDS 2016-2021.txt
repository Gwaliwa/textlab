EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1. This Evaluation Report is for the end of cycle evaluation of the Human Capital1 Pillar of the
Kosovo National Development Strategy 2016-2021 (NDS HC1). This evaluation is
commissioned by the Strategic Planning Office (SPO) within the Office of the Prime Minister
(OPM) of Kosovo and supported by UNICEF Kosovo and will cover the period from 2016-
2021. The timing of this evaluation aims to inform the Kosovo Institutions and the Office of
the Prime Minister, and other stakeholders on the progress of the NDS HC1, lessons learned
and to present recommendations for informing the design and development of the next cycle
of the NDS (2022-2030) HC1.
2. The expected users for this evaluation are the SPO/OPM, Kosovo government and other
partners, notably related to adjustments in NDS Human Capital Pillar implementation
and/or design, and to support discussions with stakeholders regarding the elaboration of the
next NDS for Kosovo. The evaluation will also serve to inform the Kosovo Government and
an array of Ministries, Departments and Offices, the United Nations Agencies, donors, and
CSOs on the lessons learned from the NDS HC1 and to present recommendations for future
NDS based on the essential findings.
National Development Strategy
3. The Kosovo Government developed its first NDS, which serves as a strategic document for all
planning in Kosovo, in 2016. The NDS aimed to develop a list of priorities under an umbrella
strategy which would allow building synergies between initiatives, prevent institutional
overlap, and yield higher performance efficiency, orientation of support of the development
partners, and establish a basis for public accountability. The NDS is organized across four
thematic pillars: human capital, good governance, industrial development, and
infrastructural development. As a supplement to the NDS, the NDS roadmap, prepared in
2017, outlined a more detailed implementation plan which included costing, as well as
implementation and activity indicators.
4. The Human Capital Pillar, the focus of this evaluation, places a strong emphasis on measures
seeking to strengthen the education system and to strengthen its connection and
applicability to the labour market and the economy. These are articulated through seven
distinct measures and 32 associated activities. The pillar is oriented around the promotion,
creation, and sustaining of a productive, skilled, and innovative labour force. The underlying
logic is that this is a determining factor for successful national development. This is
predicated on assumptions that as the labour force acquires higher skills, there will be a
subsequent increase in incomes and a general improvement in the economy. Skills are not
only defined as technical skills, but also include cognitive skills, such as logic and reasoning,
as well as ‘soft’ skills such as interpersonal skills or values. Building these skills is seen as
heavily linked to the education system and the quality of education provided pre-workforce
entry, although labour market skill increases may also come from migration to other settings
and subsequent ‘brain gain’ from diaspora returnees.
5. The leading stakeholders involved in the implementation of the NDS Human Capital Pillar
involve three key Ministries as well as a range of supporting institutions. The key Ministries
were the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology and the Ministry of Labour and
Social Welfare, and the Ministry of Diaspora.2
1 For the purposes of this evaluation, Human Capital is defined to be the collection of skills, knowledge and experience in a
population and is viewed in terms of its contribution and value to Kosovo economic development.
2 These ministries have been restructured in 2020 as part of an overall ministerial reform. The titles here refer to the titles as of
the time of design.

Methodology
6. The evaluation used a mixed-methods approach, drawing on pre-existing documentation,
pre-existing quantitative data, and combined with qualitative interviews with key
stakeholders. In total, 56 persons (65 percent women) were interviewed during the
evaluation representing a mix of government, UN, donors, and civil society members. In
addition, more than 100 documents were reviewed that were made available from the SPO
and respective ministries.
7. The evaluation team was composed of two evaluators. The evaluation team was also
shadowed by six student volunteers to amplify youth participation and as capacity building
for the youth. The student volunteers participated in the virtual interviews, supporting the
evaluation team (ET) with notetaking in the data analysis and writing up their impressions
and thoughts on UNICEF's programme and evaluation process. The youth volunteers also
participated in the debriefing sessions and data analysis exercises and helped build the
conclusions and recommendations for the evaluation.
8. The evaluation approach had to be adjusted to account for the COVID-19 pandemic and the
subsequent travel restrictions. These restrictions meant that the evaluation shifted to a fully
remote approach in which all the interviews were carried out through virtual platforms.
Three in-person learning workshops were carried out during the inception phase and initial
data collection phase including an initial training on the principles of evaluation and
application for government with the SPO, a presentation of preliminary findings and
recommendations to a workshop with representatives from the OPM, and a presentation to
the Evaluation Reference Group (ERG).
Findings
9. Relevance: The NDS HC1 design process was rigorous, and evidence based. The priorities
identified in the NDS HC1 are relevant, although perhaps not sufficient to cover all
development needs. The NDS HC1 has the potential to serve as an important medium-term
instrument between mandates and could provide an important mechanism for orienting
towards external frameworks such as the SDGs and the EU ascension agenda (termed the
Programme for the Implementation of the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA)).
10. In terms of challenges, the activities, and measures in the NDS HC1 focus almost exclusively
on economic growth aspirations through strengthening education and enhancing
employability. Other wellbeing considerations such as health, culture, or social cohesion are
not present. Finally, the strong economic growth orientation of the NDS HC1 limits the
degree to which transversal equity themes are able to be considered and as such, gender and
access considerations are not strongly visible in the NDS HC1 and this is a critical gap.
11. Effectiveness: There has been some progress made against the measures and activities,
but there has been lower rollout than anticipated as per the targets set. Out of the 101 KPIs,
23 have made good progress or were completed, 30 have made some progress while 48 were
rated as having limited or no progress yet. The measures and activities that have the highest
rates of success are those which were resourced by donor support.
12. The implementation rate of the measures that attracted substantial donor funded projects
was higher than for those that relied more broadly on government funding for three reasons.
First, the donor funded projects tended to have standalone planning processes including the
development of targets, the definition of specific responsibilities for implementation, and the
development of a structured timeline for implementation. Second, the donor funded
projects within the measures used a specific resourcing framework with the funds for the
project activities allocated and earmarked for specific use even if conveyed through the
vi
government. Finally, reporting processes were regular, focused specifically on the outlined
project activities with factors provides for any delays in implementation.
13. The macro-level economic indicators have improved modestly since 2016, but the NDS HC1
contributions to these gains is likely to have been minimal due to the relatively low
completion rates of activities and the fact that there are declines in the outcome level
indicators related to the respective measures. If almost half of all KPIs are reported as
having had no progress and if the indicators at Measure-level that do exist for the NDS HC1
tend to show declines from 2015 even as the macro-level indicators show gains, then it is
reasonable to assume that modest macro-level progress is being supported from other
sources than NDS HC1 activities per se.
14. Efficiency: It is not currently possible to answer the TOR evaluation question on how the
financial resources were used for the NDS HC1 implementation because of the structure of
the budgeting and resource allocation process. The NDS HC1 action plan in 2017 did
develop a costing estimate disaggregated to the level of activities including a description of
which percentage of costs would come from government of Kosovo and which percentage of
costs would come from donor contributions. However, the way that financial resources are
recorded in the Ministerial reporting does not identify resourcing allocations by NDS HC1
activity. Sectoral workplans disaggregate by other dimensions.
15. Based on the available evidence, the allocations to NDS HC1 activities were not
commensurate with the costing estimates in the NDS HC1 action plan and NDS activities
tended to not receive priority during budgeting. The NDS HC1 measures were not
harmonized enough with budgetary allocations linked with budget law and ministries were
not under obligation to allocate funding per the NDS HC1 activities even though this was
requested from the SPO. While some of the ministerial budgets were connected to the NDS
HC1 activities, there was no internal requirement in government for the NDS HC1 identified
activities to receive priority in funding. As a consequence, NDS HC1 activity progress is
highly aligned with voluntary commitments – especially donor commitments.
16. Sustainability: within the frame of a policy evaluation focuses on two dimensions: 1) To
what degree can the NDS HC1 itself be sustained within the processes and frameworks of
government? And 2) to what degree can the results that were achieved in the past NDS cycle
be sustained going forward.
17. For the first component, sustainability would involve the degree to which the NDS HC1 is
integrated with external and internal frameworks (synergies), including the degree to which
the NDS HC1 is aligned with, and integrated into, existing government processes and
mechanisms. Compared to the 2018 mid-term review, the NDS HC1 performance through
the second half of the cycle has declined slightly in the subsequent years. This is because the
NDS HC1 is not well integrated into other government processes which reduces the degree of
prominence that the NDS HC1 have in shaping policy, strategies, and implementation of
government workplans and orienting government priorities. Government turnover has
increased during the NDS period as well with four different Governments taking power since
the inception of the NDS.
18. The second component considers the degree to which the results of the NDS can be
sustained. Sustainability of results in the case of the NDS HC1 would involve three levels: i)
whether there is a sufficient legal or regulatory framework in place; ii) whether there are
sufficient systems, processes, or assets developed; and iii) whether there is sufficient human
technical capacity development related to the systems, processes, or assets including both
contracting and training human resources.
19. For the NDS HC1 overall, achievement rates at any level have been relatively low. Over the
entire NDS HC1 activities, 28 percent of the listed level 1 activities (laws and regulations)
vii
were achieved. Level 2 activities had a similar achievement rate (24% achieved or good
progress) related to establishing centres or building infrastructure or systems. The lowest
achievement rates were related to those activities connected to trainings or contracting
people (15%). This is triangulated from stakeholder observations in interviews.
20. The implications for sustainability of the results is that the results of the NDS HC1 are not
likely to be able to be sustained. The most gains have been in the foundations established by
the creation of the necessary draft laws and regulations and the beginning of the
establishment of systems and assets accompanying the measures. However, there remains
more to be done in terms of training and contracting the people – to build the requisite
technical capacity – to manage the assets or implement the laws.
Conclusions and Recommendations
21. Based on the patterns in the findings, a few key observations stand out as important
regarding the first NDS HC1 for Kosovo and implications for the next design process.
22. Build on the achievements of the existing NDS HC1. Although slower than
anticipated, there has been progress towards a number of the current NDS HC1 measures
and activities. A new NDS HC1 should include a review of progress milestones to date in the
respective measures including an overview of the state of progress towards each measure.
23. Reframe the NDS HC1 towards a more strategic, human development
orientation. This includes restructuring the NDS HC1 architecture towards a ‘strategy of
strategies’ rather than a prioritization of priorities. Reorienting the NDS HC1 towards
human development rather than exclusively on human capital. Because a national
development strategy should involve all aspects that connect to quality of life for citizens, the
strategy should encompass more than economic growth. The NDS HC1 should maintain a
multi-year scope for bridging mandates and should continue to be aligned with the 2030
agendas of the EU and the SDGs. The strategy should integrate transversal priorities of
gender, equity, access, and environmental sustainability more visibly across all pillars
measures and activities.
24. Integrate the NDS HC1 more closely into existing government systems. This
includes ensuring the integration of the NDS HC1 sectoral strategies and workplans through
a stronger cross-check mechanism. Establishing Administrative Instructions for the Budget
Department of the Ministry of Finance, Labour, and Transfers (MFLT) on NDS HC1 costing
opinions and resource prioritization and revising the budget law for clarifying roles and
responsibilities in ministry budget departments. Finally, consider establishing
Administrative Instructions from the Ministry of Local Government to Municipalities for
prioritizing budgeting for NDS HC1 activities at the municipality level.
25. Increase the mechanisms for accountability and reporting against the NDS HC1.
This includes developing systems for tracking progress against the NDS HC1 activities
including reporting on the completion of NDS HC1 activities in Ministry workplans. Develop
monitoring and reporting templates that disaggregate achievements and expenditures by
NDS HC1 measures and activities which should be shared with the OPM and Assembly
annually. Increase the alignment of existing management data through linking databases
and increased sharing of data between Ministries and departments. Increase public
monitoring of the NDS HC1 through publishing of raw data for public dashboards.
26. Systematize high level political ownership of the NDS HC1. The NDS HC1 currently
is highly dependent on individual motivations which can fluctuate through government
transitions. Political will for supporting the NDS HC1 should seek to be strengthened
through systematizing the NDS HC1 ownership including broad based political
representation at supervisory and management levels beyond the OPM and SPO itself. One
viii
way to do this would be through the formation of an expanded NDS HC1 Steering Committee
comprised of a combination of OPM and Assembly representation and including civil society
to build increased external accountability and ownership of the NDS. This committee would
have to have a mandate for annual review of the NDS HC1 progress. In addition to the legal
alignment cross-check mechanisms referred to earlier, this could include empowering the
SPO for coordinating with other government bodies responsible for the elaboration of
government workplans and resourcing to enforce greater attention to the integration of NDS
HC1 activities and measures in government resourcing, workplans, and reporting.
27. Recommendations:3
28. The following recommendations are focused on the HC1 pillar only as this is the scope of the
evaluation. However, the overarching recommendations would have relevance for informing
the overall NDS as well.
Recommendation 1: NDS HC1 Measure Progress Review. The SPO/OPM should support a review process in
the design of the new NDS HC1 that describes existing milestones achieved in each measure and identifies which next
steps are required in each measure. This could be part of a SWOT analysis for the upcoming NDS design but could
also be based on the data provided in this evaluation report.
Recommendation 2: Strategy of Strategies Architecture. The SPO/OPM should re-orient the NDS HC1 focus
towards emphasizing the NDS HC1 as a strategic compass to orient other sectoral strategies.
Recommendation 3: Sustainable Development Orientation. The SPO/OPM should re-orient the NDS HC1
focus not solely towards economic growth but to also include a more holistic development agenda that visibilize
sustainability and wellbeing elements.
Recommendation 4: External Frameworks Alignment. The SPO/OPM should refine the alignment of the NDS
HC1 with the SDGs and Implementation of the SAA frameworks through better integration and monitoring of these
frameworks. The NDS HC1 could become the overarching tool for the localization of the SDGs in line with the SDG
Resolution.
Recommendation 5: Strategic Results and Action Plan. The SPO/OPM should maintain the existence of an
NDS HC1 Action Plan and Performance Results Framework in the new NDS HC1, but these should be aligned with the
strategic re-orientation of the NDS HC1 to be more a strategic compass rather than a project action plan.
Recommendation 6: Sectoral Planning Integration. The SPO/OPM should strengthen how the NDS HC1 is
integrated into the ongoing national planning system and the NDS HC1 should serve as the basis for the development
of sectoral strategies and workplans.
Recommendation 7: Sectoral Cross-check mechanism. The SPO/OPM should update the guidelines and
Administrative Instructions for strategy development to establish a strengthened cross-check mechanism to ensure
that sectoral strategies and workplans are in alignment with the NDS HC1.
Recommendation 8: Resourcing Integration. The SPO/OPM should establish a strengthened mechanism to
ensure funding of NDS HC1 activities through Ministerial budget allocation.
Recommendation 9: Sub-national Integration. The SPO/OPM should establish a strengthened mechanism to
ensure the linkages of the NDS HC1 strategies with municipal planning and resourcing.
Recommendation 10: Strengthened internal monitoring. The SPO/OPM should establish a strengthened
mechanism to ensure the systematic internal monitoring of NDS HC1 progress through mandated data collection
exercises related to both financial allocations and expenditures and activity progress.
Recommendation 11: Establish a civil society monitoring of the NDS HC1. The SPO/OPM should establish
a mechanism to ensure there is a public monitoring of NDS HC1 progress.
Recommendation 12: Political Ownership Structures. The SPO/OPM should establish a strengthened
mechanism to ensure there is sufficient political ownership of the NDS HC1 by including both broad-based political
representation from different levels in steering committees commissioned to review progress against the NDS HC1
and instruct follow-up when implementation delays occur.
3 Recommendations in the executive summary only include key headlines. The recommendations in table 13 provide the more
detailed sub-recommendations as part of the overall action plan.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
1. This Evaluation Report (ER) is for the end of cycle evaluation of the Human Capital4 Pillar
(HC1) of the Kosovo National Development Strategy (NDS) 2016-2021. This evaluation is
commissioned by the Strategic Planning Office (SPO) within the Office of the Prime Minister
(OPM) of Kosovo and supported by UNICEF Kosovo and covers the period of the NDS from
2016-2021. The timing of this evaluation aims to inform the Kosovo Institutions and the
Office of the Prime Minister, and other stakeholders on the progress of the NDS and lessons
learned and to present recommendations for informing the design and development of the
next cycle of the NDS (2022-2030).
2. Inception Phase. During the inception phase (April-July 2021), the evaluation team and
evaluation manager (EM) gathered relevant background information on the NDS and the
context in which it is being implemented; as well as identified different stakeholders for
interviewing regarding their priority areas of learning from the evaluation; and to begin
making detailed plans for the data collection and analysis phases of the process. Desk review
of shared documentation were reviewed prior to the finalization of the Inception Report (IR).
3. Representatives from different stakeholder groups were consulted during the inception
phase, including the Strategic Planning Office (SPO) in the Office of the Prime Minister
(OPM) and UNICEF.5 One significant issue identified during the inception mission has been
that the drafting of the next NDS was already ongoing. As a consequence, the evaluation
process would need to take measures, such as the sharing of preliminary findings to feed into
the new NDS design process, even before the evaluation exercise could be completed. The
inception phase also identified the importance of a learning-focused approach in the
evaluation including planning for the elaboration of two workshops for capacity
strengthening; one just after the inception phase for technical staff regarding general
evaluation principles, and one during the reporting phase to facilitate the development of
management response and action steps based on the NDS HC1 evaluation recommendations.
These are described in more detail in subsequent sections of this ER. As part of the learning-
focused approach, the NDS HC1 evaluation process included the participation of youth
volunteers who accompanied the evaluation process as part of a practicum process and for
professional development. This youth-accompanied component is described in more detail
in section 4.2 and the Terms of Reference is included in Annex 11.
Context Description
4. Kosovo is categorized as upper middle-income with a GDP per capita in 2021 estimated at
US$4,312.6 According to the World Bank, Kosovo is “one of the four places in Europe that
have experienced economic growth since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008.”7
Despite the growth trend, inequality is high, and children and youth are particularly
vulnerable. With 18 percent of the population living below the poverty line, Kosovo remains
to be the poorest in Europe.8 Kosovo has one of the highest percentages of economically
inactive populations in Europe 9According to the 2020 (Third quarter) Labour Force Survey
(LFS), the inactive workforce in Kosovo is considerably high at 69.9 percent, with a major
disparity between women (85.6 percent) and men (53.8%).10 The general employment rate is

population and is viewed in terms of its contribution and value to Kosovo economic development.

30.1 percent with youth and women among the most disadvantageous in the market force.11
The non-tradable sectors dominate the economy and the jobs market followed by industry
(17.5% of GDP), manufacture (11% of GDP), and agriculture (8% of GDP).12 Kosovo’s
economic growth is also heavily reliant on remittances. The rural areas have lower economic
and social indicators and thus are more vulnerable than the urban areas.13 Table 1 presents
an overview of Kosovo’s key indicators.

5. Administratively Kosovo is divided into 38 municipalities. A strong focus of the government
in the last decade has been over the decentralization process as a way to improve services at
the local level, increase local representation and defuse ethnic tension.15 The decentralization
has however highlighted discrepancies in full and equitable child rights such as variable
quality in resourcing for educational attainment and access to health services and lack of
capacity at the local level to implement various reforms.16 In terms of reforms, Kosovo has
signed a number of key EU agreements including the EU-Kosovo Stabilization and
Association Agreement (SAA) in late 2015 and is implementing the European Reform
Agenda (ERA) since 2016 as “a useful tool to guide the implementation of EU related
reforms in the SAA context .”17 The 2019 EU Report on Kosovo emphasis the progress made
by Kosovo in aligning to EU legislation and implementing certain EU-related reforms.
Kosovo has shown also good regional collaboration and participation in most regional fora.
6. Overall public expenditure on social services has increased over time but remains relatively
low and insufficient to ensure universal access and coverage. Education and health, two of
the significant building blocks for the development of human capital, are underfunded, and
this is a key reason behind the Human Capital Index (HCI) score of 56 percent. The HCI
indicates that children are only reaching 56 percent of the potential they would have had
with complete education and full health. This is a loss of 44 percent of their potential
earnings because governments are not currently making effective investments in their people
to ensure a healthy, educated, and resilient population ready for the workplace of the
future.18
7. Currently, social services in Kosovo are decentralized at the municipality level, however, the
funding, as well as several services such as the services for children without parental care,
services for people with disabilities, and others, remain centralized at the national level. The
fund allocation for social services in health and education is below the EU average. The
spending on health is 3.8 percent of the GDP, which is significantly lower than the EU
average of 7.1 percent.19 Similarly, the spending on education is comparatively low at 4.1

percent of GDP, with most of the funding spent on wages.20 Social protection spending has
seen an increase in recent years form 3.6 percent of the GDP in 2009 to 6.1 percent of the
GDP in 2016.21 The coverage of the population by social protection programs, in particular
social assistance among vulnerable groups, remains low.22 As a result, according to the
Human Capital Index, a child born in Kosovo today will be 57 per cent as productive under
the current human capital conditions than if they had enjoyed a complete education and full
health support.23
8. Youth and Economic Empowerment. Kosovo has a very young population with over
half of its 1.8 million inhabitants under 30 years of age and 31 percent under the age of 18.24
As these citizens age into the workforce, there is opportunity to take advantage of this
“demographic dividend” to spur economic development if appropriately seized. Some
estimates project that by 2030, the adult population within the workforce ages will have
increased by 10 percent.25 However, according to the policy notes for the initial NDS design,
there is concern that significant migration from Kosovo of working age and educated young
people can accelerate population ageing and reduce the advantages of this demographic
dividend. According to a UNICEF study on the demographic dividend in Kosovo developed
in 2015, the window of opportunity to rely on this potential labour force to spur economic
development can be narrow and is expected to close by the mid-2030s. Key policy
recommendations to take advantage of this opportunity suggested by the UNICEF research
would focus on investment in human capital, enhancing labour market mobility, reducing
barriers for female labour participation, strengthening savings, and creating new
opportunities for employment. Adapting education and technical training to meet the
demands of the emerging labour market is a particularly important foundational concept for
taking advantage of this emerging dividend in Kosovo.26
9. Education. The NDS has prioritized investing in human capital in education through the
expansion of preschool education.27 Access to early education programmes for children aged
36-59 months is very low at 15 percent compared to an EU average of over 80 percent.28 The
development-focused family practices are poor, leading to low child development indexes
particularly for the cognitive dimension.29 Quality and inclusive education in Kosovo remain
key concerns. There is a lack of data for the inclusion of children with disability and their
access to education. The enrolment of children from Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian
communities in compulsory education is below the national average at 85.5 percent for
primary and 64.4 percent for lower secondary, while upper secondary school enrolment is
31.1 percent.30 Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian girls are more disadvantageous than boys and
are often forced to early marriage.31 Learning inequality can also be observed in the
achievement gap between the poorest and richest students, estimated at 1.5 years of
schooling for Kosovo (66 PISA points).32 The World Bank (2020) states that “children in

Kosovo who start school at age 4 can expect to complete 13.2 years of pre-primary, primary
and secondary school by age 18. However, when years of schooling are adjusted for quality of
learning, this is only equivalent to 7.9 years: a learning gap of 5.3 years.”33 The 2018 PISA34
results suggest that over 78 percent of 15-year-olds in Kosovo are functionally illiterate
(performing below Level 2 of proficiency in PISA).35 In 2020, among youth aged 7-14, only
41 percent had foundational literacy36 and 42 percent had foundational numeracy37.38 The
high unemployment rates among those with tertiary education (20.7 percent in Q3 2020)
indicates a mismatch between the education system outcomes and labour market needs.39
10. Gender: The situation of women in Kosovo is influenced by strong social norms, social
expectations, and traditional practices. Gender roles are constructed at the family and are
reinforced in school and community settings. Conservative social norms result in the low
participation of women in the labour force and in society in general. Although there are no
reliable information on the prevalence of women being subjected to gender based violence
over their lifetimes, one quarter of women from 15-49 years of age justify their partner’s
violence toward them.40 Only one in five women of working age are active in the labour
market as opposed to three in five men.41 Other barriers for women’s participation as
valuable members include family responsibilities, limited access to quality and affordable
child and elder care, the high cost of maternity leave for employers and women’s limited
access to assets and productive inputs.42
11. Policy Framework: During the period under review, Kosovo established several key
central plans and documents to create the foundation for an equitable and more inclusive
society. These include general sectoral strategies for each ministry, the Child Rights
Monitoring Strategy and Action Plan 2019-2023. The Concept Document of the Law on
Local Finances has also foreseen the creation of the specific grant for social services
approved by the Government, and the Concept Document on Social and Family services will
clearly define the mandate of different institutions including coverage, types and quality of
services, monitoring and inspection, and financing.43 Finally, the approval of the Child
Protection Law in 2019 confirmed the commitment of stakeholders to establishing an
integrated child protection mechanism throughout Kosovo.44
Subject of the Evaluation: NDS 2016-2021 - Human Capital Pillar
Overview, Pillars, and Alignment
12. The NDS (2016-2021) is the first one developed by the Kosovo Government and serves as a
strategic document for all development planning in Kosovo. The NDS aimed to develop a list
of priorities under an umbrella strategy which would allow building synergies between
initiatives, prevent institutional overlap, and yield higher performance efficiency, orientation
of support of the development partners and establish a basis for public accountability. The
NDS is organized across four thematic pillars: human capital, good governance, industrial

development, and infrastructural development. As a supplement to the NDS, the NDS
Roadmap, prepared in 2017, outlined a more detailed implementation plan which included
costing, as well as implementation and activity indicators.
13. Pillar 1: Human Capital (HC1), the subject of this evaluation, is oriented around the
promotion, creation, and sustaining of a productive, skilled, and innovative labour force.
The underlying logic is that this is a determining factor for successful national development.
This is predicated on assumptions that as the labour force acquires higher skills, there will be
a subsequent increase in incomes and a general improvement in the economy. Skills are not
only defined as technical skills, but also include cognitive skills, such as logic and reasoning,
as well as ‘soft’ skills such as interpersonal skills or values. Building these skills is heavily
linked to the education system and the quality of education provided pre-workforce entry,
although labour market skill increases may also come from migration to other settings and
subsequent ‘brain gain’ from diaspora returnees.
14. In terms of overall resource allocation for the NDS, the bulk of the resourcing for the NDS is
allocated to Pillar 4: Infrastructure Development ,which comprises nearly 95 percent of the
total resourcing for the NDS. In comparison, Pillar 1: Human Capital comprises 3.4 percent
of the total resourcing, and it is the second highest resourced pillar, with about 3-4 times the
amount of resourcing as Pillar 2 (Good Governance) and Pillar 3 (Competitive Industries)
(Table 2). This suggests that although all Pillars are considered necessary for national
development, there has been an extra attention given to infrastructure development in
comparison to the other pillars. The following Figure summarizes the relative resourcing
estimates based on the initial resourcing plan for the NDS.

15. Macro-Impact contributions: The NDS articulates a series of 16 macro-level indicators
that should reflect positive changes if the NDS measures are successful. These are clustered
under four general categories: Economic Growth, Labour Market, Social Cohesion, and
Investments and Trade (Table 3). Although all pillars contribute either directly or indirectly
towards all macro-level indicators, the most relevant indicators for the human capital pillar
are those related to the labour market. The GAP Institute recently completed a review of the
progress of some of these macro-level indicators to 201945. Some of the social cohesion
indicators are not included as they had not been remeasured before the GAP report was

16. There are no macro-level indicators that specifically focus on the education system capacity
itself but there are associated performance indicators for the education system described in
the NDS Roadmap such as PISA score improvements. Annex 3 provides a more detailed
description of all performance indicators associated with the Human Capital Pillar at the
macro and activity level.
17. NDS Framework Alignment: Although the main focus of the NDS has been economic
growth, the implementation of the NDS was meant to serve as a vehicle to also advance
Kosovo’s European Integration agenda. As a result, at the time of the design of the NDS in
2016, there were attempts to harmonize the NDS measures with the National Stabilization
Association Agreement (SAA) and its implementation programme for the adoption of EU
acquis.
18. NDS HC1: The subject of the evaluation is the NDS HC1 component inside the overarching
NDS and all subsequent analysis and findings are reported against the NDS HC1 only.
Although there is not a specific Theory of Change (TOC) for the NDS HC1, there are implicit
assumptions embedded in the measures and rationale behind the Human Capital Pillar that
imply what are the key barriers impeding human capital development in Kosovo and entry
into the labour market. These implied barriers and assumptions for redress embedded in
the policy notes for the NDS HC1 are an “implied TOC”.
19. The NDS HC1 and the NDS HC1 Roadmap indicate that the major key barrier to entry into
the labour market is insufficient skills and knowledge of the population – particularly the
youth population (15-24 years). Three key barriers impede human capital development in
Kosovo: i) Children are not entering into education programmes or are entering too late, ii)
The quality of the education provided in schools is insufficient to build human capital, iii)
The educational system and curriculum is not adapted to the knowledge and skills needs of

the modern labour market. These barriers form the foundation of activities within the
Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology55 with a particular emphasis towards
building schools and setting up the certification and accountability mechanisms.
20. A second key barrier is that citizens are reluctant to enter the labour market because of poor
treatment including the lack of contracts and poor working conditions. This is somewhat at
odds with the stated logic of the first barrier – that it is the population itself that is lacking in
the sufficient human capital to enter the labour market.
21. The third key barrier implied in the measures is that the human capital is low in the Kosovo
population because of the brain drain within the diaspora and that the human capital can be
strengthened by developing incentives to attract and contract diaspora to engage in the
labour market within Kosovo (or the education system).
22. Because of these barriers, the NDS HC1 places a strong emphasis on measures seeking to
strengthen the education system, and its connection and applicability to the labour market
and the economy. There are seven distinct measures articulated under Pillar 1 (Table 4). A
full description of the NDS measures, activities, lead agencies, and costing is found in Annex
3.
TABLE 4: HUMAN CAPITAL PILLAR MEASURES
Measure Rationale
1. Increased inclusion This will allow better success at higher levels of education, decrease
of children in pre- inequality, and increase the participation of women in the labour
school institutions market. Children may learn while their mother is working.
2. Improved quality of This is a pre-requisite for better success of the education system and
teaching in the strengthening the skills of youth for the labour market. As teachers
primary and become more qualified, the quality of education received by the
secondary education children should improve.
3. Improved correlation This will contribute to driving down unemployment and promote the
between skills growth of Kosovar industries. Students from vocational schools or
acquired in education universities should therefore find it easier to obtain employment upon
and labour market completion of studies as well as practical work during their studies.

6. Decreased level of Formal employment allows for better protection of workers and more
informal employment structured advancements. Workers should be able to benefit from
pensions, better access loans, and work under better labour conditions.
7. Concrete recruitment This will allow for the transfer of skills and knowledge obtained by the
of experts and diaspora community abroad for the national development of Kosovo
diaspora students and strengthen ties to their homeland. Technology experts may be
financially supported while developing projects for Kosovo institutions
or private companies for long-term production.
23. In 2018, the Kosovo Assembly adopted the Resolution on Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). The SDGs were closely aligned and reported as part of the NDS HC1 including the
integration of additional core social indicators in health, education, employment, and social

welfare.56 The NDS HC1 alignment with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was
intended to accelerate the SDG implementation agenda for Kosovo. In addition, the NDS
was aligned with the sectoral strategies aiming to maximize results for economic
development, education, and employment. The NDS HC1 is aligned with the SDG
framework – reflected in the NDS HC1 action plan of 2017. In terms of equity and human
rights, the NDS HC1 articulates action steps for improving systems that provide services to
all. However, two vulnerable populations described in the Human Capital pillar are women
and rural populations who have limited access to national services.
NDS Implementation and Progress
24. The Implementation of the NDS was envisioned to become an essential component of the
Integrated Planning System in Kosovo. The rationale for its centrality included the following
assumptions: the NDS measures should have priority in resource allocation and will be
monitored closely, including the Prime Minister’s direct attention; the NDS measures should
receive full financial coverage, with preferential access to any additional resources from the
government budget or development partners as available; Ministers and Institutions
responsible for NDS priorities should develop clear guidelines for NDS implementation of its
objectives. It was recognized the two key challenges would include potential political
turnover as well as the difficulty in tracking expenditures within the financial system in
alignment with the activities planned within the NDS.
25. In 2018, a mid-term review (MTR) was carried out of the NDS implementation and its
progress. The report noted that for NDS HC1, strong progress had been achieved in some
important areas such as the professional development of teachers and the introduction of
national student examinations to measure learning achievements. In addition, the mid-term
review noted that, the anticipated rollout of a new education information system at the time
was assumed to be nearly complete and upgrading school inspections has progressed.57
Related measures for reducing informal employment and improvements in labour market
inspections were also cited.
26. The MTR report also noted that delays under the pillar were often linked to systemic changes
and the ongoing institutional development. For example, the Standards and Evaluation
Agency had not yet been established because of a wider public administration reform was
undertaking a review of executive agencies. This led to delays in the capacity development of
the National Qualification Agency and Kosovo Accreditation Agency which in turn had a
knock-on effect of delaying implementation of a teacher grading and licensing system, and
key tools for professional education, such as forecasting or reviewing financial formula were
also delayed. The MTR also noted that there had been little done to attract diaspora experts
and students to the national education system. The report highlighted a series of potential
adjustments and recommendations for implementation.
27. In 2021, the process began for the conceptualization and design of the new NDS (2022-
2030). Due to Government transitions, the MTR recommendations were not followed up on
but can still be taken into consideration in the design of the new NDS. The new NDS design
is expected to be completed by 2022 and the findings from this evaluation of the current
NDS should inform the design of the NDS and the selection of activities in the NDS action
plan. The following table summarizes the important process landmarks in the current NDS.

28. Stakeholders. The leading stakeholders involved in the implementation of the NDS
Human Capital Pillar involve three key Government Ministries as well as a range of
supporting institutions. At the time of the design of the NDS HC1, the key Ministries were
the Ministry of Education, Science, Technology, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare,
and the Ministry of Diaspora.58 The supporting institutions include academic, business, and
development entities. Academic entities include: The Pedagogic Institute of Kosovo, Kosovo
Accreditation Agency, and National Qualification Authority, Private and Public Universities,
Student Networks, and schools. Business related entities include: The Kosovo Chamber of
Commerce, Innovation Centre Kosovo, Professionals Networks, and private businesses.
Development and Administrative entities such as UNDP, GIZ, and Donors.
29. Stakeholder Interests in the Evaluation. A range of stakeholders both inside and
outside of UNICEF and the Office of the Prime Minister have interests in the results of the
evaluation and many were asked to play a role in the evaluation process (Annex 6). Citizens
are key stakeholders as ultimate recipients of the NDS HC1 measures. Other key
stakeholders include institutions of Kosovo as well as those directly and indirectly
responsible for design and implementation of the NDS - including representatives from line
ministries, central and local levels, implementing partners and donors.
2.0 EVALUATION FEATURES
Evaluation Purpose and Objectives
30. As described in the TOR, this evaluation is intended to be a formative evaluation of the work
completed under Pillar 1 of the Kosovo NDS (2016-2021) and will contribute to the design of
the next NDS. The evaluation has three objectives:
• To assess relevance, effectiveness, sustainability, efficiency, synergies, and longer-
term changes associated with the NDS – Human Capital Pillar - including the
priority and programmatic choices made in relation to other sectoral strategies and
priorities and the changing socio-economic context in Kosovo.
• Provide an independent performance assessment of the NDS 2016-2021 – Human
Capital Pillar – seen in relation to expected results as indicated in the NDS
roadmap monitoring framework for which the promotion of equity and gender
equality are considered to form an integral part.
• Identify lessons learned and forward-looking recommendations that can inform the
development of the NDS 2030.
31. The evaluation focussed on the three main objectives by applying primarily qualitative
methods. The organizational scope of the evaluation was to focus on the national level results
achieved under the Human Capital Pillar, in line with the over-arching priorities of the NDS.
This required a review of the development process and interconnected strategic choices. It is
58 The Ministries were recently restructured. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology is, at the time of this report,
now called the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MESTI), the Ministry of Labour and social welfare is now
integrated under the Ministry of Finance, Labour and Transfers (MFLT), and the Ministry of Diaspora is now integrated into
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Diaspora. For the purposes of the report, the original names of the ministries are cited
throughout as they were the structure for the majority of the NDS cycle.

not anticipated that the evaluation will cover the other NDS pillars nor is it expected that the
evaluation will assess the overall NDS.
32. The evaluation reviewed the relevant strategies and knowledge products relevant to the
Human Capital Pillar with a focus on education, skills development, and market needs. A
focus included in the TOR pertains to the issues related to equity and whether these address
and contribute to human rights, SDGs, and gender mainstreaming. The original Evaluation
Questions (EQ) did not necessarily reflect these components explicitly, but they have been
treated as cross-cutting themes throughout the evaluation. For example, when exploring
how monitoring or implementation is carried out, an assessment was done on the extent to
which human rights or equity issues have been considered in the activities implemented.
33. Lessons and recommendations described in the TOR were to include (but not be limited to)
four components: a) the process of stakeholder inclusion and participation in the design of
the NDS;59 b) the appropriateness and type of pillars chosen and associated priorities;60 c)
adjustments to activities to enhance contributions to Kosovo;61 and d) mainstreaming the
implementation and ownership of the NDS measures, monitoring, and reporting within the
Government.62
34. A Lessons learned exercise on the design process of the 2014-2015 NDS preparation was
supported by the European Commission, and this can serve as a foundation for the
elaboration of the contemporary lessons learned.
35. Based on these expectations, the TOR presented an initial set of questions and sub-questions
to be explored within each of these criteria (Annex 1). These TOR questions were
subsequently refined during the inception consultations and the refinements are described
in Section 4.1.
36. Time Period under Review: Activities conducted from the beginning of the NDS HC1
design in 2015 through to March 2021 are included in the scope of the evaluation.
37. Evaluation Use: The evaluation will serve the dual and mutually reinforcing objectives of
accountability and learning but with an emphasis on learning. For accountability, the
evaluation will assess, and report on, the performance and results achieved (intended or
unintended, positive, or negative) of the NDS HC1. For learning, the evaluation will
determine the reasons why, and how, certain processes and results occurred the way they
did; draw lessons and derive good practices with pointers for learning from them. It will
provide evidence-based findings to inform strategic decision-making around human capital
development strategies in Kosovo. Lessons learnt from this evaluation are intended to be
utilized to refine and improve the design of the next NDS and the implementation of its
activities.
38. Expected Users of the Evaluation: The expected users for this evaluation are the SPO in
the OPM, Kosovo institutions and other partners in NDS decision-making, notably related to
adjustments in NDS HC1 implementation and/or design, and to support discussions with
stakeholders regarding the elaboration of the next NDS for Kosovo. The evaluation will also
serve to inform the Kosovo Government and an array of Ministries, Departments and
Offices, the United Nations Agencies, donors, and CSOs on the lessons learned from the NDS
HC1 and to present recommendations for future NDS HC1 activities based on the essential
findings.

Evaluation TOR Questions
39. During the inception mission, the ET reviewed the original TOR questions with the SPO and
other NDS stakeholders to consider how to adapt the exercise to the most relevant needs of
the Kosovo Government.
40. This reflection and consultation were partly necessitated due to the timing of the NDS HC1
evaluation with respect to the overall process for the development of the next NDS (2022-
2030) and to elicit the perspectives of the stakeholders who had not heretofore been
involved in the construction of the original TOR questions. Table 6 presents the refined TOR
questions for the entire evaluation. The implied TOC analysis and review of assumptions
will serve as one of the cross-cutting exercises for informing the findings against these
evaluation questions. For example, were the assumptions regarding the needs alignment
and subsequent selection of the NDS HC1 measures accurate? Did the proposed measures
logically connect to the achievement of the described objectives?

63 Effectiveness as an OECD principle usually focused on the contribution of activities and interventions to immediate
outcomes. In the context of this evaluation, this is interpreted as the effectiveness of the implementation process of the NDS.
64 Efficiency as an evaluation dimension usually explores two categories. First, the timely completion of planned activities and
second, the cost-effectiveness of the activities implemented. For the purposes of this evaluation, the first category is integrated
into EQ4 under Effectiveness leaving the only the second category to be explored in this section.
65 The TOR provides examples such as the Kosovo Education Strategy and Action Plan (2017-2021), the Social Welfare Sectoral
Strategy (2018-2022), and the Youth Strategy (2019-2023) and suggests exploring others during the inception phase.

Evaluation Methodology
41. The evaluation used a mixed-methods approach, drawing on three general sources of
information across different levels of stakeholders: i) Pre-existing documentation (e.g.
policies, donor reports, external research); ii) Pre-existing quantitative or qualitative
information (e.g. national-level demographic indicators, programme indicator
measurement, internal datasets); and iii) Primary qualitative information. Principles of
participation, empowerment, and appreciative inquiry were integrated into the design, tools,
and analysis exercises. Based on the evaluation questions, an evaluation matrix (Annex 5)
was developed that described the linkages between information and analysis sources used to
identify findings and build conclusions. Further details regarding the methodology can be
found in Annex 6. The interview guides for the KIIs are found in Annex 7.
42. The evaluation approach had to be adjusted to account for the COVID-19 pandemic and the
subsequent travel restrictions. These restrictions meant that the evaluation shifted to a fully
remote approach in which all the interviews – key informant interviews, focus group
discussions, and surveys – were carried out through virtual platforms. Three in-person
learning workshops were carried out during the inception phase and initial data collection
phase. These were intended to provide feedback on initial findings and observations, orient
key stakeholders to key evaluation principles and practices and align emerging findings to
inform the design processes of the new NDS currently under development. The following

43. The evaluation team was composed of two evaluators. The evaluation team was also
shadowed by six student volunteers to amplify youth participation and as capacity
building for the youth. The student volunteers participated in the virtual interviews,
12
supporting the evaluation team (ET) with notetaking in the data analysis and writing up
their impressions and thoughts on the NDS and the evaluation process. The youth
volunteers also participated in the debriefing sessions and data analysis exercises and helped
build the conclusions and recommendations for the evaluation.
44. During the data collection phase, the evaluation team interviewed 56 stakeholders (65
percent women) through KIIs. These stakeholders represented the diversity of stakeholder
categories connected to the NDS (Annex 9). For each KII, evaluation notes were compiled
into a standardized template labelled by stakeholder and activity (Annex 7). The majority of
the interviews were conducted virtually using Skype, Zoom or phone calls. However, some
KIIs were able to be carried out in person by the national team member based in Prishtina.
45. Data analysis. Data analysis was conducted as a set of integrated briefings throughout the
data collection phase through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous exercises.
For the synchronous exercises, sessions were held over Zoom and using the Mural platform
for visual organization. In the asynchronous work, team members were invited to do their
own “homework” in Google Sheets set up against the evaluation matrix and in Mural in
advance of each meeting. This approach allowed members to have time to reflect as well as to
brainstorm together.
46. The evaluation team reviewed the responses from stakeholders, the quantitative data, and
the document review to generate findings and conclusions against the TOR evaluation
questions. All three main types of data (document, quantitative, and qualitative) had their
accompanying management and analyses. Data analysis methods employed descriptive and
comparative quantitative analysis, thematic narrative analysis, qualitative iterative data
analysis, and contribution analysis. Key thought units were identified in interviews and then
clustered into categories. Emergent themes from each category were selected for further
analysis and re-categorization to identify key patterns. The data analysis is further detailed
in Annex 6. All methods were triangulated both internally and across methods as feasible.
47. Due to the importance of the triangulation of findings from different sources, a vital
component of the data analysis was the analysis debriefings at the end of the data collection
phase. They were used to substantiate the findings and to develop conclusions and
recommendations in response to the TOR questions. Triangulation involved comparing
information from different sources, collected by different evaluators, and obtained from
different methods.66 In alignment with the evaluation's utilization-focused principle, initial
findings and conclusions were shared with the SPO/OPM and other stakeholders from the
Kosovo Government as part of the learning workshops mentioned earlier.
48. Evaluation Limitations. The evaluation was able to keep to the intended plan and
methodology although there were some delays due to the summer month calendars in
Government and the availability of stakeholders for interviews. The ET is confident of the
robustness of the identified patterns and the relevance of the lessons learned to inform the
new NDS design. The most significant limitation to the evaluation – as well as being an
important element in the lessons learned – relates to the availability of management
information67 regarding the implementation of the NDS HC1 measures and activities. The
management information does exist, but it is highly dispersed among ministries and not
easily connected to the NDS itself – but rather oriented to other sectoral strategies,
government workplans, or other Aid platforms. The data is also not easily available to access
by non-Government representatives. The limited availability of the quantitative
management data and lower-level indicators limits the availability of the degree to which the
quantitative data could be used in the findings. Qualitative data from KIIs was able to
provide general overviews of progress and could be used to cover some of these gaps. In
66 See ALNAP. Evaluation of Humanitarian Action: Pilot Guide, ODI, 2013:140 for definitions of each type of triangulation.
67 Internal monitoring and reporting by Government against the implementation of the NDS HC1 activities and measures.

addition, the emerging importance of process-oriented consideration and management
considerations were able to be assessed through the qualitative data collected in the
interviews.
3.0 EVALUATION FINDINGS
Overview
49. The presentation of the findings is structured according to the evaluation TOR questions and
subsequent evaluation matrix. For purposes of flow in the narrative, some evaluation TOR
questions are combined. When this occurs an introductory paragraph clarifies which
questions are being combined and the logic behind the combining. The findings represent
the triangulation of different sources including pre-existing quantitative data,
documentation, and interviews. References to a particular source, such as key informant
interviews, are added for highlighting or illustrative purposes.
Relevance
50. This section assesses the alignment of the NDS HC1 to existing needs of Kosovo including
strategies, policies, and changes in conditions. The TOR questions focused on three
dimensions - the degree to which the NDS HC1 design was evidence based, aligned with the
needs of Kosovo and the degree to which the NDS HC1 adapted to emerging priorities.
However, in the course of the qualitative interviews, three additional relevance
considerations emerged that were seen by stakeholders to have a strong influence on NDS
HC1 performance. These were related to the architecture of the NDS HC1, the relevance of
the NDS HC1 integration into existing government processes (such as budgeting, reporting,
and monitoring) and the relevance of the NDS HC1 for Government itself – the degree of
political ownership of the NDS HC1 within Kosovo governments. Because these elements
affect the potential sustainability of the NDS HC1, these are included in sustainability and
only the relevance to NDS HC1 design are covered in this section.
51. Needs and Evidence. The NDS HC1 needs assessment and context analysis process had
been evidence based and relied on recruiting external expertise. Document review identified
a number of assessments that were developed in anticipation of the NDS HC1 design.
External expert consultants developed policy notes that served as the basis of the
development in the NDS HC1. Line Ministries gave inputs through Working Groups and
before final approval, public consultations were held. The consensus of all interviewed
stakeholders involved in the design process also confirmed these observations of a rigorous
and evidence-based approach.
52. The policy papers assessing the context identified a range of social, economic, cultural, and
political challenges that could be used to develop the NDS HC1. Out of this range of
potential elements, the two overarching themes selected in the NDS HC1 focused on
strengthening the educational system and improving employability skills among Kosovo
citizens. Employment and education are relevant priorities to the Kosovo context
triangulated from the policy notes, other context assessments carried out by the EU, World
Bank and UN Agencies, and triangulated consensus among interviewed stakeholders at all
levels even if they do not capture the entirety of challenges cited in the situational analyses.
53. Among the examples of the importance of these priorities are the low educational outcomes
and high levels of unemployment. The low PISA scores of 2015 served as an important
notice of the degree of support required to the education system to strengthen the
educational performance of Kosovar youth to match the other European countries. One of
the presumed drivers of the relatively high unemployment rates – especially among youth –
were linked to low employability skills and the lack of linkages between the education system
14
and the labour markets. There were no contradictions among the documentation and
interviews regarding the importance of strengthening the quality of the education system
and the importance of increasing employment rates. For example, the European
Commission Annual reports on Kosovo note the continued need for addressing the skill gaps
in the labour market and continuously highlighted the need for improving the quality of
education and education outcomes. The UNICEF report ‘Kosovo in its early demographic
dividend stage’ noted in 2016 that there was an urgent need to invest in human capital and
increase youth employment and women’s participation in the labour market. The World
Bank Human Capital Index for Kosovo in 2018 showed a learning gap of 5.1 years for 18-
year-olds in Kosovo compared to the European average. Subsequent and contemporary
studies still confirm that the employment and education themes upon which the NDS HC1
priorities are based are still relevant within the HC1 pillar.
54. Relevance of implicit Theory of Change. The NDS HC1 articulates an implicit theory
of change (TOC) that heavily focuses its measures on employment and education themes and
each selected measure is a proposed pathway for change with its own rationale for inclusion
(Table 4). The measures chosen are considered necessary for national development based on
the available studies, but the selected pathways within the implicit TOC for addressing these
overarching themes have gaps or challenges that were identified throughout the NDS cycle.
55. For example, in terms of employability, the NDS HC1 measures focused on informal
contracts and workplace conditions, but these are elements related to those who are already
employed. Employment policies for recruiting those who are unemployed into the
employment ranks was missing from the NDS HC1 measures. Another example emerging
from qualitative interviews noted that one of the key bottlenecks not highlighted in the NDS
HC1 had to do with the relative attractiveness of teaching as a career option. Respondents
reported that university students were prioritizing other professions with pre-university
teaching being perceived as only an option for those who were not qualified for other careers.
This perceived stigma related to pre-university teaching was seen as being one factor that
deterred students from choosing this profession – with a subsequent cascade effect on the
quality of teachers available and the subsequent willingness of teachers to enter preschool
teaching as well.
56. Not only are there gaps within the selected measures for consideration, but the selection of
measures did exclude potential measures that would be necessary to contribute to
strengthening education or employment and there were additional dimensions missing that
would have contributed to national development. For example, at the level of the NDS HC1
itself, there were gaps cited related to the inclusion of health, and social well-being, even as
these indicators are included in the macro-level indicators as part of the HDI indicator under
social cohesion. HDI is a composite measure assessing general quality of life and includes
health, gender equality, education, and social inclusion within its framework.
57. The following table summarizes some of the key gaps both within the selected measures and
among the selected measures that are missing from the implicit TOC.

58. The culmination of a review of the implicit TOC shows gaps both within and among the
selected measures and dimensions leading to an incomplete pathway of change for the NDS
HC1. The elements that are selected are considered necessary for national development of
education and employment but are not sufficient to comprise the entirety of the
considerations that need to be included in an implicit TOC to achieve the macro-level results.
59. This type of “gap” structure of the NDS HC1 is intentional in the design because the NDS
HC1 (and the NDS overall) was framed as a prioritization of the key priorities for
national development. Specifically, the priorities selected for inclusion were those that were
anticipated as being able to attract donor funding or which were aligned with donor
interests. The NDS HC1 did serve as a vehicle for organizing and attracting donor funding,
but the unintended consequences for taking a prioritization of priorities approach are
explored further in the sustainability section.
60. Adaptation and Positioning. There was no evidence from interviews or the
documentation that the NDS HC1 adjusted its measures or activities throughout the cycle to
address these gaps or to integrate emerging new priorities. To a great degree, this was due to
the absence of mechanisms or processes within the NDS HC1 to allow for adjustments.
61. At the time of the design, the NDS document noted that the document should be seen as a
living document to be complement during the coming years through specific sectoral policies
and strategies. However, there were no descriptions of the mechanisms or landmarks that
were to be employed for adjusting the NDS HC1. For example, the NDS HC1 process had a
mid-term review for tracking progress of the identified indicators, but there were no periodic
mandated mid-term review for assessing the needs and priorities of Kosovo or changing
circumstances (such as mass migration, natural disasters, or pandemics) and subsequent
mechanisms for convening decision makers to review and approve new priorities and
17
measures based on these reviews. As a result, the NDS became a relatively static document
rather than an evolving strategy.
62. Furthermore, the NDS HC1 flexibility was unintentionally inhibited because of the
elaboration of the NDS HC1 action plan in 2017. When the NDS was developed in 2016, it
focused on describing the four pillars and measures within the pillars. However, the NDS
HC1 (along with the other pillars) lacked sufficient guidance in describing how the pathways
for change – the activities that would lead to the achievement of these measures – as well as
the operational plans for achieving these measures. In response, in 2017, the NDS HC1
action plan was developed. This included a further elaboration of activities to be addressed
under each measure, a description of which Ministries were responsible for these activities,
and a linkage to the relevant sectoral strategy and expenditure framework. The action plan
also included a detailed costing description describing the relative expected contributions for
the implementation of each activity by government, donors, or to be sought. Key
performance indicators were linked to each activity and sub-activity to provide a thorough
performance results framework.
63. The NDS HC1 action plan was intended to provide an operational roadmap to guide
Ministries (and donors) on how to achieve the targeted measures within the NDS HC1.
However, there was a relatively muted roll-out of the NDS HC1 action plan after its
elaboration and many stakeholders in government ministries – especially those who had
transitioned into their positions after the NDS HC1 design – were not even aware of the NDS
HC1 action plan or their obligations within it. The implication was that the NDS HC1 action
plan, while thorough and detailed, had evolved into a de facto project implementation
framework rather than a national strategy for development. Because of the level of details in
activities, the NDS HC1 action plan was not easily shifted to absorb emerging interests or
new opportunities. As such, it was seen as serving the unintended effect of reducing
potential adaptability of the NDS HC1 and became gradually less relevant to needs as
government transitioned.
64. Relevance of the NDS HC1 within government processes. The NDS HC1 was framed in its
design to prioritize priorities within the Kosovo government. Within the plethora of needs
and directions proposed among all the Government strategies, which were the ones that
were to be most prioritized in terms of donor support and sectoral strategy development?
65. Although the priorities identified in the NDS HC1 are needs, one consequence of this
approach is that the NDS HC1 became more of a vehicle for targeting gaps in existing
services rather than service as a strategic compass to orient sectoral strategies. As noted in
the previous section, the collection of measures in the NDS HC1 do not comprise an
overarching framework but are seen by respondents as highlighting particular areas of
needs. The themes are universally perceived to still be relevant, but the way that the NDS
HC1 focused on specific themes unintentionally reduced the relevance for Ministries. The
NDS HC1 has less capacity to serve as an umbrella strategy to orient Ministries in the
development of their sectoral strategies but became almost a checklist of activities that could
be included in a sectoral strategy.
66. At the time of the development of the NDS HC1, there was an ongoing recognition that the
government was suffering from the existence of too many strategies. The SIGMA report in
2017 noted that in the region, Kosovo was among those having the highest number of central
planning documents, making it difficult for them to ensure coherent and consistent planning
– leading to a backlog in the implementation of these strategies. The NDS was seen as
having the potential to play a role in creating a more connected strategy environment and
reducing or streamlining the strategies. This was most frequently seen in stakeholder
interviews where respondents suggested that the NDS HC1 framing would be more relevant
if it were constructed to serve more as a strategic compass or a ‘strategy of strategies’ – to
18
become a framework to inform the subsequent elaboration of the more detailed Ministerial
strategies.
67. A second concern related to the relevance of the NDS HC1 framing pertained to the economic
growth orientation of the overall NDS HC1. All four pillars almost exclusively focus on what
can promote increased economic growth. The qualitative data highlight that even the term
“human capital” implies that humans are serving as fuel for the economy. As a consequence,
the architecture of the NDS HC1 is less relevant for integrating other forms of human
development, such as health, or equity and access concerns. There was an almost universal
agreement among interviewed respondents, corroborated from contemporary reports
including the mid-term review of the NDS, that the NDS HC1 would be more relevant for
national development if there were a shift from pure economic growth towards a sustainable
development approach and the integration of cross-cutting themes related to gender, equity,
and inclusion throughout all the pillars and subsequent activities.
68. As a consequence, the growth orientation and prioritization of priorities focus of the NDS
HC1 architecture meant that while the elements included in the NDS HC1 are necessary for
the Kosovo context, they are not sufficient for addressing the needs of the Kosovo context.
Further implications of the architecture of the NDS HC1 for shaping NDS HC1 performance
is explored in more detail in Section 3.6 (long-term impact).
Effectiveness and Long-Term Change
69. In the TOR, the effectiveness section evaluates the extent to which the NDS HC1 activities
and interventions were implemented. The effectiveness section covers the achievements of
objectives and targets including the degree of gender mainstreaming within the NDS HC1.
The Long-Term change section explores the extent to which the NDS HC1 can be considered
to have made a contribution to observed progress in human capital including the potential
contributions of the interventions on human rights and equalities. Because these two
sections are connected (implementation and then contributions), these two sections are
combined. First, the effectiveness section profiles the progress of the NDS HC1 in the
implementation of activities and measures. The subsequent contribution of the performance
of activities and measures implemented to national level changes is then described through
reviewing the macro-level indicators and possible connections to NDS HC1 contributions.
Measure and Activity Performance
70. NDS HC1 Progress Indicators: There are three levels of performance indicators in the
NDS HC1: Macro-level economic indicators (for the entire NDS, not just measure 1),
Measure-specific indicators, and Activity level indicators. These are aligned with goal,
outcome, and output results in a performance framework. The macro-level indicators
represent changes in social demographics. The measure specific indicators reflect changes in
individual or organizational behaviours. The activity level indicators represent the changes
in procedures or materials that should lead to behavioural change and are tracked as key
performance indicators (KPIs). The effectiveness section is tracking the latter two levels –
measure specific indicators and the NDS HC1 KPIs for activity performance. The macro-
level contributions is described in the Long-Term Change section.
71. Activity performance. Within the human capital pillar, the NDS HC1 action plan
describes 32 activities linked to the seven measures. In the 2018 mid-term review, the
exercise identified that 66 percent of the activities had been in good progress according to
the NDS action plan calendar at the time. However, no subsequent review was carried out
since 2018 at the level of the individual activities.
72. For the purposes of this report, the more detailed key performance indicators are used to
track progress. There are 101 key performance indicators in the NDS HC1 action plan
19
intended to track the progress of the respective activities. The following table shows the
performance of the NDS HC1 against these KPIs through a stoplight rating as of July 2021.
Green means good progress or completed, yellow means some progress, red means limited
or no progress (or no data available) on the respective KPIs. Assessments were based on
SPO internal monitoring summaries shared with the ET in excel files supplemented by donor
reports, Ministry reports, and interviews with key stakeholders.

73. Out of the 101 KPIs, 23 have made good progress or were completed, 30 have made some
progress while 48 were rated as having limited or no progress yet. The relatively low full
implementation rates are triangulated with other studies on Sectoral policies as well. For
examples, a KEC report in 2020 on the implementation of the Kosovo education sectoral
policy (KESP) reported that of the 264 measures within the KESP, only 19 were fully
achieved (7%).
22
74. The measures and activities that have the highest rates of success are those which were
resourced by donor support. For example, the two measures within the NDS HC1 with the
highest percentage of KPIs reporting at least some progress were Measure 1 (pre-schools)
and Measure 3 (Labour market connections). Both reported 71 percent of their KPIs having
had some progress. Both of these measures received considerable donor support for the
implementation of activities – particularly the Measure 3 with respect to the vocational
technical training centres support which received substantive donor support for
implementation.
75. Even in these ‘successful measures’, the gaps in progress tended to be for those activities that
had not received donor support and were reliant on national government resourcing. For
example, in Measure 3, the biggest gaps yet were for the development of the national skills
forecast system (activity 3.4) and connecting research work at universities with industry
(activity 3.5). In Measure 1, the construction of public kindergartens and the legal
frameworks has progress, but the largest gaps pertain to teacher training and re-allocation
efforts to support these preschools.
76. The implementation rate of the measures that attracted substantial donor funded projects
was higher than for those that relied more broadly on government funding for three reasons.
First, the donor funded projects tended to have standalone planning processes including the
development of targets, the definition of specific responsibilities for implementation, and the
development of a structured timeline for implementation. Second, the donor funded
projects within the measures used a specific resourcing framework with the funds for the
project activities allocated and earmarked for specific use even if conveyed through the
government. Finally, reporting processes were regular, focused specifically on the outlined
project activities with factors provides for any delays in implementation.
77. This latter dynamic of a supervisory entity asking for reasons for delayed implementation
was cited in interviews as an unanticipated important factor in sustaining progress.
Stakeholders noted that in the national government funded activities and measures within
NDS HC1, there were no consistently enforced mechanisms in place for higher level
representatives to ask why progress against NDS HC1 measures may not have been achieved.
78. Measures 4, 5, and 6 reported fewer than one third of their KPIs as having progress with
more than two-thirds of the KPIs in these three measures reporting no progress. Measures 4
and 5 related to accountability and certification measures within the education system while
Measure 6 pertained to diaspora recruitment.
79. In Measure 4, there was some progress in the establishment of national tests (Activity 4.2),
but the other five activities had shown little progress in systematizing procedures for quality
improvement and accreditation. For Measure 5 (expenditure planning) there is some
progress against the establishment of information management systems, but these are
reported to be under-utilized by all education stakeholders and there are substantive
constraints for being able to use the information management system data for analysis,
monitoring or planning.
80. The Measure 7 reported progress in developing a labour inspectorate framework although
there are relatively few inspectors contracted yet. The oversight functions and the systems
management and procedures were reported as needing to progress yet.
81. Gender Mainstreaming. The NDS HC1 does not have a strong gender, equity or
inclusiveness focus mainstreamed into the strategy. At the activity level, data on
participation in activities is reported disaggregated by male and female participants and one
of the macro-level indicators relates to the proportion of women in the workplace. Some
respondents were also able to articulate a potential cascade effect of pre-school institutions
allowing improved access to the workplace by mothers or how improving formal contracts
23
could integrate more women into the formal economy because women may be
disproportionately involved in informal employment. However, gender mainstreaming is
not articulated in the NDS HC1 itself or the subsequent action plan. For example, none of
the activities are specifically framed with a gender-sensitivity lens and there are no gender-
related KPIs or Measure level indicators for NDS HC1 beyond the gender-disaggregated
reporting obligations.
82. The economic growth orientation of the NDS HC1 and its elaboration of human capital to
fuel the economy cited earlier in the relevance section is one factor that impedes the
integration of gender as well as other equity and access themes. Gender and equity themes
are more often considered with a frame of sustainable development or inclusive development
rather than growth per se. Vulnerable populations and remote regions are also not
specifically articulated among the measures, activities, or performance indicators.
83. Measure Performance. There are seven measures included in the Human Capital Pillar
1. The performance of these measures is measured through 13 outcome level indicators
(visible individual or organizational behaviour change). The following table describes a
summary of the changes in the Measures-level indicators. For Measure level performance,
green means significant progress. Yellow depicts some progress, but not very advanced. Red
means no progress – or a decline in indicator values from baseline. The full descriptions of
Measure indicators values are profiled in Annex 3.

84. The data on Measure 2 and Measure 3 indicators were not available to the ET. Of the others,
the only two measures that showed improvements from 2015 were in the pre-school
enrolment and the decline in the percentage of informal employment working conditions.
The percentage of children enrolled in pre-primary and kindergartens rose about 6 percent
from 2015. This reflects a modest improvement although again not to the levels of the
targets elaborated in the NDS HC1. For workplace employment, the percentage of informal
employees declined substantively according to inspectorate data (45 percentage points) but
only very slightly according to Labour Force Survey data (about 2 percentage points).69
However, although modest, these indicators did reflect a positive change. The rest of the
measure level indicators do not show positive progress. Of greatest concern is likely the
changes in the education performance of students in the Grade 9, Matura (Grade 12) and
PISA tests.
85. The PISA test scores are from 2015 and 2018, but not yet available for later in the NDS cycle.
However, the scores do not show a positive trend. While raw scores in reading and math
stayed relatively similar from 2015 to 2018 (347 to 353 and 362 to 366), the raw scores in
science dropped from 378 in 2015 to 365 in 2018. For the 9th and 12th grade national tests,
the percentage of achievement dropped on both measures from 2015 by about seven
percentage points (64.7% to 57.9% for 9th grade and 74.1% to 67.4% for 12th grade).
National Contributions
86. Macro-Level Performance. The macro-level indicators measure economic growth,
labour markets, social cohesion, and foreign investment. One limitation of the NDS macro-
level framework indicators is that they are not specifically measuring the performance of the
individual pillars. For example, there are no indicators related to education performance.
The logic behind the macro-level indicators are that these are to reflect the collective
national consequences of the entire NDS HC1 and thus focus mostly on the economic-
oriented macro level indicators (rather than human development or well-being). In theory,
the HC1 pillar activities should be most directly relevant to the labour market indicators and
social cohesion indicators. The social cohesion indicators were not measured but as noted in
the NDS HC1 programme description, the other macro level indicators all reflect modest
gains from the baseline on all indicators but not to the level of the targets described in the
NDS HC1 Roadmap (2017). For example, GDP per capita increased from 2015 by nearly 700
Euros (3277 Euros per capita to 3986 Euros) but the target had been ambitiously set at 5000
Euros per capita by 2021; the employment to population ratio increased by five percentage
points (25% to 30%) but the target had been 34 percent per capita); and foreign investments
increased by about 12 million Euros from 2015 although the target had been 600 million
Euros by 2021.70 The following table summarizes the macro-level indicator performance.
69 KAS data shows an increase in in the share of employees with permanent contracts from 28% in 2015 to 45% in 2020. This
data is not part of the official data sources for the NDS Action plan but shows triangulation of the same patterns.

87. Of the 16 indicators in the NDS macro-framework, four were not measured. Of the
remaining 12, one showed no progress, one showed progress as per the targets, and 10
showed some modest improvement although not to the level of the aspired target. The most
frequent gains were in labour market employment and economic development. However,
there is some volatility in the year-to-year measurements of labour markets that is not easily
captured in simple baseline/endline measures. For example, the labour market indicators
improved from 2016 to 2018, but then a decline from 2018 to 2019 before improvements
again in 2020.
88. Contributions of activities to macro-level indicators. The macro-level indicators do
show positive gains from the baseline, but there is limited evidence that the causal chain in
the implicit TOC is able to influence the macro-level indicators. First, the relatively low

achievements rates (less than half) of the activity indicators would not reflect a logical causal
pathway for the changes observed in the NDS HC1 outcome indicators. Second, of the 20
outcome level indicators in the NDS HC1, nearly three-quarters show no change or a decline
from the baseline (such as the PISA scores). Third, a number of the macro level indicators
are not ones that could be logically affected by the NDS HC1 activity pathways (such as social
cohesion or foreign investment) and the types of indicators that could be affected by the NDS
HC1 (such as education indicators) are not present in the macro-level indicators. If more
than half of all KPIs are reported as having had no progress and if the indicators at Measure-
level that do exist for the NDS HC1 tend to show declines from 2015 even as the macro-level
indicators show gains, then it is reasonable to assume that modest macro-level progress is
being supported from other sources than NDS HC1 activities per se.
Efficiency
89. Efficiency as an evaluation dimension usually explores the timeliness of planned activity
completion and the cost effectiveness of the activities implemented. For the purposes of this
evaluation, this OECD dimension was adjusted in the TOR to assess to what extent were the
available financial resources used efficiently. As the evaluation data collection progressed, a
number of implementation bottlenecks were identified within internal government processes
related to resourcing procedures. This section is restructured to highlight these financial
bottlenecks because the financial resourcing element is related to this while other
bottlenecks are treated in the sustainability section.
90. Resourcing bottlenecks: It is not currently possible to answer the TOR evaluation
question on how the financial resources were used for the NDS HC1 implementation because
of the structure of the budgeting and resource allocation process. The NDS HC1 action plan
in 2017 did develop a costing estimate disaggregated to the level of activities including a
description of which percentage of costs would come from government of Kosovo and which
percentage of costs would come from donor contributions. However, the way that financial
resources are recorded in the Ministerial reporting does not identify resourcing allocations
by NDS HC1 activity. Sectoral workplans disaggregate by other dimensions. As such, it is
not possible to track the degree of expenditures against the NDS HC1 activities within the
existing structures.
91. The implications of this is that any tracking of expenditures to NDS HC1 activities would
therefore have to be done manually and are not part of the regular reporting processes. It is
easier to track donor funding which are allocated under different financial codes. The
increased accountability of related to being able to track donor funded projects is one factor
for improved activity achievement rates as noted in the effectiveness section.
92. Although there was an absence of financial data against the NDS HC1, based on the available
evidence, the allocations to NDS HC1 activities were not commensurate with the costing
estimates in the NDS HC1 action plan and NDS activities tended to not receive priority
during budgeting. The NDS HC1 measures and activities were not usually taken into
consideration by the Cabinet level representatives when setting the annual priorities. As a
result, Ministries allocated much of their resources to other priorities – such as salary
support for teachers – and NDS HC1 activities were not prioritized even in the allocation of
‘free’ resources. For example, according to the GAP Institute, the Ministry of Education
allocates about 65 percent of its annual budget to salaries and infrastructure. Systems
strengthening efforts activities in the NDS HC1 such as certification or teacher performance
review are not recorded in formal reporting. This pattern of allocation aligned with
strategies is also cited in other external assessments in Kosovo including the SIGMA report
(2017) and EU Annual Progress Reports (2017-2020).
93. One reason for this is that resource allocation to the NDS HC1 activities and the integration
of the NDS HC1 into budgeting processes overall has been a bottleneck for implementation.
27
Annually, as part of their sectoral workplans, Ministries elaborate their costing strategies
and then allocate resources from their budget to the specific activities. The NDS HC1
measures were not harmonized with budget law which meant that ministries are not under
obligation to allocate funding per the NDS HC1 activities. While some of the ministerial
budgets were connected to the NDS HC1 activities, there was no internal requirement in
government for the NDS HC1 identified activities to receive priority in funding.
94. As a consequence, NDS HC1 activity progress is highly aligned with voluntary commitments
– especially donor commitments. The NDS HC1 still serves as an overall orientation for
donor investment evidenced by the relative progress of measures being closely associated
with the degree of donor investment. However, those elements which depended on
government financing or implementation, relatively little progress can be seen. This
dynamic of budgeting and budget law is covered in more detail in the following sections.
Sustainability and Synergies
95. Sustainability within the frame of a policy evaluation focuses on two dimensions: 1) To what
degree can the NDS HC1 itself be sustained within the processes and frameworks of
government? And 2) to what degree can the results that were achieved in the past NDS cycle
be sustained going forward.
96. For the first component, sustainability would involve the degree to which the NDS HC1 is
integrated with external and internal frameworks (synergies), including the degree to which
the NDS HC1 is aligned with, and integrated into, existing government processes and
mechanisms. The assessment of potential bottlenecks for the implementation of the NDS
HC1 are important considerations for understanding the long-term sustainability of the NDS
HC1.
97. The second component considers the degree to which the results of the NDS can be
sustained. Sustainability of results in the case of the NDS HC1 would involve three levels: i)
whether there is a sufficient legal or regulatory framework in place; ii) whether there are
sufficient systems, processes, or assets developed; and iii) whether there is sufficient human
technical capacity development related to the systems, processes, or assets including both
contracting and training human resources. The assurances of ongoing adequate resourcing
of the results is linked to the first component as this has to do with government budgeting
processes.
Sustainability of the results of the HC1
98. The 101 different KPIs from the NDS HC1 can be classified into the three categories of
activities related to sustainability of NDS HC1 outcomes: i) the development of laws, legal
frameworks, or studies (29); ii) the development of systems or processes or the creation of
an asset (buildings, centres, equipment) (45); and iii) trainings and contracting human
resources (27).
99. The three different levels are reflective of different conditions necessary for sustainability.
The first level is the most basic, the establishment of the laws and legal frameworks
necessary for a measure to succeed. The second level involves the establishment of the
systems and centres necessary within which to implement the measures. The final level
involves the contracting and training of the people who will be involved in the
implementation of the measures. For sustainability of the results to be achieved, all three
levels should be achieved within a measure.
100. For the NDS HC1 overall, achievement rates at any level have been relatively low
(Annex 4). Over the entire NDS HC1 activities, 28 percent of the listed level 1 activities (laws
and regulations) were achieved. Level 2 activities had a similar achievement rate (24%
28
achieved or good progress) related to establishing centres or buildings or systems. The
lowest achievement rates were related to those activities connected to trainings or
contracting people (15%).
101. The implications for sustainability of the results is that the results of the NDS HC1
are not likely to be able to be sustained. The most gains have been in the foundations
established by the creation of the necessary draft laws and regulations and the beginning of
the establishment of systems and assets accompanying the measures. However, there
remains more to be done in terms of training and contracting the people – to build the
requisite technical capacity – to manage the assets or implement the laws.
Sustainability of the NDS HC1 as a policy
102. This section explores the degree to which the NDS HC1 measures were aligned with
the SDGs and EU priorities as well as the extent to which the NDS HC1 measures are able to
be sustained in the future. The TOR had also included a question related to the alignment of
the NDS HC1 with existing sectoral strategies which has been integrated into the previous
relevance section.
Synergy with External Frameworks
103. The NDS HC1 (and the NDS overall) is aligned with the SDGs and EU priorities
although the standard annual reporting processes of the NDS HC1 do not include these
indicators. In the case of the SDGs, the SDGs had not been adopted by the Kosovo
Government until after the design of the NDS HC1. Therefore, a retrospective exercise was
carried out as part of the design of the NDS HC1 action plan in 2017 to illustrate the
established linkages in the NDS HC1 with their contributions to the SDGs. The 2018
progress report of the NDS included a chapter on the SDGs which reported the data at the
level of the indicators. However, this was only reported once throughout the cycle and the
annual reports of the NDS HC1 as part of the ongoing reporting process does not report
against the SDGs and the SDG indicators are not part of the performance results framework
of the NDS HC1. A similar exercise was carried out to align the NDS HC1 retro-actively with
the EU priorities as well. However, even though the EU annual reports on ascension do
make reference to the NDS HC1 activities, the actual annual reporting of the NDS HC1 does
not specifically reference progress against the EU priorities, identify delays, or cite action
plans for redress against the priorities.
Sustainability with Internal Frameworks
104. The overall performance, and potential sustainability, of the NDS HC1 has been
uneven and has been influenced by a series of factors. The ‘prioritization of priorities’ in the
NDS HC1 architecture and the lack of integration of the NDS HC1 products into ongoing
Government processes limits the usefulness of the NDS HC1 for orienting sectoral strategies
and limits the degree to which monitoring data for NDS HC1 management is available. The
limited political ownership of the NDS HC1 beyond the SPO office also limits the degree to
which Ministries are held accountable for NDS HC1 performance and sustainability.
105. The limited ownership is further complicated by impediments for inter-ministerial
cooperation and coordination. The NDS HC1 contains multiple measures that rely on inter-
ministerial coordination for achievement. However, there is relatively limited evidence of
cooperation among ministries or with the SPO and this is complicated by the existing
division of roles and responsibilities within the government. For example, the SIGMA report
on governance in the Balkans in 2017 noted that in Kosovo the planning work is split
between the SPO (setting priorities) and the government coordination Secretariat
(developing the government’s workplan) which creates additional challenges for the
coordination within government. The report goes on to note that rooting the priorities and
29
the work plan in the same structure unit would make it easier to ensure alignment. As a
consequence, very close cooperation between the units would be necessary to make shared
planning work. This embedded challenge was further exacerbated by the lack of integration
of the NDS HC1 within the existing government mechanisms.
106. There exists the potential of the NDS HC1 as a policy framework to be relevant for
serving as an important medium-term instrument that could serve as a bridge between
government mandates. The longer span of the NDS HC1 provided an overarching
framework longer than individual government mandates. The NDS HC1 was also seen as a
relevant framework for orienting donor strategies and investments in projects. Donors did
report that they refer to the NDS HC1 priorities in their project justifications in Kosovo. This
was also triangulated from interviews where the linkage of the ministry activities with the
NDS helped provide a more convincing rationale for targeted investments from donors.
107. However, practically, the NDS HC1 has been somewhat disconnected from the
normal Government processes. This can be seen in terms of workplan development and
reporting as well as other processes such as budgeting and oversight. Although the NDS HC1
is referenced, the Ministerial sectoral strategies serve as the primary orientation for
government and donors in the actual project implementation and reporting. Ministries
report achievements against their sectoral strategies and workplans rather than the NDS
HC1.
108. In the budgeting processes, there are budget departments within each ministry
as well as the Budget Department within the Ministry of Finance, Labour, and Transfers
(MFLT). Both the ministry budget departments and the Budget Department within MFLT
are responsible for the final review and costing of the ministry budgets and the MFLT Budget
Department is also responsible for issuing good opinions on whether the proposed costing of
the ministry budgets is realistic. However, both have limitations with respect to
consideration of the NDS.
109. Because of the NDS HC1 is not part of the budget law (and structured), in order for
the MFLT Budget Department to issue good opinions against the NDS HC1 costing or to
enforce allocation of ministry funds to NDS HC1 activities, the MFLT Budget Department
would require an annual administrative instruction (AI) to require the NDS HC1
considerations to be taken into account. However, the MFLT Budget Department did not
receive these administrative instructions to guide the issuance of budget opinions against the
NDS HC1 or for requiring Ministries to prioritize NDS HC1 activities during resourcing.
Therefore, the respective ministries were not required to allocate funding to these NDS HC1
activities if donors did not choose to fund them.
110. The structure of costing and budgeting within the ministries also emerges as another
efficiency bottleneck. Each Ministry has its own finance officers, but these personnel are
usually not included in the annual planning of Ministry budgets and are only included at the
end where they are mandated to apply the costing for the selected activities. Currently the
budget does not filter proposed budgeting planning and are not involved in the initial
planning to assure compliance with overall budgeting parameters for a given year within a
ministry.
111. In terms of oversight, the NDS HC1 action plan of 2017 did design a detailed
monitoring framework, but this framework is not integrated into the ongoing Sectoral
monitoring processes that are carried out by Ministries, resulting in many indicators not
being routinely measured unless they were actually part of the Sectoral monitoring plan.
112. In terms of political ownership, there is relatively little political will to
implement NDS HC1 activities. The term political will was consistently cited in stakeholder
interviews although this tended to denote two different types of phenomena depending on
30
the level of government involved. At the highest level of government, political will meant the
ownership of the NDS HC1 as a strategy to be taken into consideration and enforced. At the
civil servant level, political will was used to refer to the willingness to work to implement
activities and measures. The latter usage was an indirect reference to the need for
accountability mechanisms to ensure attention and progress in implementation or the
existence of consequences or sanctions for inadequate performance.
113. The NDS HC1 is relevant to the context and needs but is less relevant politically in
terms of high-level government ownership of the process – or at least, the levels of
government involved in the design of the NDS HC1 were not commensurate for instilling
consistent high-level support for the NDS HC1. Part of this may have been related to the
design process which brought in high level experts who developed, through rigorous
methods, the policy notes and subsequent NDS HC1. This process required government
stakeholder validation, but because the exercise was done by external consultants, there was
limited Ministerial involvement in the elaboration of the NDS HC1 activities and workplans.
Even the NDS HC1 action plan, which is thorough in its elaboration of activities, key
performance indicators, and costing, was developed through external consultants and,
according to stakeholder interviews, had limited rollout and integration into ongoing
government processes.
114. The rapid turnover in Governments and government personnel within Ministries also
impeded the strengthening of political ownership over the cycle of the NDS HC1. From the
elaboration of the NDS HC1 in 2016, there were four government transitions and one period
of nine months when there was no government formed at all. During some periods of the
NDS cycle, there was greater political interest in the NDS HC1 than at other periods. From
2015-early 2018, there appeared to be relatively high political will based on the number of
documents and reports produced against the NDS HC1 (including the NDS HC1 action plan
and 2018 mid-term review). From late 2018 through late 2020, political will appears to have
declined as evidenced by fewer reports and activities. The period also coincided with high
degrees of Government turnover with four separate Governments taking power from
December 2017. Finally, from early 2021, there appears to have been a resurgence of
interest in political will for the NDS HC1 with increased activities around the NDS HC1
including lessons learned exercises, SWOT analyses, and new concepts for the new NDS HC1
design.
Bottlenecks for NDS HC1 integration
115. Although the products were technically rigorous, the disconnect of the products from
ongoing government processes and the limited political ownership limited the degree of
integration of the NDS HC1 within existing processes, and government mandates and
created the following implementation and sustainability bottlenecks.
116. Monitoring and Reporting bottlenecks: The NDS HC1 action plan developed a
detailed results performance framework. However, this performance framework is not
specifically integrated into the Ministry report processes. Because of this, there is limited
monitoring data that can be easily abstracted from Ministry reports and applied to
specifically track the NDS HC1 activities in the sectoral strategies. Any NDS HC1 reporting is
done ‘in addition’ to Ministerial reporting processes rather than ‘as part of’ Ministerial
processes. Even in the SPO, the annual report to the Prime Minister regarding activity
achievements from the Ministries is based on Ministry workplans and not according to the
NDS HC1 priorities and measures. For example, the SPO annual report may say how many
activities within the MEST sectoral workplan were completed, but it does not report how
many of these were NDS HC1 activities.
117.There are internal reporting platforms that do provide monitoring information, but these are
not collected or reported on around the NDS HC1. For example, donors report their project
31
activities within the aid management platform and these activities could be linked to NDS
HC1 performance but are not published in this manner. In addition, internal government
reports of activities to the SPO are supposed to be linked to NDS HC1 activities where
relevant, but these are not abstracted to report specifically against the NDS HC1 publicly.
The annual plan of the government is supposed to include references on NDS measures, but
these are not always filled out by the respective sectoral agencies. Finally, other information
management data for the NDS HC1 exists but is not easily abstracted and requires
coordination between agencies such as the Ministry of Education, Science, Technology, and
Innovation81 and Kosovo Agency of Statistics. Different offices are collecting different pieces
of information, but these are not collated together to provide an overview of NDS HC1
progress.
118. Because of the dispersed nature of the information, there is limited opportunity for
public monitoring of the NDS HC1. The existing data is not efficiently shared between
agencies with respect to the NDS HC1 and while statistics are reported, raw data is not
publicly available or is kept in separate databases which are not cross linked. Without this
cross-linking of data to NDS HC1 performance, there are bottlenecks to inform evidence-
based policy discourse. For example, the GAP institute annual publishes budget allocation
data, but the data is linked to Ministerial strategies rather than the NDS HC1 measures, but
these could be reformulated to illustrate budgeting against NDS HC1 measures and
activities.
119. Accountability bottlenecks: There are limited accountability mechanisms in
place to enforce Ministry and department compliance with the NDS HC1. The NDS HC1
lacks a mechanism for ensuring that all sectoral strategies and workplans are aligned with
the NDS HC1. During the elaboration of workplans, the legal departments within each
Ministry perform a checking of the strategies and workplans to ensure alignment with
current legislation. This includes budget office and spending, EU ascension82 alignment and
so forth. However, there is not a mechanism within the departments responsible for
planning and policy coordination to cross-check the workplans against the NDS HC1 for
their respective ministries, nor is there an SPO level administrative instruction to perform
this cross-check for the OPM.
120. Finally, there are measures within the NDS HC1 that require municipalities to be in
accordance with the NDS HC1 because of the decentralization process in Kosovo. This could
be Municipality support to budgeting for teacher in education system, preschools, or
supporting VET centres. However, even though measures require municipality support,
there is currently no mechanism in place to ensure that municipality budgets and actions are
actually in accordance with the NDS HC1. Such a mechanism could be through an
administrative instruction form the Ministry of Local Governments to prioritize the NDS
HC1 measures when providing municipal budget allocations. The absence of this type of
mechanism was noted in the stakeholder interviews which cited that central to local level
cooperation was lacking during NDS HC1 implementation except in the case of donor funded
projects. For the latter, this was often because the donor or implementing partners
themselves were making the necessary municipal connections for coordinating project
activities.
121. Focus or point of emphasis bottlenecks: The NDS HC1’ growth orientation
orients the HC1 activities towards treating humans as ‘fuel for the economy’ rather than
more holistically seeking to enhance overall citizen well-being. The economic needs are real,
but the absence of other dimensions not immediately connected to the economy, such as
health, inhibits the degree to which the NDS HC1 can make sustainable contributions to
81 New title changed since the design of the NDS
82 National Programme for the Implementation of the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA)
32
overall national well-being – such as might be expressed in the social cohesion indicators in
the macro-level framework.
122. Furthermore, the focus on fuelling the economy minimizes the potential
contributions of the NDS HC1 to sustainably addressing equity issues cited in the gaps and
challenges in the relevance section. Gender mainstreaming had relatively little focus in the
NDS HC1 activities themselves. Other forms of equity including addressing inclusion of
marginalized populations and/or hard to access populations are not specifically addressed
within the measures and activities -nor measured through indicators. Finally, elements
related to sustainability and environmental impact are minimized in the current design due
to the NDS HC1 growth emphasis. There are few measures or activities that could be
associated with alternative economic growth, green-energy, or other potential national
contributions to sustainable development. A key emergent theme involved the conceptual
limitations of the NDS HC1 to serve as a larger development vehicle and the importance of
reconceptualizing the NDS HC1 as a contribution to human development – rather than
human capital.
4.0 CONCLUSIONS
Summary
123. Based on the patterns in the findings, a few key observations stand out as important
regarding this first NDS HC1 for Kosovo.
124. The NDS HC1 design process was rigorous, and evidence based. The priorities
identified in the NDS HC1 are relevant, although perhaps not sufficient to cover all
development needs. The implicit theory of change within the HC1 is heavily focused on
economic growth aspirations through strengthening education and enhancing employability.
However, there are gaps in the TOC and within the measures that could be addressed in the
next NDS (for example, while measure 7 focuses on contracts and working conditions, this
actually focuses on those who are already employed rather than on policies to increase
employment). Furthermore, other wellbeing considerations such as health, culture, or social
cohesion are not present, and this is a critical gap.
125. The NDS HC1 has the potential to serve as an important medium-term instrument
between mandates and could provide an important mechanism for orienting towards
external frameworks such as the SDGs and the EU ascension agenda (termed the National
Programme for the Implementation of the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA)).
However, the NDS HC1 does not serve as the primary orientation for the Kosovo
Government or donors and the sectoral strategies tend to have greater prominence. The
strong economic growth orientation of the NDS HC1 limits the degree to which transversal
equity themes are able to be considered and as such, gender and access considerations (rural
versus urban, vulnerable versus wealth, etc) are not strongly visible in the NDS HC1.
126. The macro-level economic indicators have improved modestly since 2016, but the
NDS HC1 contributions to these gains is likely to have been minimal due to the relatively low
completion rates of activities and the declines in the outcome level indicators related to the
respective measures. The economic orientation of the macro-level indicators also impedes
tracking gains in other sectors at the macro level such as education or health. There are
social cohesion indicators in the NDS HC1 macro-level performance framework, which can
serve as proxy measures for elements such as education and health, but these social cohesion
indicators have not been measured as consistently as the economic indicators.
127. Even so, there has been some progress made against the measures and activities, but
there has been lower rollout than anticipated as per the targets set. Many of these
33
achievements have been in the sphere of establishing the required legal frameworks or
commissioning the inception studies related to measures. Particular progress is observed in
those measures which received project-specific donor support. The next steps in many of
these measures would be to take actions to change systems or procedures – especially in
terms of human resources and capacity.
128. Compared to the 2018 mid-term review, the NDS HC1 performance through the
second half of the cycle has declined slightly in the subsequent years. This is likely due to the
structural and architectural limitations observed in terms of the mechanisms for NDS HC1
implementation. The primary limitation to the NDS HC1 has been that it is not well
integrated into other government processes which reduces the degree of prominence that the
NDS HC1 have in shaping policy, strategies, and implementation of government workplans
and orienting government priorities. There are several other factors that have also served to
impede the implementation of the NDS HC1 and reducing its prominence in Government
actions.
a. First, the NDS HC1 focus as a prioritization of priorities and its emphasis on economic
growth has impeded its ability to serve as a larger strategic compass for other strategies
and for integrating equity themes transversally.
b. Second, the NDS HC1 has a well-developed associated action plan outlining in detail
costing and key performance indicators and respective ministry responsibilities.
However, as technically sound as this document it, neither the NDS HC1
implementation, nor the action plan is well integrated into existing government
processes for budget, planning, and reporting. This de facto treatment of the NDS HC1
as ‘external’ to government systems limits the degree to which progress against the
NDS HC1 itself can be tracked, limits resourcing for NDS HC1 activities, and reflection
and analysis for accountability.
c. Third, the NDS HC1 has a technically sound monitoring and performance framework,
but this framework tends to be treated as a standalone document that is inconsistently
integrated into existing government bureaucratic processes. This inhibits the degree to
which monitoring of the NDS HC1 progress can be carried out. Management data
related to budget expenditures or NDS HC1 activity progress can be found within the
government system, but it is highly disaggregated. The data is distributed among
different databases managed by different government Ministries or departments and
not easily shared or collated. Public access to this data is limited and what data that is
published tends to be oriented towards other frameworks (such as sectoral strategies)
rather than the NDS HC1 and the resource allocation categories are different from
those cited in the NDS. This limits the degree to which the linkages from activities to
measures to pillars to the macro level indicators are able to be tracked and the degree
of public transparency towards the NDS HC1.
d. Finally, political ownership and will for the NDS HC1 has fluctuated over the cycle.
Based on the patterns of progress in the NDS HC1, there appears to have been a period
of about 30 months in the middle of the cycle of relatively low ownership of the NDS
HC1 in government. This coincides with a period of multiple government transitions in
Kosovo and suggests that NDS HC1 political ownership is highly contingent on
individual motivations rather than embedded in the system.
Lessons Learned
129. Lessons learned are intended to be observations or patterns emerging from a specific
evaluation that can be generalizable to other contexts beyond the immediate focus of the
evaluation. The following section on recommendations highlights the important principles
to be taken into consideration in the design of the next NDS HC1. In terms of generalizable
34
lessons learned, there are four lessons that would be important for consideration in other
contexts.
130. Having an NDS is important for orienting government priorities. This was
the first national development strategy developed by Kosovo and even with the challenges
present, there is widespread recognition that an NDS is an important tool for shaping
government priorities and providing a longer-term vision beyond the individual government
mandates.
131. How the NDS is structured within government is critical for success. To
ensure rigor, the NDS relied heavily on external inputs and support ranging from contracting
external experts tasked with developing concept notes to receiving donor funding support for
the NDS exercise, to contracting external consultants to develop the operational plans
accompanying the NDS. The intent was to promote rigour and recruit expertise, however,
this subtly affected the integration of the NDS into the rest of normal government processes
and subsequently reduced both the degree of accountability and the degree of ownership by
government in the NDS. Almost all of the recommendations in the following section are
related to this important lesson learned.
132. The NDS can serve an important role in donor conversations but should
not be driven by donor priorities. The NDS design emphasized a prioritization of
priorities as a way of managing and making sense of all the competing priorities emerging
from a multiplicity of strategies. The intention was to help guide donor investment into
those areas first. However, the specific measures that were eventually chosen within the
NDS HC1 were selected in anticipation that these would be the ones that the donors had the
most interest in funding. In other words, the NDS became aligned to donor interests rather
than helping align donor interests with government priorities. Where donor funding
subsequently followed, these measures were relatively successful. However, for the
measures that did not end up receiving significant donor project support, the NDS struggled
to provide sufficient funding allocation because of its disconnect from other government
resourcing processes.
133. The NDS can serve an important tool to more systematic and structured
donor coordination. There is relatively little coordination by the government of donor
engagement. There does exist a donor information management system, where donors are
supposed to enter updated project and investment information. However, this management
is not consistently updated by all donors and the reporting of the donor management
information system is not connected to NDS reporting. Furthermore, access to the donor
information management system is limited, reducing its potential to be integrated with other
reporting platforms. Integrating the NDS more closely with the donor information in
monitoring and reporting can provide a more systematic and structured approach for donor
coordination and conversations.
5.0 RECOMMENDATIONS
134. The evaluation recommendations are based on the patterns emerging from the key
findings. Feedback on the preliminary recommendations was obtained from the SPO and
the ERG through two workshop presentations in Kosovo on both findings and
recommendations. Overall, the recommendations are oriented towards the design of the
next NDS – specifically for the NDS HC1. However, some of these recommendations may be
applicable for the entire NDS design process. The sub-recommendations should be
considered possible avenues for achieving the desired change described in the
recommendations. The recommendations are based on these five key conclusions:
35
135. Build on the achievements of the existing NDS HC1. Although slower than
anticipated, there has been progress towards a number of the current NDS HC1 measures
and activities. A new NDS HC1 should include a review of progress milestones to date in the
respective measures including an overview of the state of progress towards each measure.
This could include identifying the next steps to be taken in each measure that should be
considered in the next NDS HC1.
136. Reframe the NDS HC1 towards a more strategic, human development
orientation. This includes restructuring the NDS HC1 architecture towards a ‘strategy of
strategies’ rather than a prioritization of priorities. Reorienting the NDS HC1 towards
human development rather than exclusively on human capital. The strategy should
encompass more than economic growth. The NDS HC1 should maintain a multi-year scope
for bridging mandates and should continue to be aligned with the 2030 agendas of the EU
and the SDGs. The strategy should integrate transversal priorities of gender, equity, access,
and environmental sustainability more visibly across all pillars measures and activities.
137. Integrate the NDS HC1 more closely into existing government systems.
This includes ensuring the integration of the NDS HC1 sectoral strategies and workplans
through a stronger cross-check mechanism aligned with existing legal cross-check
mechanisms in Ministries. Establishing Administrative Instructions for the Budget
Department of the MFLT on NDS HC1 costing opinions and resource prioritization and
revising the budget law for clarifying roles and responsibilities in ministry budget
departments. Finally, consider establishing Administrative Instructions from the Ministry of
Local Government to Municipalities for prioritizing budgeting for NDS HC1 activities at the
municipality level.
138. Increase the mechanisms for accountability and reporting against the
NDS HC1. This includes developing systems for tracking progress against the NDS HC1
activities including reporting on the completion of NDS HC1 activities in Ministry workplans.
Develop monitoring and reporting templates that disaggregate achievements and
expenditures by NDS HC1 measures and activities which are shared with the OPM and
Assembly annually. Increase the alignment of existing management data through linking
databases and increased sharing of data between Ministries and departments. Increase
public monitoring of the NDS HC1 through publishing of raw data for public dashboards.
139. Systematize high level political ownership of the NDS HC1. The NDS HC1
currently is highly dependent on individual motivations which can fluctuate through
government transitions. Political will for supporting the NDS HC1 should seek to be
strengthened through systematizing the NDS HC1 ownership including broad based political
representation at supervisory and management levels beyond the OPM and SPO itself. One
way to do this would be through the formation of an NDS HC1 Steering Committee
comprised of a combination of OPM and Assembly representation and including civil society.
This committee would have to have a mandate for annual review of the NDS HC1 progress.
In addition to the legal alignment cross-check mechanisms referred to earlier, this could
include empowering the SPO for coordinating with other government bodies responsible for
the elaboration of government workplans and resourcing to enforce greater attention to the
integration of NDS HC1 activities and measures in government resourcing, workplans, and
reporting.
TABLE 12: RECOMMENDATIONS
Desired Change Recommendation
Build on the Recommendation 1: NDS HC1 Measure Progress Review. The SPO/OPM
achievements of the should support a review process in the design of the new NDS HC1 that describes
existing NDS HC1 existing milestones achieved in each measure and identifies which next steps are
measures and required in each measure. This could be part of a SWOT analysis but could also be
activities. based on the data provided in this evaluation report.
36
Recommendation 2: Strategy of Strategies Architecture. The SPO/OPM
should re-orient the NDS HC1 focus towards emphasizing the NDS HC1 as a strategic
compass to orient other sectoral strategies. This could include:
i. Structuring the NDS HC1 as an overarching strategy for sectoral strategies
ii. Integrating the NDS HC1 into the national strategic management framework to
which sectoral strategies should be aligned.
Recommendation 3: Sustainable Development Orientation. The SPO/OPM
should re-orient the NDS HC1 focus not solely towards economic growth but to also
include a more holistic development agenda that visibilize sustainability and wellbeing
elements. This could include:
i. Change the focus of the HC1 pillar from human capital to human development.
ii. Change the overall orientation of the NDS HC1 from purely economic growth
towards a sustainable economic development
iii. Integrate non-economic dimensions into the NDS HC1 including health,
culture, social cohesion, environmental sustainability, among others to ensure
a more holistic development focus.
iv. More visibly integrate transversal themes of gender, inclusion of marginalized
groups, access (rural/urban), and environmental sustainability across all
activities and all measures.
Recommendation 4: External Frameworks Alignment. The SPO/OPM should
Reframing the NDS
refine the alignment of the NDS HC1 with the SDGs and Implementation of the SAA
HC1 towards
frameworks through better integration and monitoring of these frameworks. The NDS
strategic human
HC1 could become the overarching tool for the localization of the SDGs in line with the
development.
SDG Resolution. This could include:
i. Maintain a multi-year scope aligned with the 2030 agendas of the EU and
SDGs
ii. Integrate SDG and EU macro-level indicators into the NDS HC1 Performance
Results Framework
iii. Establish targets at all level indicators based on adequate analysis
Recommendation 5: Strategic Results and Action Plan. The SPO/OPM should
maintain the existence of an NDS HC1 Action Plan and Performance Results
Framework in the new NDS HC1, but these should be aligned with the strategic re-
orientation of the NDS HC1. This could include:
i. Develop a strategic accountability framework that establishes clear linkages
between activities, measures, and pillars but provides flexibility to adapt to
changing priorities under the strategic directions.
ii. Integrate macro-level indicators that include elements in health, culture,
education, social cohesion, and other well-being indicators.
iii. Integrate SDG and EU macro-level indicators into the NDS HC1 performance
framework
iv. Require all sectoral strategies to articulate a clear linkage between sectoral
workplans to NDS HC1 outcomes, measures, and pillars including identifying
relevant KPIs for sectoral workplan activities linked to the NDS HC1.
Recommendation 6: Sectoral Planning Integration. The SPO/OPM should
strengthen how the NDS HC1 is integrated into the ongoing national planning system
and the NDS HC1 should serve as the basis for the development of sectoral strategies
Integrate the NDS and workplans. This could include:
HC1 into existing i. Issuing an administrative instructive to Ministries ensuring that sectoral
government strategies are linked to the NDS HC1 strategic objectives
systems and ii. Ensuring a mechanism in which subsequent sectoral operational and workplan
processes. activities can be linked in a clear causal chain to overarching NDS HC1
objectives.
Recommendation 7: Sectoral Cross-check mechanism. The SPO/OPM should
update the guidelines and Administrative instructions for strategy development to
37
establish a strengthened cross-check mechanism to ensure that sectoral strategies and
workplans are in alignment with the NDS HC1. This could include:
i. The SPO/OPM should update the Administrative Instructions and guidelines
in the templates for the development of strategies to ensure that subsequent
sectoral strategies are aligned with the specific NDS HC1 measures and
outputs.
ii. Through these AI and guidelines, ensure that the legal departments in each
Ministry include in their checking of sectoral strategies against current
legislation whether the sectoral strategy is aligning with the NDS HC1.
iii. Establish an OPM cross-check mechanism – carried out by the SPO – to
establish a colour coding of sectoral strategies according to alignment with the
NDS HC1 (within, inline, in conflict, outside but not in conflict, unforeseen but
important).
Recommendation 8: Resourcing Integration. The SPO/OPM should establish a
strengthened mechanism to ensure funding of NDS HC1 activities through Ministerial
budget allocation. This could include:83
i. Establish a review process for assessing NDS HC1 costing and potential
sources for support including internal government and external donors.
ii. Establish an Administrative Instruction with the budget department to issue
opinions on NDS HC1 costing feasibility as evidenced in sectoral strategies and
workplans.
iii. Establish an administrative instruction with the budget department to require
prioritization of resource allocation by Ministries to workplan activities linked
to the NDS HC1 measures.
iv. Establish a review of the coding of the NDS HC1 resourcing codes to be aligned
with the Ministry of Finance, Labour and Transfers coding to allow for better
tracking of resource allocation against the NDS HC1.
v. In collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, Labour, and Transfers, review
the budget structure to better connect line budgeting towards programme and
performance budgeting.
Recommendation 9: Sub-national Integration. The SPO/OPM should establish
a strengthened mechanism to ensure the linkages of the NDS HC1 strategies with
municipal planning and resourcing. This could include:
i. Establish an administrative instruction with the Ministry of local Government
to ensure that Municipalities are prioritizing resourcing for supporting NDS
HC1 activities through the respective municipal departments.
ii. Commissioning of costing studies for the implementation of the NDS HC1 at
municipal levels.
iii. Defining capacity building work required for orienting both national and
municipal level Ministries and departments on the implications of the NDS
HC1 objectives for municipal workplans and budgets.
Recommendation 10: Strengthened internal monitoring. The SPO/OPM
should establish a strengthened mechanism to ensure the systematic internal
monitoring of NDS HC1 progress through mandated data collection exercises related to
both financial allocations and expenditures and activity progress. This could include:
Increased
i. Developing budget and activity reporting systems that allow for tracking and
mechanisms for
reporting cost allocations to NDS HC1 activities by different departments and
accountability and
Ministries.
reporting against
ii. Review data management systems for increased sharing and collation of
the NDS HC1
management data across separate databases to better track NDS HC1 progress.
iii. Develop an annual reporting framework within the SPO that reports to the
OPM on percentages of activities completed by Ministries against the NDS HC1
(in addition to respective sectoral strategies).
83 This would be a recommendation relevant for the entire NDS for all pillars under the NSMF. The scope of the evaluation is to
the HC1 and this recommendation should serve as a checklist to ensure the necessary mechanisms are present somewhere to
ensure resource integration.
38
Recommendation 11: Establish a civil society monitoring of the NDS HC1.
The SPO/OPM should establish a mechanism to ensure there is a public monitoring of
NDS HC1 progress. This could include:
i. Commissioning a civil society entity to create and maintain an NDS HC1
activity dashboard updated annually.
ii. Establishing a public budget allocation dashboard structured to illustrate
Government resource allocation by NDS HC1 objectives and measures.
Recommendation 12: Political Ownership Structures. The SPO/OPM should
establish a strengthened mechanism to ensure there is sufficient political ownership of
the NDS HC1 by including both broad-based political representation from different
levels in steering committees commissioned to review progress against the NDS HC1
and instruct follow-up when implementation delays occur. This could include:
i. Establish an NDS HC1 steering committee comprised of broad-based high level
political representation to ensure broader ownership including representation
from OPM, Assembly, or Ministries which meets annually for review of the
NDS HC1 progress.
Systematize
ii. Establish a reporting mechanism by which the SPO collates and reports
political ownership
progress against the NDS HC1 and presents to the NDS HC1 steering
of the NDS HC1
committee highlighting implementation delays and required actions to be
taken to confer alignment.
iii. Consider including civil society and private sector representation in an NDS
HC1 steering committee to provide external perspectives on NDS progress.
iv. Commission that the SPO and the Government Coordination Secretariat
(which coordinates the development of government workplans) to coordinate
to require Ministerial compliance with NDS HC1 objectives including the
linkage of sectoral strategies and workplans to NDS HC1 objectives.

6.0 ANNEXES
Annex 1: Terms of Reference
Terms of Reference for an Evaluation of the Human Capital Pillar of the Kosovo
National Development Strategy (2016-2021)
1. Introduction
1.1. Kosovo National Development Strategy Evaluation
This Terms of Reference (ToR) have been drafted for the evaluation of the Kosovo Human Capital
Pillar of the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2016-2021, hereinafter referred to as the
Evaluation.
National planning in Kosovo is underpinned by the National Development Strategy (NDS), which
provides overall strategic direction. The NDS 2016-2021 was the first such strategy developed by the
Kosovo institutions, aiming to improve quality of public policies and to contribute to effective
decision-making processes that would integrate Kosovo’s overall development agenda with the
European integration agenda and available resources.
The NDS is divided into four thematic pillars: human capital, good governance and rule of law,
development of competitive industries, and development of infrastructure. A more detailed
implementation plan – the NDS roadmap – which includes a costing of measures and indicators for
implementation and results, was prepared in the first half of 2017. The NDS (2016-2021) roadmap is
aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to measure national policies contribution
towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The development and implementation of the NDS (2016-2021) is led by the Strategic Planning Office
within the Office of Prime Minister (SPO/OPM). A progress report on the implementation of the NDS
was conducted in 2018 which highlighted the results achieved and contribution of the NDS towards
the SDG global targets. The progress report also served as a mid-year stocktaking to inform some of
the recommendations for the development of the upcoming NDS which will cover a time period until
2030.
While there are a number of sectoral and thematic strategies in place, evidence-based planning,
design and implementation of strategies and policies remain a key challenge hindering strategic
interventions and progress in key developmental indicators in Kosovo. Hence, in line with the plans
and preparation for the development of the new NDS 2030, the SPO/OPM has requested UNICEF
support to undertake a summative evaluation of the Kosovo Human Capital Pillar of the NDS 2016-
2021 to assess the progress made with a forward-looking focus, drawing on evidence-based lessons to
inform the design and implementation of the NDS 2030.
1.2. Evaluation Rationale
The NDS (2016-2021) is the first strategy that outlines key national priorities and aims to streamline
strategic planning and interventions in Kosovo. Apart from the 2018 progress report on the
implementation of the NDS (2016-2021), no evaluation has been conducted to shed light on the
progress made towards the implementation of measures. Hence, as the current NDS (2016-2021)
enters the last year of implementation, a summative focused evaluation is necessary and would serve
for learning purposes, as well as informing the development and implementation of the upcoming
NDS 2030 that is expected to be completed by 2021. The Evaluation sets out to assess the
performance and contribution of relevant sections and institutions towards the national development
goals.
40
The Evaluation will assess the relevance, effectiveness, sustainability, efficiency, synergies, and
longer-term changes associated with the NDS, its contribution to SDGs, as well as programmatic and
strategic choices made in the implementation of the NDS to identify promising practices, draw lessons
and forward-looking recommendations that can inform the development of the NDS 2030. While the
NDS covers a wide range of priorities, the Evaluation will specifically focus on the “Human Capital”
pillar to assess the key evaluation criteria for this area while the overall findings and
recommendations will identify lessons that are applicable to all pillars.
The Evaluation is commissioned by the SPO/OPM, and UNICEF will provide the technical guidance to
the evaluation team and support SPO/OPM with management and quality assurance as needed.
SPO/OPM and UNICEF will work closely to ensure a smooth implementation and management of the
Evaluation.
1.3. Stakeholders
The Evaluation may be used by a broad range of stakeholders of which some have a direct stake in the
Evaluation because they are involved in implementation of the NDS (2016-2021) or in programmatic
frameworks, plans or strategies that support the implementation of the NDS (2016-2021). The users
include specific offices and departments within the Office of Prime Minister, relevant line ministries,
civil society organisations private sector organizations and others as relevant. The primary intended
audience for this evaluation includes policy makers involved in designing of policies and strategies at
national and local level, with specific focus on addressing issues related to human capital development
such as education, health, social and protection policies, labour market and others as relevant. In
addition, the evaluation findings are to inform and to be utilized by other relevant stakeholders such
as civil society organizations, developmental agencies, private sector organisation, right holders, and
others as relevant.
The key stakeholders whose perceptions of the NDS should be reflected in the Evaluation and who
should, ideally, be informed about the evaluation process, its findings and recommendations that may
support optimization of joint work. A new consultative, informal group of targeted stakeholders will
be established to serve as an Evaluation Reference Group, including but not limited to Kosovo
Institutions, Public Agencies, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), Private Sector, Academia,
Development Agencies. Additionally, the key stakeholders that will be consulted as part of this
evaluation will include the relevant line ministries such as: Ministry of Education and Science,
Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Diaspora,
Ministry of Public Administration, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of European Integration specific
departments within the Office of Prime Minister, Civil Society Organization, relevant agencies, private
sector organisations and academia. A more detailed stakeholder’s mapping will be conducted during
the inception phase of the evaluation while the leading and supporting institutions responsible for the
implementation of the NDS Human Capital is provided under section 1.3.
The role of UNICEF will be to support commissioning of the Evaluation and provide continuous
technical support to the SPO/OPM, with specific focus on quality assurance on the conduct of
Evaluation.
2. Context
2.1. Socio-economic Overview
The overall Kosovo population is estimated at 1.8 million, with about 60 per cent living in rural areas.
Kosovo has the youngest population in the region with half of the population under the age of 30 years
and 31 per cent estimated to be under the age of 18.1
1 Kosovo Agency of Statistics. Population Estimation 2017
41
Kosovo is categorized as lower middle-income with a GDP per capita estimated at US$4,458, in 2019.2
Over the last decade, Kosovo has enjoyed a relatively solid economic growth. Although growth
projections have been quite positive, Kosovo has remained one of the poorest places in Europe, with
18 per cent of the population estimated to be living below the national consumption poverty line and
5.1 per cent below the extreme poverty line. Along with other social indicators, specific population
groups, including women, children and those living in rural areas are disproportionately affected by
poverty. In rural areas, the poverty rate was estimated at 19 per cent compared to 16 per cent in urban
areas and women live more on poverty (19 per cent) compared to men (17 per cent). Children are
disproportionally affected (23 per cent) compared to the overall population (18 per cent), with 7.2
percent of children living in extreme poverty.3 The most recent data point to a large proportion of
children under the age of five years (1 in 4) living in the households belonging to the poorest wealth
quintile.4
Kosovo has the highest percentage of total economically inactive population rate in Europe.5 The
general unemployment rate in Kosovo is estimated at 29.6 per cent. Significant disparities are
observed between women and men, with 45.3 per cent of men reported to be employed, compared to
12.3 per cent of women. High unemployment rate is also recorded among youth aged 15-24 at 55.4 per
cent, with unemployment rate as high as 63.5 per cent among female and 48.4 per cent among male.6
Overall public expenditure on social services has increased over time but remains relatively low and is
insufficient to ensure universal access and coverage. Public spending on health does not meet the
global recommendations for funding the health sector. Spending on health care is projected at only
3.8 per cent of the GDP which is significantly lower than the EU average (7.1. per cent). Similarly, per
capita public spending on education is low compared to other countries in the region. The estimated
education related expenditures for 2019 is at 4 per cent of the GDP, with spending dominated by
wages.
Since 2009, delivery of social services has been decentralized. However, the decentralisation process
has not been systematically linked to allocation of resources. There are no parameters in place for
establishing a specific financial formula on social service delivery to be allocated to the municipalities
by the central government. As a result, limited financial resources and human capacities, as well as a
lack of proper planning, result in poor provision of social services to the most vulnerable people in
Kosovo.
Education and health are building blocks for the development of human capital; they are essential for
maximizing the potential of individuals to live a prosperous and happy life. In Kosovo there are
significant breakdowns in the provision and quality of education and health affecting the ability of
Kosovo population to participate in the labour market and live a long, prosperous, and healthy life.
According to the Human Capital Index prepared by the World Bank, a child born in Kosovo today will
only be 56 per cent as productive when he or she grows up than would be the case if they enjoyed a
complete education and full health.7
Data from the same source indicates that a Kosovar child who starts school at age four can expect to
complete 13.2 years of school by his or her 18th birthday but when what children learn is factored in,
expected years of school is only 7.9 years. Students in Kosovo score 375 on a scale where 374
represents the minimum and 625 represents the highest possible attainment. This shortfall in human
capital, reflecting a mismatch between the outputs of the education system and the demands of the

labour market, is a challenge which Kosovo must meet. regarding health outcomes, the report shows
that across Kosovo, 91 percent of 15-year-olds will survive until age 60. Getting a good start to life is
an essential first step in this direction.8
Kosovo is not a member of the EU or the United Nations. However, in April 2016, the EU Stabilization
and Association Agreement (SAA) came into force as the main vehicle to regulate the trading, stability,
and prosperity of Kosovo to facilitate EU accession. In order to meet its SAA obligations, Kosovo
needs to engage in further democratic reforms, achieve social and economic development, and
progressively align with EU legislation and standards, so that it is able to fully implement the EU
“acquis” (the accumulated body of EU law and obligations from 1958 to the present day) upon
accession.9
2.2. The National Development Strategy
The NDS aimed to develop a list of priorities, under an umbrella strategy, which would allow building
synergies between various initiatives, prevent institutional overlap, yield higher performance
efficiency, orientation of support of the development partners and establish a firm guiding basis for
Kosovo’s institutions and accountability to the public. It is divided into four thematic pillars: human
capital, good governance and rule of law, development of competitive industries, and development of
infrastructure. A more detailed implementation plan – the NDS roadmap – which includes a costing
of measures and indicators for implementation and results, was prepared in the first half of 2017.
The progress implementation report outlined the progress achieved, including four macro-level
indicators, and drew on recommendations for future consideration which highlight that important
social aspects critical for the wellbeing of the population have not been included in the current NDS
(2016-2021). The report called for additional measures to be included as part of the NDS on
employment, health, and social welfare. Additionally, the progress report highlighted the progress
made over the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Out of all 17 SDGs and 169 SDG targets, 12
goals and 22 targets were found to be in line with the NDS.
In its first pillar, Human capital, the NDS (2016-2021) emphasizes the need for a productive, skilled,
and innovative labour force, establishing these factors as one of the determinants of development. The
more advanced the labour skills, the higher the workers’ incomes and economy in general. Discussion
on skills encompasses not only technical skills, such as cutting and shaping a product, but also
cognitive skills such as logic and reasoning, or soft skills such as interpersonal skills or work ethics.
Building these skills depends entirely on the quality of education, its correlation to the labour market,
the work conditions in the labour market, but also opportunities to acquire skills through migration
or, reversely, brain gain from diaspora.
NDS measures under the Human Capital Pillar:
1. Increased inclusion of children in pre-school institutions. This will allow better
success at higher levels of education, decrease inequality, and increase participation of women
in the labour market. This means that a child may learn while his or her mother may work.
2. Improved quality of teaching in the primary and secondary education. This is a pre-
requisite for better success of the education system and strengthening the skills of youth for the
labour market. This means our teachers, who teach our children, are qualified for the work they
do.
3. Improved correlation between skills acquired in education and labour market
needs. This will contribute to driving down unemployment and growth of Kosovar enterprises.
This means that a pupil of a vocational school or a student from University may find it easier to
find practical work during studies or full-time employment upon completion of studies.
4. Strengthened mechanisms of accountability and certification in the education
system. This will allow schools and teachers to be held accountable and be rewarded for the
quality of work, which will help improving the quality of education.

5. Improved expenditure planning in the education system. This will allow savings to the
state’s budget and divert funding from areas of lower to higher priority.
6. Decreased level of informal employment. This will allow protection and better
advancement of workers. Also, a worker will be able to benefit pensions, enjoy access to loans
and better conditions for work.
7. Concrete recruitment of experts and diaspora students. This will allow transfer of
know-how from our diaspora and strengthening their ties to their homeland. This means that
a technology expert may be financially supported to develop a project in Kosovo institutions or
private companies and produce something long-term.
The leading stakeholders involved in the implementation of the NDS Human Capital
Pillar include, the Ministry of Education and Science, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Diaspora. The supporting institutions responsible for the
implementation of the NDS Human Capital Pillar include, schools, the Pedagogic Institute of Kosovo,
Kosovo Chambers of Commerce, Kosovo Accreditation Agency and National Qualification Authority,
Ministry of Public Administration, Ministry of Justice, UNDP, GIZ, Innovation Centre Kosovo, Private
and Public Universities, Students Network, Professionals Network, donors, businesses.
Correlation to other strategic planning frameworks
Although the main focus of the NDS (2016-2021) was economic growth, the implementation of the
NDS (2016-2021) was meant to serve as a vehicle to push forward the Kosovo’s European integration
agenda. In this sense, there was significant attention paid to the harmonization of the NDS
implementation actions with National Stabilization Association Agreement (SAA) Implementation
Programme and the need for further adoption of EU acquis. The NDS (2016-2021) was also aligned
with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and aimed to accelerate the SDG implementation
agenda for Kosovo. In addition, the NDS (2016-2021) was aligned with the sectoral strategies aiming
to maximize results in the area of economic development, education, and employment.
Implementation of the NDS
The implementation of the NDS (2016-2021) was envisioned as an essential process of the Integrated
Planning System in Kosovo, based on the following principles: the NDS (2016-2021) measures have
priority in resource allocation and will be monitored closely, including through Prime Minister’s direct
attention; the NDS measures receive full financial coverage, with preferential access to any additional
resource from the state budget and / or development partners; Ministers and institutions responsible
for NDS's priorities, shall develop clear guidelines for implementation of NDS’s objectives. The
frequent political turnovers and lack of full alignment and tracking of expenditures in line with
activities planned within the NDS constitute the two key challenges that have impacted the
implementation of the NDS (2016–2021).
First report on the implementation and results of the National Development Strategy
2016–2021 – Human Capital Pillar (2018)
Pillar 1 measures focus on improving the quality of education and better linking education with the
needs of the labour market. Strong progress has already been achieved in important areas, such as the
professional development of teachers and the introduction of national student examinations that
measure learning achievements. The development of an education information system is nearly
complete. The upgrading of school inspections has also advanced, as have improvements in labour
market inspections and related arrangements for reducing informal employment.
The first report noted delays under this pillar are primarily linked to systemic changes and
institutional development. The Standards and Evaluation Agency has not been established since the
Government of Kosovo within wider public administration reform agenda will undertake a review of
executive agencies, while the capacity and professional autonomy of the National Qualification Agency
and the Kosovo Accreditation Agency need to be improved. The implementation of a teacher grading,
44
and licencing system was not started in 2017. Key tools for the development of professional education,
such as for forecasting skills and reviewing the financing formula, are delayed. Finally, little has been
done to date to attract experts and students from the diaspora to the national education system.
3. Objectives and Scope of the Kosovo Human Capital Pillar of the National
Development Strategy Evaluation
3.1. Objectives
The Evaluation has three key objectives, which are to:
1) Assess the relevance, effectiveness, sustainability, efficiency, synergies, and longer-term
changes associated with the NDS, including the priority and programmatic choices made in
relation to other sectoral strategies and priorities and the changing socio-economic context in
Kosovo.
2) Provide an independent performance assessment of the NDS 2016-2021 – Human Capital
Pillar seen in relation to expected results as indicated in the NDS roadmap monitoring
framework for which the promotion of equity and gender equality are considered to form an
integral part.
3) Identify lessons and forward-looking recommendations from the assessment of objectives (1)
and (2) above that can inform the development of the NDS 2030.
The Evaluation shall focus on the degree of attaining the planned and actual results and targets
related to the NDS (2016-2021) high level indicators. The Evaluation also shall consider the resources
allocated for implementation as well as coherence of their expenditure related to measures and
objectives defined by the NDS (2016-2021).
Findings of the Evaluation will inform the development of the upcoming NDS 2030 and will provide
key lessons and recommendations for further strengthening the implementation, monitoring
framework as well as resources allocated to maximize results in line with the set priorities. SPO/OPM
will coordinate the review of the Evaluation report through the Evaluation Reference Group.
3.2. Scope
The Evaluation will cover the period of the NDS implementation which dates to 2016. The
Evaluation will assess the implementation of the Human Capital within the NDS (2016-2021).
The organizational scope of the Evaluation focuses on the national level results in line with
overarching priorities of the NDS (2016-2021).
The evaluation covers the Human Capital Pillar including a review of the totality of NDS in the
context of development process and interconnected strategic choices. A particular focus of the
Evaluation will be placed on assessing issues related to equity – in particular as these address and
contribute to human rights, SDGs as well as gender mainstreaming’s Evaluation process will not cover
other NDS pillars (Governance and the rule of law; Competitive industries and Infrastructure) nor will
assess the overall NDS (2016-2021).
The programmatic focus of the Evaluation will include review of relevant strategies and knowledge
products relevant to the Human Capital pillar, with specific focus on education, skills and labour
market needs, employability, and others as relevant.
3.3. Evaluation Questions
The questions that will guide this evaluation are aligned with the evaluation criteria developed by the
OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC)10 - relevance, effectiveness, efficiency,
10 The DAC evaluation criteria were first defined in 1991 under the leadership of the OECD. In 2019 they are currently under
revision.
45
sustainability, synergies, and long-term impact. A more targeted sub-questions are to be defined
during the inception phase.
Relevance

10) To what extent can the NDS (2016-2021) Human Capital Pillar be considered to have made a
contribution to observed progress in enhancing human capital, including potential
consequences of the interventions on human rights and equalities?
4. Methodology
The Evaluation will be guided by the “Norms and Standards” and the “Ethical Guidelines for
Evaluation” developed by the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG)12 and UNICEF’s corporate
guidance for human rights-based approach and equity focused evaluations13. It will be planned and
implemented with a non-experimental design, using mixed-methods, and drawing upon secondary
data when possible. The team is expected to generate primary data principally through Key Informant
Interviews (KIIs), however, use of alternative data generating approaches that add further value is
welcome, e.g., administration of surveys, focus groups, observation, use of big data, etc. In line with
the COVID-19 protection measures, the data collection will include alternative ways to physical
11 Some of the key strategies include: The Kosovo Education Strategy and Action Plan (2017-2021); The Social Welfare Sectoral
Strategy (2018-2022); The Youth Strategy 2019-2023 and others identified during the inception phase.

46
presence. Hence, all primary data collection will be conducted through virtual means, including, and
not limited to zoom, skype, telephone, Viber, WhatsApp etc.
4.1. Assessment Frameworks and Theories of Change (TOCs)
The implementation of the NDS (2016-2021) has been informed by the “Roadmap for
Implementation of the NDS 2016-2021”, which includes detailed information on costing of
measures and activities. While the Roadmap sets the basis for monitoring of implementation
of the NDS, the Evaluation Team will be responsible to work on constructing the Theory of
Change (ToC) to highlight the results chain that will inform the evaluation process. The
proposed evaluation methodology should reflect a human rights-based and equity-focused
approach utilizing disaggregated data by sex, ethnicity, age, disability, etc., and it should pay
diligent attention to ethical issues.
Data Availability and Reliability
The 2018 report on the implementation and results of the NDS (2016–2021) highlights the lack of
data availability for progress monitoring of NDS’s (2016-2021) measures and results. The NDS (2016-
2021) roadmap includes outcome, output baseline and target indicator data with clear indicators
definitions outlined in the Passport of Indicators document. When no data are available to assess
outcome, outputs indicators, proxy data will be needed to provide an indication or direction on the
progress made. When available and applicable, utilization of disaggregated data is needed to ensure
in-depth analysis to highlight equity issues, gender, children, adolescents, youth, and others as
relevant. The consolidated monitoring data collected by the Strategic Planning Office/Office of Prime
Minister will serve as a guiding framework to inform the Evaluation.
Limitations
Lack of reliable and systematic data as well as documentation of the design and implementation of
some programme interventions may limit the Evaluation. During the inception phase, the evaluation
team is expected to confirm data availability and to suggest how it will fill any gaps. The situation
created with COVID-19 pandemic will impose limitation on the physical presence for data collection
by the evaluation team.
5. Evaluation Process
Once the evaluation team is on board, the Evaluation will be structured in three main phases defined
by accompanying activities as described below:
The Inception Phase
• Capacity Building on Conduct of Evaluation for the SPO
The evaluation team jointly with UNICEF will conduct two workshops with Strategic Planning
Office Staff, UNICEF Kosovo, and other relevant partners on introduction to evaluation,
covering principles, standards, approaches, and implementation of Evaluation. The first
workshop will be conducted during the Inception Phase to ensure that the staff members have
increased capacities and understanding of basic steps towards the evaluation implementation.
The second workshop will be organized following the finalization of the Evaluation Report,
focusing on the development of Management Response for the Evaluation.
• A Desk Review
The evaluation team will commence the Evaluation with a document review for which an
electronic library will be established by SPO/OPM comprising relevant documentation that
will be updated on an ongoing basis by both the evaluation team (ET) and SPO/OPM during
the evaluation process. Documentation made available to the team may include but will not be
limited to: the NDS (2016-2021) including all accompanying documents (road map,
monitoring framework etc.), sectoral strategies such as the Kosovo Education Strategy and
Action Plan (2017-2021); the Social Welfare Sectoral Strategy (2018-2022); the Youth
47
Strategy 2019-2023; the Child Rights Strategy and Action Plan (2019-2023), key relevant
policy documentations, situation analysis and other survey relevant reports that include data
and information on human capital related indicators.
• Initial Briefings
In addition to the desk review, brief introductory interviews with staff from the SPO/OPM
and UNICEF Kosovo Office will inform the prioritization of evaluation questions and the
detailed planning of the evaluation methodology.
• A virtual inception mission (VIM). Once the initial desk review is completed, a 2-3-day
virtual inception mission will be organised for the Team Leader. One important purpose of the
VIM is to introduce the Evaluation and the ET to SPO/OPM staff and key evaluation
stakeholders, including members of an Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) established as a
sounding board for the evaluation to foster transparency and participation and to review key
evaluation deliverables. In addition to discussing with SPO/OPM staff the practicalities of the
evaluation field mission, other issues, as necessary.
• An Inception Report (IR)
An inception report (20 pages) will be submitted that demonstrates impartiality, and that
aligns with UNICEF’s quality standards. The IR will be subject to quality assurance performed
by the evaluation manager, a review conducted by internal evaluation stakeholders and the
ERG, an ethical review – should proposed data gathering involve vulnerable groups, sensitive
subjects and/or use of confidential data – and, finally, an external quality assurance check
that requires a satisfactory rating for the field mission to proceed. The approval of the IR
marks the completion of the Inception Phase.
• Based on the desk review and VIM, the IR will provide: a contextual description and summary
of initial findings available from secondary sources; justifications of proposed changes to the
Evaluation ToRs; an outline of the detailed methodology (including sampling strategies for all
primary data collection); theoretical frameworks against which the NDS will be assessed; a
description of the quality assurance mechanism of the evaluation team. The IR will also outline
evaluation team strategies for management of data gaps, or data reliability issues, and it will
include ethical considerations relating to primary data generation. Attached to the IR will be an
evaluation matrix outlining evaluation questions, sub-questions, judgment criteria/indicators,
data sources and instruments/methods; a stakeholder analysis; a timeline; the NDS TOC; a
work plan; and bios of ET members with an overview of the division of labour between the
evaluation team members vis a vis evaluation deliverables.
The Virtual Data Collection Mission Phase
Following the inception phase, a two-week virtual data collection mission with full
participation of all team members will be organised during which additional secondary data
may be identified and primary data will be generated. An estimated 70 stakeholders will be
consulted by the evaluation team that include the following categories: Kosovo Institutions
and Public Agencies, Private Sector, CSOs, Academia, and Development Agencies.
The SPO/OPM and UNICEF Kosovo Office will support the ET, organizing meetings and
logistics at the request of the Team Leader – but will not participate in any of the external
stakeholder interviews. At the end of the field mission, the evaluation Team Leader will
present preliminary observations and finding to SPO/OPM and UNICEF evaluation team
staff, the ERG (ERG) and, if required, other stakeholders.
The Reporting Phase
• The evaluation team will prepare a draft evaluation report, which should include an Executive
Summary, that will be subject to a review undertaken by SPO/OPM and UNICEF Kosovo Office
staff, members of the ERG and the evaluation manager; an external quality assurance that
requires a satisfactory rating and, if required, an ethical review. Following the first internal
48
review of the draft report and the initial quality assurance, the evaluation team will incorporate
the comments provided, as appropriate, and prepare a final draft report. The final draft
evaluation report is shared with the ERG for validation and any additional comments. As with
the IR, it is a requirement for evaluation report to have a satisfactory rating before it can be
considered final.
• Either at the final draft stage (to support the reports validation) or once the evaluation report
is finalized (to support further internalization and discussion on the recommendations), the
evaluation Team Leader will hold a virtual meeting with the SPO/OPM and UNICEF Kosovo
Office staff, the ERG and, if relevant, other national stakeholders. The report will comply with
UNICEF’s reporting standards and be no longer than 40-60 pages excluding executive
summary and annexes. Upon completion of the evaluation report, it will be rated in UNICEF’s
Global Evaluation and Research Oversight System (GEROS), and it will be published on
UNICEF’s global public website. The lessons learned drawn during the process of the design
and implementation of the Evaluation will be documented and shared to inform similar
evaluation in different contexts.
• Ethical considerations: the evaluation team should clearly identify any potential ethical
issues and approaches, as well as the processes for ethical review and oversight of the evaluation
process in their proposal with regards to data collection, review, and other relevant processes.
Management Response (MR)
• The SPO/OPM is responsible for formulating a formal management response to the NDS
evaluation, taking into consideration the inputs of the ERG. The MR provides a concrete set of
actions that Kosovo institutions commit to undertaking in response to evaluation
recommendations that are accepted. The MR will be shared with the Strategic Planning
Committee for validation and will further inform the design of the NDS 2030.

Annex 3: Kosovo NDS Summary
Human Capital Pillar Narrative
Logic. The economy of a country is based largely on its human capital.97 A capable labour force that can produce value in goods and services is
required. A more skilful labour force will not only ensure a higher economic growth rate, but also comprehensive growth as well. Increasing
children’s involvement in education programmes, improving the quality of education, and a better linkage between the school curriculum and
labour market will ensure that children gain the necessary skills and abilities to be integrated into the labour market.
Implicit Assumptions: The measures contain implicit assumptions regarding the key barriers to Human Capital development in Kosovo and
entry into the labour market. One key barrier to entry into the labour market is due to insufficient skills and knowledge on the part of the
population – particularly the youth population (15-24 years). Three key barriers impede human capital development in Kosovo: i) Children are
not entering into education programmes or are entering too late, ii) The quality of the education provided in schools is insufficient to build human
capital, iii) The educational system and curriculum is not adapted to the knowledge and skills needs in the modern labour market. These
assumptions form the foundation of the elaboration of activities within the Ministry of Education with a particular emphasis, based on the
costing, towards building schools and setting up the certification and accountability mechanisms.
A second key barrier implied by the measures is that citizens are reluctant to enter the labour market because of poor treatment including the lack
of contracts and poor working conditions. This second set of assumptions is somewhat at odds with the stated logic of the first assumption – that
it is the population itself that is lacking in the sufficient human capital to enter the labour market.
The final key barrier implied in the measures is that the human capital is low in Kosovo population because of the brain drain within the diaspora
and that the human capital can be strengthened further through developing incentives to attract and contract diaspora to engage in the labour
market within Kosovo (or the educational system).

Measures and Actions: Based on these assumptions to barriers to human capital development, the Human Capital Pillar of the NDS proposed
seven measures. Five of the eight measures are targeting the first assumption regarding the education system and focused on increasing the
quality of the primary and secondary educational system through a range of activities targeting certification, accountability, expenditures, and
infrastructure for education as well as one measure target early inclusion of children in pre-school institutions. The second barrier is addressed
through a single measure which focuses on increasing the degree of protection and advancement of workers through entry into formal
employment. The final measure proposes to increase the level of human capital in Kosovo through the recruitment of experts and students from
the diaspora to work in and support the Kosovo labour market.
Each measure comes with an associated set of sub-activities and is expected to be linked to ongoing Kosovo strategies and programmes and
implemented under a lead Ministry. The 2017 Roadmap for implementation also introduced an estimated costing for achievement of these
activities and measures. The following table summarizes the activities, indicators, estimated cost, strategy linkage and leading institutions for
each measure.

Annex 5: Evaluation Matrix
Connection of Tools to Evaluation Dimension. The tools profiled in Annex 5 also describe the link
between specific questions on the tools and the overarching evaluation dimensions. The following narrative
describes the contribution of each data source to the respective evaluation dimensions.
Document Review: A review of available documentation beyond the quantitative data will continue to be used
throughout the evaluation phase to address the relevant evaluation criteria and to serve as both a
complementary source for triangulation with the field phase quantitative and qualitative data and as historic
overview of changes in programming. The document review has particular pertinence for addressing questions
related to relevance and efficiency. The SPO/OPM and UNICEF Kosovo Office has already provided
documentation that will be integrated into the evaluation analysis (Annex 2). The pre-existing quantitative
data available related to the macro-level indicators1 highlights achievements at the national level.
Pre-existing Quantitative data: Within the frame of the evaluation criteria, the pre-existing quantitative data
is best suited to address elements pertaining to efficiency and effectiveness of the NDS. Extensive data for
activities and outputs were already collected and a portion of these patterns are summarized in the programme
description section of the narrative and in the summary of outputs and activities in Annex 3.
Primary qualitative data. The data obtained from the mix of KIIs are relevant for contributing to explorations
of relevance, programme effectiveness, and potential sustainability issues. The qualitative data is a
fundamental source of information for the evaluation and will be collected through a series of semi-structured
interview guide. The mixture of stakeholders is intended to integrate the perspectives of the different groups
involved in or associated with the human capital pillar. The key informant interviews and conversations with
Prishtina stakeholders will be used to contribute to the analysis of all dimensions of the evaluation criteria, but
with particular pertinence for relevance (national policy alignment), efficiency, and sustainability. The
selection of stakeholders is intended to represent the array of potential stakeholder categories cited in the
stakeholder analysis section with a prioritization of those specific individuals who are particularly information
rich with regards to NDS programming. This does not have to be solely individuals who are partners or
beneficiaries, but it would assume to be those who have enough observational experience to be able to form a
competent opinion regarding programme performance.

d. Contribution Analysis
Naturalistic inquiry is not so much a distinct form of analysis as it is an approach to use the main forms of
analysis when a priori frameworks are not available for grounding information analysis – either because of
changes to initial frameworks or because of their absence. The forms of analysis are associated with each of
the sources of information and data collection methods – triangulation, document review, and pre-post
analysis are most likely summative analyses.

123 The evaluation itself will not undertake a cost benefit analysis, but the Budget Office issues opinions on costing as part of their mandate for all Government strategies, policies, and programmes. The
review of the Budget Office good opinions for NDS activities will be part of the cost-effectiveness review.

of the implementation process of the NDS.

Annex 6: Methodology
Evaluability Assessment
Evaluability is the extent to which any activity or programme can be evaluated in a credible fashion. To a large
extent, this evaluability is informed by five dimensions: i) data availability, ii) reliability and validity of
available data, iii) elaboration of existing logframes and ToC development, iv) documentation of activities
implemented (monitoring), and v) logistical or cultural constraints which may influence evaluation data
collection activities. The first and four dimensions present the most significant challenges to evaluability in
the current NDS evaluation.
In terms of data availability, documentation exists in terms of the assessment, design, and policy framework of
the NDS including the 2017 NDS roadmap which makes concrete the link between the policy notes, NDS
priorities, and targeted actions. The roadmap also includes a monitoring framework for collating progress
across the activities and pillars. There are also an array of available documentation on Sectoral strategies and
policies which have alignment with the NDS.
The primary evaluability barrier in terms of data availability is related to the monitoring phase of the NDS.
Within the Kosovo Government, there are departments that monitor activity accomplishments and plans of
the respective Ministries and other units. Each of these would be reporting on elements related to the NDS in
terms of the accomplishment of activities, the resourcing of activities. These are reported against the
respective Ministry and unit plans. However, there is a relative scarcity of consolidated monitoring reports
tracking progress of roadmap activities against the NDS.
There is one stock-taking exercise carried out in 2018 reporting on the progress of the NDS. There have also
been one measurement of the macro-level indicators related to the NDS in 20211 as well as additional macro-
level data that can be used for triangulation from the MICS survey conducted from Kosovo Agency of Statistics
to complement other forms of data such as the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and World Bank demographic data
for Kosovo.2 There are decentralized reports and documentation that can be used to infer progress over time
such as the Line Ministry workplans, but these were not developed with a view to reporting against the NDS
roadmap itself and information is often scattered or coded differently than the NDS roadmap. It is possible to
track the activity process through the individual unit reports, but this will be time-consuming and require
special attention as not all of these reports are shared with the SPO/OPM.
The quality of the pre-existing quantitative data for the macro-level indicators will be assessed during the data
collection phase by the evaluation team, but the GAP institute report has presented updated values through
2019 for the macro level indicators and therefore the evaluability appears good. However, linking changes in
these indicators to the contribution of NDS activities may present limitations. Even though the evaluation can
develop an implied ToC based on the roadmap for the NDS, there may be limitations in the use of the implied
ToC for guiding contribution analysis if the implementation of the activities cannot be successfully tracked and
if there is an absence of output level indicator values.
Although potential constraints exist for evaluability, the ET believes that the evaluation mandate for a
learning-oriented evaluation can be reliably undertaken given the use of the documentation already compiled
as well as the use of qualitative interviews with key stakeholders who have both deep and broad familiarity
with the NDS across multiple contexts. The breadth of scope of the NDS activities within the Human Capital
Pillar and the potentially broad array of Government Ministries, Agencies, and Offices that have participated
in some aspect of the NDS implementation does present some difficulties in generalizability but triangulation
with key informant interviews from different units and levels should produce reliable evidence for the targeted
evaluation criteria.

Evaluation Principles and Approaches
The principles guiding the proposed evaluation approach rely on a naturalistic framework to generate a
utilization focused evaluation to help with contribution analysis. Principles of participation and
empowerment and appreciative inquiry will further shape the tools, methods, and analysis exercises employed.
• Naturalistic Inquiry: focuses on articulating the operational realities and adjustments made in the field and
often involves elicited or inductive methods.3 This principle is particularly appropriate when there have been
ongoing adjustments or changes in the context or the frameworks which limits the extent to which an evaluation
can use an established logframe or original plan as a point of departure for assessing programme performance in
relevance, effectiveness, or impact dimensions. A theory-based evaluation within naturalistic inquiry described
the implied theory in use informing choices in design and implementation of a programme or project (or in this
case, a strategy). This is considered through the reconstruction – based on interviews and document review – of
the implied theory of change behind the programme and then subsequent analysis of whether these assumptions
proved to be valid.
• Utilization focused prioritizes the end utility of the evaluation products and recognize that attributing results to
interventions is generally complex and not always feasible. In the case of this evaluation, this includes significant
and continuous consultation with key stakeholders on adjustments to evaluation objectives, design, and analysis
in order to be most useful for ongoing SPO planning needs.
• Contribution Analysis through mapping pathways from interventions to results. This is often built on the use
of a theory of change to guide the contribution analysis; however, it can also be done through inductive analysis.
Contribution analysis can help identify to what degree the observed changes have been the result of interventions
or externalities. Contribution analysis is useful when there are multiple actors in a dynamic context who may
have overlapping effects on social outcomes. Contribution analysis is also an important tool for assessing the
validity of a design or framework and for identifying possible adjustments in the linkages within the framework.
• Participation and Empowerment are important principles for increasing the ownership and contribution of
the evaluation exercise itself to larger development objectives. This is related to the utilization focused principle
which posits ongoing consultations in the design of the evaluation. The key additional element is the inclusion of
participation and empowerment principles in the implementation of the evaluation – including in the data
collection and data analysis phases.
• Appreciative Inquiry. Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is a strengths-based, positive approach to organizational
assessment and change. This principle overlaps substantively with the previously described principles of
naturalistic inquiry, utilization focused and participation and empowerment. The extra additional contribution
to the evaluation is the emphasis on a strengths-based approach in shaping the evaluation questions and data
analysis.
As a general practice, the advantage of these approaches in combination is that they allow for a combination of
methods to be used, but implicitly recognize that the programmed objectives and activities of any framework
such as the NDS (2016-2021) Human Capital Pillar is also embedded within political economies, social
systems, and cultures and therefore is implemented by different stakeholders in different ways at different
times as adaptations to context. The particularities of the NDS itself within the larger Kosovo governance
context suggests that integrating these five principles will be important for the development of the evaluation
process.
Naturalistic Inquiry: The package of the NDS implementation strategies has undergone changes and
adaptation from the initial design in 2016 including the elaboration of an NDS roadmap in 2017 and ongoing
turnover in Kosovo governments with subsequent shifts in strategic implementation and programming. The
naturalistic approach would be a useful principle to help track contributions in the midst of changes.
Exercises such as timeline exercises could help articulate these adjustments and changes. Naturalistic inquiry
often relies on interview guides that allow for flexibility to explore unexpected dimensions or identify when
shifts occurred not captured in programme documentation. The guides are intended to elicit the implicit
theories in use among stakeholders which can then be compared against the formalized logframe, roadmap or
Theories of Change to assess the degree that these instruments align with the stakeholders’ implicit theories of
use and to identify potential adjustments or programmatic gaps. Consequently, semi-structured interview
guides and historical review are important tool adaptations based on a naturalistic inquiry approach.
3 Naturalistic approaches include a gamut of methodologies including – but not limited to – goal-free evaluation, outcome harvesting, interpretivism,
among others.
91
The utilization focused principle is an important consideration in the design of the evaluation process. In
this case, related to the timing of the evaluation within the larger design of the new NDS and ongoing policy
development processes of the Kosovo Government. As mentioned in section 1.0, an evaluation such as the
current exercise is intended to inform the development of the new NDS. However, the drafting of the new
NDS has already been started before the evaluation of the old NDS has begun – limiting the potential of the
NDS recommendations to inform the new NDS. The utilization focused is most evident during the inception
phase when additional consultations with stakeholders shaped the focus of the evaluation to best provide
usefulness given these dynamics. In addition, in the case of this NDS evaluation, it is expected that the
evaluation process will liaise with the key focal points involved in the design of the new NDS and will provide
preliminary observation inputs based on available information at agreed upon moments to help inform the
design process of the new NDS.
Contribution Analysis. Contribution analysis is an approach for inferring the degree to which programme
actions have contributed to the perceived outcomes. A theory of change is often the foundation of a
contribution analysis but other tools such as a roadmap or a logical framework can also be used.4 The
articulation of a theory of change and subsequent assessment of the perceived relationships between the
various linkages and the validity of the assumptions can be used to generate a plausible argument for
programme contribution. The conclusion of a contribution analysis is not necessarily definitive proof, but
rather provides evidence of a line of reasoning that the programme has contributed to observed results. In the
case of the NDS, the NDS has elaborated both policy notes and a road map for guiding implementation. The
policy notes were to present a logical connection between the overall NDS objectives and the practices and
measures that could serve to the accomplishment of these objectives. These policy notes can be considered a
de-facto TOC in this sense of providing linkages between objectives to actions and will serve as the foundation
of the reconstruction of the implied TOC mentioned in section 2.2.1. The mechanics of Contribution analysis
are covered in more detail in the data analysis section of the methodology.
Participation and Empowerment. This evaluation is being commissioned by SPO and the UNICEF as part
of an ongoing capacity building and learning opportunity. As such, there is a strong interest in ensuring the
active participation of stakeholders within the design, data collection and analysis processes within the
evaluation. There are three mechanisms in the design of this evaluation to support this. First, the evaluation
approach is emphasizing a learning approach which seeks to engage stakeholders in reflection on lessons
learned. Second, the evaluation process is integrating two additional workshops to support learning and
participation. In the first part of the design process, a learning workshop is planned to be held with technical
staff from the SPO and other Kosovo institutions on the principles of evaluation. During the reporting phase, a
second workshop is planned with SPO and Government stakeholders on the process for developing a
management response to the evaluation findings. Finally, the design of the evaluation intends to include the
participation of Kosovo youth as part of a youth accompanied evaluation. UNICEF in Kosovo places a high
degree of importance on youth empowerment principles and to support the personal and professional
development of youth within the Kosovo context. As a co-sponsor with the SPO of the NDS evaluation, there is
an aspiration to continue to support this deliberate integration of the voice of youth into the organizational
processes. The UNICEF Kosovo Programme has had some history of success with youth integration in
evaluation and assessment processes. In 2019, during the Situation Analysis exercise carried out by UNICEF
as part of the new programme cycle design, UNICEF organized a youth reference group who played a role in
helping youth provide input to the design of the process, to the content of the situation analysis itself, and also
to the review of the products of the situation analysis. Following on this in 2020, the evaluation of the
UNICEF Kosovo programme included the accompaniment of five youth from Kosovo University who
participated in data collection interviews as well as the data analysis exercises.
In line with the efforts to increase youth participation in planning and decision-making processes, SPO and
UNICEF will involve six university-aged youth (1st and 2nd year students). The students were selected through
two avenues: First, a social media announcement was distributed by the Psychology department at the
University of Prishtina “Hasan Prishtina” soliciting volunteers to be part of accompanying the evaluation
process for professional development. A psychology professor at the University volunteered to serve as a
mentor to the students participating in this exercise and the students could get practicum credit. In addition,

92
a general announcement was posted by UNICEF on the Kosovo Volunteer platform seeking volunteers who
may not be linked to the Psychology department but who would have interested to accompany and support the
NDS evaluation processes. From these two avenues, candidates were interviewed by one of the evaluation
team members during the inception phase and six candidates (four women and two men) were selected. Their
role will be to shadow the evaluation team members in the course of interviews and analysis, but it is also
expected that their observations and insights regarding what they see and hear will contribute to informing the
data analysis and findings from the data collection exercises and provide an opportunity for additional
professional development and learning for the participants.
Appreciative Inquiry. As mentioned earlier, AI principles overlap with the utilization focuses, naturalistic
inquiry and participation and empowerment principles. The additional contribution to shaping the evaluation
methodology beyond the implications already covered in the previous paragraphs includes the strength-based,
positive approach focus. This can be seen in the development of interview guide questions for the NDS that
also explores what has the NDS done well already? Or what are the comparative advantages of having an NDS
in the Kosovo context and so forth. In the development of the conclusions and recommendations appreciative
inquiry shapes their outputs through identifying not only the lessons learned in terms of gaps but also to
support the strengths to maximize in the next NDS in terms of implementation practices and positioning.
United Nations Evaluation Principles: The evaluation will focus on the three main objectives outlined in
the TOR by applying key OECD/DAC criteria, specifically relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, synergies,
sustainability, and long-term change. It is expected that all members of the evaluation team will abide by the
2016 UNEG norms and standards, the 2007 UNEG Ethical Guidelines and Code of Conduct as well as the
principles of ‘do no harm’. The key OECD/DAC criteria will inform the development of the data collection
methods and tools. The methodology will be guided by UNEG Ethical standards to shape the evaluation
approaches to ensure that the exercise does not harm participants either during or after the evaluation
process. The UNEG guidance on Gender (UNSWAP) - specifically the Evaluation performance indicator (EPI)
- will inform the shape of the evaluation approach to ensure adequate representation of gender considerations
in the evaluation processes and assessment of results. Based on these parameters, an evaluation matrix was
developed for the evaluation describing the key questions and sub-questions, their links to the OECD/DAC
criteria, relevant indicators, and the data collection methods to be used to address these questions (Annex 5).
Gender, Equity and Human Rights: Based on the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) guidance
and based on the principles described in the UN SWAP Evaluation Performance Indicator (EPI) technical note
(April 2018), the methodological approach will further integrate a gender-equality lens as part of the overall
analysis. This involves addressing the substantive aspects related to gender and equity issues within the NDS
activities included in the evaluation period. The evaluation will take a two-pronged approach for Gender
consideration in the methodology. At the basic level, ensuring adequate inclusion of men, and women as
relevant in the data collection process. The evaluation will also seek to explore whether the Kosovo NDS has
made contributions to addressing the key gender barriers, harmful practices, or negative norms and
stereotypes as well as other inequalities that may be impeding the development for women as well as men.
With the exception of increased women’s participation in the workforce, the NDS itself does not articulate a
systematic equity or human rights lens – focusing more on the establishment of activities that are intended to
improve the operations and quality of specific systems. However, an equity and human rights approach can be
integrated into the evaluation process to a certain degree by taking a disaggregation approach to the evaluation
questions themselves. For example, which types of stakeholders were consulted during the design process and
were particular groups excluded? Or, during monitoring reports, is monitoring data disaggregated to consider
vulnerable populations or differentiated effects of activities on vulnerable groups? Recommendations for
future NDS programming may also include suggestions regarding how to bring an increased equity and human
rights lens to subsequent NDS measures.
Evaluation Information Sources
Sources of Information: For any evaluation, there are four potential general categories information: i) Pre-
existing documentation (e.g., policies, donor reports, external research, among others); ii) Pre-existing
93
quantitative or qualitative information (e.g., national level demographic indicators, programme logframe
indicator measurement, internal datasets, among others); iii) Primary qualitative information (information
collected by the Evaluation team or other stakeholders during the data collection field mission - e.g., key
informant interviews, focus group discussions, project observations, or similar exercises); iv) Primary
quantitative information (information collected by the Evaluation team or other stakeholders during the
data collection phase. e.g., household surveys, health measurements, education performance measures,
virtual questionnaires, and similar exercises). For this evaluation, the approach will draw on the first three
types of data and will use a mixed methods approach. The specific methodological adaptations and tool
development to gather information from these sources are shaped by the evaluation principles described in
section 4.2.
In terms of pre-existing documentation, for this evaluation, there exists a wide range of studies, strategies,
policy notes and other assessments sponsored by the OPM and the Kosovo Government (Annex 2). These can
be used to track progress and alignment of the NDS against other frameworks.
In terms of pre-existing quantitative information, for this evaluation, the NDS at the strategic level has
primarily relied on national level demographic indicators linked to goals and outcomes. These indicators are
measured through Governmental or Inter-Agency exercises. UNICEF did support the implementation of the
MICS in 2013-2014 and a second MICS in 2019-2020. These exercises can complement and update the
macro-level indicators connected to the NDS. The NDS roadmap developed in 2017 does outline a monitoring
framework to track output and activity indicators related to the NDS implementation.
There are some gaps in the pre-existing quantitative information for tracking activities and outputs because
the NDS monitoring framework was not always able to be applied consistently. However, while the
information is not necessarily collated into a single monitoring framework, many of these activities can be
tracked through triangulation with the annual reports produced by Line Ministries and other Government
departments.
Based on the current pre-existing documentation, and qualitative and quantitative data, the primary
qualitative information needs – to be collected by the evaluation team or other stakeholders during the data
collection phase – relate to triangulating patterns from the documentation and quantitative indicator data to
address the evaluation questions and sub-questions. The documentation gaps are noted in section 4.4.1. In
terms of persons to interview to respond to the evaluation questions, these were identified during the
inception phase stakeholder analysis and a precise list elaborated with the SPO/OPM. Annex 7 describes the
additional mapping carried out for stakeholder analysis.
The stakeholders associated with the NDS are described in Section 2.2.3 and their interests and roles in the
evaluation further elaborated in Annex 6. Based on this analysis, a subsequent analysis was carried out to
determine who should be part of the primary qualitative data collection process. The evaluation will ensure
that efforts will be made to ensure a gender balance of interviews.
These specific categories of stakeholders can be clustered into different tiers or levels of stakeholders
connected with the NDS programme. The first level would be those who had a direct stake in the evaluation
because they are involved in the implementation of the NDS and its associated programmatic frameworks,
plans or strategies. This includes specific offices and departments within the OPM, relevant line ministries, or
other private sector organizations. The second level would be decision makers who are involved in designing
the policies and strategies at the local and national level related to the human capital pillar or their financing.
Finally, there are a class of stakeholders who would be affected by the NDS such as civil society organizations
(CSOs), Public Agencies, Ministries, private sector organizations, among others. These three levels can provide
complementary insights into the performance of the NDS in this current cycle. The specific types of
stakeholders can be clustered into three tiers or levels associated with the NDS who can be interviewed during
data collection (Annex 7).
Key Features of Evaluation Structure
Based on the available information, information needs and evaluation principles, the overall evaluation
structure is comprised of the following elements:
94
A core evaluation team of two members – one international and one national expert5
Six6 national university-aged youth will accompany the evaluation processes as part of UNICEF’s overall
vision of youth inclusion and professional development. The youth will provide support to the evaluation team
members in terms of logistics and note-taking, and they will be expected to provide their insights and
observations to contribute to informing the data analysis exercises.
The data collection field mission will emphasize collecting primary qualitative data through key informant
interviews (KIIs) or group interviews. Secondary quantitative data will be analysed from pre-existing
datasets from other available national and international sources. Additional document review will be
carried out during and after the data collection phase.
The evaluation data collection exercise is based on remote interviews due to the pandemic and is scheduled to
last for four weeks and include a two-day (remote) data analysis exercise with the ET members and youth
accompaniers at the end of the data collection phase.
Per the TOR, the elaboration of two one-day “learning workshops” will be integrated into the process. The first
shortly after the inception phase with SPO technical staff on evaluation principles and processes and the
second at the end of the reporting phase to facilitate the development of the management response and action
plans.
Data Collection Methods and Tools
The evaluation methods to be applied are consistent with the methods proposed in the TOR. The primary
adjustments have been the integration of the youth volunteer supporters to the evaluation.
Remote Approaches. Due to the pandemic and the social distancing restrictions, the bulk of the evaluation
data collection will need to be carried out through remote technologies – telephone, WhatsApp, Zoom, or
Skype. However, one of the evaluation team members is based in Prishtina and does have the opportunity to
carry out some face-to-face interviews as protocols or conditions dictate. It is not anticipated that a remote
approach will present any difficulties to the evaluation process. Kosovo has extremely high internet
penetration even in remote rural areas and the categories of stakeholders required for interviews in this
evaluation are those who will have access to good internet and remote approaches. In addition, UNICEF has
had experience with remote evaluations through the elaboration of the Kosovo Programme Evaluation in
2020. Finally, the Government of Kosovo has been operating remotely throughout the pandemic and
associated stakeholders are now familiar with, and have access to, remote approaches in their daily work.
Finally,
Evaluation Matrix: An evaluation matrix has been developed based on the evaluation questions (Annex 4).
The matrix provides an overview and framework to guide the ET throughout the process of data collection and
data analysis and is intended to show the linkages between the TOR questions, the sources of data, indicators
for analysis, methods of data collection, and methods of analysis that the team will use. Each type of
information will contribute to the triangulation of data responding to each of the evaluation questions.
Data Tools. There are two primary approaches to be employed as part of the evaluation process – document
review (for qualitative and quantitative information) and key informant interviews. The document review will
be based on a checklist of information needed to assess efficiency and effectiveness of activities that has been
synthesized from the 2017 Roadmap (described in more detail in Annex 2). The checklist may also be used
during some interviews to assess whether certain activities had been completed or not based on the
perspectives of the stakeholders.
The Key informant interviews (KII) will be done using a single semi-structured questionnaire based on the
questions outlined in the evaluation matrix. A general KII is developed for all stakeholders that is expected to
be adapted by the team appropriately to the expertise and relevance of the stakeholders under review. The
5 See Section 7.1 for more details on team composition, roles, and responsibilities. An additional research assistant may be provided by KonTerra to
support the core team during the data collection phase if necessary
6 Applications are still being received during the inception phase and will be finalized for the data collection phase.
95
Annex 5 descriptions include both the document review tool and the detailed descriptions of administration
protocol, informed consent, and ethical considerations to be used with the interview guide.
Connection of document review and KIIs to Evaluation Dimension. The survey profiled in Annex 7
also describe the link between specific questions on the tools and the overarching evaluation dimensions. The
Evaluation Matrix (Annex 5) provides a summary of the link between each data source and the indicators to be
reviewed as part of the process of building conclusions. The format of the KII in Annex 5 is structured so as to
illustrate the linkage between specific interview questions, the evaluation TOR questions and the respective
evaluation dimensions.
Stakeholder Selection
An over-arching criterion is information richness based on purposive sampling. 7 The specific
selection will depend on purposive sampling for the qualitative interviews. Criteria include: Information
richness (are the respondents sufficiently familiar with the activities to provide insights from different
perspectives including sex, ethnicity, or regional dynamics?), accessibility (can the stakeholders be accessed
by the evaluation team?), and diversity (Does the mix of stakeholders represent of the diversity of sex and
ethnicities among NDS stakeholders?). To confirm information richness, the final selection of stakeholders
was made in consultation with the SPO/OPM and UNICEF Kosovo.8 Annex 6 describes the list of stakeholders
and stakeholder classes to be interviewed during the data collection phase.
Data Analysis Methods
All three main types of data (document, quantitative and qualitative) will have their accompanying
management and analyses. To ensure consistency in understanding the objectives of the evaluation, a
preliminary orientation facilitated by the team leader will provide a shared understanding of the use of the
tools. Semi-structured interview guides with probes are used to ensure consistent formatting of the interviews.
Evaluation notes are to be compiled into a standardized template - labelled by stakeholder and activity and
location (Annex 5). The notes are to be shared and reviewed collectively by the team for data quality. Data
analysis methods employ descriptive and comparative quantitative analysis, thematic narrative analysis,
qualitative iterative data analysis and contribution analysis. All methods will be triangulated both internally
and across methods as feasible.
Descriptive and comparative quantitative analysis. The pre-existing quantitative data will be
analysed through descriptive analysis. As feasible, this will involve frequency analysis of key patterns with
cross tabulation for dimensions of interest. Where possible, the analysis will seek to identify trends across
criteria or time.
Document Review: The documentary review will rely on thematic narrative analysis for highlighting
key themes identified in the documents and connect them to the relevant points in the evaluation matrix.
Annex 5 contains the proposed tool for thematic narrative analysis.
Qualitative iterative data analysis is based on an iterative process of identifying key thought units
related to each evaluation question from the KIIs9, organizing these thought units into clusters and identifying
the key themes within each cluster. These are then clustered into categories and emergent themes from each
category for further analysis and re-categorization to identify key patterns.10 Evidence for conclusions is to be
built via triangulation analysis. Themes or patterns will be examined to determine if they are coming from
multiple stakeholder levels and multiple stakeholder categories. Observations or comments that only come
from a single source or a single category of stakeholder will be given less weight during the building of the
7 Information rich individuals do not necessarily mean individual who are biased about the programme or who are directly involved in implementation
of activities – rather, information richness implies individuals who can speak knowledgeably about the programme – either as an intended recipient of
the programme OR external observer with sufficient observational exposure to the programme that they can provide a competent opinion.
8 It is not usually a good use of ET time to interview persons who have no knowledge of a programme, but an additional way to control bias is to include
in the course of interviews to stakeholders familiar with one type of programming what are their perceptions about OTHER programmes supported by
UNICEF to which they are not as closely linked. These observations can be integrated into the triangulation exercises described in the data analysis
sections.

96
analysis. Findings highlighted in the report will be those emerging from multiple actors and across multiple
stakeholder categories.11
Data analysis will be conducted through a series of synchronous and asynchronous exercises both during the
data collection phase itself and afterwards as part of the analysis phase. The synchronous sessions are held
combing Zoom verbal communication with the platform Mural for visual organization.12 In the asynchronous
work, team members will do their own asynchronous work against the evaluation matrix and integrate into
Mural prior to each meeting.
Contribution Analysis. Contribution analysis is an approach for inferring the degree to which programme
actions have contributed to the perceived outcomes and is based on the construction and analysis of the
implied theory of change behind the NDS. The construction of the TOC is one of the data analysis exercises to
be carried out during the previously described synchronous Mural sessions. The theory of change is the
foundation of a contribution analysis.13 The articulation of a theory of change and subsequent assessment of
the perceived relationships between the various linkages and the validity of the assumptions can be used to
generate a plausible argument for programme contribution. The conclusion of a contribution analysis is not
necessarily definitive proof, but rather provides evidence of a line of reasoning that the programme has
contributed to observed results. Generically, the important factors for a successful contribution analysis
include:
That there exists a theory of change for the intervention
• Key assumptions behind the expected connection of the interventions have face validity
• The activities in the programme were implemented as described in the theory of change
• The theory of change has not been disproved
• External factors influencing results have been assessed and controlled for or their relative role in contributing to
the desired result has been recognized.
Contribution analysis is important for understanding the linkage to observed programme effects and will play
a role in conclusions regarding effectiveness, relevance, and sustainability. The NDS has not elaborated an
overall ToC – either over all or as part of each pillar. However, the NDS policy notes and the NDS roadmap do
describe an implicit theory of change which guided the elaboration of the objectives and the selection of
activities to achieve these objectives. This implicit ToC can be used to infer contribution analysis.
This model can then be populated with the evidence currently available (qualitative or quantitative) related to
the outcomes and the programme. During the analysis, patterns of results are assessed against the links of the
implied ToC to determine whether the observed patterns match the implied ToC model and to identify
possible weakness or gaps in the ToC. A reasonable contribution claim can be made if: a) there is an implied
theory of change that is plausible and supported by the evidence; b) the planned activities operationalizing the
intervention were implemented in alignment with the ToC; and c) other influencing factors have been assessed
and their relative role in contributing to the desired results have been recognized and accounted for.
Triangulation. Due to the importance of triangulation of findings from different sources in the exercise, a
key component of the data analysis will be the analysis debriefings at the end of the data collection phase to be
used to substantiate the findings and to develop the conclusions and recommendations in response to the TOR
questions. Triangulation involves comparing information from different sources, collected by different
evaluators, and obtained from different methods.14 In alignment with the utilization focused principle of the
evaluation, initial findings and conclusions will be shared with the SPO/OPM and UNICEF and Kosovo
Institutions at the end of the data collection phase for discussion and eliciting feedback or the correction of
facts.
11 Stakeholder categories will be disaggregated as well to check for balance among voices. For example, if 10 personnel from a specific municipality
noted a certain pattern – this would receive less weight if the ten respondents were all from different municipalities. The latter would have more
generalizability to the national level while the former would only be relevant to the observations from the single source.
12 Mural is an online platform which functions as a virtual flipchart where the team could post their thoughts on virtual “sticky notes” which could then
be moved and organized by categories and clusters. Constructing the Mural together allowed each team member to have ownership in the process.

97
Ethical Considerations and Protocols
Ethical Considerations. As mentioned earlier, the evaluation will be conducted to ensure the compliance
with ethical and moral principles through the application of the UNEG Code of Conduct for Evaluation and
Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation and UNICEF’s procedures for data collection for evaluation research and
studies.15 These have special relevance in relation to evaluations including affected populations and vulnerable
groups.
In the case of the NDS evaluation, the process is expected to draw on the pre-existing documentation and KII
with NDS stakeholders to inform the results of the NDS. There are no potentially vulnerable stakeholders
likely to be interviewed now children for this NDS. Because there are no children or vulnerable groups
involved in the evaluation data collection, the evaluation does not need to go through a formal Institutional
Review Board (IRB) ethics review as part of the design process. However, the evaluation will still adhere to the
ethical considerations related to safety, confidentiality, and data protection regarding its treatment of
participants in the evaluation process.
Protocols for Safety, Confidentiality, and Data Protection. The principles of informed consent and
the maintenance of confidentiality are crucial pillars of any evaluation data collection exercise. In this case,
interviewees will be informed at the start of the interview regarding the purpose of the evaluation, assurances
of voluntary participation, and confidentiality of all responses.16 Potential interviewees are likely to have high
workloads and the evaluation team will use the principle of mutual respect by ensuring that the interviews are
as concise and as efficient as possible. In addition to the standard ethical requirements of any evaluation data
collection process, this particular evaluation has five additional factors with ethical implications related to the
principle of “do no harm” – both for the evaluation team as well as evaluation participants.
Data protection measures. After data is collected, data protection measures will be used to ensure
respondent confidentiality across all data instruments. The pre-existing monitoring data from as available
from the Kosovo Government or UNICEF will be stripped of personal data before sharing with the evaluation
team, although this is not likely to be necessary given the strategic nature of the evaluation.
For the qualitative data, all interview notes from the evaluation team are kept electronically on password
encrypted computers. Personal names and other potential personal identifiers will be removed from the data
prior to analysis. Data analysis will be carried out only with the evaluation team members to ensure
confidentiality. Data compiled in reporting will be aggregated so that individual responses from KIIs cannot be
traced to specific locations or individuals. Both quantitative and qualitative information will be maintained on
evaluation team computers only until the finalization of the report, at which time it will be deleted to further
protect individuals from possible identification.
Based on the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) guidance and based on the principles described in the
UN SWAP Evaluation Performance Indicator (EPI) technical note (April 2018), the methodological approach
will further integrate a gender-equality lens as part of the overall analysis. This involves addressing the
substantive aspects related to gender and equity issues within the NDS human capital pillar activities included
in the evaluation period.
Learning evaluations and conflict of interest. The evaluation is led by an independent international expert.
The other evaluation team member is an independent consultant contracted by UNICEF. This is not an
evaluation of UNICEF programming but rather this evaluation has been commissioned by the Office of the
Prime Minister and is an example of a national government led evaluation exercise. As such there is limited
concerns for conflict of interest as both evaluation team members are no associated with the Government of
Kosovo or the NDS.
Furthermore, although all evaluations contain elements of both accountability and learning, the relative
emphasis of these two dimensions will inform the degree to which stakeholders who may be part of the
programme and strategy under review should participate in the evaluation processes. Conflict of interest

98
considerations are a major point of emphasis when evaluations are emphasizing accountability aspects. In the
case of this NDS, there is a strong emphasis on the learning aspects, and this will shape the design and
participation of internal stakeholders. Learning is best accomplished when more internal stakeholders are
involved in the evaluation process. For this reason, the Evaluation Management is co-shared by the SPO/OPM
with UNICEF, and it is anticipated that the Evaluation Reference Group will be comprised of high-level
Government stakeholders to ensure increased learning and ownership of the evaluation results.
Limitations and Risks
Evaluation risks during data collection generally involve four potential factors: i) security considerations, ii)
response bias (including gender bias), iii) access, or iv) timing. During the pandemic, an additional
consideration of COVID-19 restrictions and protocols has also emerged. At the time of the Inception phase,
these risks were deemed relatively minimal for data collection with the exception of the Covid-19 restrictions.
These have led to the use of a remote interview methodology and a virtual evaluation. However, there may be
opportunities for physical presence events to be carried out during one or both learning workshops. The
following paragraphs review each of these four dimensions for risk.
Security considerations. There are no specific security risks in Kosovo either to the evaluation team or for
potential stakeholders involved in the interview process.
Mitigation: None needed. However, since the evaluation commissioned by the SPO/OPM, and UNICEF will
be carried out virtually any potential issues of risk to the evaluation team are considered minimal.
Response Bias: Given the particularities and sensitivities embedded in the Kosovo political context, there is
a potential that evaluation team members will receive biased information or may not be sufficiently aware of
potentials for response bias.
Mitigation: A series of measures are integrated into the methodological approach to respond to issues of
consistency and potential bias. First, the selection of stakeholders to be interviewed will comprise a mix to
ensure that the respective voices from each of the stakeholder groups are included in the data. Second, the
team has developed standardized interview protocols based on the evaluation questions to ensure that the
interviews are consistent and can be easily validated. The protocols will ensure that sex disaggregation is
integrated into the questions to respondents, but also in the selection of respondents and in the analysis of
responses. Diversity will be considered in the selection of respondents and the analysis of responses.
Finally, the evaluation team itself represents a mix of nationalities, sex, and expertise. Different members of
the team will interview different sets of stakeholders in order to limit potential interviewer bias. Data analysis
will be done collectively to provide triangulated assessments of conclusions and to balance international and
national interpretations of the findings. The use of the evaluation matrix will further seek to balance
international and national interpretations of findings.
Gender Bias and Gender Integration. Gender sensitive results of the NDS will need to go beyond simply
assessing the participation of girls and women touched by activities but to also understand the degree of
consultation and voice in the design of the process. There may also be a potential for responses to be biased
depending on the evaluation team members.
Mitigation: To mitigate potential gender bias, the selection of stakeholders to be interviewed will always
include a range of women, and men to ensure that the respective voices are included in the data. Where
possible, members of the team will interview different sets of stakeholders in order to limit potential
interviewer bias or respondent reticence impeding female responses. The evaluation will look to apply sex
disaggregated analysis as relevant and to assess the extent to which differential needs, priorities, and voices
were included in the NDS design and implementation processes. Gender and ethnicity equality are integrated
into the evaluation matrix and subsequently into the interview guide for understanding the interventions.
Covid-19 Pandemic. The global pandemic still presents risks not only to the evaluation team but to local
stakeholders involved in the evaluation interviews. Global travel restrictions, the closing of borders, and
99
internal social distancing regulations could prevent the evaluation team from being able to visit Kosovo or
conduct in-person interviews or focus group discussions with stakeholders.
Mitigation: The NDS will rely primarily on a virtual evaluation format. This is seen as feasible because of the
high degree of internet penetration among targeted stakeholders and the nature of the evaluation questions.
The primary shifts are to do all interviews through Skype, WhatsApp, Zoom, or Cell Phone calls with the
targeted stakeholders. The data collection window needs to be expanded to account for the more likely
disruptions to interviews. However, data quality is still expected to be high with these adjustments. Data
analysis will be carried out using the Mural internet platform which allows for real-time collaborative
development of findings and conclusions by dispersed participants in a single space.
Quality Assurance
The quality of the evaluation will be addressed in several ways throughout the process. First, through the
application of core GEROS principles in its practice; second, through approaches supporting data reliability,
consistency, and accuracy; and third through support and oversight provided by KonTerra.
Quality assurance in evaluation refers to the process by which evaluation standards will be upheld. In this
case, UNICEF uses the GEROS review system. This evaluation is not a UNICEF evaluation and as such will
not go through the formal GEROS review, but the evaluation will follow the principles of quality described in
GEROS and the evaluation will pass through an external review for learning purposes with the SPO/OPM.
Application of GEROS. The ET will create a checklist using key UNEG/UNICEF (2010) and GEROS
standards (2013) for each report produced (i.e. inception report, draft/final report, synthesis presentation).
For example, the checklist will help ensure that the report:
• Specifies data collection, analysis, and sampling methods.
• Specifies data sources, their rationale for selection and their limitations
• Describes ethical safeguards undertaken ensure confidentiality, protection of stakeholders’/participants’ rights,
ensuring informed consent, providing feedback to participant, and shaping/checking the behaviour of the
evaluators.
• Incorporates to the extent possible a human right, gender equality and equity approach in the data approach,
analysis, and findings.
• Adequately describes the scope and scale of stakeholder consultation
• Adequately describes the ET limitations and how they were managed
• Presents findings clearly and based on the evidence provided; this should also include a discussion of unexpected
findings
• Addresses all main questions in the ToR
Activities to ensure data reliability, consistency, and accuracy. The methodology as described in
Section 4.3 is designed to support data reliability through mixed methods, diverse stakeholder engagement,
and triangulation, including the following:
• Drawing information from a diverse range of stakeholders to enhance accuracy and reliability of data.
• Ensuring stakeholders are relevant and represent true key informants.
• Ensuring interview guides focus on interviewees’ expected areas of expertise and in the quality of questioning in
the key informant interview guides (for example, ensuring questions are not leading, assumptions are explicit,
research biases are mitigated, etc.).
In addition, the quality of data analysis will be supported through triangulation of results from multiple data
sources (document review, key informant interviews disaggregated by stakeholder type, youth tracer study
survey and primary data collection via field visits)
KonTerra supervision and expertise. KonTerra’s Director of Evaluation & Organizational Learning,
Menno Wiebe, assumes primary responsibility for contract quality assurance. He will have responsibility for
maintaining an effective working relationship with the evaluation team leader and the other team members.
Belén Diaz, a member of the KonTerra team and quality assurance specialist, will also provide support as an
independent resource. The Director and QA specialist will provide an independent review of all deliverables
100
produced during the course of the contract. KonTerra is ultimately responsible for the quality of the evaluation
products and will ensure the quality of data (validity, consistency, and accuracy) throughout. KonTerra will
make the necessary amendments at their own expense, to bring the evaluation products to the required quality
level in the case of any standards that are not be met by the evaluation team.
Evaluation Reference Group (ERG). An Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) is always integrated into an
evaluation process to serve to provide oversight of the evaluation process and ratification of evaluation results.
The NDS evaluation will have an ERG, but the exact composition is not yet finalized at the time of the
inception phase. It will be composed of key stakeholders from the Kosovo Government, UNICEF, and other
stakeholders to serve as the primary oversight steering committee for the overall evaluation process.
Currently, the intention is that the reference group will review and comment on the evaluation final product
and be involved in the elaboration of the management response. The reference group may also be an audience
for the exit debriefing presentation conducted at the end of the data collection phase (Anticipated near the
middle of June) to present preliminary findings and conclusions. The ERG is to be composed of between 8-12
members depending on availability and led by a representative within the Office of the Prime Minister or
similar level. The final composition of the ERG is at the discretion of the SPO/OPM. The UNICEF EM will
coordinate throughout the evaluation process with the relevant actors and serve as the primary
communications link between the ET and the ERG.

Annex 7: Data Collection Tools
7.1 Key Informant Interview Guide
KII Semi Structured Interview Guides
This section lays out the principles that will guide the evaluation team in its selection of Key Informant (KII)
participants and its conduct of the KII interviews. The evaluation team will conduct KIIs with participants
selected for their first-hand knowledge of the NDS and its programming.
These guides are designed to be a “semi-structured” interview guide. A semi-structured interview guide is one
that is intended to provide some guidance to a conversation, but with the flexibility of being modified as
needed. As semi-structured guides, the facilitators may engage in probes as themes emerge and the facilitators
should have the freedom to follow emergent themes as pertinent to the overall evaluation matrix and the
evaluation objectives. It is important to note that not all questions will be considered relevant for all
stakeholder groups. Thus, the interviewer should re-phrase the questions as they see fit to make them
appropriate for their audiences.
A single guide has been developed. The numbers in parentheses are to show the linkage between each
interview guide question and the corresponding themes in the evaluation matrix. All notes are recorded in a
response matrix and all responses for a particular evaluation matrix theme will be analysed in combination at
the end of the field phase to determine emergent themes and patterns across the responses.
Each section covers a different segment of the Evaluation TOR and Matrix. The interviewer should only cover
a segment if the respondent has sufficient experience or insights to address the segment.
The interviewer should foresee about 1 hour on average for each KII interview. Not all questions can be
asked in all interviews, therefore, it is important to prioritize which sections are the most information rich
with particular stakeholders.
The interviewer should introduce themselves and clarify the purpose of the evaluation, as well as the
confidentiality of the interview (i.e. when quoting KIs, attribution will be made to categories of stakeholders,
not individuals or organizations)
General Guidelines for KIIs
Establish rapport. Begin with an explanation of the purpose of the interview, the intended uses of the
information and assurances of confidentiality (See introduction below). Except when interviewing technical
experts, questioners should avoid jargon.
Phrase questions carefully to elicit detailed information. Avoid questions that can be answered by a simple yes
or no. For example, questions such as “Please tell me about the youth programme activities?” are better than
“Do you know about the youth programme activities?”
Use probing techniques. Encourage informants to detail the basis for their conclusions and recommendations.
For example, an informant’s comment, such as “The youth program has really changed things around here,”
can be probed for more details, such as “What changes have you noticed?” “Who seems to have benefitted
most?” “Can you give me some specific examples?”
Maintain a neutral attitude. Interviewers should be sympathetic listeners and avoid giving the impression of
having strong views on the subject under discussion. Neutrality is essential because some informants, trying to
be polite, will say what they think the interviewer wants to hear.
Minimize translation difficulties. Sometimes it is necessary to use a translator, which can change the dynamics
and add difficulties. For example, differences in status between the translator and informant may inhibit the
103
conversation. Often information is lost during translation. Difficulties can be minimized by using translators
who are not known to the informants, briefing translators on the purposes of the study to reduce
misunderstandings, and having translators repeat the informant’s comments verbatim.
Collect Additional Documentation. During the interview the Key informant may refer to documentation. Ask
for copies preferably in digital form, but if unavailable then hard copy. This can help fill in any gaps and add to
the existing documentation.
Thank the key informant. Thank the key informant for the time given to the interview and the information
provided. Suggest that if acceptable, you may need to contact them again to confirm statements or to seek
more information.
Ethical and Safety Considerations
Conducting work of this nature requires high ethical standards to ensure that expectations are not raised,
confidentiality is maintained, and respondents are treated with dignity and respect, and are never forced to
participate or encouraged to speak about subjects that may be traumatising or may put them at risk. This
entails:
▪ Dignity & Respect: Key Informants understand the purpose of the exercise, the types and intended use
of the data that are going to be collected. They are reassured that there will be no repercussions should
they choose not to participate.
▪ Confidentiality: Key Informants are aware that any reference will be generic to make it impossible to
trace information to its individual source. However, the information provided during the interview will be
recorded and used for the purpose of the evaluation.
▪ Safety: Location and timing are crucial. Discussion is held in a private, non-threatening, and easily
accessible and safe place, and at a time that is appropriate to the key informant needs and schedule.
KII Interview Introduction

Background
The Strategic Planning Office / Office of the Prime Minister is conducting the Evaluation of
the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2016-2021, with a focus on the Human Capital
Pillar, supported by UNICEF Kosovo Office.
This evaluation aims to inform the Kosovo Institutions and the Office of the Prime Minister,
and other stakeholders on the progress made to date in the implementation of the Human
Capital related measures of the NDS 2016-2021 with a specific focus on forward-looking,
evidence-based lessons to inform the design and implementation of the upcoming NDS
(2022-2030).
The preparatory phase of the evaluation has been completed, with the design of the evaluation
underway, whereas the data collection should be completed by June 2021. The final evaluation
report is expected by July 2021.
The Evaluation Objectives and Focus
This evaluation will serve the mutually reinforcing objectives of accountability – assessing
performance and results achieved – and learning – determining why and how, certain
processes and results occurred the way they did, and drawing key lessons and good practices.
These evidence-based findings will inform strategic decision-making related to human
capital development in Kosovo.
The Evaluation has three objectives:
• To assess relevance, effectiveness, sustainability, efficiency, synergies, and longer-term
changes associated with the NDS – Human Capital Pillar - including the priority and
programmatic choices made in relation to other sectoral strategies and priorities and the
changing socio-economic context in Kosovo.
• Provide an independent performance assessment of the NDS 2016-2021 – Human Capital
Pillar – seen in relation to expected results as indicated in the NDS roadmap monitoring
framework for which the promotion of equity and gender equality are considered to form an
integral part.
• Identify lessons learned and forward-looking recommendations that can inform the
development of the NDS 2030.
To ensure independence and objectivity, an external company, The Konterra Group, was
engaged to conduct the Evaluation.
Purpose and Duration of the Youth Accompaniment Component in the
Evaluation
The Strategic Planning Office / Office of the Prime Minister and the UNICEF Kosovo Office
place a high degree of importance on youth empowerment principles and aspire to continue
to support the increase of youth participation in planning and decision-making processes. In
line with these efforts and the shared goal of supporting the personal and professional
development of youth in Kosovo, a youth accompaniment component has been included in
the design of the evaluation.
As part of the youth accompaniment component of the Evaluation, six youth volunteers will
participate in the Evaluation by shadowing the Evaluation team and participating in data
collection interviews, as well as data analysis exercises. The engagement of the youth
volunteers will start in May and should conclude by July 2021.
123
Recruitment and Eligibility of Youth Volunteers
Youth volunteers will be recruited through open calls for applications through two separate
channels.
As one of the psychology professors at the Department of Psychology of the University of
Prishtina will be mentoring the youth volunteers throughout the Evaluation, a social media
announcement will be distributed on the Department’s social media, soliciting volunteers to
be part of accompanying the evaluation process for professional development.
In addition, the same announcement will be posted by UNICEF on the Kosovo Volunteer
platform seeking volunteers who interested in accompanying and supporting the NDS
evaluation processes.
As this is an empowerment and capacity building opportunity for youth with limited
professional experience, candidates in first or second year of studies are particularly
encouraged to apply.
Duties and Benefits of Youth Volunteers
The youth volunteers will be expected to:
• Support the review of the evaluation instruments
• Regularly participate in planning meetings for the implementation of the evaluation
• Support the data collection process, through participation in interviews with key
stakeholders and note-taking
• Support the debriefing sessions and data analysis exercises with the Evaluation
Team, through sharing their insights and observations
• Support the development of the final evaluation report
• Contribute to a joint report with youth volunteers’ impressions and thoughts on the
NDS 2016-2021 and the evaluation process
• Maintain confidentiality of information in accordance with the Confidentiality,
Internet, and Data Security Statement
The youth volunteers will receive internship or volunteering credits for their participation in
the Evaluation. They will also be remunerated for their telephone expenses during the course
of the Evaluation.
The youth volunteers will have the opportunity to build capacities and understanding of
basic steps towards the evaluation implementation through participation in the one-day
learning workshop on evaluation principles, standards, approaches, and implementation.
During the course of the evaluation, the youth volunteers will also benefit from mentorship
of Prof. Ass. Dr. Kaltrina Kelmendi, Department of Psychology, University of Prishtina, as
well as support from the Evaluation Team.
