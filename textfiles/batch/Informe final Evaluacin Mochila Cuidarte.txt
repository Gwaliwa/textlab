Executive summary
BACKGROUND
The first years of the child's life feel the foundations for their future development. In particular, in the stage
of pregnancy up to 3 years, the brain is more sensitive to external influences.1 Progress in
Neuroscience show that the baby's brain forms new connections at extraordinary speed
Of more than 1 million per second, a rhythm that is never repeated. During this process, the experiences that
They live, including adequate nutrition, protection and stimulation through communication, game and
Receptive care of caregivers, influence neuronal connections, which impact development
cognitive, emotional, physical and social of the boy and the girl.2
According to the latest statistics available in Panama, only 2.7% of children under 3
Years are enrolled in public care services. Threats to development during the first
childhood are greater for children living in the most vulnerable homes3. The children in
Poverty have fewer toys and books. These children are more exposed to inappropriate care
and to malnutrition.
The object of this evaluation, take care of you, coincides with the regulatory and policy framework
public for early childhood development in Panama: i) Law 171/2020 on Integral Protection to the
Early childhood and early childhood development; ii) The early childhood comprehensive care route
(RAIPI), an intersectoral and inter -institutional care model that draws the sequence of attention
planned, continuous and permanent for the guarantee of the rights of children from 0 to 8 years and
iii) the "Colmena Plan", the State policy aimed at combating poverty in the 300 more corregimientos
Vulnerable, with the highest poverty index in indigenous areas.
To mitigate the impacts of the interruption of initial care and education services during pandemic
By COVID-19, the Ministry of Social Development (MIDES) designed and implemented various innovations, between
They, your Caipi at home (institutional modality) 4 and a backpack (family/community modality).
Take care backpack is a family/community care service and education service, which is
implements in areas of difficult access and without coverage of institutional modalities.
Evaluation object
Take care backpack is an initial care and education service in family/community mode. Has
as a goal to promote the development of boys and girls between 6 to 36 months through the game, care
family and the empowerment of parental skills. It consists of the delivery of a backpack with materials
didactics and a structured guide of activities aimed at mothers, fathers and caregivers of children.
In addition, families receive biweekly domiciliary visits for 6 months (12 visits) for “responsible
of implementation and monitoring ”(RIS) who were trained to promote and enhance the use of the
guide. Take care backpack is implemented in three phases: phase I (pilot), phase II (pilot evaluation), and phase III
(scale).
The evaluation object is understood as a “pilot at scale” because it proves the concept and elements for
Inform the escalation, for example, the added value of the home visit on the results of the
Early child development. Evaluation is part of the process of creating knowledge and learning
institutional to inform the escalation. Mides' scale vision is to reach a state program of
Initial care and education in family/community modality contextualized to local realities.

3 MICS, 2013. Data does not include children under 3 years. However, they demonstrate the territorial gaps.
4 The CAIPI teachers developed the curriculum through biweekly visits to the Caipi and weekly monitoring to the
families through phone calls.

Take care backpack is an adaptation of the care program5 and was designed by the Directorate of Services of
Social protection (dispos) of measures. Both interventions recognize the leading place that the
Families in care, upbringing, education and development of the child in their early childhood.
Purpose, objectives and scope of the evaluation
The purpose was to evaluate an initial care and education service (take care of you) in its pilot phase6,
validate elements and weigh the processes and results at this stage to inform the planning and
Execution of scaling in territories with important access gaps to education services
initial. The external formative evaluation generates knowledge that allows the institution
Learn and refine, prior to climbing the service as a state program. The evaluation is innovative, to the
incorporate an assessment of the impact of the service on the life of children and their families, as well as the
management and leadership of the evaluation process by the country itself.
The specific objectives of the evaluation are:
1. specify the pilot's relevance level to address the situation of children between 6 and 24 months
and their families in terms of child care, initial education and family accompaniment to improve
The interaction between caregivers and children through the game.
2. Determine the efficiency of the intervention in its pilot phase, by examining whether it is complemented in design,
implementation and monitoring with other interventions focused on early childhood financed by the
State, and establish actions to improve complementarity.
3. Estimate efficacy in the pilot phase (effectiveness efficacy). Specifically: i) establish the
factors (individual, socioeconomic) that affect the effectiveness of the backpack version that includes
biweekly visits, ii) estimate the optimal frequency of visits to achieve effects, iii) determine
assessment and satisfaction of the beneficiaries of the backpack taking care of yourself, and iv) delineate strategies to
Improve the component of home visits (process efficiency, service quality).
4. Estimate the differences between children who only receive the backpack and those who receive the backpack plus one
FINCENAL VISIT OF ORIENTATION AND ACCOMPANIMENT FAMILY FOR A RIS. (impact)
5. Determine the normative and institutional conditions necessary to climb the service
(Sustainability, scale pilot approach).
6. Determine the degree of inclusion of human rights approaches, gender and equity.
7. Identify good practices, innovations and lessons learned in the pilot stage to improve the
future intervention and provide elements that allow climbing its implementation.
8. Determine how to take care of yourself was thought from its design to be climbed, and assess whether in design
and execution has the appropriate components for escalation (scale pilot).
THEMATIC SCOPE: EVALUATION IS PART OF A “PILOT AT SCALE” process and constitute phase II of this
Process (formative pilot evaluation) for learning and escalation.
Temporary scope: The evaluation was carried out between October 2021 and June 2022 and covers experiences
obtained by the pilot during the execution for 6 months from July to December 2021.
Territorial scope: According to the pilot's population profile, the evaluation includes diverse territories
(rural, indigenous) of greater degree of poverty nationwide for information collection.
METHODOLOGY
The evaluation is non -experimental and uses mixed methods and elements of the evaluation based on theory
of the intervention (theory of change). Mixed methods covered qualitative and quantitative methods.
This integration seeks to provide a deep and contextualized understanding of relevance, efficiency,
Efficacy, sustainability and scalability of intervention, and impact.
5 The care program is another service of the family/community modality of initial care and education. Develop actions
Pedagogical at home adapted from the REACH UP program to extend early childhood care services to areas
difficult to access. The intervention plan that used a backpack with the RIS was based on the guide of care activities.
6 A pilot can be understood as a “concept of the concept”. During the design and implementation of a project, it is a stage
small -scale to evaluate feasibility, time, costs and unforeseen results.
5
The quantitative component includes data analysis from the monitoring and evaluation system
(M&E) of Backpack Take care, where 5% of the beneficiary families were evaluated through surveys
to determine the motor development of the child, development of the child's language, family interaction and
Home game opportunities. Information collection was completed with surveys in four
Tomas (during the baseline, 2 months after starting a backpack, 4 months later and 6 months
after). The M&D system includes children who received only backpack and children who received
more biweekly domiciliary visits (12 visits in total). The qualitative component (made for
This evaluation) includes interviews with national and regional directors of Mides, as well as groups
Focals with beneficiary families and the RIS.
The evaluation has a “pilot at scale” that allows identifying opportunities and elements
They are worth being scaled and how. Contemplates a utility approach since it provides elements and
evidences that can be used for 1) climb the pilot, 2) improve the design and execution of the M&E system
and 3) Design an evaluation of the escalated intervention by the actors responsible for the ecosystem
Institutional Attention to Early Childhood in Panama. The main user of the results of the
Evaluation are the Social Protection Services Directorate (Dispros) of Mides and Regional Links
responsible for ensuring that the right of children to have adequate child development is fulfilled.
Other key users are the actors of the RAIPI.
Main findings
Relevance: Backpack Take care is valued as relevant because it is an alternative to reach children
that do not have access to institutional services for initial care and education.
1. Backpack is pertinent for the beneficiary population, since care services and
Initial education did not exist in remote areas. In other words, taking care of you becomes
a way to guarantee the initial care and education service in difficult access contexts,
contributing to expand coverage.
2. All caregivers interviewed, including indigenous and Afro -descendant caregivers, agree that
Take care backpack is appropriate to their realities. The tools were useful during the
Confinement by Covid-19 pandemic, and helped children in their emotional development and
cognitive.
3. Backpack Take care does not cover other needs of the child for its integral development7, but the visit a)
It works as a mechanism of i) case management and ii) reference to other services that, otherwise,
It would not happen in these communities, and b) allows to create articulations with other attention suppliers to
childhood.
4. TAKING YOURSHOP INCLUDES Ethnicity, equity and gender approaches: a) To contextualize the
intervention, made cultural adjustments in indigenous areas, b) contributed to identify children with
disability, whose caregivers received tools to improve care adapted to
child needs, c) is relevant to large families because other household members
participate in the activities, and d) encourages the participation of the father figure in the interaction with the
son/a. Challenges persist to raise the involvement of the father figure for cultural factors and
Traditional gender roles.
Efficiency: Backpack caring yourself is valued as partially efficient.
5. It is evident a partially coordinated planning and implementation of backpack
Services for early childhood. For example, there is harmonization in planning and implementation
With the Take care program. Take care backpack coincides only partially with protection interventions
Social, because only half of the backpack families caring for you also receive a state subsidy.
6. There is no protocol that guides the reference and monitoring of inter -institutional cases,
although the multidisciplinary equipment and functions of the RIS propitiate the reference to instances
competent.
7 To achieve their maximum potential, young children need five indivisible components of affectionate and sensitive care:
Good health, optimal nutrition, protection and safety, opportunities for early learning, and receptive care.
6
7. Backpack Take care does not have an institutional budget and has not been paid including items
administrative/operations differentiated by region.
8. Periodic supervision and accompaniment from the central level were valid in this phase for the
Knowledge management and operationally adjust the service quickly, but they are not efficient
to get to the communities.
Efficacy: Take care backpack is valued as effective, because planned results have been achieved.
They have trained personnel to provide the service, the backpacks were distributed to families,
Visits to families were mostly fulfilled, most caregivers continue the guide and
material, and an increase in families commitment is observed. In addition, beneficiary caregivers
They express high satisfaction with the service.
9. It was found that a) the approach of using plant personnel available in the regions and equipment
Multidisciplinary influenced a high commitment of the RIS at this stage. However, b) training
It was not enough and does not have quality standards that guide a training plan, but there were
Continuous accompaniment and monitoring of RIS from dispos and guidance between the RIS.
10. Home visits are of quality and perceived as valuable by providing guidance on how to use
The content of the backpack. Some group caregivers who only received backpacking backpack request
Monitoring for the RIS. The RIS coincide with this, because they indicate that the visit is an opportunity to
Guide families in strengthening parental skills and initial education.
11. Backpack Take care was designed more as a project than a pilot on a scale, because its design is not
It explicitly bases a scalability plan. However, it has implicit elements of a pilot
because it allowed to test the necessary elements of the service, and has a vision of escalation
depending on whether positive effects are achieved in the beneficiary population. The monitoring system and
Evaluation (M&E) Piloted the impact measurement.
Impact
12. There are indications that taking care of you generates profits in the development of language, motor development and
Increase game opportunities at home.
13. There are no statistically significant differences between those children who only received
Backpack versus those who received more visits, in no indicator of child development
(motor development, language or home opportunities). These results should not be
Taken as definitive, because in the design of this evaluation, there is the limitation of the sample size,
inter alia.
Sustainability: favorable conditions are observed to convert backpack taking care of you in state program,
such as the high degree of political will and commitment of Mides. The normative context is also
Favorable, as taking care of you is based on Law 171 of 2020 and the Ripi update.
Lessons learned
Learnings derived from the findings of the evaluation:
Relevance
• The close monitoring and accompaniment through home visits is valuable for the profile
of the population to which services are directed as a backpack, because otherwise they would not receive
Initial education. Home visits also offer an opportunity to detect difficulties
in development, health and nutritional problems, and special protection needs.
• Adaptations for children with disabilities in interventions such as a backpack
better when there is commitment to caregivers, facilitator capacity and availability of
Specialized personnel to adapt activities to the special needs of the child.
Efficiency
• Case management through home visits increases the impact of social programs
as a backpack to take care of children because it contributes to integral attention to childhood.
Effectiveness
7
• Services such as Backpack Take care require the development of quality standards that guide
Initial and continuous training plans for suppliers.
• The escalation of interventions such as a backpack has more potential in regions where
There is a robust institutional structure, with sufficient personnel available and trained.
• Scale pilot: a gradual or intermediate escalation can be useful when trying the
adaptations and new recommended elements before performing a scaling nationwide.
Impact measurement
• At this stage it is challenging to get statistically founded lessons. However, the pilot
It allowed to rescue lessons about the design of an impact assessment.
• A rigorous impact assessment of this type of interventions must involve from the beginning to
Experts in their design and implementation.
Sustainability
• The sustainability of services such as a backpack care depends on the assignment of items
Institutional Budget.
• Design a joint scaling plan with the Take care program would allow you to define the steps
necessary to reach a single contextualized program to the Panamanian territorial reality.
Conclusions
Take care backpack is valued as relevant because it is an alternative to reach children who do not have
Access to institutional services for initial care and education. Especially in its version with visit,
Backpack caring yourself contributes to the initial education of these populations that did not access this service before.
Backpack is valued as partially efficient since there is an opportunity to formalize and execute
the articulation or case reference within the framework of the governance mechanism established in the RAIPI.
Backpack effectiveness is satisfactory because the results raised at this stage have been
achieved, sustained by high satisfaction of the beneficiary population.
In terms of impact, the greatest challenges are not in the potential or capacity of the intervention
to produce impact, but on the design and implementation of the M&E system that piloted the measurement of
impact (not yet rigorous).
In terms of sustainability, under the premises that take care of you be 1) visible and internalized
In the raipi, 2) harmonized with the scaling of the Take care program, and 3) that a game of
sector resources (extension of scale for scale), it is likely to achieve their continuity, escalation and
sustainability.
Priority recommendations
Among the priority recommendations that the evaluation throws are:
1) Perform a backpack costing differentiated by region (I.E., different costs are expected in areas
difficult to access), including administrative and operational items (efficiency);
2) Assign a state budget item for backpack escalation
costing exercise (efficiency, sustainability);
3) Develop protocols for the reference of cases (health, nutrition, education, special protection) to
through the governance mechanisms of the RAIPI, and train service providers in these
protocols
4) Include home visits for all children and families who receive a backpack. The follow -up
and close accompaniment through visits is valuable for the profile of the population to which they are directed
These services. Home visits also offer an opportunity to detect difficulties in the
Development, health and nutritional problems, and special protection needs. (effectiveness)
5) Have service providers closer to communities, for example, through a
Strategy where the visit is made by trained mothers and parents, under the supervision of the
RIS at the regional level (efficiency);
8
6) Develop quality standards to take care of you to guide the initial and continuous training of
suppliers, as well as visits supervision mechanisms (effectiveness);
7) Position Backpack Take care of the RAIPI update as a care and education service
initial (sustainability).
1. Context and evaluation object
1.1 Context
With the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CDN) approved by the United Nations in 1989 it is declared
a set of rights for all children based on four principles: non -discrimination;
the best interest of childhood; the right to life, survival and development; And respect for
Children's opinion. CDN states that states must guarantee survival and development
of the children considered as subjects of rights from the moment of their gestation through a
Comprehensive approach. 8
Early childhood refers to the integral development of children from pregnancy to eight years.
The first years of the child's life feel the foundations of all their future development. In particular, in the
pregnancy stage until 3 years, the brain is more sensitive to external influences.9 Progress in
Neuroscience show that the baby's brain forms new connections at extraordinary speed
Of more than 1 million per second, a rhythm that is never repeated. During this process, the experiences that
They live, including adequate nutrition, protection and stimulation through communication, game and
Receptive care of caregivers, influence neuronal connections, which impact development
Cognitive, emotional, physical and social of the child/a.10
Early childhood development can reduce social disparities and sustain the economy
Tomorrow. The Nobel Prize in Economy James Heckman11 pointed out that non -cognitive and cognitive skills
They play a key role in future school performance, productivity and probability of behavior
aggressive during adulthood. Investing in early childhood contributes to the development of the country, interrupts cycles
Intergenerational poverty and social inequality if children develop the necessary skills
to achieve its maximum potential. It is a profitable way to boost shared prosperity,
Promote inclusive economic growth, eradicate poverty and create a more equitable society.12
The development of children in early childhood is key in the implementation of the objectives for the
Sustainable Development (SDGs). According to goal 4.2 of the SDGs, “from here to 2030, it must be ensured that
All boys and all girls have access to attention and development services in early childhood and
quality preschool education, so that they are prepared for primary education. ”
This stage has an enhancement effect on nutrition (SDG 2), Health (SDG 3) and protection (ODS 16) .13
Protective influences that promote child development include affectionate interaction between the child and
The caregiver, opportunities for the child to play and learn, maternal skills and competences,
breast milk feeding, among others.14 To strengthen, interventions are key that emphasizes
careor-child relationship, development of parental skills, mental health, emotional competencies,
Social protection for families, health/nutrition and construction of friendly societies with the raising of the child.

When the child has adequate care and learning opportunities in a free environment of
violence, the results in their development improve.15
In Latin America, there are interventions that seek to strengthen knowledge and competences
parental and transform parental practices or behaviors to influence positive upbringing and
development of children and families. In some cases they are implemented through home visits
or group sessions with mothers and fathers.16 Visits are a community intervention strategy
of the provision of social services used to reach children at risk and their caregivers. The different
Visit models use various techniques and curricula that focus on improving a wide range of
results such as social, emotional and cognitive development in early childhood, the functioning of the
family, or the health of the mother and child. They are carried out through structured interactions that involve
A trained provider, caregiver and child/a.17 evaluations indicate that these interventions can
improve parental practices of care, the quality of the family environment and the relationships between caregivers and
children/8
The object of this evaluation, a back of taking care of yourself, is positioned as the offer of home service of
Initial care and education in family/community mode, to promote positive parenting guidelines,
aimed at the population between 0 and 36 months.
The provision of child care services in Panama is insufficient. According to the last
Statistics available in the country, only 2.7% of children under 3 years were enrolled in
Public care services. Development threats during early childhood are greater for
rights holders, that is, the child population living in the most vulnerable homes.19
Only 27% of the child population of the first revenue quintile received preschool education, while
67% of the child's population of the last Quintil received it. At the national level they received 38% of male children
and 35% of girls.20 It is less possible that the rights holders of the first quintil receive support for the
early learning at home21 and have toys and books.22 These children are more
exposed to inappropriate care23 and malnutrition, which affects children more than girls.24 The index of
early childhood development in indigenous regions is less than the national average: 71.6% in Ngäbe

21 The percentage of 36-59 months children with whom an adult from the home participated in activities that promote learning and
The preparation for the school was 73.5% (80.8% urban area and 62.1% rural area). In the Ngäbe Buglé indigenous region it is reduced to
29.5%, and in the Emberá Wouraan region at 32.3%. There are gaps among the poorest quintiles (55.4%) and richer (88.8%), and according to
The educational level of caregivers (educational level of the mother of primary education, 33.7%, versus higher education, 86.8%).
By specifying if the male father has participated in the activities, the figure is reduced significantly (44.7%), with great
Territorial disparities (urban 51.2%, rural 34.5%), economic (poorest 30.9%, richer 63.1%), and educational.
22 In indigenous regions, 1.3% (Ngäbe Bugle), 2.3% (Emberá Waunaan) and 5.7% (Kuna Yala) of children under 5 have
3 or more books at home (National 26.0%, girls: 24.3%, boys: 27.5%). Half of children under 5 have two or more types
of toys in households of Darién and region Emberá Waunaan and Ngäbe Buglé (National 68.8%).
23 In the regions, 13.8% (Ngäbe Buglé), 8.1% (Emberá Waunaan) and 8.9% (Kuna Yala) of children under 5 were left alone
or in the care of a child under 10 years for more than 1 hour (national 2.6%, girl 2.2%, male 3.0%).
24 data from the National Health Survey of Panama, EASPA (2019) show that malnutrition (low size prevalence) affects
to 15.8%of children under 5 years (urban: 11.5%, rural: 12.3, indigenous: 39%), the most affected indigenous areas being. In

The object of evaluation, take care of you, coincides with the regulatory framework and public policies for the
Early Childhood Development in Panama: i) Law 171 of the 2020 Integral Protection to Early Childhood and
early childhood development, which is the State Management Tool that establishes the guidelines
Intersectoral techniques and management in early childhood development for children from 0 to 8
years; ii) The Early Childhood Comprehensive Care Route (RAIPI), the inter -institutional care model and
Intersectoral that draws the sequence of planned, continuous and permanent attention for the guarantee
of the rights of children from 0 to 8 years; and iii) the "hive plan", the State policy aimed at fighting
Poverty in the 300 most vulnerable corregimientos, with the highest poverty rate in indigenous areas.
State policy in early childhood and with a perspective based on the rights of the child,
It is guided by family perspective guidelines, including the promotion of parenting guidelines, attention
integral, understood as a set of intersectoral and inter -institutional actions applied through
of the raipi, universal and focused benefits, prioritization and budgetary protection, transparency and
Territorialization of actions, through a network of public, private and civil society actors.
Mides is the governing body of social policy, including integral protection to early childhood and
Early child development. It has the mission of organizing, administering and coordinating the execution of policies,
Plans, programs and actions aimed at strengthening the family and community. To do this, he says
with the Social Protection Services Directorate (Dispros) whose role is to improve protection services
social at the national level through the formulation and surveillance of quality standards and according to a
Comprehensive rights approach.
From Mides, initial care and education services during early childhood are provided in two
Modalities: a) institutional and b) family/community. Both modalities must guarantee integrality

care and parenting.25 Currently, the modality of institutional initial care and education is offered through
of the Centers for Comprehensive Early Childhood Care (CAIPI). The family/community modality focuses
in high geographical dispersion contexts and/or where there are no caipi. Take care backpack is one of the
Services within this modality, as well as the care program.26

1.2 Object of the evaluation
Take care backpack is an initial care and education service in family/community mode. Has
as the main objective to promote the development of boys and girls between 6 to 36 months through the game, the
family care and the empowerment of parental skills. It is implemented in areas of difficult access and
No coverage of institutional modalities. It consists of the delivery of a backpack with materials
didactics and a structured guide of activities aimed at mothers, fathers and caregivers of children.
In addition, families receive biweekly domiciliary visits for 6 months (12 visits) for “responsible
of implementation and monitoring ”(RIS) who have been trained to promote and enhance the use of
The guide.
Caring for you includes a monitoring and evaluation system (M&E) to follow up on indicators
early child development and contribute to the impact and efficacy of the pilot. This system,
Described later, it included periodic measurements of the situation of children and beneficiary families.
RIS are trained to use the system (collection, coding and data analysis).

In his pilot phase between July to December 2021, Backpack took care of you reached 5,000 children from 6 to 36 months
Nationally in 23 districts (4,220 received only backpack and 780 received a backpack
Home). The territorial selection was established in accordance with the corregimientos prioritized by the
poverty reduction strategy of the country, the Colmena Plan.33 the selection of families within the
Territories were established based on the following prioritization criteria:
o Children who are part of the Opportunities Network Program.34
or children at nutritional risk.
or children in disability.
o Children with caregivers with disabilities.
o Children members of families with female or parental monkey headquarters.
or children belonging to ethnic communities that demand the service.
The cost executed in 2021 for the pilot phase was $ 173,432. This amount does not contemplate expenses
indirect, such as transport to the communities and salaries of the RIS. Includes evaluation costs.
There is no budget for later phases.
Backpack Take care of you pilot the elements mentioned above through 3 components of the intervention:
1) conformation and training of institutional equipment (RIS), composed of plant personnel from the
Measure in the regions, not exclusive to the service, and complement by non -state partners35 in territories of
difficult access; 2) Equipment: delivery of backpacks to prioritized families. The backpack contains a set of
Toys, books and a guide to caregivers to carry out activities and build toys in

This goes in line with the specifications of the RAIPI that establishes the knowledge and skills that must
develop caregivers to generate i) empathy with their child and recognition as a subject of
rights; ii) attachment and generation of a link; and iii) positive discipline and assertiveness capabilities in their
children and not inhibitors or aggressive.
The State is the main guarantor of rights with the responsibility of implementing the services of
Initial education throughout the country, in urban, rural and indigenous areas. The pilot phase was designed and
implemented through MIDE dispos-mides and personnel in the operational regions, and in some
areas through non -state allies (NGOs) as guarantors of rights that provide services in
Vulnerable communities of difficult access. The caregivers are guarantors of rights to be responsible for the
care and receptive attention of their children, and rights holders for their need to develop

same is in Annex D.
2.2 EVALUATION OBJECTIVES
The specific objectives are:
1. specify the level of relevance of backpack taking care of yourself in your pilot phase to address the situation of the
children between 6 and 24 months and their families in terms of initial care and education; OK
with the local and cultural reality of beneficiary families.
2. Determine the backpack efficiency take care of your pilot phase, when examining whether it is complemented in
Design, implementation and monitoring with other state interventions focused on first
childhood, and establish actions to improve complementarity.
3. Estimate the backpack efficiency Take care in S pilot phase (efficacy at the results level).
Specifically:
or establish the factors (socioeconomic, individual) that positively and negatively affect
The preliminary efficacy of the backpack version that includes biweekly visits.
or estimate the optimal frequency of visits. Determine the assessment and satisfaction of families
beneficiaries with both versions according to their local realities and cultural contexts
(process efficiency, service quality)
or delineate strategies to improve the component of home visits within the service
of initial care and education (process efficiency, service quality).
4. Estimate if there are significant differences between children who only receive the backpack and those who receive
The backpack plus a biweekly visiting family visit for a laugh (impact,
Effectiveness at the level of results).

5. Determine the normative and institutional conditions necessary to climb the intervention
(Sustainability, scale pilot approach).
6. Determine the degree of inclusion of human rights approaches, gender and equity.
7. Identify good practices, innovations and lessons learned in the pilot phase that allow
Improve future intervention and provide elements that allow climbing its implementation.
8. Determine how to take care of yourself was designed from its design to be climbed and assess whether in
Design and execution, has the appropriate components for escalation (scale pilot).
2.3 Evaluation scope
THEMATIC SCOPE: EVALUATION IS PART OF A “PILOT AT SCALE” process and constitute phase II of this
process38 (formative evaluation of piloting) for learning and escalation. Intends to determine if the
intervention in its pilot phase, both in design and execution, has (1) the appropriate components
For scaling and (2) positive effects on the development of a subgroup of children between 6 and 24
months (impact). The result variables ("outcomes") are motor development, language, opportunities for
game at home, and family interaction. The evaluation analyzes the elements that contribute to that effectiveness.
The evaluation covers the following determining criteria for scalability: relevance to determine
If the intervention responds to the needs of the most vulnerable population (families with relevance
ethnocultural, in poverty and women), if it is aligned with the national objectives and if it constitutes a
Early childhood inclusive strategy guaranteeing a gender and human rights approach; efficiency
to specify if resources are properly used; efficacy and process quality to determine the
scope of the results raised ("outputs"); impact to estimate positive effects on the development of
the children; and sustainability, to determine the conditions required in the regulations for the
Scalability The evaluation offers recommendations to Mides, its allies and institutions involved and
other responsible actors for comprehensive care that will allow them to refine the service and design the
scaling
Temporary scope: It is an evaluation of the pilot phase that covers the experiences obtained during the
Execution for six months (July to December 2021). Due to the evaluation period considered, the
results and derived recommendations will be important to define scalability and allow
refine the intervention. Quantitative data were collected between June (baseline) to December
of 2021 by the RIS through the M&E Backpack System, while the qualitative data
were collected by the evaluators in February and March 2022. The evaluation uses a mixed design, with
Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data to answer the evaluation questions.
Territorial scope: According to the pilot's population profile, the formative evaluation includes the
diverse territories (rural and indigenous) of higher nationwide poverty indices for collection
of information. The M&E system from which the quantitative design data of this
Evaluation captures a sample at the national level of 5% of beneficiaries who receive the backpack with
biweekly visits (39 children), and 5% of children with a backpack without visits (39 children). The sample
qualitative is intentional (convenience), taking into account accessibility factors and limitations of
resources. In the case of beneficiaries, it covers 2 regions and 1 indigenous region with characteristics
diverse, and in the case of personnel who perform home visits covers the 12 regions.

39 DAC-OCDE DEFINITIONS: http://www.oecd.org/dac/evaluation/daccriteriaForevaluatingdeVelopmentassistance.htm
40 This evaluation question was removed from the impact criteria given the methodological limitations of measurement.
41 The results planned at the product level (short -term effects) are contemplated. Medium and long term effects
Defined in the TDC will be contemplated in the impact criteria.
42 Respond to this ask based on the qualitative data, since the M&E system does not allow subgroup analysis according to
Sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors.
43 It was proposed to add this additional evaluation question to the TDR to increase the usefulness of the evaluation.

4. Methodology
This evaluation is non -experimental and used mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative methods) and
Evaluation elements based on the theory of intervention (theory of change). This integration allowed
Provide a deep and contextualized understanding of relevance, efficiency, efficiency, sustainability,
scalability of the pilot, and impact.
The evaluation incorporated innovative practices such as i) assessment of the impact of the service, ii) assessment
of a social pilot designed and implemented during the Pandemia by COVID-19, and iii) management and leadership of the
evaluation process by the country itself.
The evaluation included the transverse approaches of gender and equity, ethnicity and human rights that
They helped understand how intervention helps reduce inequalities. These approaches were
Integrated in the questions and instruments of the evaluation (TDC, evaluation framework, guides for
interviews and focal groups). The vision of users, facilitators and allies about inclusion was considered.
He investigated how to take care of you is sensitive to the needs of families in poverty, women,
large families, boys with disabilities or how their impact can be different for girls. It was included
an approach to the family regarding the roles of the father and mother in the raising of the children and how the
intervention contributes to transforming these gender roles and increasing the father's participation in the
breeding. The ethnic context was incorporated by analyzing to what extent the services are sensitive to reality
Cultural of indigenous and Afro -descendant families. The data were disaggregated and the results were valued
differentiated according to different groups and by sex as possible.44
Law guarantors (dispos, regional directors of MIDES, RIS) led the evaluation and
They participated in the Reference Group (Dispros). They also participated as informants and during the
Data collection. The rights holders (caregivers) participated as informants.
The reconstructed TDC in a participatory process with the dispos and UNICEF during the Inception phase of the
Evaluation was used in the design of the instruments of the collection of qualitative information, in the
Analysis of quantitative and qualitative data, and in the presentation of the results. The questions of
Evaluation are aligned with each evaluation criteria. Each evaluation criteria fits the levels
of the TDC as follows: the relevance at the strategic level (design, strategies, components); the
efficiency at the level of the products (short -term results) and inputs; transverse efficacy in
all levels and with focus on medium -term products and results; Sustainability of form
transverse and for the results in the median and long term, also considering the risks and assumptions; and
The impact at the long and medium term results level.
The “Pilot at the scale” approach allows identifying the opportunities and elements of the pilot that are worth the
It is worth being scaled and values how to do it. This implied for the methodological design of evaluation i) add
A question to evaluate whether the intervention has the necessary elements of a pilot to be scaled, II)
integrate and make visible this approach to the TDC of the intervention and rebuild the desired for the phase of
climbing, highlighting the usefulness of a pilot on scale, iii) Additional bibliographic review of services
similar with a scale pilot approach, and iv) integration of the scale approach in the instruments of
qualitative research to explore visions, plans and elements to climb with the actors
involved, from the design of the intervention. Graph 3 visualizes the pilot approach to scale.
44 The collection of qualitative data separated by regions and other regions, allowed better to understand their contexts.

The methodological design of the evaluation contemplated an utility approach since it will provide elements and
evidences that can be used for 1) climb the pilot, 2) improve the design and execution of the M&E system
and 3) Design an evaluation of the escalation intervention, by the responsible and linked actors of
Comprehensive early childhood care in Panama. As part of the analysis of the pilot to climb and the
evaluation, the quality of the information in design and execution was analyzed, and the potential uses of the

Bibliographic review
The first step was to obtain and review the available backpack documents, a frame review
normative and institutional of early childhood care in Panama, and a documentary review of
Similar or complementary experiences in the country, the region and worldwide. This allowed to provide
elements in the proposed methodology for the evaluation, and contributed to the lessons learned,
Recommendations and suggestions of evaluation for performance improvement (see the list of the
Literature consulted and reviewed in Annex H).
The following data were analyzed and triangulated to answer the evaluation questions:
Quantitative data from the pilot's M&E system
The quantitative methodological design and its instruments (see surveys in Annex E) came from the system
of m & e developed by dispos, with small samples, and, therefore, complementary to others
approaches It includes the application of various surveys in several shots (longitudinally, by the RIS).
21
Surveys applied to children and caregivers were: 1) a basic socio-family characterization file,
2) a survey of motor activities, based on the profile for the evaluation of the child's development/a
6 years of Minsa, 3) A language survey, based on the National Health and Nutrition Survey
Ensenut 2018 (Section VIII– Children's Language from 31 to 42 months ”) of the National Statistics Institute
(INEC) of the Comptroller General of the Republic in Panama, 4) The Home Survey which is a version
abbreviated from the instrument of household observation for the measurement of the environment, 5) a survey of
Game opportunities at home, and 6) a record of the child's performance and the family completed by
THE RIS.
The surveys are: on the baseline (time 0), two months after the backpack
Take care (time 1), 4 months later (time 2) and 6 months later (time 3). The M&D system includes
a random sample of 5% of the children's beneficiaries to take care of you who receive the backpack with
biweekly visits, and 5% of children with a backpack without visits.
The quantitative data of the M&E system were used to respond to the impact and efficacy criteria.
The evaluation allowed to assess the M&E system and each element that tested the intervention to inform
its scale, and deepen in aspects of management of this M&E system (responsibilities, capacity/
Resources for information collection, storage, analysis, decision making).
Qualitative data
A qualitative methodology with semi -structured interviews to key actors and focal groups to
beneficiary families and laughs to respond whether to take care of yourself is relevant, appropriate, efficient, effective, for
complement the impact analysis, and to determine the necessary factors for escalation and
Sustainability (see appointments in Annex N). According to the methodology proposed in the Inception phase,
They were made:
• Key actors interviews: 6 semi -structured in -depth interviews were conducted with actors
Pilot key, including 3 national displays officials and 3 regional directors of the
Measure (veraguas regions, the saints and region guna yala) .45
snow46 because in the interviews they were not referred to actors from other care institutions47 given
The pilot character of the intervention designed and executed only by Mides in this phase (see
Interview guidelines for key actors in Annex F, and lisido of interviewees in Annex G).
• Focal groups with beneficiaries: 6 face -to -face focal groups were held with caregivers of
children 6-24 months, differentiated in case they received a backpack or backpack plus 12 visits
Home The focal groups were held in Coclé, region Ngäbe-Bugle and Colón, which are
Operational regions with diverse characteristics. In this way, evidence was sought to obtain
differences depending on the local context. Of the total of 18 planned caregivers, the
participation of 14.48
• Focal groups with RIS: 7 focal groups were carried out with laughter from all regions of the country where
implemented backpack to take care of you, unlike 5 originally planned groups (4 virtual groups of
RIS Links, 1 Virtual Group of NGO RIS, and added 1 RIS face group in Coclé and 1 group
RIS in Columbus face -to -face taking advantage of its availability in the field).
Qualitative data were used to respond to the criteria of relevance, efficiency, efficiency,

Information, but also to guide backpack activities. This may imply a congestion of the group's data without

Achieve results (see guide of focus groups with caregivers and guide of focus groups with RIS in Annex F,
and the consent forms informed in Annex F1).
4.1 Data analysis
The evaluation questions were answered from the triangulation of the quantitative data and
qualitative When something could not be measured from quantitative data, it could be responded through
of qualitative data. This triangulation was complemented with the use of the change of change to
Dimension the results according to the causal logic of the intervention that explains how its different inputs
and components produce the desired effects.
QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS METHOD: The quantitative data from the system of the system of
M & e designed by displays for efficiency and impact criteria. Indicators related to
Early child development were extracted from said M&E system. The data were analyzed
disaggregated (sex, number of members in the family). Due to the limitations of the M&E system, no
a disaggregation by socioeconomic level, ethnicity, educational level of the mother or
caregiver, disability, and mothers head of the home, and no differentiated results could be observed by
Caregiver's sex, child's sex, or geographical location. For being the territorial scope of the intervention
Specifically rural in remote areas, rural/urban-urban-marginal disaggregation was not possible.
The characterization of the quantitative sample is found in Annex I.
The quantitative component of the evaluation has as its main objective to give lights on the M&E system
of a backpack, which will allow a rigorous design in the future (and assess the impact definitively).
Thus, although the data allow reporting a series of empirical findings regarding the performance of the
intervention in their pilot phase, which could help refine their scaling, the main contribution of the
Evaluation lies in the detection of strengths and weaknesses of the M&E system in:
- (i) Methodological design of the M&E system;
- (ii) implementation of the system on the ground;
- (iii) construction of data collection instruments;
- (iv) generation of appropriate databases for empirical analysis; among others.
The pilot's M&E system was designed under the methodological framework of randomized studies. That is, it was chosen
to the families that would receive the treatment (backpack with a visit) and to those who would only receive the backpack without visit
(control group) randomly. The M&E system also collected socio -economic information from
families and elements related to cognitive development of children before starting the
intervention (baseline), which- on an appropriate scale- will allow to obtain the causal effect of the pilot
In different indicators of child development. However, despite the modest scale of this pilot,
It was worth taking advantage of the random assignment to make a first approach to the causal effect to
through regressions; although graphics and bivariate tables were also used that allow an analysis
more intuitive and breakdown of the effects.
The statistical specification used in the models is as follows:
𝑌 = 𝛼+𝛽𝐴+𝛾𝐷+𝜌𝐴 ∗ 𝐷+𝜀
Where a is a dichotomous variable that indicates whether the family or child receives the visit; D is another dichotomic
indicating the before and after the intervention (baseline versus last shot), and 𝜌 collects the effect
Cause of the intervention.
To facilitate the interpretation of this parameter, it is convenient to remember that mathematically is
equivalent to the following:
𝜌 = [(𝑌 𝑇 𝑌 𝑇 𝑇) (𝑌 𝐶 𝑌 𝐶)]
1 0 1 0
Where:
23
- (𝑌 𝑇 −𝑌 𝑇) It is the difference in the average of the indicators between the last shot and the first
1 0
For the treatment group.
- (𝑌 𝐶 −𝑌 𝐶), better known as the counterfactual, reflects how it would have gone to the group of
1 0
treatment if I had not received the same. In other words, it is the difference in the average
the indicators between the last shot and the first for the control group.49

Qualitative analysis method: Refers to evidence in the form of opinions and information from
of in -depth interviews with technical personnel and authorities of Mides and Focal Groups with families
Beneficiaries and RIS. The granular analysis of qualitative instruments was carried out through the
Systematization based on the indicators set for each of the criteria of the evaluation matrix.
The reasons why certain situations have been given, paying special attention are identified, paying special attention
to the differences that may be between groups with visits and without visits.
Phases or levels of analysis: The evidence collected was analyzed in the following order:
1) International and regional literature review.
2) Documentation review of the intervention Backpack Take care: review of all
Materials and surveys and meetings with dispos. That allowed an understanding of
background and frame the questions related to the evaluation criteria.
3) Assessment of the M&E system of the intervention that provides the quantitative data identifying
its strengths and improvement fields.
4) Quantitative data analysis from the M&E system based on the questions of
Evaluation related to the impact criteria and (partially) efficacy.
5) Qualitative information analysis collected through interviews and focal groups, based
In evaluation questions related to the criteria of relevance, efficiency,
efficacy/processes, and sustainability.
6) Identification of findings. In order to reduce bias and support evaluation findings,
Information triangulation was performed, using quantitative data and data
qualitative that help answer each question proposed within the framework of the evaluation of the
different criteria thoroughly. The results were also analyzed in a

5. Evaluation limitations
In the inception phase, the evaluation team carried out an intervention evaluation analysis (see the
Summary of this analysis in Annex D). Among the main limitations can be indicated:
• Limitations in the Backpack M&E system, such as the non -inclusion of a group of
pure control and the modest sample size that did not allow estimating the impact purely
quantitative. To mitigate this limitation, the quantitative information of the M&E system was triangulated
With the qualitative data collected by the evaluators thus managing to estimate the impact of backpack
Take care of you In addition, an M&E system assessment was made and recommendations are offered
Improvement of the M&E system to be implemented during the escalation phase.
• The sample of caregivers and RIS interviewed for the qualitative component of the evaluation was not
representative and did not include all regions of the country. The selection was intentional (sampling
propositional). However, the qualitative information collected served to assess efficiency and relevance
from the perspective of the beneficiary population and the RIS in the field. Any qualitative assessment that
Use propositive sampling is prone to the bias of subjective or generalized assumptions. This
bias has been mitigated through the solidity of the design of the evaluation that includes: 1) triangulation and
systematization of evaluation judgments, 2) diversity of regions chosen for the lifting of
information (representing the north, central and south of Panama, as well as rural and indigenous areas), and
3) The establishment of relevant hypothesis to validate.
• An additional limitation was the rejection of some caregivers to participate in focal groups. It was
to mitigate this limitation by communicating to participants sufficiently anticipated the
Programming of focal groups. As for ethno-cultural sensitivity, there was the support of
people recognized by the community who handled the local language. In addition, there was support
of a local consultant with experience in moderating focal groups in rural and indigenous areas.
• Cost-effectiveness: quantitative analysis does not allow conclusions about cost effectiveness because,
Given the limitations described, no statistically significant effect was identified. To the
Not having that effect, you can't talk about cost-effectivity.50 To mitigate, an analysis of
Efficiency comparing costs per unit attended under different treatments or programs.
• Use of evaluation -Infocate and learning in the design of the pilot: one of the objectives of
The evaluation was to learn about the elements to be scaled. However, this was not specified in
The objectives of the intervention and evaluation, neither were those references in the documentation
of the pilot, as an escalation plan. Mitigation to increase the usefulness of evaluation
were i) integrate the pilot perspective at the scale in the inception phase, 51 ii) visible this approach to
TDC and rebuild the desired for escalation to ensure an approach to learning, III)
Bibliographic review of similar services with a scale pilot approach, iv) rescue of the elements
that are tested and those that do not, e v) integration of the focus on research instruments
qualitative in order to explore the visions, plans and elements to climb with the actors involved.
• Role of partners and government: the design of the pilot and the TDR of the evaluation do not provide information
on the role of possible partners in the intervention and in the use of evaluation findings for the
scaling Other early childhood care actors in Panama were not involved in the
Design and execution of the pilot and evaluation. As mitigation, recommendations were developed
relevant to the possible partners who validated with the managers and executors of the intervention.
• Logic of the intervention: the pilot design did not have a logical framework, indicators at the level of
results, products and activities (only at the impact level) that would allow a referential line
of the desired. It did not have an analysis of assumptions and risks. As mitigation, during the phase of
Inception of the evaluation The TDC was reconstructed in a participatory manner with the displays, based on the
Identification of problems, and exploring related assumptions and risks.
50 The objective was no longer to find a given effect of study pilot to see evaluability.
51 An additional evaluation question was added to those stipulated in the TDR, which allowed to determine or assess whether the intervention,
In design and execution, it had the appropriate components for escalation.
25
6. Ethical considerations
The United Nations guidelines were followed for evaluations and ethical research policy with
children, of UNICEF52 for the purpose of maintaining the highest standards of confidentiality of the
information collected and participants. The confidentiality of all participants is guaranteed, the
Anonymity of the data, the safety of the data and the right not to participate in the interviewee. The
Credibility of the data is ensured through the triangulation of the information. It is also protected
The impartiality of evaluation and respect for all the opinions of all the people interviewed.
There were no conflicts of interest since the evaluation team is independent of Mides. UNICEF
provided technical assistance in the study design and in the purification of the system databases
of m & e. Mides assumed the logistics organization during qualitative data collection. Yes ok
UNICEF staff and Mides accompanied the evaluation team to data collection places
primary, did not participate in the focus groups of beneficiaries and land officials, with the exception of
A pair for the purpose of verifying if the questions of the questionnaire managed to extract the desired information.
Quality control was the responsibility of the monitoring and evaluation officer of the UNICEF office
Panama, with support from the reference group for the formed evaluation to ensure the quality of the
Evaluation products. UNICEF Panama Monitoring and Evaluation Officer, with consultant's support
Social policy, supervised the field work, the analysis of the findings and reports delivered by the
Evaluating team. The reference group for evaluation was composed of technical personnel of the
MIDES, UNICEF Panama and the Regional Office for Latin America and the Unicef.
This reference group guarantees the legitimacy of the process and supported all logistics activities
required for field work.
As interviews were not conducted with minors, there was no need for a control committee
Ethics According to the UNICEF Ethics Policy. 53 before each interview the participants were given
an information sheet and an informed consent. (See Annex F1)
The interviews were confidential at the time of collection, analysis and presentation of the results.
The recordings for information collection were deleted after the interviews were
analyzed. Before accessing the quantitative databases provided by MIDES, the team
Evaluator signed a confidentiality agreement in the use of information.
The main user of the results of the evaluation is the displays of Mides and the regional links
responsible for ensuring that the right of children to have adequate child development is fulfilled.
Other key users are the actors of the RAIPI to position a backpack as part of the services
of initial education.
In relation to copyright, TDRs establish that all products in this evaluation will be

1. To what extent does the intervention in your pilot phase in your modalities with and without visit, respond
to the needs of the target population?
Backpack taking care of yourself is relevant because it is an alternative to reach children who do not access services
institutional care and initial education. Take care backpack allows caregivers to enrich their
ways of interacting with their children, using the game as a key tool that contributes to
Development of safe links. Caring backpack becomes a way to guarantee the service of
Initial care and education in difficult access contexts, contributing to expand coverage.
Through the visits component that seeks to create synergies with other sectors responsible for the guarantee
of rights (see graph 4), take care of you bet on attention with a comprehensive approach adopted by
the State through Law 171 and the RAIPI. The objectives are valid in the local context because they are based on
An early childhood development proposal that considers the challenges of local realities. In this
sense, it was also evaluated which other services can accompany backpack to ensure to ensure
Integral development of children. Beneficiary caregivers and RIS suggest include a) orientations
on food to prevent malnutrition/malnutrition, b) Guidelines for disease prevention,
54 Semaforization: Green color: the strategy or activity is relevant. Yellow color: the strategy or activity in your
Implementation has been partially relevant. Red color: The strategy is not relevant.
27
c) support for housing improvement, including sanitation and hygiene, d) Specific support for children with
difficulties in development and e) group community spaces, led by “mothers and master parents
local ”that promote learning and interaction of children and caregivers. (i) 55
Families were selected to participate in the pilot, especially in the version with visits, contrary
to a "mandatory" assignment. During the execution of the pilot with the visits component, in some cases
There was a need to replace families for lack of interest in continuing. (II)
The managers and executors of the intervention in the regions describe the high relevance of a backpack
For families as follows:
“The peasant people we managed to arrive showed acceptance to a project that did not have a bag of
food, a money bonus, but was a didactic tool to implement integral development
of the child and participation was massive. " (Regional Director), and “This is basic for the country to advance. TO
We had to see situations that explain why so many difficulties in adolescence. For example,
A totally apathetic, selfless mother, an absent and selfless dad, like grandparents and
rest of the family. It is like the baby is left only to evolve by itself. So for me it was
Fantastic see how they developed, some more than others, beneficiary babies along the pilot [...]. (RIS)
All caregivers interviewed agree that the pilot is appropriate to their realities. Specifically,
They mention that the tools provided by backpacking were useful during the
Confinement by Covid-19 pandemic, and helped children in their emotional and cognitive development.
(iii) is adequate because it reaches home and resources are used at home. However, some
Group caregivers that only received backpack without visits request monitoring for the RIS. (IV) The RIS
They coincide with this recommendation, because they indicate that the visit is an opportunity to guide families in
Strengthening parental skills and initial education. (V)
Finding 1: Initial care and education services offered by backpack to take care of yourself, in both
modalities (with and without visit) and even more in the visit mode, are widely relevant in relation
to the needs of the beneficiary population, since these services did not exist in remote areas and with
Take care backpack are given.56
FINDING 2: All the caregivers interviewed, including indigenous and Afro -descendant caregivers,
They agree that taking care of you is appropriate to their realities, although it has no specific elements
of indigenous cultures. They mention that the tools provided were useful during the
Confinement by Covid-19 pandemic, and helped children in their emotional and cognitive development.
FINDING 3: Backpack Take care was focused on promoting receptive care and significant interactions
between caregivers and children to influence child development. It does not cover other needs of the child for
achieve optimal and integral development57, but the component of the visit a) works as a mechanism of
i) Case management and ii) reference to other services that, otherwise, would not pass in these communities and
b) It allows to create joints with other service services according to the local context.
2. To what extent are activities consistent with the backpack objectives take care of yourself?
The logical relationship of activities with the objectives and among the activities themselves is examined. For one
Systemic approach to the answer The TDC is used (see graph 4). The following are also considered
Judgment criteria: the extent to which the activities and products provided by the backpack to take care of yourself were the
more appropriate and sufficient to achieve the objectives and results. For each specific objective
carried out an evaluation of the activities carried out and the products produced, to determine what
measure were enough to achieve the goal.
55 The Romanes numbers refer to original primary data appointments, which support the findings presented.
56 The relevance for indigenous families, large families, children with disabilities deepens later.
57 To achieve their maximum potential, children need the 5 components of affectionate and sensitive care: good health,
Optimal nutrition, protection and security, opportunities for early learning, and receptive care.
28
In the first level of the Backpack TDC, a wide range of activities was foreseen: having the
human resources necessary to provide services to families (from the elaboration of the profile of
personal until your training); equip families with the backpack and their materials (from the selection of
families until the adaptation and design of materials and delivery and induction to the backpack); toast
orientation and monitoring of families (home visits); and have an M&E system that allows
Evaluate the service and generate the necessary knowledge for the escalation of the intervention.
These activities are consistent with the problems and needs of the recipient group, since the
Vulnerabilities identified during execution are largely in line with the diagnosis
Initial of the recipient group. In general, for this stage, there were no activities/ products with a
limited contribution to the specific objective, or additional products necessary for the same purpose. No
Services not provided in the backpack framework were identified (which would not be part of their
package), in whose absence the expected results could not materialize. Among the more services
valued by the recipient group is the orientation and modeling of the use of materials with
The children and the material for the game that contains the backpack.
For some of the most frequent vulnerabilities of the recipient group (such as
malnutrition of children, lack of hygiene in homes, birth registration, vaccination, etc.),
This initial education service provided guidance to families and referencing cases to the instances
relevant. However, other complementary services outside the backpack took care of you would have been
necessary to fully improve the situation of children through responsible institutions.
Take care backpack could more strengthen your approach to detection and reference of cases and advice on
the respective services, which would respond to a key necessity of the recipient group that is not
familiar with their rights and where/how to access them.
The component of visits is considered key for their high relevance for the achievement of the objectives (despite
that this relevance was not yet tested robust/statistic by the quantitative component
of the M&E system) and to better make the contents of the backpack better. Some laughs indicate that visits
They were necessary to guide and explain to caregivers how to use the activity guide.
The pilot character allowed to test the necessary elements of the intervention (see Table 2 in Chapter 2),
including testing the impact measurement, and identifying those elements that worked to be
scales and those that must be strengthened and how, to inform the design of the escalation plan.
3. To what extent do you take care of yourself includes human rights approaches, gender and
equity? To what extent can it be more sensitive to the different groups in a situation of
vulnerability?
Backpack Take care, through children's selection criteria, explicitly addresses groups
vulnerability situation, especially those of low socioeconomic stratum, mothers head of the
Home, large families, indigenous families, and families with people with disabilities. Besides,
Backpack Take care was implemented in prioritized corregimientos in the Colmena Plan. However, I know
evidence that children were not always in greater condition of vulnerability within these
territories that received the service especially in the version with visits (see Table 4 and Graph 4).
For example, 1 in 3 beneficiary families had a formal income (37%) and half of the
caregivers had complete secondary (47%). There are very few illiterates (2.56%). 88% of families
It had own home, with water (64%) and electricity (65%). Only in 1% of the families there were some
child with some disease or disability. A slight unbalance of the sex of children is observed that
They receive the intervention in favor of male children (54%). It is possible that the prioritization criteria used
To select children they were not implemented in practice in all cases.

Adaptation to indigenous and Afro -descendant cultures: indigenous and Afro -descendant caregivers
interviewees indicate that the backpack materials were appropriate to their reality and request
Backpack scaling caring in their communities, what it demonstrates is relevant to them. Although
that Mides made adjustments to the backpack to take care to be sensitive to indigenous cultures and
Afro -descendants (for example, the laughter had to handle indigenous language in the case of the regions, in the
regions were selected with the same ethnicity, the figures/illustrations included various ethnicities), there were no
formal participation of indigenous and Afro -descendant communities in the design of the backpack, and the
Design was no different for those cultures. The design and implementation of the backpack took care of yourself occurred in the middle
of the Pandemia for COVID-19, this being one of the reasons why they could not be performed
More direct approaches with these communities. Some materials such as puzzle could
Require an adaptation to local reality with elements that children manage to recognize their environment.
(VI)
Numerous families: In the intervention areas, 1 of 3 homes are composed of 6 or more people.
Take care backpack provides indirect benefits to the child's brothers and other adults of the home,
It offers opportunity for everyone to get involved in activities.
58 The M & e system does not allow to capture the variables of mother head of the home and ethnicity.
30
Families with children with special needs: the RIS express the usefulness of a backpack to take care of yourself to
detect cases of children with difficulties in their development, although an instrument was not applied to
detection. Take care backpack worked better for children with development difficulties when there was
High commitment of caregivers to participate in the activities and when they had staff
specialized in regional teams to adapt activities to the special needs of
Children. Take care backpack can be more sensitive to special needs by strengthening capacities
of the RIS to refer to these cases and to strengthen the awareness of caregivers about the importance of
interaction with the child for its development, especially in areas where the issue of disabilities is a
taboo. (VII)
Gender equity: in rural communities and indigenous cultures the belief that parenting predominates
It is the responsibility of the woman. Take care backpack integrates the gender approach because it contributes to increase
The participation of the man caregiver in initial education through the game. Challenges persist to raise
The involvement of men caregivers for cultural factors and traditional gender roles. Without
However, some positive backpack influences are observed to take care of co -responsibility in
The parenting. (VIII)
As for the relevance of the backpack material for children, the need to sensitize persists
To caregivers to eliminate gender stereotypes. For example, cases are reported where the father
Consider the material of the backpack inappropriate, such as the puzzle with figures of men or women. TO
Sometimes the girl received a backpack with blue toys and doll puzzles, and the boy
He received pink toys and wrist puzzles. In one case the mother indicates that the father
prohibited his boy from the use of these girl toys (pink ball, wrist puzzles) for being
inadequate. (IX)
Finding 4: Take care backpack includes equity and gender approaches because:
a) The indigenous and Afro -descendant caregivers perceive a backpack as appropriate, despite the fact that

4. To what extent does it take care of the backpack is complemented (planning, implementation, monitoring
and evaluation) with other early childhood care services in the country?
The modality with visits is an adaptation of the Reach Up and Learn, a program with proven efficiency
in other countries in the region.
In planning: Take care backpack
It must coordinate with the axes of attention 4 (control and monitoring of child development, from the sector
health) 60, 7 (accompaniment to the family) and 8 (registration and identification of the child). Take care backpack
He leverage in MIDES Social Protection Services, when he reached beneficiaries of other protection services
social, and when using institutional multidisciplinary teams anchored to these programs and services, which
facilitated intra-inter-institutional coordination (for example, with the health sector and identity registration).
However, Backpack Tachy did not coordinate in the planning with the family accompaniment program
of Mides and other actors of the RAIPI, especially the suppliers of the 4, 7 and 8 care axes of the
Raipi.
Planning and implementation coordinated with the Tarking Program is evidenced. Both services are
They complement in their territorial reach, by offering in different communities.
In the implementation: the intervention partially coincides with the reception of State subsidies. The

Coincidence with families that receive these other social services. The universal scholarship helps families
in the child's food and supplies, and this allows them to better serve the child through the game.
The RIS report a better use and disposition of families to participate if at the same time they received a

The RIS were captors and channels of situations in families that required assistance. In some
cases, regional directors coordinated references to other institutions for these cases, for example,
Electoral Court (for birth registration, especially in indigenous areas), Minsa (nutrition or
Children's Health) and Senniaf (Special Protection) through the Center for Orientation and Comprehensive Care (COAI)
Regional MIDES, or through direct approaches to the institutions responsible for attention and
monitoring, both from dispos and from the regions. (XI) However, this did not happen in all

61 COAI, through social workers, provides guidance in situations of social vulnerability, receives the case reference and
It channels the required support to the responsible entity.
33
The cases, since there is still no elaborate protocol and a designed training that guides the RIS on
When and how to perform the reference inter -institutionally through the COAI and/or
governance mechanisms established in the RAIPI (see graph 5).
Emerging and punctual intra -institutional joints of MIDES are reported at the regional level, with the
Social protection programs and the literacy program. The articulation and reference of cases
detected through the backpack care depended on factors such as 1) the existence of care services
In the region, 2) the ability of the RIS to detect the specific needs of the child, the initiative to carry out
The reference note, and guide/advise caregivers about interaction with the respective services
And the competent instances (familiarizing families with their rights and where/ how to access them),
3) the multidisciplinarity of the RIS teams and their functions in other MIDES programs, 4)
Authorization, request and reference management of the regional director, 5) the opening of the instances
competent, and 6) the initiative of families to approach the indicated services. The intervention could
Strengthen the participation of other actors such as local governments. (XII)
In some regions (Los Santos and Chiriquí) there was no articulation, but the RIS only guided the
family about required procedures and competent instances to which the
caregivers, such as social protection programs, health services or stimulation available. The
Darien region deserves special attention because it does not have professionals from other services from
Attention to childhood to which cases could be referred to, and presents weaknesses in the management structure
Regional Mides, which puts challenges to the referencing of cases. (XIII)
The functions of the RIS in other programs and services (as a teacher or coordinator of Caipi, performances
In Coai, Conapredes, Senapan, literacy programs, Ángel Guardian, etc.) led to the
cases of cases, although they were often not trained enough to detect them
(for example, low weight or development difficulties).
However, in terms of complementarities during implementation, caregivers interviewed
They report that taking care of you did not help them receive or access other programs available in the territory.
This information does not coincide with what is expressed by the RIS and directors, and may indicate the need for
monitoring of cases of cases of cases to ensure attention by the responsible entity.
In monitoring and evaluation: the backpack m & e system

With the population that serves the backpack so that Mides Social Protection programs are
complement. On the other hand, the five -year plan for the updated raipi is being built which
It also contemplates the design of a Ripi nominal monitoring system. The data of the following
Backpack phases Take care must be one of the inputs for this system.
FINDING 5: Take care backpack coincides only partially with social protection interventions, especially
The universal scholarship, because only half of the backpack families are also
that supports nutrition or child health, among others.
FINDING 6: There is no protocol that guides the reference and inter -institutional monitoring of cases,
although the multidisciplinary equipment and functions of the RIS propitiate the reference of cases towards the
competent instances. A regional management structure of Robusta Mides favors referentiation.
FINDING 7: There is no articulated planning with the family accompaniment program of the
Mides that has operational manuals for its implementation.
62 FUPS is the tool that integrates the exact information of the beneficiaries of Mides' social programs to evaluate
the inclusion, permanence or exit of the beneficiaries.

5. Are there opportunities to increase the backpacking reach, specifically to
through a reference system to create synergies? If so, what factors are
necessary?
There are opportunities to increase the back of the backpack take care of your escalation. As indicated
Before, for example, the articulation with the health sector and birth registration is essential, through
of the governance mechanisms at the local level that establishes the raipi and/or through the COAI that channels
the required support to the responsible instances.
To optimize synergies with other programs, it is necessary that the beneficiary of the backpack
It is included in existing information systems for monitoring and management of social services, such as
the FUPS and/or the Nominal monitoring system of the RAIPI. In this way, it will be possible to identify if others
programs, specifically for early childhood, have not reached the beneficiaries of a backpack, and
thus ensure integrality of attention
6. Do the activities implemented (delivery of the backpack to families and visits) are cost-effective
o There are alternative strategies or more efficient mechanisms to carry out backpack
Take care of you?
Intervention costs: Backpack Take care does not yet have an institutional budget, it does not have a
Costing all its distinct areas by region, and did not leverage in the financial resources of the
Take care program. The total backpack investment takes care of you in its pilot phase for 5,000 children, 780 of them
With home visit, it was $ 173,432. This includes the costs of the backpack with its materials, the
RIS training in all operational regions, including training in system application
of M&E, the delivery of the backpack, the monitoring of the families, the supervision during the implementation and
The costs of this formative evaluation.
Administrative and operational costs are not included (and have not been calculated) and refer to salary
of the RIS (which are MIDES plant personnel also dedicated to other functions), the rental of offices,
Transportation expenses to remote areas where families, equipment equipment, services reside
public and communications. The adaptation costs of the structured guide of activities and costs of
Replacement of backpack materials have not been calculated either.
The backpack costs with its content formed the highest cost category ($ 121,549.80), followed
for the cost of visits63 ($ 15,971.80) that includes the training of the RIS ($ 4,504) and the supervision and
monitoring by dispos. Not including administrative and operational costs not yet calculated,
The cost per child of the backpack taking care
$ 4.05 per child per month, calculated based on a duration of 6 months of service. The cost per child of
Backpack Take care (Backpack plus 12 visits) is $ 44.79, which is equivalent to a cost of $ 7.47 per child per month
calculated based on 6 months of service. The cost of the total of the 12 visits per child is $ 20.48 ($ 1.70
by visit).
A total of 295,820 boys and girls are estimated between 0-3 years in Panama.64 assuming that 32% of them are
found in multidimensional poverty65, the approximate target of backpack to take care of you would be 94,662 children
and girls. At a cost of $ 44.79 per child to receive backpack plus 12 visits, the total investment of measure would be
of approximately $ 4.2 million annually without including administrative and operational expenses. Taking like
Base the investment budget of Mides by 2021 of $ 261 million, the backpack scaling
would imply an increase of 1.6%.66
63 Includes the costs of the RIS training process ($ 3,082.80) and dispos personnel ($ 1,422.00), and the cost of
Supervision and monitoring of dispos ($ .11,467.00). The RIS cost of the institutional plant is not included in this item.
Nor is the cost of RIS training to apply the M&E system provided by UNICEF.

35
Compare these costs with the alternative strategy, the care program is not simple, because the cost of
Taking care includes other items that could not be quantified to take care of you. As a consequence, the
Cost of the Take care program per child per month (includes weekly visits) of $ 103.51 seems to be higher,
Because it includes all items. Given the differences of items included in the calculations, a comparison
of costs per unit between both programs is not recommended.
On the other hand, take care backpack managed to take advantage of the capacities available in the regions (stimulating
early, teachers, supervisors, psychologists, etc.). However, supervision was carried out from the level
central, which implied periodic transfers from the displays to the operational regions, from a
Defined schedule. Establishing a regional supervision mechanism can contribute to optimize
The cost-effectiveness of the intervention.
Finding 8: Backpack Take care does not yet have an institutional budget and does not contemplate indirect costs and
differentiated by region. Despite being an adaptation of the care program, he did not leverage in his
financial resources. 67
FINDING 9: The use of MIDES PLATING Personnel, periodic supervision and
accompaniment made from the central level according to defined schedule, have shown to be
valid in the pilot phase to promote knowledge management and operationally adjust the intervention
quickly, but they are not optimal for the following phases for the challenges in logistics terms for
transfers to remote communities and staff availability.
7. What is the optimal frequency of visits to achieve impact?
The information of the Mochila M&E system indicates that the vast majority of children
beneficiaries with a visit mode received the total of the 12 planned visits, although not always of
face -to -face, while only 3 children received 8 visits in total. Visits that were not given to
These children were in the first quarter of the intervention because it was not possible to contact them.
Although the interviewees suggested increase the frequency of visits to 3-4 per month (instead of 2), with
A service duration of 1 school year (instead of 6 months), this adaptation during escalation
The cost of the service would increase and there is no evidence that it would improve the effectiveness of the intervention. Increase
The number of visits and the duration of the service could be efficient in those cases where the child and/or the
caregiver present greater degree of vulnerability, for example, for caregivers/children with
Disability, with low commitment or with high family conflict.
Other limitations for more frequent visits include transport challenges, time available and
RIS training, scarcity of activities in the guide for caregivers, and occupation of caregivers. (XIV)
The increase in frequency and execution period implies having personnel closer to homes
qualified to provide quality visits, as well as have a guide with sufficient activities and
adequate. (XV)
Find 10: The frequency of biweekly visits is not yet optimal because it is not adapted to
needs and special cases of children and caregivers. For example, there are caregivers who need more
orientation and close accompaniment to carry out the activities, and/or still need to develop a greater
degree of commitment to child care.
67 Financial sustainability and how to achieve it is covered in the sustainability evaluation criteria.

8. At this stage of the pilot, have the planned results been achieved?
The scope of four results is analyzed: 1) There are trained personnel to offer a backpack.
Initial education service in family modality (P1), 2) families have tools (a guide and
materials) to facilitate stimulating environments (P4), 3) families have accompaniment and
Orientation (P5), and 4) caregivers acquire awareness about the importance of care and education
initial, and are committed to the development of their children (P5, P6). See Graph 6.
P1: MIDES AND ALLIAS HOME CAUTION STAFF Trained in Early Childhood Attention

The requirements were adapted when using voluntary promoters, in the absence of MIDES available.
As can be seen in Table 6, of the 78 RIS trained in the pilot, most are women (91%, 71), and with
Secondary education finished (89.8%). Almost 1 in 5 RIS has early stimulation formation
(17.9%), but only 3.8% of them served as a stimulator in the region before, and only 3.8%
They play as caipi teacher. Almost half of RIS has a social promoter position (46.1%).

Training: Graph 6 presents this result as partially reached. The two -day training
I did not have the goal of forming stimulators70, but it was still very short and not enough to deepen
in the development of soft skills (communication, empathy) to increase the commitment of
caregivers, detect cases and how/when to refer to specialized care through COAI

of children, and how to minimize gender stereotypes. (XVIII) in a timely manner, training in some
Regional areas included guidance to detect disability and how to act. More material is required
didactic on how to make toys to use on the visit.71 Some RIS, including NGOs,
They indicate being prepared enough to make visits and monitoring. (XIX)
No continuous or practical training mechanisms are observed, but a mechanism of
Monthly supervision and continuous accompaniment from the central level by dispos. Within
The regions, the most experienced laughs supported and oriented those in need of reinforcement. (XX)
The need for a formal continuous training plan and regional supervision is evident.
The initial and continuous backpack training plan is not yet based on such quality standards
as technical guidelines that guide 1) the implementation of family accompaniment72, and 2)
Initial education programs and services in community, family and institutional contexts.
Finding 11: Regarding the profile, selection and training of RIS, it was found that:
-The approach to use plant personnel available in the regions, multidisciplinary equipment whose
Functions are complemented in a high commitment of the RIS at this stage.
-The training was not enough, but there was a periodic accompaniment and supervision of RIS from the
Dispos of the central level and orientation between the RIS at the regional level.
- Although in Mides there are technical guidelines and minimum family accompaniment criteria, backpack
Taking care does not have quality standards that guide a training plan.
R2. Improves the capacity and performance of home care personnel in care and reference
Results are suggested through RIS's perceptions about the importance of initial education, and in its
home care performance with a comprehensive care approach, because they point out that it is vital
teach caregivers to create stimulating environments through affective communication, game
and receptive care to the needs of the child, health, adequate child nutrition, hygiene, and
birth registration, in cases detected.
The RIS mention backpack benefits such as obtaining more knowledge, experience and
trust about family accompaniment and to detect the needs of caregivers or children.
New knowledge also applies in their homes and other areas of their work, as in the Caipi.
(XXI)
P3: Increase in home game opportunities: more books and toys available
Through the backpack M&E system, the differences in the variable are explored: opportunities
game at home/ availability of toys and books at home, which corresponds to the score of the
Subescala_objetos (Home, T0 and T3) and the Subscala_ Opportunities score (Opportunities Survey
of play at home, T0,1,2,3). The analysis is presented in the impact criteria.
P4: families have content and instruments adapted to their local and cultural context that facilitate
The creation of stimulating environments for development and learning
Graph 6 presents this result as reached at this stage.
Quality and use of the guide for caregivers: the guide is positively valued by caregivers with or without visit,
RIS and regional directors because caregivers guides how to educate children. The main ones
Guide strengths are its structure according to the age of the child, its variety of examples and the use of
Figures and colors that make it easy to understand. It is possible to include more activities in the guide according to the ranges
age because some children advance quickly with activities. (XXII)

Most caregivers, both ways, including indigenous mothers and mothers head of household,
Indicates using the guide frequently and perform some of the activities it contains. Those who receive
Visits tend to use the guide more (versus those who only receive the backpack). Guide activities
that less are made in both groups are to make toys with recyclable materials. (XXIII)
Content and quality of the backpack and toys: the laughter and caregivers positively value the materials
included in the backpack, although they suggest improving the quality of the backpack itself and materials. Some
caregivers report that the backpacks broke, the pencils and crayons were broken because they were
Too thin, and the drawing notebook was quick. They also suggest adding more materials
didactics, for example, material to fit/insert and plasticine. (XXIV)
Find 12: The content of the backpack (materials) was very well received by families and is valued
positively the guide for caregivers because it guides them on how to teach children at home. The
Most caregivers follow the guide and backpack material.
9. Is the quality of the biweekly domiciliary visit service optimal?
This evaluation question is related to the P5 result: families have accompaniment and
Orientation, suitable for local and cultural context, on parenting practices and care skills.
Graph 6 presents this result as reached at this stage. The evaluation of service quality
It focuses on the number of visits made, the contents of the visit and the proportion of children per RIS.
Number of visits made: in most regions it can be seen that the 12 visits (biweekly during
6 months) were fully fulfilled for all families. However, in some regions it was not achieved
comply with all visits due to lack of transport, climate, COVID-19 cases or change of residence of the
families. In some cases, face -to -face visits were replaced by telephone follow -up or video.
There were families who did not want to continue, and the motivation by the RIS was crucial so that
will abandon. However, in some regions such as Darien and Bocas del Toro, it was necessary to replace
Several families for absence or disinterest. (XXV)
Visits content: interviews show that the activities were carried out and that the visits
They were valuable because the game, song and story are activities that facilitate learning and wake up in
the child the habit of reading. The caregivers express that the RIS were well prepared and taught them
How to do interaction and game activities. Another crucial area during the visit was the motivation of
caregivers to carry out the activities with your child. (XXVI) Although the RIS has the function of observing,
Guide, model, and guide caregivers, families perceive the laughter as a teacher who arrives at the house.
(XXVII) However, there is no tool developed to supervise the quality of visits. 73
Caregivers who received the backpack without the visit later requested it.
Proportion of children by RIS: in general, relatively adequate proportions of
children per laugh to protect the quality of the visit and operate in dispersed locations (10 children for each
Ris). However, in some regions with a weaker institutional structure (for example, when not
There were enough plant staff), more than 10 children was assigned to each RIS. For example, in Darién
There were only 3 laughs with 20 children assigned to each one due to lack of availability of RIS.
FINDING 13: Home visits are of quality and perceived as valuable by providing guidance on
How to use the content of the backpack. Caregivers who received the backpack without the visit requested it
Subsequently, which demonstrates the demand and need for this component. A management structure

P6: mothers and fathers aware of the importance and benefits of proper, motivated and
Committed to early childhood development
This result was partially reached (see graph 6). Both families that received only the
Backpack as those who received the most visited backpack report that the backpack caring for you increased their
interest and motivation in the initial education of their children. The RIS also made assessments of
commitment (interest, motivation and performance) of the child and the family in each follow -up visit.74
According to the observations of the RIS and the quantitative data75, improvements in the commitment are evidenced
of children and families with backpack take care of you over time. The analysis is presented in detail in the
Impact criteria. However, qualitative analysis demonstrates disinterest, not availability and lack of
Motivation in some cases, especially at the beginning of the intervention, and men caregivers. (XXVIII)
Find 14: Both modalities (backpack with and without visit) raised the motivation and interest of mothers, fathers
and caregivers, especially the main caregiver with the development of his child. Challenges still persist in the
Motivation and participation of the father figure. Visits also contributed to increase consciousness
of the main caregiver about the importance of the game and its participation and commitment to activities.

As demonstrated by graph 7, it is possible to distinguish between contextual (socioeconomic, cultural factors
or individual), and factors linked to the management and implementation process of the intervention.
74 The classification of family and child performance are: low: little or no interest in activities; Medium: interest
moderate in some activities; High: motivation, interest and collaboration during activities.

Parents motivated and committed to the DIT (subscale Parents Performance. Family Performance Survey)
41
Contextual factors (which do not focus from the intervention) that influence the strategy positively
include sociodemographic factors such as large families that can increase the scope of the
Intervention producing a multiplier effect, since several members participate in the activities.
Contextual factors that can negatively influence the strategy have to do with i) a greater
level of socio -economic vulnerability (for example, not having a cell phone, lack of coverage of
telephone networks, basic telephone teams, ii) cultural factors such as perceptions and habits of
Traditional gender roles that can hinder the involvement of the father in the raising of his son,
economic factors such as work away from home, iii) social factors, for example, a family environment
negative; and other factors such as Pandemia for COVID-19.
Contextual factors (which focus from the intervention): a main individual factor that influenced
The achievement of the backpack goals was the level of motivation, interest, and commitment of families
to carry out the activities, and their perceptions about the importance of positive parenting. These elements
They have been building and strengthening during the implementation of the backpack. Another factor

to make visits, and v) financial resources available to cover administrative expenses and
Operational service.
11. What is the level of satisfaction of families benefiting with the two modalities?
The caregivers interviewed, including indigenous mothers and mothers head of household, show high
satisfaction with the service because they see the effect of interaction with the child on their development and learning.
They feel that they have been taken into account and appreciate the game materials. They want to continue with a backpack
Take care because they have learned and saw advances in child development. On a scale of 1 to 5 being 5 lo
more satisfied, all classify their level of satisfaction between 4 to 5. satisfaction tends to be greater in
those families that receive more visits backpack (see graph 8). The level of satisfaction is in line with the
RIS report that perceives good satisfaction of families and desire to continue. (XXX)
There are exceptions, for example, in the Darién where some families did not want to participate and you cannot

In the Darién, the participation of families was little, due to external situations such as COVID-19, move

12. What aspects of taking care of you can be improved in the escalation stage?
An important element to refine in the backpack is to include the periodic visit for all
participants. Some caregivers pointed out the need to provide more visits, and backpack executors
Taking care indicate that accompaniment by visit was useful to motivate caregivers to
perform more with guide activities. (XXXI)
At the short -term results level, graph 6 visualizes the results defined in the TDC to improve: the
RIS training (P1), and, to a lesser extent, the level of consciousness of caregivers regarding the
importance and benefits of interaction with the child through the game and adequate child care
(P6).
P1: RIS, availability, training and accompaniment profile: the training and profession of the RIS and their
Knowledge of the local context are aspects that influence the quality of the visit. For example, two thirds
of the RIS did not have the ideal training (early stimulation, education, psychology, social work) for
make visits (see Table 6), and therefore it was crucial to provide more orientation by personnel trained
In the required disciplines. One of the strengths was the work modality through teams
RIS multidisciplinary by region. Its different professional profiles and functions were complemented.
However, their functions in other programs limit the availability of time for the visit, and the
Location of RIS outside the communities limits access to distant communities. (XXXII)
In the case of NGOs, the need to have allocated financial resources to execute is highlighted
Visits, ideal and sufficient staff for the number of families and close to families. (XXXIII)
Considering the above, the capacities created in the RIS teams can be used in the
Escalation in a role of supervision to other appointed facilitators, closer to communities.
The participating families have low economic resources, so some caregivers and RIS highlighted
The need to require support that contributes to the child's food. This reflects the need for
joints with the health sector and other actors within the framework of the RAIPI. (XXXIV) the quality of some
didactic materials and the backpack itself must improve to last longer. (XXXV) Other aspects
43
proposed by caregivers are to include meeting spaces for caregivers and children to share
and learn, for example, about crafts, or how to handle difficult situations. (XXXVI)
The main aspects to improve include:
• Include the element of home visits for all beneficiary families.
• Improve the quality of the materials contained in the backpack so that they are more durable, define
The replacement of certain elements of the backpack, add other elements to the backpack to achieve
more effective care and upbringing, and carrying out a participatory process with families and community
for the development of toys or activities of context and culture;
• Design a training supplier training plan, and provide more initial training and
Continue to strengthen aspects of care and parenting, reference of cases, disability, etc.
• Build and pilot the quality standards of this community modality;
• Equipment profiles: have personnel closer to communities for visits;
• Have a budget for pilot and escalation phases.
• Design an M&E system that statistically estimate the added value of visits

13. To what extent did you take care of yourself from your design to be climbing? Design and
Execution are useful as a starting point (pilot) for a large -scale service?
Although the design of the pilot phase does not explicitly count on an escalation and plan of

14. Does the M&E system allow the impact of a backpack to take care of yourself? What adjustments do you
do you require to measure the impact on a larger scale?
Transversely, the backpack m & e system is valued as a tool that allows
Systematize learning (T7: The intervention uses an M&E system that allows to pilot the collection
of data to design evidence -based intervention, and statistically estimate the added value of the
visits component; and laughs oriented to apply the instruments of the M&E system to pilot the
Impact measurement, T8).
The result T8 is considered achieved (see graph 6), because the RIS through training and application
Practice during the execution of the pilot learned to apply the surveys to know the progress in the
child development and family. There was close accompaniment of the displays and support between
The RIS teams of a region to provide more guidance as necessary. (XXXVII).
Regarding T7, it is identified that the service system includes quantitative components and
qualitative Graph 6 presents this result as partially reached, because although it piloted the
Impact measurement, it still does not allow statistically to estimate the added value of the visits component.
Qualitative component of the M&E system: It has two tools: 1) The simple design of a system
of alerts77 to detect cases of children with special or reinforcement needs, and 2) the file of
monitoring of visits as a mechanism to document what happens in the visit, useful to supervise or
monitor the quality of visits, and to explore factors that are associated with the performance level
and family motivation. The application of these tools for the RIS and information analysis
contributed to the generation and management of knowledge, and the intersectoral articulation of the cases by the
Backpack service managers take care of yourself. However, the qualitative component of the M&E system
It has a systematic analysis of the application of these tools described. The M&D system includes

There are indications that the intervention with or without visit generates profits in the language and motor development of the
child. Motor survey scores and language survey improved substantially in the last
take. Qualitative analysis confirms this positive impact for children on both modalities.
From the qualitative analysis, the caregivers of both groups, including indigenous mothers and mothers head
of the home, and RIS confirm that the backpack car contributed to the development of cognitive, social, social skills
motor and children's language. (XXXVIII)
“I have been able to make comparisons between children belonging to the organization and who participated in the project
and notice their evolution in relation to those who did not have that benefit in terms of skills acquired by
those who did participate. " (NGO RIS)
In addition, qualitative appreciations suggest positive effects of both versions (with or without visit) to others
children in and outside the home. The households of both versions and RIS indicate a participation of
brothers and children in the activities. For example, older brothers play with the
Small brother who did not do it before. (XXXIX). Most caregivers in both versions
They talked about backpack with neighboring families and motivated neighboring caregivers to perform the
Backpack activities with their children. (XL)

As for family interaction and game opportunities at home?
As for the indicators of home opportunities (R4) and family interaction (R3 improve

In short, there are indications that intervention with or without visit generates profits. The indicators of
Home game and family interaction opportunities improve substantially in relation to the line
base. Qualitative analysis confirms positive preliminary effects on both modalities.
Most caregivers indicate that the backpack took care of you helped them develop skills to play with
your child and stimulate it, which are now more attentive to initial education and that are best organized to
Dedicate quality time to your children (XLI):
“I as a mother did not know how to teach him to play and that. Here in our area when we have the
Children do not know how to educate them, only when they go to school is for the teacher to guide us. Me
Personally the backpack has helped me a lot to know how to play with my son, to be closer to me
son and I feel happy every time he identifies something […] ”(indigenous mother, c)
“I before, when my son was two years old I did not put him to learn things as colors or anything and when he arrived
The book yes. One thinks that at 4 he goes to school then why he will teach him. ” (Mother, T)
Contrary to quantitative results, some caregivers indicate that they did not change habits or
behaviors, especially in the group without visits and/or when they already had previous experiences in
breeding practices. It is also observed that some caregivers carry out the activities with the children
Because the "teacher" requests it. This demonstrates the importance of the visit to motivate caregivers. To the
same time demonstrates the need for more activities for families to internalize further
Importance of interaction.
Positive impacts are also reported on other relatives of the home and outside the home, which due to backpack
Taking care were involved in play activities with the child. For example, grandparents perform the
guide activities with the child when the main caregiver is not and some caregivers report having
Shared learning with other people outside the home (aunts, neighbors). (XLII)
In addition to family activities and routines together, the family bond is strengthened through the
Expression of caregivers affection for their children. The samples of affection make the child feel happy, they go up
his self -esteem, and give him a feeling of security and protection that promotes exploration and regulates his
Emotions Both beneficiary families and backpack executors take care that a
deeper interaction between caregivers and children who strengthened the family bond, which did not exist
before. (XLIII)
92 classification of family and child performance through the performance registration: low: little or no interest in
activities; Medium: moderate interest in some activities; High: motivation, interest and collaboration during activities.
54
Finally, changes in the family environment are indicated, for example, greater discipline and coexistence between
The brothers, better ways to correct children, or improvements in the hygiene of the environment. There is no
differences in ethnicity or mothers head of the home. (XLIV)
Summary of impact findings
Finding 18: quantitative analysis reveals that there are no statistically significant differences between
children who only received the backpack versus those who received more visits, in any
Child development indicator (motor development, language, and home opportunities).
Find 19: There are indications that intervention with or without visit generates profits in motor development,
Language, game opportunities at home, and family interaction. The indicators improved
substantially with respect to the baseline. Qualitative analysis confirms positive impacts on both
Modalities
Finding 20: Qualitative appreciations suggest positive effects of both modalities to other adults
and children in and outside the home, which were involved in the game activities.
7.5. Sustainability
The extent to which they continue or are probable that the net benefits of the intervention continue to continue.
Includes analysis of financial, social and institutional capacities necessary for the benefits to be
Keep. This evaluation criterion fits into the TDC levels in a transverse way and for
medium and long -term results, also considering the risks and assumptions.
16. What conditions are required in public regulations and institutionality so that the initiative
Can it be scaled and incorporated as part of your fan range?
Regarding the degree of commitment and political will of the Government and management institutions, they are observed
favorable conditions for converting backpack in state program, for the priority level you take
The development of early childhood. It is based on Law 171 of 2020 that establishes the implementation of
The RAIPI, which is in an iterative, incremental and participatory update process.
Mides i) recognizes the relevance of a backpack taking care of yourself as a care and initial education service in
family/community mode for the most vulnerable areas where services are not yet provided
institutional, and the potential of this service to achieve similar results that the institutional offer, II)
You have the willingness to design the scaling plan based on the findings of this evaluation, to
Reach a broader population, with focus on coverage expansion in difficult access areas,
indigenous areas, urban-marginal areas, and iii) sustains the vision of service continuity as a
State program.
Regarding the budget for escalation, within the framework of Law 171 and the update of the RAPI as
Programmatic Policy Framework, the Government gives budget priority to early childhood. Backpack
Taking care had with government resources, but does not have its own assigned budget. In this
context, it is necessary to integrate backpack as a service of care and initial education, aligning
to the guidelines of the RAIPI that facilitate the future budget allocation, action provided by Mides.
Regarding harmonization with other programs or services of the institutional ecosystem, specifically
With the care program, there is a harmonization between both interventions by channeling them to different
geographical areas In the short term it is viable to maintain a geographical complementarity approach.
Regarding the degree of involvement of other early childhood care actors in the
Service design or in the escalation plan, the pilot phase of the backpack car was not planned in a way
articulated with other actors from the RAIPI. However, the raipi update allowed to socialize backpack
Take care of the RAPI actors responsible for the linked attention (control and monitoring of the
Child development; family accompaniment; and registration and identification of the child). These actors
55
They understand the need for comprehensive and articulated attention in the early childhood that it puts as a center
to the child as a subject of rights93 and is necessary from the competences of each sector to achieve the
Articulation in the field considering the governance mechanisms established by the RAIPI.
Among the conditions that could affect the scaling, the lack of sufficient personnel is identified
available at the local level for service implementation. The programs that contemplate visits
Home required sufficient personnel, being their selection and training key considerations for the
quality, costs and the process of climbing this type of intervention.94 To mitigate this risk, it is suggested
Consider an incentive mechanism for community facilitators ("mothers and master parents")
accompanied by initial and continuous training, and supervision mechanisms at the regional level. Supervision
At the regional level it could be carried out by the RIS trained in the pilot phase.
Among the conditions that could accelerate the scaling are identified: a) Include backpack taking care of yourself in the
RAIPI update, within the initial education axis, b) establish a state budget item
For scaling, c) Make an intermediate escalation phase implementing recommendations
of this evaluation, prioritizing 2-3 territories with diverse characteristics (for example, a region, one
rural and urban-marginal) and re-evaluate to collect learning before climbing nationwide
(final scaling), e d) Involve local governments (provincial technical boards) as allies in the
Implementation of the service, promoting the intersectoral articulation and local management.
Another favorable factor for escalation is the demand for the intervention observed in the
communities. Families not included in this pilot phase, including indigenous people, expressed interest and
They requested participating. Also, a certain demand for continuity for families and children is perceived
who have participated in the pilot phase. (XLV)
An element with potential is the component of building toys through recyclable or homemade material
because it stimulates creativity in making your own toys. This also allows the social fabric to work in
The receiving community. From joint creation spaces, you can work the prevention of the
Violence, gender equity, cooperativism, among others. It is still necessary in Panama to advance in
sensitize the population about the issue of recycling and achieving changes in behaviors, attitudes and
You practice recycling, which is an opportunity to work on the topic of climate change. Some
Caregivers with visits value it positive:
“It also tells us what we could do with recyclable material, and that helped us because there was
Much that we dump and then the child used them to entertain. It is very
educational." (Mother, T)
The conditions required to climb and sustain a backpack take care of yourself in the recommendations.
FINDING 21: favorable conditions are observed to convert backpack to take care of you into a state program, such
as the high degree of political will and commitment of Mides. The normative context is also favorable,
Well, taking care of you is based on Law 171 of 2020 and in the Ripi update. It is also observed
Backpack harmonization take care of you with other initial education services, specifically with the program
Take care of you Finally, high demand for service in communities is observed. Families not included in
This phase expressed interest and requested to participate, while several of the beneficiary families
They requested continuity of the service.

8. Conclusions
According to the findings presented by each evaluation question, the following are presented
Conclusions.
Regarding the relevance of a backpack, take care of you,
1. This modality, especially in the version with home visits, is valid in the local context
because it contributes to initial care and education in the family/community environment, in areas
vulnerable and remote without institutional coverage, and strengthens the capacity of caregivers to respond
to the needs of the child.
2. It is adequate because the initial care and education service reaches home, and the materials you use
For the game they are accessible to families because they are taught to take advantage of resources.
3. The component of home visits allowed to identify and manage, to the extent that the
Local context allowed, cases from other actors and sectors responsible for the guarantee of
rights.
Backpack taking care of yourself, especially in its version with a visit, is valued as relevant because it is a
Alternative to reach children who do not have access to institutional services for care and education
initial. In other words, taking care of yourself becomes a way to guarantee the care service and
Initial education in difficult access contexts, contributing to expand coverage.
As regards the efficiency of the backpack, take care of you,
4. From its cost it is possible to see that a backpack has been efficient as a service that contributes to the
Initial care and education in the family/community context, because i) is an adaptation of a
program already established, which allows you to use and take advantage of elements and contents of it, and II)
Take advantage of existing human resources in the regional institutional structure and these teams
Multidisciplinary facilitated articulations with other care actors to the extent that the
Local context allowed. 95
5. A protocol that guides the reference and monitoring of inter -institutionally not yet
It has been designed. The articulation with other attention and services would contribute to a greater commitment
of families and would bring better results for children.
6. Supervision from the central level is not optimal in terms of efficiency.
7. A budget for a backpack was not yet assigned. In addition, backpacking back still does not have
a calculation of its operating and administrative costs differentiated by region.
In terms of efficiency, taking care of yourself is valued as partially efficient since, although it is
possible to identify a certain articulation or reference of cases, there are opportunities to formalize and
Execute this mechanism within the framework of the governance systems of the RAIPI and/ or through the COAI
regional, and train the RIS for reference. Some considerations to increase efficiency are
Visits for all caregivers through personnel closest to communities supervised by
RIS at regional level.
As regards the efficacy of the backpack, take care of you,
8. The results in the short and medium term have been achieved. There are trained personnel for
provide the service; The backpacks were distributed to families in prioritized vulnerable areas
For the Colmena Plan, although it was not always the families in greater condition of vulnerability
within the prioritized territories that received the service; The visits to families were
mostly fulfilled; Most caregivers follow the guide and material; and a
Increase in commitment of families.
95 materialize in the management and reference of cases through the COAI or directly with the instances responsible for
Attention, for example, with the Civil Registry in the regional areas.
57
9. The periodic accompaniment and the supervision of the RIS from the dispos and orientation between the RIS
In multidisciplinary teams it functioned as a continuous training mechanism and contributed to the
Achievement of the results at this stage.
10. Beneficiary caregivers express high satisfaction with the service (both modalities) including
Indigenous caregivers. However, there are opportunities to add elements that allow
Increase efficacy in the following phases.
11. Visits have been perceived of quality and valuable by providing guidance on how to use content
of the backpack. Those caregivers who only received the backpack requested visits as they require
closer orientation.
12. Despite the backpacking of you was designed more as a project than like a pilot, it has
implicit elements of a pilot because it allowed to prove the necessary elements of the intervention,
and has a vision of climbing depending on whether positive effects are achieved in the beneficiary population.
The design of a scaling plan with intermediary phases will allow to test and evaluate
Suggested adaptations.
13. The pilot phase included an M&E system that piloted the impact measurement, which allowed to rescue
Lessons on the design of a future evaluation.
Backpack effectiveness is valued as satisfactory because the results raised at this stage
They have been reached, and a high level of satisfaction of the beneficiary population is perceived. Although the
Design and execution during the pilot phase is not based on a framework or scalability plan, it has allowed
Identify elements that worked well and those that need to be refined.
Regarding the impact of a backpack, care for you:
14. No statistically significant differences were found between the backpack modality and the
Backpack mode + visits regarding early childhood development in any indicator.
15. There are indications that the backpack taking care of yourself in both versions (with or without visit) generates profits in the
Language development, motor development and increases game opportunities at home. The data
Qualitative reveal that caregivers who receive visits tend to use the guide.
16. Qualitative appreciations suggest positive effects of both versions to brothers and children
Neighbors, and other relatives of the home, who were involved in the activities.
In terms of impact, the greatest challenges do not seem to be in the intervention itself, but in the design and
Implementation of the M&E system that piloted the impact measurement. This evaluation provided suggestions
for the design of a subsequent impact assessment, which will allow robust measurement of added value
of the home visit.
Regarding the sustainability and scalability of the intervention Backpack Take care:
17. Favorable conditions are observed to convert backpack to take care of you into a state program, such
as the high degree of political will and commitment of Mides. The normative context is also
Favorable, as taking care of you is based on Law 171 of 2020 and the Ripi update.
To ensure sustainability, it is suggested to include a backpack taking care of the raipi update,
Establish a state budget item for scaling informed by costing
differentiated by region, and involve local governments (provincial technical boards) as allies
In the implementation of the service, promoting the intersectoral articulation and local management.
18. Backpack Take care initiated the adaptation of the modality of the Take care program to the Panamanian context and
according to state capacity.
In terms of sustainability, under the premises that the service is 1) visible in the RAIPI, 2)
harmonized with the scaling of the care program, and 3) budgeted (extension of funds for
scale), is probable or with moderate risk to achieve its continuity, escalation and sustainability.
Regarding human rights approaches, gender and equity:
Although taking care of you was not designed in a participatory process with communities at the level
local, the integration of the perspective of human rights, equity and gender is verified. Intervention,
58
In its two versions, it is specifically directed to the most vulnerable populations in the country, in rural areas
remote, including the indigenous and Afro -descendant population, mothers head of the home, and to a lesser extent
children with disabilities and father figure.
TAKING YOU Backpack is a mechanism to ensure that vulnerable populations have access to care
and initial education in the family and community context. This contributes to minimizing inequalities,
Fight violations of children's rights and supports the realization of those rights. Backpack
Caring for you strengthens the capabilities of home care personnel and caregivers to fulfill your
Child care and initial education obligations. It is required to strengthen scope in indigenous areas,
In urban-marginal areas, children with disabilities, and strengthen parental co-responsibility.
9. Lessons learned
Among the lessons that can be extracted from this pilot phase, the following stand out:
Relevance
• The close monitoring and accompaniment through home visits is valuable for the profile
of the population to which services are directed as a backpack. Domiciliary visits in addition
They offer an opportunity to detect difficulties in development, health problems and
nutritional, and special protection needs.
• Adaptations for children with disabilities are better when there is commitment to
caregivers with activities, facilitator capacity and availability of specialized personnel
to adapt the activities to the special needs of the child.
Efficiency
• The case management mechanism through home visits increases the impact of
Social programs such as backpack caring and contributes to comprehensive care.
Effectiveness
• As part of the M&E system, the tools to systematically document what happens
In visiting and measuring their quality they allow interventions such as a backpack to continue
adapting and refining.
• Services such as Backpack Take care require the development of quality standards that guide
Initial and continuous training plans for suppliers.
• Scale pilot: Implement an intervention such as a backpack taking care of yourself in phases, including a stage
Pilot, allows institutional learning and refinement before escalation. An escalation
gradual can be useful to test adaptations.
• The escalation of interventions such as a backpack has more potential in regions than
They have a robust institutional structure, with sufficient personnel available and trained.
Impact measurement
• In rigorous impact evaluations of this type of interventions they have to be involved
From the beginning the experts in design and implementation implementation.
• At this pilot's stage it was challenging to take statistically founded lessons. However, I know
They were able to rescue lessons about the design of an impact assessment.
Sustainability
• The sustainability of services such as a backpack care depends on the assignment of items
Institutional Budget.
• It is possible to see backpack as part of a joint adaptation and scaling process
With the Take care program.

10. Recommendations
The recommendations are derived from the findings and conclusions described (see Matrix of Findings -
CONCLUSIONS - Recommendations in Annex M), and were subject to a validation and prioritization process
through a participatory session with the reference group. For each recommendation a
Synthesis of the finding, the priority, the time horizon for its implementation, the actions that are due
carry out, and the key actors in their development. At the end of this section it is also presented in a table
the priority in scaling in the form of semaforization (high, medium or low priority) (Table 11).
In order to increase relevance
1. For the scaling phase, include consultations with indigenous and Afro -descendant communities for
Ensure any adjustment to service contemplates your vision and needs.
It was found that the backpack material did not contain specific elements of indigenous cultures and
Aphrodescendants, although dispos made cultural adjustments in indigenous areas to contextualize the
intervention.
Therefore, beings are recommended in the medium term, prioritize within the backpack redesign
Take care of the participation of the indigenous and Afro -descendant community, as well as the inclusion and
ethnicity The above includes cultural, social, special needs, among others. Includes
also a participatory process with families and community, for the development of toys or activities
typical of context and culture, and strengthen the selection of the beneficiary population with an ethnicity approach.
Responsible Institution: Mides-Dispros, with support from regional and regional addresses.

Priority: Low
Term: Start this process in the short term
2. While advancing in the coverage expansion of the CAIPI, include a space component
group community, led by “local mothers and parents” for learning and
Children's interaction. This component would also promote community dialogue and
Backpack appropriation of the community.
In the pilot phase it was found that the visit functioned as a case management and reference mechanism
to other services that, otherwise, would not be given in these communities, and that allowed to create articulations
with other suppliers of early childhood to the extent that the local context allowed.
As contextualized strategies to the community and families, it is recommended to integrate into a backpack
Other aspects such as spaces for socialization and learning for caregivers and children through circles
of monthly group learning in the community, and/or provision of mobile services (mobile library that
arrives at the communities), and training of mothers and master parents in their communities.

3. Strengthen inclusion approaches (disability), and gender to promote co -responsibility
in parenting and transforming social norms that perpetuate gender roles into care.
It is recommended to strengthen the inclusion approach (disability) in which it is included:
• Identification and timely referencing of cases,
• Contribute to families with children with disabilities accessing angel programs
Guardian or monetary transfers programs (subject to case evaluation),
60
• Strengthen the capacities and competences of service providers in relation to the
disability,
• Have tools and activities that respond to different types of disability. In
the escalation, articulate the intervention with the health sector, as a competent entity for
Determine and certify disability and its therapeutic management.
It was found that challenges persist to raise the participation of the father figure for cultural factors and
Traditional gender roles. To overcome this, it is recommended to strengthen the gender approach, which includes:
• The information lifting that allows us to understand the dynamics and beliefs of roles
gender traditional related to the raising of children, and
• Design accompaniment strategies to transform parenting practices with
gender (include a sensitization, communication and transformation component
cultural and social norms related to the care of children associated with women),
• Work this in line with other actors and sectors, and community and religious leaders.

4. Strengthen the backpack joint take care of yourself with other social services, including the subsidies of
Social protection of beneficiary families, contributing to a sensitive social protection system
to childhood with equity approach (inclusion).
It was found that only half of the families of the backpack taking care of you receive a state subsidy that supports
Nutrition or child health, among others. It is recommended to reinforce the backpack joint take care of yourself with others
Social services, for example, through its inclusion in existing information systems for the
complementarity monitoring (FUPS and/or nominal registration of the RAIPI). This would contribute to a system of
social protection sensitive to childhood with equity approach.
Allow a) to achieve a minimum social protection floor for families with children in early childhood, and
b) Ensures that for the beneficiary of the backpack caring for you, its eligibility to receive is determined
Subsidies of the MIDES Social Protection Programs portfolio and/or determine the eligibility of the
Social protection subsidies containers to access backpack.

5. Develop protocols for cases referencing (health, nutrition, education, protection
special) through the regional COAI and/or the governance mechanisms of the RAIPI, and train
to service providers (RIS) in these protocols.
The evaluation revealed that there is no protocol that guides the reference and monitoring of cases
inter -institutionally. To overcome this challenge, develop protocols for the reference of cases to
through regional COAI and/or governance mechanisms of the RAIPI. The following actions are key:
• In the redesign and escalation, involve the actors of the RAIPI and Law 171, to formalize the
Intra-institutional articulation mechanisms, in design, implementation and monitoring
61
of backpack take care of yourself. The base is the updated raipi.96 for case management, use the mechanism
of governance of the RAIPI and/or the regional COAI.
• Incorporate the detection and reference protocols of cases97 in the training processes
initial and continuous training, and in the M&E system.
• Work with the competent instances and the actors of the RAIPI in such a way that at all levels
The powers and actions that must be implemented within the framework of Law 171 are understood.
• In the Darien, strengthen the regional management structure to strengthen the articulation.

Recommendations are summarized to strengthen the M&E Backpack System (Box 1), and for
Ensure that the M&E system allows impact measurement during the scaling phase (box 2):
Box 1: Recommendations to strengthen the M&E system
➢ Incorporate in the M&E system a families' satisfaction survey with the service.
➢ Explore the options of a digital system, to optimize the collection, organization, analysis and
Data presentation, ideally in real time, and with a system of alerts for cases of needs
special or that require reinforcement. Explore the unification with the M&E system to take care of yourself.
65
➢ Link the backpack data Take care of the RAIPI monitoring system.99
➢ Include the beneficiary population in the renab or unique beneficiary record (FUPS) .100
➢ Create an information system where the base ready for analysis is automatically generated.
➢ Consider disaggregations for equity variables.
➢ Caring for you requires a system that allows to monitor the advances and alerts of the intervention,
including the number of visits, changes or not in the environment or family dynamics from the
Intervention, identification and management of alerts for alleged violation of rights, etc.
Box 2: Recommendations for impact measurement during the escalation phase
➢ The design itself of the surveys and, in general, of the quantitative data collection process could be
led/designed by a consulting team with experience in impact designs to be consistent with the
Quantitative evaluation model.
➢ Increase sample size.
➢ Make a design with a pure control group (without receiving the intervention).
➢ A randomization to the interior of communities helps to eliminate (or mitigate) the bias that could generate the
particular characteristics of the territories (which are inserted in the prioritization criteria).
➢ Capture rejection and attrition rates, that is, quantify and report the number of families that had the option
of receiving visits and rejected, documenting and understanding the reasons that motivate decisions of families of
abandon or not participate in the intervention. In this way, impact estimates would be of intention of
treatment, which would include all selected families (or for an impact assessment, assigned
randomly to treatment), regardless of whether they effectively received treatment.
➢ Have one or several groups with a frequency of different visits to estimate the optimal frequency.
➢ Capture equity variables (mothers head of the home and ethnicity) that would allow data of data.
➢ Increasing the sample to all the age ranges of the intervention would increase the validity of the effects.
➢ Determine the time spaces between data shots to capture changes in children's development
It requires a more complete analysis of specialists in DIT or psychopedagogy. Create a differentiated system of
Data capture according to children's age range (eg data collection every 6 months for children over 1
year).
➢ Lift the baseline before starting the intervention, that is, before delivery of the backpack and the first
Visit to avoid data distortion as a new effect.
➢ Avoid providing guidance to families from the control group to apply surveys so as not to contaminate the data.
➢ Include already validated questionnaires about parenting guidelines (example: DP-3 that is open use). If it continues
Using the forms designed in the pilot phase, check them:
• Unify Home Surveys and game opportunities to avoid duplication of questions. Extend surveys
of motor activity and language to the age range of 48 months. Unify identification heading
of the child and caregiver in the surveys. Measure performance indicators in both groups to see differences.
➢ Perform another socioeconomic survey taking at the end, which allows to capture possible changes in the situation
socioeconomic of families that can have an impact on the care of the child's performance and
child. For example, ask families in the end retrospectively about changes in their situation
Socioeconomic would capture those dynamics and allow controlling other factors. Also, it would be mitigated by a
largest sample size in which the balance of the characteristics of the
groups ensuring their comparability.
99 In the framework of the RAIPI update, its five -year plan is being built which also contemplates the design of a
Unique information system. Data from the following backpack phases Take care must be an input for the single system.
100 MIDES is the coordinating entity of the implementation of the Single Registry that allows to update and articulate the data of all the
beneficiaries of the different social protection programs of measures aimed at the national population to strengthen the
Efficiency of the social protection and inclusion system and the monitoring capacity of social protection programs.
66
➢ Incorporate the measurement of the skills and skills of visits suppliers, and their previous knowledge,
For example, through a pre-post training test. Measure the development of capacities and change of
Behaviors, attitudes and practices (CAP) of suppliers, for example, through Cap questionnaire.
➢ Measure how the profile (profession, experience) of the service provider could influence the results in
DIT indicators and family performance.

The stage from pregnancy to 4 years, children need nutrition, protection
and stimulation for your brain to develop correctly.
The brain development is activated and modeled by the stimuli or interactions provided by its environment, as well as
for the love and care he receives from gestation. The deprivation of these care interactions
affectionate and sensitive impacts the physical, cognitive and emotional development of children. Care is
It relates to the practices that occur at home, but also includes those interactions in the
spaces in which the child receives services from the different sectors: health, nutrition, education and
Social protection.
The above requires state investment to give each child a right start in life and guarantee
His rights according to the commitments of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. An intervention
Adequate at the right time contributes to the development of the country, interrupts intergenerational cycles
of inequality and is a profitable way of promoting shared prosperity, promoting growth
Inclusive economic, and put an end to poverty. According to the sustainable development objectives, “of

Primary education ”(goal 4.2.).
According to population projections by 2020 according to the last national census, in Panama
There are 369,747 girls and boys between 0 and 4 years, representing approximately 9% of the population. Multiple
analysis suggest that a large number of these children are deprived of three essential elements for
brain development: "Eat, play and love" .102 highlights in areas that are key to sitting

In response to this situation, the Ministry of Social Development implements a backpack, a
project that seeks to promote early stimulation in children between 0 and 4 years. The objective of the project
is that caregivers stimulate their children while creating emotional ties through a guide
Practice but effective, that allows children to develop their cognitive, social,
emotional, and language. The backpack is equipped with a guide of activities for families and caregivers
which promotes positive upbringing and strengthens affective ties through game and family communication.
For its part, UNICEF has prioritized the development of early childhood as one of the results of its
Cooperation Program in Panama for the 2021-2025 period, with a special approach in promoting
Sensitive parenting guidelines and services for child development in terms of nutrition,
quality preschool and primary education, in coherence with the main deprivations that come
affecting development during this stage, and responding to the institutional and territorial context.
Backpack Project Take care
The project consists of distributing backpacks that contain: toys, books, activities and a guide
to build toys at home, to provide comprehensive care according to the age of each child and in their
family context, promoting the motor, social and verbal development of the infant and the monitoring of the
Actions that allow guaranteeing the rights of children established in the RAIPI (attention route

Similarly, the Backpack Project takes care to provide content and instruments to
families so that they can, from home, stimulate the development of their children, as well as favor the link
Loving care and care through the implementation of the Family Activity Guide and
Backpack caregivers take care of yourself (for children from 0 to 4 years old). This is done through biweekly follow -up
through structured face -to -face or telephone visits (in the case that merits) to children
and their families.
The Backpack Project takes care of you recognizes the leading place that families have in care, parenting,
education and development of boys and girls in their early childhood, making them the closest
Co -responsibility scenario in the guarantee of the rights of children. Establishes as axis
main, the accompaniment and strengthening of the socio -emotional and parental skills of the

4. Evaluation scope
Under the technical supervision of the National Directorate of Social Protection (Dispos) of the Ministry of
Social development and UNICEF monitoring and evaluation area, the evaluation team is expected to
selected systematizes the design of the evaluation proposed by the Ministry of Social Development, analyzes
The results and draw conclusions and recommendations on the backpack project Take care in your stage
pilot.
The Ministry of Social Development has designed an experimental evaluation (with theoretical randomization) of
Two arms (backpack modality and backpack + visits) without pure control group. The sample for the
Evaluation are 78 families nationwide, where 39 have been assigned to the backpack modality and 39 to the
Backpack mode + biweekly visits (I.E., receive the backpack more stimulation at home by an agent
specialized community). The details of the sample are presented in Table 1.
Table 1. sample information
Population n
Total number of families 78
Number of control families 39
Number of families in treatment group 39
The design contemplates data collection on the baseline (time 0 - June 2021), 2 months later
(Time 1 - August 2021), 4 months later (Time 2 - October 2021) and 6 months later (time 3 -
December 2021). Data collection is carried out from June to December 2021 by operators of the
project. The result variables (outcomes) are 1) motor development, 2) language development, 3)
Game opportunities at home E 4) Family interaction with the child between 6-24 months.
The definitive scope of the evaluation will be determined together with the evaluation team, the Ministry of

Mitigation: during the reconstruction of the TDC by the evaluation team through a participatory process with the

and escalation of the intervention.
9 Have the assumptions about the role of the partners and the government be explicit? Limitation: the documentation of the intervention and the TDR do not contain information about the role of the partners and do not
specify which key partners must involve the intervention. Mitigation: The evaluation team elaborates
Recommendations based on a review of the PI attention ecosystem in Panama. The recommendations will be
validated through in -depth interviews with managers and executors (RIS) of the intervention. May imply
Also additional interviews with other actors of attention to the PI.

Training cost RIS links in the databases by UNICEF: $ 1,911
RRHH time costs for data collection: N/D
Data purification costs: The budget of the evaluation team does not cover these costs.
Data analysis costs: These costs are part of the evaluation costs.
7 Is there a complete set of documents available? Yeah. The chips and surveys were provided to the evaluation team by MIDES.
There are also databases that synthesize this data.
Are these documents accessible and well organized? Mides has documentation on the organized project, although there are some elements that were not
explicitly written from the beginning (for example, details of the M&E system and recruitment details
of families). The MIDES has all the M&E system data (families surveys) organized on paper. These
Data have been coded in Excel by the RIS, with delays in some operational regions. Excel databases
They will be delivered to the evaluation team when the evaluation design is approved by MIDES and UNICEF.
8 Is there a viable plan to fill data gaps? Limitation: There is still no plan to wear data gaps. Group data pollution is also observed
Control: when complying with the quantitative data bimonthly by the projects of the project, these are not only

Cases, it is observed that the data and treatment group data are mixed. On the other hand, it is observed that
During the process families have been left for several reasons and were replaced by other families. Mitigation:
Explain the limitations of the M&E system through an assessment of this system by the evaluators, and
Complement the quantitative analysis with qualitative data.
C Evaluate adequacy of financial resources to achieve expected results
87
1 Are the resources aligned with the results? The pilot's resources are aligned with their results. It is observed that the pilot was kept cost-efficient, with
low amounts assigned to the training process, and taking advantage of human resources available at the plant of the
Measure to make home visits.
3 Are there resources reserved for evaluation? It is an evaluation led by the Government, with financing and technical support by UNICEF. UNICEF
established a reference group to support and ensure the quality of the evaluation. UNICEF resources are available
to finance the evaluation and with MIDES resources to organize the collection of data in the field. There are challenges
regarding the availability of enough resources of the evaluation team to carry out the evaluation, as a result
of necessary approaches to ensure quality evaluation (I.E, pilot at the pilot's scale and evaluability) but not
sufficiently sized on TDR.

(1) The main limitation to perform an impact assessment at this stage through data
from the pilot's M&E system is the size of the sample, a strong limitation put
that in total there is only information about 78 children. Size directly influences the
significance of statistical tests and models performed, so a sample size more
Great would allow more consistent results.
On the other hand, despite the fact that random allocation (RCT) allows us to isolate socio -economic factors that
They could be correlated with the treatment, some conditions must be met, because
randomization alone does not ensure a causal effect. When the RCT is not done in the
adequate conditions and under the optimal random criteria, then the treatment group
and the control group are not similar or comparable, which generates biases for the study110.
One of the essential conditions for the validity of the experiment (RCT) is the "balancing" of the groups.
That is, the characteristics of the control group and the treatment group must be similar in the line
base. In this case (below), a strong unbalance in the groups is notorious. Further
particularly, the treatment group shows better socioeconomic conditions than the group
of control. Although once again the sample size does not allow to obtain statistically differences
Significant in a good part of the comparisons, it is evident that the treatment group is
relatively more privileged111 112.
CHARACTERISTICS CONTROL DIF TREATMENT. Statistics (P)
University Education 6% 27% 0.0206
Formal income 43% 53% 0.4469
Subsidies 57% 46% 0.3460
Own Housing 89% 95% 0.3828
Safe water 57% 76% 0.0741
Electric Power 63% 71% 0.4706
Internet 13% 24% 0.2422
In another area, a potential source of bias, it is the way in which the
Information on the baseline. Of the investigated- especially in the qualitative study- the information
From the baseline it was obtained in many cases at the same time or after the backpack was delivered.
This may have generated biases at the scores obtained by children and families in Toma 0.
However, not having more accurate and documented information of this procedure, only
We could indicate that it merits a more detailed investigation and, if applicable, a reformulation of
the way it is implemented.
Another problem could be contamination between groups with visit (treatment) and without visit
(Control), since some families being part of the control group, took advantage of the visits of the
Laugh to consult the use of materials included in the backpack, that is to say that the group of
Control partially receives treatment. At the geographical level there are also possible contamination
by the families of the control group that could be in contact with neighbors or relatives who
They do receive treatment visits.
110 The difference with respect to the baseline, among the groups, helps to solve the issue of biases a bit,
But not quite.
111 This will be ratified later when we see the base scores of the groups in the indicators
studied.
112 In addition, it was also found that, at the gender level, the control group has more children
What girls, while the treatment group has the same proportion. On the other hand, ¾ parts of the children are

Activity subscale
The subscale of caregiver interaction activities with the child goes from 0 to 8, it was found that more
of 50% of the children of the control group belong to a scale greater than 3 in Toma 0, while for
Toma 3, more than 82% exceeds scale 4. Something similar occurs with the treatment group, because more
56% of children have a scale greater than 4 in Toma 0, which improves for taking 3 since the
82% of children are on a scale exceeding 5.

4.3 Behavior subscale
In the behavior subscale (related to child discipline) that takes values of 0 and 1 (being 0
that does not stick to a child and 1 that is attached), it is observed that for the control group there is an increase
exponential because 6 children who obtained scale 1 in the first shot, in the 3, 23 children take
They obtained the scale in question. Also in the treatment group it can be seen that 5 children are
reported on scale 1 in Toma 0, and in Toma 3 a total of 26 children settled on that scale
which indicates that in the most children treatment group they went to the Behavior Subscale 1 than the children
of the control group that passed to said subscale, thus evidencing one of the benefits of the
accompaniment.

5. Survey of home opportunities
In the home game opportunities survey we obtain not only subscales of opportunities and
involvement, but also the child's game hours were determined, with whom he plays, who
Take care, among others. This survey was conducted in all shots, from 0 to 3 allowing to compare
The evolution of the groups among the various shots. In the subscale of game opportunities, in the take
0, both the control group (51%) and the treatment group (54%) obtained a subscale less than 5,
while for taking 3 about 95% of children obtained a subscale between 5 and 8, as well as 98%
of children of the treatment group were found in the aforementioned range.

(ii) “We had to change some families because they received the backpacks, but they had no interest in continuing, they were
They hid every time we arrived or left when we warned that we would visit. In those cases the families that
They didn't want to continue they stayed with the backpack. " (Ris Bocas or Herrera)
“The selection process was through the vice governor, for that reason some children did not present the profile that were
He asked us to enter the project, so we had to leave them outside and thus decrease the number of children
that we had initially contemplated. " (Indigenous Area RIS)
(iii) “It seems appropriate to me because with this pandemic we could not leave the house and it has also helped the
Girl in her performance and development to grow, know and encourage. " (Mother, T)
"Yes, it is adequate and I feel that she has helped the girl's learning and one is more pending of the children."
(Mother, C)
(IV) “I would give a 4 note to the project because I see that it is good, you just have to improve to give you note 5,
improve giving more follow -up, like two or three days per week ”(indigenous mother, c)
“I would give note 5 to the project because it has information that helps mothers and children, teaches us to work on their
development and to stimulate them as it should be. " (Indigenous mother, t)
“I would give him a 4 because I feel that he does benefit the children and one is teaching them and when they go to the preschool and
They will have some knowledge acquired at home, but I would give you a 5 if you incorporated other elements. " (Mother, C)
(v) “[…] The resources contained in the guide are accessible, the father of family is not required to buy a toy
prefabricated, but is taught to take advantage of resources at your fingertips and do not have to invest money for your child
scope to develop their potentialities. " (RIS)
(VI) “So that's because if we asked that the material had contents of the Ngäbe culture the child would have
problems because I would not identify things out there. They learn our culture at home and need to learn what
That there is also outside, so I see the material well, as is. ” (Indigenous mother, t)
“I was quite surprised by the success we had in the indigenous regions and I think the key were the RIS, since
We ask that they were indigenous people who spoke their language and communicate in the way they usually
to do it […]. (Dispros, central level)
(VII) “There were two cases, a three -year -old boy with delay in language, but he had an advance and the guide adapted to him.
Another child did not have a good attachment because of the parents and physically observed some disability because he had
birth problems, but if the parents had put more than their part that child would have advanced. ” (RIS)
“We have a girl's case with Down syndrome features and another degenerative disease. To her every two
Months was done the survey and told us that the girl had advanced a lot and effectively I see that the girl
Now he stops and joins when he could not stand up. Then the project is spectacular because
It is involving adults to get the child to benefit. ” (RIS)
“We had two cases, one of them from a deaf -mute girl and the activities had to be adapted because the backpack was not
Suitable for her, but it could be worked and the girl showed progress. " (RIS)
(VIII) “[…] I was able to witness some cases in which it was the father who accompanied the work with the child. On the other hand,
The laughs used to tell me that moms told them that parents participated more in work with
The children. It is something that we cannot measure now, but I think that was an advance and that helped unite families. ”
(Dispros)
“The Lord is attracted to the project. He sees that it is the best for the child because he realizes that he is
learning. […] Before I did not play so much with the child because he did not have to guide him, now that this project arrived
Then he is guiding him better. " (Indigenous mother, c)
“Yes, because at the time the father was free, he also contributed to the baby's learning. With the backpack
He could focus more on playing with the child ”(Mother, T)
“He plays with her when he is at home and uses the backpack materials, and likes the project, but also thinks
that should include other things. " (Mother, C)
“The majority of the project caregivers were single mothers and the few fathers who had worked and when
They returned home they were not going to get the activities with the children ”(RIS, Colon)
“Another mother told us that he had not done the activities because the husband had told him that they were not according to the
Child's age, who was two years old, then we had to explain that they were designed for their child and little to
Little she was doing them, but in the hidden dad. […] But in the last visits it was achieved that the dad also
will incorporate and carry out the activities with the child. " (RIS)
"In Bocas del Toro we had no contact with any family father." (RIS)
“Yes I think. I had two parents among the families I attended and one of them was so integrated with their child that gave
pleasure to go to attend him and in most of the homes that did not happen, either because the man had to go to work
as the only economic support of the family or for a cultural issue, but I think that, to the extent that
We can strengthen family integration, parents will realize the importance of their figure in this
project." (NGO RIS)
(IX) “You also have to be clear if the backpack is as a boy or girl, because there were backpacks that were for a child, but the
puzzle was as a child and also the opposite. If my son is a man, then he has to play with things about
Men, I'm not going to play with skirts and things because it is clear that child is a child. ” (Mother, T)
“The puzzle came just as a child, at least the one who touched the boy and the girl. He had an image of a girl with
Faldita, sweater, all ROSADITO, but I still played without affecting. " (Mother, T)
(x) “Yes it helps us a lot because we bought their little things and leaves us more calmly to attend the child who is in
stimulation. " (Mother, T)
“An evaluation should be made to the families of children who are going to enter the program to be beneficiaries of
Network of opportunities or senapan to have their children to nurture. ” (RIS)
“Yes because that could help in communication to be able to acquire cell cards, or then I could improve the
food, which would contribute to moms doing things with more disposition, more effective. ” (RIS)
“There were very few who received a subsidy, if perhaps, about five of the sixties who participated. Those who received it
They put more effort in project activities […] ”(RIS)
(XI) “The cases of children with special needs that we find as blind children or with cerebral palsy to the
that the backpack could not cover were channeled to seek help for such situations. In those cases
Mides sought the link with the Ministry of Health or other institutions […]. The RIS were like captors of
serious situations that had never been treated and through this process it was possible to find help. ” (Dispros
central level)
“[…] For example, in the province of Herrera, I went to the health center that attends all that area and talked with
The medical director and realized that he did not know all that, so we invited them to participate and they were integrated
to the process. " (Dispros, central level)
“That occurred in a positive percentage because we could even detect families that needed nutrition for le
child, low weight children, others who were missing some medical exams, so we made the connection
With the Ministry of Health and in some cases attention could be performed, in the same way, in relation to food
We were able to involve them in family orchard programs so that they themselves take care of their own development
Family integral and thus channel the issue of nutrition. " (Regional Director)
“[…] There is now the link with the Minsa, with which we have made the beneficiaries obtain exams or
Free studies through home visits, medical tours. " (Regional Director)
“[…] The food part was channeled with the territorial networks program through technical support
that families were given so that they could produce their own food. ” (Regional Director)
“With a multidisciplinary team made up of early stimulators, teachers, psychologists and workers
social, we took the opportunity to capture if the beneficiary children had received adequate health care at their age and
We end up discovering several cases of children with autism or malnutrition, for example, without parents
They knew. […] Through this program we can capture all these cases and in doing so we have the possibility of
Raise social reports and touch many institutions to advance and channel those cases […]. ” (Regional Director)
“The articulation is easy because these programs are MIDES too, this is a very complete institution, the
Protocol is to articulate with other institutions, if we find, for example, health problems, we register
And we pass it to Minsa, if we find violence problems we pass it to Senniaf, if we detect dropout
School in children over 4 years of age we pass it to Meduca and we are articulating. ”
“Illiteracy was a great challenge because many parents and moms in the field do not know how to read or write, then
How to help the child do something they don't know how to do. So, as Mides has a program of
literacy, we take the opportunity to stay not only taking care of children but also putting together atmosphere to
Teach parents to read and write. We were also able to do articulation with health tours because we found
Children full of parasites. " (Regional Director)
“For us, the support of Minsa was strategically, which we received through the addresses
Regional, the health promoters, so that we could cross their information with ours. We also had the
IPHE support in relation to visits to families and giving us the possibility of other alternate actions
to what is the implementation of the project. " (Dispros, central level).
(XII) “There are other actors that can be involved, such as local governments, who play a very important role
Within that family and community integral development environment helping them to have a better membership
within your community through family and community integration tools. " (Regional Director)
(XIII) “For us the project has had a very important impact because we have involved the whole family, to
the community authorities, to institutions such as the Minsa and the Electoral Tribunal. On the one hand, we have
collaborated by training volunteers on child development and, on the other hand, we have worked in articulation
with the registrar that the court has in each community to keep it informed of any case of children without
record." (RIS, indigenous area)
“There was the case of a girl who lived with the 75 -year -old grandmother, who said that the mother had abandoned her and
Then the case was directed to be followed up and the mother could be contacted, which clarified that the
Grandma's version was not true and it was discovered that even the girl was in danger of some abuse situation
Sexual because most of the people who lived there were men and also with intellectual problems. Also
There were cases of children who did not appear registered and were oriented to go to the Electoral Court, some were aimed
For network of opportunities because they were very poor. " (RIS)
(XIV) “It seemed good because some of us have other commitments, 15 days was perfect because in
Those weeks we could explain to the child the tasks that the teacher assigned to us. ” (Mother Ind., T)
“I think it is enough, but more activities should be left since the activities of the guide only
allowed to leave two per fortnight and the child could get bored, so I think that the number of activities could
increase to two per week. " (RIS)
"If we had a vehicle we would go every week, but that's a limiting." (RIS)
"Once a week it would be ideal for children to make the most of." (RIS)
“In case of increasing the frequencies of visits, people who work exclusively should be available
To take care of you because we have other occupations. " (RIS)
“Definitely visits must be more frequent and if they are several days a week, much better, because to give
Continuity to the child stimulation process cannot be given such a wide margin between one visit and the other
Because the child loses a little the development of skill and that entails another type of commitment such as integrating
More people qualified to the project ”(RIS NGO)
“The biweekly frequency of visits seems good to me because our planning meeting is also biweekly and
In this way we can capture a higher percentage of development in terms of what has been stipulated
in 15 days. " (Regional Director)
“Visits must be more frequent, but what is difficult for us is transport, since communities
They are very distant and do not have many vehicles. But the ideal would be once a week. " (Regional Director)
(XV) “I feel that it lac
Learning ”(Mother, T)
“The project had a very positive impact, but one of the limitations was the short duration and covid, since many
accompaniments had to be done on the phone, approximately 15%. " (RIS)
"It should last similar to that of the school period." (RIS)
“More than the, the important thing is the quality of the content, that is, if the guide gives activities for 6 months or for 9 months,
It could be done. The problem is not in time but in the number of activities. This time the guide brought activities
As for 3 months and worked 6 months with her. " (RIS)
“It is no use to increase time if the amount of activities does not allow us to offer a good quality of attention
To the children. " (RIS)
(XVI) “I took advantage of the technicians I had here in Mides, but I also called on universities so that
Those who were finishing early stimulation career or psychology came to do their practices here.
Many people attended the call and incorporated them in this project. They were in charge of the people
Idóne of Mides, but we release them to monitor families. They did their practice and
They benefited this project. It was a fantastic experience. " (Regional Director)
“It should always be the early stimulator or early childhood teachers, but now we can no longer count
With them because the project took advantage of the closure of the CAIPI because of the COVID-19 to incorporate these professionals,
But now the CAIPI resumed activities and they returned to their functions. " (Regional Director)
“We never trained them to be stimulators, they are based on the guide guide to the
caregivers on how to proceed with those orientations to help the child. … What we could detect in some regions
It was that there were stimulators occupied in different functions, less in stimulation, so we convinced the
Regional directors to let them join the RIS team. ” (Dispros)
(XVII) "All RIS followed and continued the process in this first stage." (Regional Director)
"The staff I chose for this project has a vocation and fell in love with it." (Regional Director)
(XVIII) “Among the RIS there were people of all kinds of training, in a region, for example, only one of the six
had a higher level of education and the others had a very basic level, so they could not give them very
complicated and with many technicalities, they had to be very specific things and I think that worked. ” (Dispros)
(XIX) “Yes, it is a project that has been very well accepted in the province of Colón, although it is necessary to do some
Adaptations, such as training more RIS staff. Several of the promoters had never worked with
Children and the lack of patience was noticed. […] In addition to that more didactic material is needed for us
be able to help you make toys. " (RIS)
“One of the aspects that must improve is that the MONs are trained with much longer and in a way
permanent so that they also understand the new tools and the evolutionary process of the project and
Do not stay stagnant. " (Regional Director)
“Training for these personnel has to be integral, which is not reduced to how to capture or how to treat the child, but
How to intervene at home, because this program is very complex and it is the comprehensive family care. ”
(Regional Director)
“A new training must concentrate on the issue of early stimulation, because in cases of children with
delay in development, like speech, we don't know what to do. ” (RIS)
“Another of the points that should be treated in the training is about the treatment with the beneficiaries, that is, to be
prepared for situations where the parents visited are not in a good mood or do not want to cooperate. ” (RIS)
“In the Ngäbe region […] I feel that we lacked more training in relation to disability situations, what to do
And how to do it, because many times we do not know how to address families to understand what it is
necessary for the child to develop motor and language activities according to his age. ” (RIS, indigenous area)
(XX) Many times we had to support the promoter companions because they initially did not know how to deal with
A child of that age, then we orient them to feel safe and they were also skilled and
Now they feel stimulating and teachers. " (RIS)
“[…] We here are accounting, computer scientists and we are not in that area, there was only one laugh that was an educator and the
Children she attended were the ones who presented better results. It is important more followed supervision. "
(RIS)
(XXI) "It has instructed me much more when it comes to being able to guide parents." (RIS)
“Now I cannot stop thinking about the childhood of the people I attend when it comes to cases of abuse,
I think of all the things that were probably missing from children. (RIS)
“Now I have more knowledge that I have been able to bring for work in the caipi. I have realized that each child
It is different and each one requires a different treatment like parents. " (RIS)
"I have taken what I have learned to my house, I see my girl's behavior otherwise." (RIS)
“I gained confidence throughout the experience in the way of guiding parents on how to do activities
With the child because at the beginning it seemed very difficult for me. ” (RIS)
(XXII) "The guide has figures, colors and that is what helps one the most." (Mother, T)
"My child advanced quickly. He grabbed two stages, up to 23 months and the 23 to 36 months" (Mother Ind., T)
“We must adapt the number of activities because we fell short because there were 12 visits […], then when
The activities were over, it was necessary to feed or invent new ones because the next one could not be advanced
age range while the child was not inside it. " (RIS)
“Some children are not at the level of development suggested by the guide, each child is different and that should be
adapted to the child. Although that is one more issue of the laughter than of the material. " (RIS)
“[…] In a second phase there must be much more open tools so that these application strategies in
As for the recommended activities, they are typified in several fields so that the child opens the mind in
Your creativity and imagination. " (Regional Director)
(XXIII) “In the booklet comes the explanation of how to drill the lids of soda bottles and pass them a thread. That part
I did it. " (Indigenous mother, c)
"The guide has taught me how to educate children and how to teach them things." (Mother, C)
“My son has begun to use the cajetas and pull them as if it were a car or a truck because he sees the image in the
puzzles and I tell him how to do it. He also grabs the sticks and starts hitting as if it were a drum. "
(Indigenous mother, c)
“I read the book and guide myself as the child's age and to make toys. I made a doll with
Trapitos. " (Mother, C)
“I use it depending on the girl's age. I have not yet made any toy that the guide indicates because she is
very small yet. " (Mother, C)
“I made the necklace with soda's tapas. I pierced them with a hot bald and that day my daughter didn't want anyone to
will touch that necklace. My daughter also knows how to change clothes to the wrist as if she were a baby, she lies in the hammock,
He starts to rock and sings to her. […] ”(Indigenous mother, t)
"I constantly use it when I want to read something that I forget [...]" (indigenous mother, t)
"I took the guide for three times during the 6 -month period that the project lasted" (mother, c)
“I use it every 3 days because she also has some stimulation activities on the part of the doctor, then
Many times I combine the activities of the book that the doctor sends him ”(mother, c)
“I have honestly done any of the toys with recyclable materials recommended in the guide, but I have
seen the instructions. " (Mother, C)
(XXIV) “The content of the backpack seems good to me because the girl has learned a lot. She doesn't look like a girl of alone
Two years, she has learned a lot. " (Mother, T)
“There was part of the material that was not consistent with children, for example, colored pencils, which were very
thin Experts recommend the jumbo or triangular crayon. The pages and the
Most backpacks got rid of from the beginning. The cubes were very good, the puzzle and the book of
stories, in most cases they reached the end. " (RIS)
“The backpack was weak and broke, people lost several of the materials because of that. Textbooks,
Although there were stories, they were very basic. Books have to adapt to the age range of children, they cannot be
general and have to be varied. " (NGO RIS)
“The guide has indications for each age range, but the toys do not correspond to the activities. It is necessary
that toys are different for each age group. " (NGO RIS)
(XXV) "Some families were going to work at coffee crops to the border and there were children who lost visits." (RIS
from NGO)
“The participation of families in the Darién area was very little, some mothers did not continue to practice the
activities with the child and others hid at the time of the visit, some abandoned and had to look for them
replacement. " (RIS)
"All not, but many more than half. Sometimes because of the weather because when it rains you could not enter and sometimes
for lack of transport. In our case we could not make visits by phone because there is practically no signal. "
(Ris Bocas or Herrera)
“Yes we achieve them all. In the positive cases of COVID-19 in families, we worked through video via WhatsApp,
as well as in those who were not at anyone at the time of the visit, they were called to instructions and they were
I asked for a video as evidence of activities with the child. " (RIS)
"In the province of Chiriquí all the families that began the project culminated." (RIS)
"In the Ngäbe region none left." (RIS)
"We replaced 7 families for absence and lack of interest" (Ris Bocas or Herrera)
(XXVI) "I feel they were valuable because they reminded us of some details that could escape us." (m, t)
“On the visit she evaluated, for example, how many colors had been learned from the last visit and took a note,
He also did a survey and explained how the child's performance was going. ” (m, t)
“The moms who were given their backpack, but they did not receive a visit began to demand that they also be visited,
Some of them sent us the photos of the activities that the child did. ” (RIS)
“There are not many affective links between parents and children. There are no emotions between them and that was something that
We had to work with families, to manifest emotions through hugs and recognition of the
effort." (RIS)
“[…] That in the case of committed mothers, and the children of mothers who did not give much importance to
Monitoring were lost and did not know what to do in the most basic activities such as taking out and putting the cubes
In a vessel or did not recognize the colors. " (RIS)
“In Capira we motivated the parents telling them that they were the first teachers of the children and we talked to them
about the importance of the game in development its early development […] ”(RIS)
(XXVII) “The teacher makes a dynamic and we repeat her as if we were learning with the child, taking
The class together. " (mother)
“He did taught me. She explained to me before the next activity that would assign the child so that I would put it into practice
With my son. " (mother)
“The teacher explained how to do the activity and before the next visit I taught the child and when the
Teacher returned she practiced it with him. I also sent me to record videos when I was applying the activity
With the child. " (mother)
“[…] Visits have created a lot of connection between the teacher and the child and also with us because we are seeing
and learning with her. " (mother)
“She arrived, asked me about the child and then we went to do the activity with the child, we remembered what we were
He had done on the previous visit and well, the child played with us ”(Mother Ind.)
“We were always oriented to be more observers, who had to do the activity with the child were the parents and
One was more like a guide. Instead of telling them if they were doing it right or wrong, I did an activity with the child
as an example for parents to know they had to interact directly with the child. ” (RIS)
“[…] Every 15 days 3 activities were assigned to the parents to practice with the child until the next visit
And they were explained in detail what I had to do. If when we returned we noticed that the child had not reached the
objective proposed by the activity, then the same activity was assigned again until
I got. " (RIS)
(XXVIII) “In Los Santos, the low schooling of families and the lack of commitment of some could be identified
mothers, since despite the fact that we were lending accompaniment, it was common for a biweekly visit
And another was that the child had not done any activity, and it was not because they did not achieve it but
Because they did not help them, since the facilitators reported that when working 15 minutes with those same children,
They noticed that they quickly understood captured the information they wanted to pass. In one of the
Correction was made a workshop with healthy parenting guidelines for parents, I hope that has helped them. ”
(RIS)
“Calculation that 20% of the population that was treated presented this problem of lack of commitment to
Children's activities. " (RIS)
“In Los Santos the situation was similar, since when we were doing the biweekly visit, we asked the
Parents the backpack and many responded that they did not find it or that they had lost some materials. The percentage
Of disinterest here was between 20% and 25%. Also when we called them to confirm the following visit,
Many times they said they couldn't or had anything else. " (RIS)
“Now we have more awareness of the importance of stimulation because with my first child I did not do that, I did not have
The opportunity and with this I have realized that it has been important. " (Mother, C)
“Here in the province of Herrera I had no problems in the sense of lack of interest of the parents, they were very
Interested and supported a lot. I feel that the program is very good and comes where I must get. " (RIS)
“[…] For me it was fantastic to see the creativity that parents of different communities put to, for example,
Build a doll, that showed that there were interest that children learn and that is why I feel that the
program is spectacular. " (RIS)
(XXIX) “Illiteracy was a great challenge because many parents and moms in the field do not know how to read or write,
So how to help the child do something they don't know how to do themselves. So, as Mides has a
literacy program, we take the opportunity to stay not only attending children but Armando
environment to teach parents to read and write ... ”(Regional Director)
(XXX) “I am very satisfied. From the first moment the teacher explained the project well and every time she
I arrived again and stressed what the project was about ”(Mother, T)
"Much, a lot. I am very satisfied." (Mother, C)
"We are very satisfied with the project. We would give you a 5." (Mother, C)
"Families are satisfied, but they want more." (NGO RIS)
“I am completely sure that they were satisfied because they manifested him talking about the development of their
Children ”(RIS)
“Those who finished the project were because they saw the fruit, how the children learned and how they as mothers
They learned to play with children and teach them. " (RIS)
“All families are satisfied, even all of them asked to be taken into account in case of giving
continuity to the project. " (RIS)
“Families are satisfied. Most of them have thanked me because they see the progress of children, for having
been taken into account, since they did not receive any early childhood service and said they wish
Continue in the project once it restarts. " (RIS)
“I am well satisfied because it helped me in coexistence with both the child, we and parents, society, the
Teacher and everything. I am satisfied. " (Mother, T)
“Here in Kuna Yala we had a lot of support from families. On the first visits […] the grandmothers were very happy
With the project because they saw that the children were very lively. " (RIS Indigenous Area)
(XXXI) “It is improving giving more follow -up. I see the visit as something better because the children encourage themselves with the
teacher. […] The best is follow -up as if it were at school. ” (Mother, C)
“It would be useful to receive visits to learn how to use the manual, with the frequency they decide.” (Mother, C)
“Maybe it wouldn't have taken advantage of it so if they hadn't visited us, we would not have put so much
Employment or we had not done anything, we would have let them play there nothing. The visit is beautiful because that
motivates one. " (Mother, T)
(XXXII) “… I think it is important that the personnel who make facilitator visits must be people with a
profession, whether teachers, stimulators, psychologists, caipi teachers, etc. Many times I had to give them a lot
orientation to promoters to do the work in the best way. The detail with the promoters is also
that work in several MIDES programs and this project meant one more workload. " (RIS Link)
"The link should not be part of the RIS because it is overloaded." (RIS Link)
“I feel that when these projects aimed at these areas are going to be elaborated, personnel should be available that
Know the local problems. " (NGO RIS)
“It is important to have technicians specialized in family matters, because if the RIS does not have the
Training necessary to address specific situations, you probably will not know how to interpret it or read the
context and may think that the problem is that the family does not want to participate, but we have the support of a
Social Worker or Psychologist The RIS will feel safer. ” (RIS)
“One of the greatest difficulties in the province of Herrera was how distant some communities were
and the difficult access to them, since in the rainy season the roads become impassable by the mud. Also sometimes
We have to walk up to 3 hours to get to these communities. ” (RIS)
(XXXIII) “You have to put more personnel exclusively for the project because we have other functions
What to fulfill. " (RIS)
“[…] As this does not have any resource for personnel, mobilization, so for us it was very difficult to
Execution, because we depended on other projects to be able to execute this. Then if it is intended to replicate
It is important that the project bring resources to have promoters or some type of personnel because […] I
I had to assign personnel from other projects when they had time to make visits. […] We have the
Better willingness to help the State, but it is difficult for us to execute a project that does not bring resources at all ”(RIS NGO)
(XXXIV) “I would like the project to have other things beyond the backpack materials, something related to the
health and the condition of children because there are children who have a problem I need a type of food
special and it would be good if he had more opportunities in that. […] ”(Mother, C)
(XXXV) “I say that it should improve the quality of crayons and backpack, also the drawing notebook because
leaves get rid of easily. " (Mother, C)
“The backpack did not go very good because the day they gave it to me I hung it from a nail and broke. The toys yes
They are good. " (Mother, T)
(XXXVI) “We would help us meet other moms to make workshops on crafts and toys for children and
