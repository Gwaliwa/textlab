Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
Executive Summary
In 2019, UNICEF’s Eastern Caribbean Area (ECA) office contracted the American Institutes
for Research (AIR) to conduct an evaluation of UNICEF’s Child Friendly Schools (CFS)
framework in use in the ECA, and its version for secondary schools called Effective Schools
(ES). This evaluation was intended to inform the effective scaling and use of the CFS/ES in
the region. AIR engaged Targeted Developed Consulting (TDC) as a regional partner for this
evaluation. This document is the report of findings from AIR’s and TDC’s evaluation.
Overview of the Child Friendly Schools/Effective Schools Framework
UNICEF first introduced the CFS framework globally in
CFS/ES is not a programme,
the 1990s. The UNICEF ECA office began to promote the
but rather a framework or
use of the CFS/ES framework in the region in 2007, and
model that countries can use
it was endorsed by the Organisation of Eastern
to guide their thinking,
Caribbean States (OECS) Ministers of Education and the
planning, and programming.
CARICOM Council on Human and Social Development.
In 2014, the ECA OFFICE adapted CFS for secondary schools, under the name Effective
Schools. The CFS/ES framework is intended to help countries and schools achieve United
Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Ensure inclusive and equitable quality
education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all). In the ECA, CFS/ES was
intended to help countries and schools address poor educational outcomes (especially for
boys and for children from marginalised backgrounds), due in part to low school safety and
school effectiveness.
Dimensions and cross-cutting themes. The CFS/ES framework incorporates five key
dimensions and two crosscutting themes. The dimensions are behaviour management,
school safety and security, student participation, life skills, and inclusive education. The
crosscutting themes are gender equality and parental involvement.
How it works. At the regional level, UNICEF and its partners (OECS, CARICOM and the
University of the West Indies) provide leadership, funding, and/or technical assistance to
help countries adopt CFS/ES. At the country level, CFS/ES is promoted through CFS/ES focal
points (embedded in ministries of education), government policymakers and education
officials, teacher training institutions, school staff, parents and community partners.
Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Intended Audience
Purpose. The purpose of the evaluation of the CFS/ES framework was threefold: (1) Inform
strategic planning in the education sector across the ECA; (2) provide stakeholders with an
understanding of the effectiveness and efficiency of CFS/ES planning, implementation and
monitoring activities in the ECA, in order to update/refine the frameworks and improve
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 1
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
programme design; and (3) ensure that countries in the ECA provide students with a safe
and effective learning environment.
Objectives. The four objectives for this work were to determine (1) the effectiveness of
CFS/ES in changing education policy, practice and school culture at the central ministry and
school levels; (2) programme relevance and sustainability and the operational effectiveness
and efficiency of the current approaches, and recommend course corrections;
(3) implications and requirements for full scale-up and rollout of redesigned CFS/ES
programming within the context of wider educational reforms; and (4) opportunities,
constraints, lessons and good practices from ongoing processes.
Intended audience. The primary audience for this evaluation included governments in the
ECA and UNICEF. Secondary users included other regional actors such as the OECS
Commission, the CARICOM Secretariat and other non-governmental organizations, and
international development partners, and stakeholders from other child- and family-serving
systems at the country or regional levels.
Methodology
The research team conducted a process evaluation of the CFS/ES framework involving a
desk review, primary qualitative data collection, and extant data analysis. The summative
portion of the evaluation documented progress related to the introduction and uptake of
the CFS/ES framework, while the formative portion generated evidence-based
recommendations to improve uptake and effectiveness of CFS/ES across the ECA. The
evaluation focused on Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia. It
included 55 interviews with government officials, representatives from regional-level
organizations, education consultants, heads of teacher training institutions, and school
heads; and 53 focus groups and 10 surveys of teachers, non-teaching staff, parents, and
students.1 The evaluation also included a desk review across the region, and interviews with
CFS/ES focal points in all 12 of the regions countries/territories.
Key Findings
The evaluation addressed five areas under the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria: relevance,
coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability.2
Relevance. Countries and schools had adopted several aspects of CFS/ES, and most
stakeholders considered the programming to be necessary and beneficial. For many
stakeholders, CFS/ES was synonymous with the adoption of positive behaviour management
(PBM), rather than being viewed more holistically. Teachers and other school staff saw the

other school staff, parents, and students.

AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 2
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
benefits of promoting positive student behaviours and giving acknowledgement, and took
steps to do so. Educators thought it was important for their schools to improve safety and
address bullying.
Countries saw the value of governance, coordination, and management to promote CFS/ES
(or its elements), but faced difficulties in doing these things in practice. Where a Health and
Family Life Education (HFLE) was in use, educators and parents agreed that the topics
addressed were appropriate.
For many, “student participation” was synonymous with students signing up for activities.
Across the ECA, there was little evidence for policies related to student councils. Educators
had mixed views on whether it was appropriate for students to be given a voice or power.
And finally, inclusive education was not a priority in the region, and received little attention.
Coherence. CFS/ES programming is being integrated with other sector-level initiatives and
requirements at both regional and national levels. At the school level, there was a barrier to
the adoption of CFS/ES, in that teachers felt like it was another programme that had to be
added to their other responsibilities. They did not view CFS/ES framework as providing
better ways to do things that they were already doing, and or to help them achieve their
goals. Teachers also noted that they did not have all of the resources they needed to
increase their use of student-centred teaching or student supports. Introduction of ES into
secondary schools is currently hampered by a combination of lack of buy-in and lack of
resources. Despite these challenges, schools were making progress in adopting CFS/ES
framework. There was cross-sectoral collaboration to meet the holistic needs of children at
the national level, but there was little evidence for this at the school level.
Efficiency. There was little evidence that countries leveraged other activities to improve
adoption of CFS/ES programming. The implementation of CFS/ES framework is very focused
on national focal points and guidance counsellors and has not fully expanded to include
ownership by education systems and educators more broadly.
Effectiveness. Countries highly valued the support they received for CFS/ES at the regional
level, but lacked sufficient monetary and human resources to implement CFS/ES to the
extent that they would want. Educators also still struggled with how to implement CFS/ES
on the ground, and there were requests for additional training, technical assistance and
examples/models that could help build educator capacity.
To address student misbehavior, schools were using some PBM, but negative methods were
also much in use (especially if positive methods did not seem to work). School safety was a
concern, with students bullied by peers as well as by some teachers. Many schools
encouraged students’ heathy eating and exercise. And finally, inclusive education was not a
priority in the region, and there was little evidence that schools were promoting it.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 3
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
Across the region, students did engage in decision making in some classrooms, but most
schools did not provide opportunities for students to participate in decision making in ways
that would impact their school. There were gaps in available student attendance data.
Student attendance rates in Saint Lucia were relatively flat since the introduction of CFS/ES
framework (and the evaluation team did not have data from elsewhere), and this pattern
was the same for girls and for boys. The team was unable to identify any consistent
relationships between the introduction of CS/ES and student persistence in school.
Sustainability. The CFS/ES model is reflected in some education policies in the region, but
there are persistent policy gaps in critical areas such as positive discipline. Governments are
concerned about lack of financial and human resources to implement and continue CFS/ES
(but also miss opportunities to gain efficiencies). Countries lack effective monitoring or QA
systems, including in areas aligned with CFS/ES. This data deficit makes it difficult for
countries to make evidence-based decisions in the education sector.
Conclusions
This section presents our conclusions in reference to the relevance, coherence, efficiency,
effectiveness, and sustainability of the CFS/ES framework.
Relevance. Stakeholders at the regional, national, and school levels found the CFS/ES
framework to be relevant, and there was buy-in at all of these levels for CFS overall. On the
positive side, the framework helped countries built up their national cross-sector
collaboration in an effort to help achieve the goals of CFS/ES – however, this collaboration
did not extend to the school level, where it would be beneficial. Educators were uncertain
or had mixed views about the relevance of some aspects of CFS/ES framework – especially
in areas such as student participation and PBM.
Coherence. At the national level, the CFS/ES initiative had external coherence with other
initiatives within the education sector as well as those in adjacent sectors, such as child
protection. Some aspects of CFS/ES (such as differentiated instruction and student-centred
learning) were starting to be integrated into the curricula of teacher training institutions.
However, CFS/ES initiatives were often not coherent with other things that were happening
at the classroom level, with CFS/ES being viewed as “one more thing” for teachers to
accomplish, rather than a new way to accomplish existing work. In terms of internal
coherence, CFS/ES principles aligned with schools and teacher training institutions’ existing
efforts to adopt approaches that characterized CFS/ES principles, such as differentiated
instruction and student-centred learning.
Efficiency. There was substantial room for improvement in terms of the extent to which
CFS/ES delivered, or is likely to deliver, results in an economical and timely way. Schools
were not making efforts to leverage other activities or initiatives to promote CFS/ES-related
information or goals. As noted above, many teachers viewed CFS/ES as something extra to
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 4
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
do. This thinking made CFS/ES burdensome to some educators. In addition, school
approaches to rewarding students were heavily dependent upon costly and time-consuming
initiatives, when there are more efficient and less costly ways to recognise students.
Effectiveness. The CFS/ES initiative was beginning to be effective at changing perceptions
about the benefits of PBM – particularly rewarding good behaviour. Schools were also
increasingly using HFLE to promote student health, wellbeing, and life skills. However, there
is still substantial room for improvement in the effectiveness of the initiative – particularly
in the areas of student participation, school safety, and inclusive education. Schools were
more likely to be making progress on CFS/ES where there was strong ownership and buy-in
from the school principal and ample support by the country’s CFS/ES focal point. It was also
challenging for countries to engage in governance, coordination, and management to
promote CFS/ES (or its elements).
Sustainability. The net benefits of the intervention are likely to continue because CFS/ES is
supported by the high level of buy-in it receives across the region, combined with steps that
have been taken across the region to use CFS/ES as a foundation for cross-sector
collaboration and curriculum reform. However, lack of effective policies (especially around
appropriate discipline), lack of human and material resources, inefficiencies in
implementation, and lack of coherence with what is happening in classrooms all detract
from sustainability. In addition, lack of systematic monitoring and evaluation of CFS/ES (or
its elements) makes it challenging for countries to show progress and to make evidence-
based decisions around education programming. Fortunately, these challenges to
sustainability are things that should be addressable across the ECA.
Lessons Learned
The evaluation team learned six lessons with implications beyond the CFS/ES initiative:
1. Trust is at the core of buy-in, and educators must be provided with information from
credible sources that new approaches are a good idea and can work for them.
2. Educators may not know how to apply new methods in their own schools/classrooms
and need practical tools and solutions to do so.
3. As long as educators view CFS/ES as a “programme” that they must do in addition to the
rest of their responsibilities, there will be significant barriers to its full implementation.
4. Students need to play an active role in the creation of a safe, supportive, and inclusive
learning environment at their schools.
5. Bullying is typically viewed as a student problem, but adult behaviour and interactions
with students are equally important.
6. Educators need to know what to do when new methods do not work for all students.
Otherwise, they may default to previous methods to cope with challenges.

Recommendations
Based on the results of this evaluation, the evaluation team formulated four key
recommendations in the areas of training and technical assistance, information sharing,
curriculum reform, and monitoring and evaluation. All of these recommendations are for
UNICEF and other actors in the region (such as CARICOM and the OECS).
First, regional actors should provide countries with technical assistance to further
consolidate policy documents and draft model policies for new initiatives (such as the
establishment and functioning of student councils). Regional actors should also provide
technical assistance to help countries better align their efforts across government
ministries, non-governmental organizations, and community-based organizations. This
technical assistance would increase engagement and efficiencies for the implementation of
CFS/ES (as well as other efforts to improve children’s healthy development and wellbeing),
and improve supports for students and their families who are experiencing difficulties. ECA
countries should place greater emphasis on CFS/ES in pre- and in-service teacher
professional development. In addition, teachers could benefit from ongoing coaching on the
various aspects of the framework to (a) increase buy-in as teachers try things for
themselves; (b) help teachers determine how to adapt CFS/ES elements for their particular
classroom context; and (c) improve the extent to which CFS/ES framework becomes
ingrained in business as usual.
Second, UNICEF should engage with government for more advocacy within countries to
sensitise stakeholders across the education system (such as education officers, curriculum
officers, and senior education administrators) and in other relevant systems (such as child
protection) regarding CFS/ES framework. Additionally, the evaluation team recommends
adding deputies or assistants for CFS/ES focal points in each country. In addition, the OECS
and other stakeholders should ensure that the new OECS Learning Hub is visible to
educators across the ECA. It would be very useful for the learning hub to have information
about best practices in the implementation of aspects of CFS/ES, and educators from the
region should be encouraged to share their own best practices in the implementation of
CFS/ES framework.
Third, educators in the region were still using harmful disciplinary practices, and this issue
should be addressed immediately through the CFS/ES focal points. It is critical that
educators in the region learn that (a) negative forms of discipline such as forcing students
into stress positions are also forms of mistreatment; (b) exclusionary discipline makes
students more likely to drop out, increases community crime, and does not make other
students and teachers feel safer; and (c) “scared straight” approaches cause children
psychological harm, and tend to make their behavioural issues worse rather than better.

Fourth, CFS/ES should be integrated into curriculum reforms that are happening across the
region (and Saint Kitts and Nevis can serve as a model). Student-centred approaches should
be integral whenever countries engage in curriculum reform.
And fifth, develop a monitoring and evaluation framework that aligns with existing
monitoring frameworks developed under the Global Partnership for Education and OECS
Education Support Project as well as the USAID-funded Early Learners Programme. This
activity should be a priority, as it will give regional and national stakeholders critical
information about the extent to which approaches are working, and where course
corrections may be needed.

Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
1. Background and Context
The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) serves as an organizing body in the
region to promote knowledge sharing and provide technical assistance to its 11 member
states and has made a commitment to ensure that every learner in the Eastern Caribbean
Area (ECA) succeeds. Since 2012, the OECS has made significant efforts to streamline
education across member states, including developing core curricula at the primary level
and partially at the secondary level.3 OECS member states and territories spend an average
of 17 per cent of their national budgets on education.4,5
Despite progress in these areas, OECS states struggle with student disengagement, gender-
based differences in transition rates and poor academic performance for all students.6
Further, not all OECS member states have near-universal enrolment. For example, in
Saint Lucia, though the gross primary school enrolment rate was 102 per cent in the 2008–
2009 academic year and 101 per cent in the 2017–2018 academic year, gross secondary
school enrolment decreased by almost 2 per cent within the same decade.7 Similarly, in
Antigua and Barbuda, the gross primary school enrolment increased slightly by 1 per cent
from 2017 to 2018, but there has been a steady decrease for the past decade, with primary
school enrolment decreasing from 115 per cent in 2007 to 105 per cent in 2018.8,9 Finally, in
Saint Kitts and Nevis, the gross primary school enrolment rate in 2016 was almost 109 per
cent, and this rate has also steadily decreased since 2010 (when it was at 113 per cent).10
Across the region, boys compose more than 60 per cent of students who drop out or repeat
grades,11,12 and the ECA lacks comprehensive policies for increasing retention at the
secondary level.13 Additionally, a recent study noted that quality of education systems,
learning opportunities and learning outcomes varied across the OECS member states.14

Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
Across all three countries in this evaluation, there are gender differences within learning
outcomes. For example, there is a higher percentage of male repeaters in primary school
than females. In 2018, the percentage of male repeaters in primary schools in Saint Lucia
and in Antigua and Barbuda was 3.5 per cent (compared to females at 2.2 per cent) and 1.7
per cent (compared to females at 1.04 per cent), respectively.15,16 Similarly, in 2016, the
percentage of male repeaters in primary schools in Saint Kitts and Nevis was 2 per cent
(compared to females at 1 per cent).17 Further, the OECS member states’ expenditure on
education varied. When compared to the global average expenditure of 4.4 per cent in
2015, only Saint Lucia had above global average expenditure at 4.7 per cent of gross
domestic product (GDP). By comparison, the expenditure of Saint Kitts and Nevis was low at
2.6 per cent of GDP, indicating a decrease of almost 2 per cent from 2007 (at 4.23 per cent)
to 2015.18 The last available data for Antigua and Barbuda is from 2009, representing an
expenditure of 2.5 per cent of its GDP on education, and this rate has steadily decreased
since 2002 (when it was 3.4 per cent).19 The ECA countries and territories have lacked
policies that encourage prioritising elements of an enabling school environment, including
parental involvement, positive behavioural management, alignment of curriculum with job
needs, and adequate provisions for students with special needs.20 In addition, educational
qualifications are not well aligned to job market needs, and only one in three secondary
school students passes the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate examinations.21
To address these concerns, the UNICEF Child Friendly Schools (CFS) framework was adapted
to fit the needs of the ECA region and enhance the comprehensiveness of the framework by
merging it with the Effective Schools (ES) framework. The UNICEF multi-country programme
CFS/ES framework aims to provide a comprehensive, holistic and inclusive approach to the
provision of a safe and supportive learning environment for all students and is aligned with
other complementary international policies and frameworks (e.g., Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, Belem Do Para, Sustainable
Development Goals). The CFS/ES framework encompasses behaviour management, school
safety and security, student participation, life skills and inclusive education. In 2019, the
UNICEF Eastern Caribbean Area (ECA) office commissioned an evaluation of the roll-out of
CFS/ES Framework (see Annex A). The UNICEF ECA office selected the American Institutes
for Research (AIR) to lead this evaluation, and AIR partnered with Targeted Development
Consulting (TDC) to support this effort.

Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
The remainder of this section describes the overarching context for this evaluation, the
characteristics of education systems in the region, and the need for the CFS/ES framework
to address the issues of concern with the aim of ultimately improving student learning
outcomes.
1.1 Overarching context
The education policy environment in the OECS traditionally has prioritised cognitive skills
and student learning outcomes, whilst lacking a comprehensive approach that emphasises
the development of the whole child.22 For example, at the point when OECS member states
finalised their CFS/ES framework in 2016, none of the OECS countries had written or ratified
policies related to any of the five dimensions of CFS/ES framework, such as the provision of
safe and supportive learning environments, and most of the countries lacked a health and
family life education (HFLE) policy that incorporated dimensions of the CFS/ES framework.23
As such, the OECS struggled to offer consistent levels of quality education throughout
schools across its member states, with insufficient readiness for transition to secondary
school and fewer than 50 per cent of qualifying students enrolling in tertiary education.24
The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Secretariat has rolled out some strategies that aim to
address the whole child and school environment; for example, the CARICOM Human
Resource Development 2030 Strategy aimed to guide and support member states to
enhance the participation of CARICOM member states in the 21st century societal,
economic and political sphere.25 The strategy also includes guidelines for the development
of the ‘Ideal Caribbean Person’ to participate actively in citizenship education and enhance
individual potential.26 One of the main targets of the 2030 Strategy includes reforming the
basic education system to reduce inefficiencies, provide better lifelong learning
opportunities for all students, incorporate gender equality within the learning
environments, and develop the skills that students need to participate in the 21st century
economy and gain adequate employment.27 These targets for the development of an ‘Ideal
Caribbean Person’ are well aligned with the purpose and goals of the OECS regional
education sector strategy, which has a goal that every learner succeeds, and it also aligns
with the goals of the CFS/ES framework, which is to help children reach their full
potential.28,29,30

Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
1.2 Context in schools
A recent review of the quality of education across the ECA highlighted the key role played by
the school’s psychosocial environment for student outcomes, and specifically mentioned
the disproportionate allocation of lower-performing students to schools with poor
conditions for learning, such as disrespect, violent discipline and low expectations.31 These
conditions adversely affect students, often leading to poor performance, learning outcomes
and, subsequently, grade repetition and increased school dropout rates. A study conducted
on out-of-school children across seven countries in the ECA emphasised that the risk of
children dropping out can be due to a range of experiences, such as academic breakdown,
bullying at school, lack of emotional safety and/or poor quality of learning experiences.32
Further, over-age children suffer from stigma of being a retained student in a lower grade
and bullying from peers, which further contribute to increasing levels of indiscipline in
schools and a higher likelihood of dropout.33
These issues are especially acute for boys at the primary and secondary school levels, as well
as for students from economically and socially disadvantaged backgrounds,34 in which low
parental involvement or at-home violence can further stratify some students.35 A 2017
International Labour Organization review of child labour indicated that in Saint Lucia, on
average, boys recorded a 25 per cent higher risk of dropout than girls over a 10-year
period.36 Additionally, a larger number of boys are out of school in Antigua and Barbuda. For
example, in 2017, 170 boys were out of school compared to 60 girls.37 The Ministry of
Education, Saint Kitts and Nevis also reported that between 20 per cent and 31 per cent of
children who enrol in secondary schools are likely to drop out, even though there are
universal transition rates for children from primary to secondary schools.38,39 Similar to the
other two case study countries, boys were at a higher risk of dropping out than girls. For
example, in 2015, only 58 per cent of boys enrolled in tertiary education compared to 115
per cent of girls, indicating a large gender difference in secondary school dropout and/or
repetition rates.40

Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
These challenges are further compounded by a lack of teachers who are trained in effective
and child-centred approaches to learning. Literature consistently shows that corporal
discipline negatively affects both the psychosocial environment and the school climate and
contributes to negative psychosocial and learning outcomes amongst students.41,42
However, because education practitioners and OECS policymakers traditionally have
regarded corporal punishment as an effective form of discipline, teacher training does not
include approaches to Positive Behaviour Management (PBM) that can help reduce the use
of violence in the classroom.43
And finally, natural disasters in the region (such as hurricanes, flooding and earthquakes), as
well as the current COVID-19 health emergency, can create significant issues of stress and
trauma for students, educators and communities – making it more difficult for schools to
function well and for students to remain engaged and learn.
1.3 Rationale for the intervention
To address these challenges, the OECS adapted UNICEF’s global CFS framework and
enhanced the comprehensiveness of the framework by merging it with the ES framework.
The CFS framework is for early childhood and primary schools, whilst the ES framework
concentrates on secondary schools.44 Ultimately, the CFS/ES framework aims to create a
learning environment that enables all children to reach their full potential.
The CFS/ES framework recognises that the quality of teaching and learning is dependent on
the physical, psychosocial and emotional conditions in schools.45 The model also adopts
guidance from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and aims to adopt a
rights-based approach centred on the interests of the child; thus, student voices are
considered in the process of developing approaches to education. The framework has been
gradually rolled out across schools in the ECA region since 2008, with approximately
55 per cent of primary schools and 38 per cent of secondary schools reporting that they
have implemented components of the CFS/ES framework as of December 2016.46
1.4 Rationale for the evaluation
Since its introduction in the ECA in 2008, the CFS/ES framework has become increasingly
mainstreamed within and across the region’s education systems and policies.47 A variety of
actors from governments, civil society groups and multinational organizations have been

using the CFS/ES framework as a basis for strengthening education sector development and
reform. However, there has not yet been a formal evaluation of the implementation of the
framework or the effects of its implementation in the region. At this juncture, it is essential
for UNICEF and national Governments to evaluate the extent to which CFS/ES has become
mainstream in education systems, its appropriateness for the context and the effectiveness
of its strategies. It is also important to consider the extent to which current levels of support
from UNICEF, national Governments and other development partners for CFS/ES are
sufficient for the framework to be effective. Further, it is important to identify effective
approaches for scaling up, as not all government schools have been reached within
countries. This information will guide the effective expansion of CFS/ES in the region.
2. Object of the Evaluation
This section describes the purpose and nature of the CFS/ES framework, articulates the
CFS/ES objectives and object/theory of change, and describes the implementation of CFS/ES
in the region during the period from 2007 (the beginning of the initiative) to 2020.
2.1 Purpose and nature of the CFS/ES framework
The CFS/ES framework was created to drive effective education reform in the ECA, helping
schools achieve Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Ensure inclusive and equitable quality
education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all).48 As noted in Section 1.2, the
region has struggled with low educational outcomes such as grade repetition rates and high
secondary school dropout (especially for boys and for students from marginalised
backgrounds), due in part to poor conditions for learning (such as harsh disciplinary
practices).
2.1.1 Where did the CFS/ES framework originate?
At the global level, UNICEF created the CFS framework in the mid-1990s and by 2000 was
promoting the provision of a quality, rights-based education.49 At the Caribbean sub-
regional level, the CFS framework (which in 2014 added the ES element for secondary
schools) was a logical fit for the kinds of changes that were required to improve schools in
the ECA. The framework was promoted in 2007 by the UNICEF ECA Office and endorsed by
two key regional bodies: the OECS Ministers of Education and the CARICOM Council on
Human and Social Development.

2.1.2 What are the objectives, principles, and areas of focus for the CFS/ES
framework?
The CFS/ES framework includes six objectives and 10 guiding principles,50 to be applied
across five dimensions that have two crosscutting themes. During the inception phase, the
evaluation team was unable to identify any documentation or model that articulated exactly
how these objectives, principles, dimensions, and themes should all fit together, and there
were inconsistencies across documents. For example, the UNICEF-issued guide for CFS-
implementing teams lists just three principles.51 In addition, the current list of objectives
contains both process elements (what activities should take place) and desired outcomes as
a result of those activities. Therefore, this evaluation was an opportunity to provide a more
coherent and comprehensive framework, being utilised by stakeholders.
Objectives. The six CFS/ES framework objectives are:
1. To improve the quality of education in the region through (a) the provision of equal
opportunities for all students; (b) the creation of safe and secure learning environments
for all students, where positive behavioural practices and healthy lifestyles are
promoted; (c) student participation; and (d) the promotion of life skills;
2. To create positive, safe, healthy learning environments where all learners can reach
their full potential;
3. To facilitate greater governance, cohesion, relevance and effective management of
education using a collaborative, community-based approach;
4. To assist ministries of education in understanding more fully what measures should be
put in place at central, district and school levels to help schools become more child
friendly and effective;
5. To develop and/or improve national CFS/ES policies in member states; and
6. To achieve national educational goals.
Guiding principles. In seeking to fulfil these objectives, the CFS/ES framework operates
under 10 guiding principles. These principles reflect the values of key global frameworks
(such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities, and the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women),
and ECA regional frameworks such as CARICOM’s HRD Strategy 2030 which outlines an Ideal
Caribbean Person. According to the 10 principles, the CFS/ES framework seeks to:
1. Respect the rights of every child;
2. See and understand the whole child, in a broad context;
3. Be child centred;
4. Promote quality learning outcomes;
5. Be relevant;
50 Note that some documentation only specifies three guiding principles.
51 UNICEF Eastern Caribbean Area Office, 2017.

6. Be flexible and inclusive, provide equal opportunities, and respond to diversity;
7. Promote mental, emotional and physical health;
8. Promote affordability and accessibility of opportunities;
9. Enhance teacher capacity, morale and commitment; and
10. Build strong partnership and collaboration.
The CFS/ES framework implemented in the ECA incorporates five key dimensions and two
crosscutting themes across the five dimensions.52 Countries, their education systems and
individual schools need not focus on all five areas simultaneously or equally. Rather,
education stakeholders may choose to focus on some areas more than others (see Section 2.3
for more information on implementation).
The CFS/ES framework incorporates the following key dimensions:
1. Behaviour Management: The framework aims to transform the use of current, negative
disciplinary strategies (such as corporal punishment) from reactive to proactive through
the use of preventative measures and PBM interventions.
2. School Safety and Security: The CFS/ES framework expanded school safety and security to
include both traditional physical concepts of safety (such as safety from natural disasters
and fires) and safety and security in relation to intellectual, psychosocial, and emotional
aspects.
3. Student Participation: The student participation dimension of the CFS/ES framework aims
to actively engage students in decision-making activities within schools and to strengthen
student participation through school management roles and student councils in order to
help develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they need to participate in
society.
4. Life Skills: The life skills dimension promotes the development and adaptation of life skills
that enable students to maximise their own potential, respond to the needs of society,
maintain healthy lifestyles and interpersonal relationships, and gain skills for economic
and personal well-being.
5. Inclusive Education: Inclusive education takes into account the strategies and elements
required within the broader education system to achieve social equity and provide all
students with the means to achieve their learning goals, irrespective of a student’s
circumstances and status, such as disability, gender and socioeconomic conditions.
Cross-cutting themes. Further, these five dimensions incorporate two crosscutting themes:
gender equality and parental involvement. The definition of ‘gender equality’ includes the
Gender Implementation Guidelines developed by the Caribbean Development Bank.53 These
guidelines inform the promotion of gender equality in education sector planning. According
to the CFS/ES framework, the crosscutting theme of gender equality is intended to eliminate
gender disparity in general across levels of education, and to focus on (a) eliminating
underachievement of male students, (b) increasing enrolment of male students in secondary
and tertiary education, (c) encouraging the participation of both males and females in

decision-making and leadership roles at school, (d) promoting a learning environment that is
equally safe for boys and girls, and (e) promoting gender-responsive HFLE. In the area of
parental involvement, the four areas of focus are to (a) raise parents’ awareness of their
children’s learning and behaviour, and how they can help; (b) provide support for parents
whose children have special educational needs; (c) eliminate misunderstanding and
suspicion between schools and parents; and (d) use parents as a resource for improving
student performance and promoting a safe learning environment.54
2.1.3 Who is involved in the implementation of the CFS/ES framework?
Both regional and country-level entities are involved in the implementation of the CFS/ES
framework. At the regional level, UNICEF’s ECA office provides leadership, funding and
technical assistance. Other key regional partners include OECS, CARICOM, UNESCO, and the
Caribbean Development Bank. These partners provide additional support to countries in the
region to facilitate development of their education systems in a manner consistent with
CFS/ES principles.
To help teachers in the region develop the right capacities to implement CFS/ES, UNICEF
engaged two respondents from a teacher training institution (University of the West Indies
School of Education, Cave Hill) to incorporate CFS/ES principles and skills into associate
degree programmes in teacher education.
In Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Lucia, and Saint Kitts and Nevis, CFS/ES is promoted through
the actions of teacher training institutions, UNICEF CFS/ES focal points (embedded in
ministries of education), government policymakers and education officials, school staff,
parents and community partners. Specifically, teacher training institutions at the country
level support implementation through adopting curriculum/teaching approaches in
alignment with the CFS/ES principles. The CFS/ES focal points provide advocacy and
leadership to promote CFS/ES in each country. Government policymakers and education
officials are involved in developing legislation involving the CFS/ES principles. School staff,
parents and community partners support implementation by adopting CFS/ES principles at
the school level and within the community. Further information on the responsibilities of
partners is included under Implementation in Section 2.3.
2.1.4 How is the CFS/ES framework implemented?
The CFS/ES framework does not involve a rigid set of requirements or activities, and it does
not specify how the framework should be implemented. Rather, it provides guidance at the
regional, national and school levels to help education systems move towards the provision
of safe and supportive learning environments. CFS/ES implementation starts with (A)
capacity building in areas such as (1) monitoring and supervision in schools, (2)
communications to support behaviour change, (3) policy reform/development, and (4)
material support. The implementation of CFS/ES involves the provision of (B) guidance and
54 Chitolie-Joseph, Esther, 2016.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 16
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
technical assistance to the ECA countries through regional entities such as OECS, CARICOM,
and UNICEF. Within countries, CFS/ES is introduced and adopted through (C) leadership by
the Ministry of Education to (1) create/adjust policies and support schools, plus through
collaborative efforts from country-level entities, such government units, civil society groups,
teaching institutions and parent–teacher associations. In addition, CFS promotes (D)
community and parental involvement in creating a safe, healthy environment for children
both in and outside of school.
2.1.4 How much have stakeholders invested in the implementation of the CFS/ES
framework at the regional level, and in the three study countries?55
At the regional level, UNICEF ECA reported investing $1,580,599 in CFS/ES programming
from 2012 to 2019. These funds were used towards different objectives and initiatives of
the CFS/ES programme and included:
• $239,000 for the University of the West Indies for advocacy, training, engagement of
teachers’ colleges and documentation (2013–2017);
• $232,974 to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for
advocacy and coordination (2015–2019);
• $186,825 to regional-level consultancies for technical support in training and policy
development (2013–2019);
• $240,000 to country focal point meetings for planning, monitoring and sharing best
practices (2012–2019);
• $125,000 for sub-regional training of trainers (2012 and 2017); and
• $556,800 for UNICEF technical support in the form of planning, coordination, technical
guidance, advocacy and fund-raising (2012–2019).
Across the three evaluation countries, UNICEF’s investment in CFS/ES was $617,866 (2012–
2019; see Table 1). This total includes $478,322 for capacity and policy development plus
advocacy, and $138,914 for communications for development.

2.2 Theory of change for the CFS/ES-project in the Eastern Caribbean Area
The CFS/ES framework is intended to drive improvements in the extent to which schools in
the ECA provide a safe and supportive learning environment and, ultimately, result in better
academic outcomes for students.
The evaluation team’s evaluability assessment showed that the CFS/ES framework can be
evaluated, but not in the same way one would evaluate a defined programme. Countries
and educators adopting the CFS/ES framework receive expert guidance and technical
assistance materials (such as UNICEF’s 2017 Implementing CFS Framework in Eastern
Caribbean Schools: A guide for CFS Teams)56 to show them how they can create change, but
there is no set program with a scope and sequence of steps. Each country can determine
how best to use the CFS/ES framework, materials, and technical assistance to address
regional and national priorities. Therefore, our evaluation focused on how, how much and
how well countries have used the framework to drive improvements in education, rather
than levels of compliance or success against a set of defined activities.
The evaluation team was unable to locate an extant theory of change for CFS/ES, and
therefore constructed one for this evaluation in collaboration with the UNICEF ECA office
based on the region’s strategies to facilitate CFS/ES (drawn from a combination of OECS
regional strategies and the CFS/ES list of objectives), the five dimensions of the CFS/ES
framework, the two crosscutting themes and the ultimate goals for students in the region –
as articulated in multiple CFS/ES-related documents (see Figure 1).57 This theory of change is
more conceptual than operational in that the exact areas of focus, inputs, activities and
sequences will vary based on the needs and priorities of individual countries (and then the
needs of individual schools within those countries). As shown in the theory of change,
implementation of the CFS/ES framework involves implementation of the framework’s
inputs (far left box in the model),58 in line with the CFS/ES guiding principles, which will then
lead to (1) PBM, (2) school safety, (3) inclusive education, (4) life skills and (5) student
participation. The model assumes that success in these five outputs will result in child
friendly/effective schools (outcomes), which in turn will lead to positive impacts on
engagement, persistence, and performance for all students. The documentation for this
model does not specify a sequence for addressing these five dimensions, but rather leaves it
to each country or individual school to identify the most needed supports in their context.59
The crosscutting themes of parental involvement and gender equality are integrated
throughout the implementation and effects of the CFS/ES framework. Following the theory

58 This theory of change includes only those activities associated with strategies (activities/approaches) that are intended
to drive programming (and excludes the objectives related to goals).
59 In the course of the study, the team will learn more about the areas in which countries/schools are focusing their efforts,
whether they roll out support for various dimensions together or in sequence, and so forth.

of change figure and a list of underlying assumptions, the report further articulates what
one would expect to see if this framework were being applied successfully.
Figure 1. CFS/ES Theory of Change (Created for Purposes of This Evaluation)
Several assumptions underlie this theory of change – that is, these assumptions will need to
be met for CFS/ES to be (fully) effective:
• The inputs are implemented as conceptualised;
• Providing these inputs will create an enabling environment for the introduction of
CFS/ES programming into education systems;
• Since the introduction of CFS/ES programming, how schools operate would not change
significantly in any ways that affect elements of the model (i.e., other forces would not
be acting on the same elements as the CFS/ES framework);
• The model is implemented in an enabling context (e.g., receptivity, adequate funding);
• Implementing the framework will have a positive effect on the extent to which schools
provide a safe and supportive learning environment; and
• If schools provide a more safe and supportive learning environment, student
engagement and achievement also will improve.
If the CFS/ES framework and this theory of change work as intended, even with variation in
implementation approaches, one would expect to see the following. The evaluation matrix
provides specific indicators aligned with each of these criteria (see Annex B).
• Understanding and use of the CFS/ES framework drives change.
• Stakeholders perceive the CFS/ES framework as relevant to their goals.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 19

• Schools using the CFS/ES framework are inclusive and promote equity in participation,
recognition, and the provision of a safe and supportive environment.
• The CFS/ES framework is implemented in alignment with contextually appropriate
norms, goals, and values.
• The CFS/ES framework is implemented in alignment with other national/school-level
initiatives and classroom norms and standards.
• The CFS/ES initiative fits within existing structures, shares existing resources, and adds
value to other education initiatives.
• CFS/ES activities are designed and implemented in alignment with the objectives as laid
out in the framework.
2.3 Implementation
The CFS/ES framework is in use to some extent across all 12 countries and territories under
the UNICEF Eastern Caribbean Office Multi-Country Programme of Cooperation.60 Ideally,
national education sector strategies and plans are aligned with OECS Regional Education
Strategy (which includes CFS/ES), creating regional coherence whilst allowing for country-
specific variation.
As countries adopt CFS/ES, implementation starts with capacity building in areas such as
monitoring and supervision in schools, communications to support behaviour change, policy
reform/development, plus material support. The implementation of CFS/ES involves the
provision of guidance and technical assistance to the countries and territories through
regional entities such as OECS, CARICOM, and UNICEF. Within countries, CFS/ES is
introduced and adopted through leadership by the ministry of education to create/adjust
policies and support schools, plus through collaborative efforts from country-level entities,
such government units, civil society groups, teaching institutions and parent–teacher
associations. In addition, CFS promotes community and parental involvement in creating a
safe, healthy environment for children both in and outside of school.
Countries across the region are currently at different levels of implementation. For example,
in Antigua and Barbuda and Saint Lucia, the implementation of the CFS/ES framework
started in 2008. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and in Saint Kitts and Nevis,
implementation started in 2012. The 12 countries and territories in the region have
provided capacity development strategies to school-level actors such as principals, teachers
and guidance counsellors. The UNICEF ECA has supported these countries by establishing
CFS monitoring teams to supervise (a) implementation practices in schools; (b) coordinated
communications between country-level stakeholders such as policymakers, (c) Ministry of
Education officers and other education partners in developing Communication for
60 The 12 countries/territories are Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, Saint Lucia,
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, British Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos, and Trinidad and Tobago.

Development materials; (d) and established other guidelines for schools to implement the
CFS/ES framework. Further, schools in each country were also at different levels of
implementation. In addition to receiving technical assistance from UNICEF and other
partners, schools took different levels of ownership of the framework and implemented the
elements of the CFS/ES framework that best worked for them. However, there were some
common implementation approaches that emerged across Antigua, Saint Lucia and Saint
Kitts and Nevis, such as the development of a rewards system to implement positive
behaviour management (see Annex J). As of 2017, the UNICEF regional office reported
implementation of the CFS/ES framework in 55 per cent of primary schools and 38 per cent
of secondary schools across the Eastern Caribbean region and reported reaching almost
90,000 students.61 The following table presents the details the rollout of CFS and ES
frameworks by evaluation focal country (see Table 2).

3. Purpose, Objectives and Scope
This evaluation was guided by the purpose, objectives, and scope set forth in the ToR
developed by the UNICEF ECA office for this evaluation (see Annex A).
3.1 Purpose of the evaluation
The purpose of this evaluation was to inform strategic planning in the education sector
across the region, including the effective scaling of CFS/ES across the region’s 12 countries.
The evaluation was undertaken with the goal of understanding the effectiveness and
efficiency of CFS/ES planning, implementation and monitoring in the Eastern Caribbean, in
order to update/refine the framework and improve programme design, and ultimately to

ensure that countries in the region are on the right track in terms of providing a more safe
and supportive learning environment for all students.
This evaluation was both summative and formative. On the summative side, the evaluation
documented progress in relevant policies, practices and effects related to the introduction
and adoption of the CFS/ES framework. The evaluation provides a detailed picture of CFS
implementation in the region, based on the combination of regional-level information and
the three country case studies. On the formative side, the evaluation offers evidence-based
recommendations to improve the range and efficacy of programmatic and policy
approaches to CFS/ES. The evaluation should inform both strengthening of the framework
and its implementation and further scaling of CFS/ES across the ECA. The evaluation was
primarily qualitative and employed in-depth data collection in three countries, interviews
with stakeholders in the other countries/territories in the region (one per country/territory),
plus regional-level information.
Three uses for this evaluation are specified in the ToR:
1. The evaluation will provide regional- and national-level stakeholders (such as UNICEF,
the OECS and governments) with an in-depth understanding of the achievements and
challenges associated with the scaling and mainstreaming of CFS/ES policies,
approaches, and practices. This information will guide further development and
implementation of the CFS/ES framework at both the regional and country levels.
2. The evaluation will help regional- and country-level stakeholders understand how to
integrate improvements in programme design, implementation, coordination, and
monitoring to maintain and enhance the CFS/ES framework’s relevance, coherence,
efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability.
3. Stakeholders are expected to use the evaluation findings to (a) support the scale-up of
CFS/ES programming at the regional and national levels, and (b) catalyse national
discussions regarding the reform of relevant educational practices.
The end users for this evaluation include governments, UNICEF, other actors in the region
(such as the OECS Commission, the CARICOM Secretariat and other non-governmental
organizations and international development partners) and potentially stakeholders from
other child- and family-serving systems at the country and/or regional levels.
3.2 Evaluation objectives
This evaluation focused on three countries and covered three UNICEF programme cycles at
the ECA regional level: (a) 2007–2011, (b) 2012–2016, and (c) 2017–2021.62 It is intended to
provide UNICEF with comprehensive information regarding the extent to which the
strategies promoted by CFS/ES (as described in Section 3 above) have been rolled out and
are being integrated into education systems. This involves understanding the extent to
62 This UNICEF region does not have individual programming cycles at the country level that differ from the regional ones.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 22
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
which facilitation strategies for CFS/ES have been carried out, CFS/ES is being adopted by
schools, implementation of CFS/ES has helped schools provide a safe and supportive
learning environment for all students, and providing that safe and supporting learning
environment is having a positive effect on student engagement and outcomes. In
considering these elements, it is important to learn about the enabling environment (such
as buy-in, funding availability, and the adequacy of technical assistance) as well as barriers
to and facilitators of adoption, changes in schools, and changes in student outcomes.
The ToR specifies four objectives for this work.63
1. Determine the effectiveness of CFS/ES in changing education policy, practice and school
culture at the central ministry and school levels. The evaluation will document results
achieved and the changes that CFS/ES produced at the school level as well as in the lives
of the most vulnerable and marginalized students.
2. Ascertain the programme relevance and sustainability and the operational effectiveness
and efficiency of the current approaches including programme focus, design, delivery,
coordination/partnership, institutional capacity, and monitoring mechanisms. Propose
programmatic and operational improvements to strengthen the benefits for all students,
teachers, and the wider community, with an emphasis on the most vulnerable and
marginalized students (including those with special needs).
3. Identify implications and requirements (institutional capacity, coordination mechanism,
costs, etc.) for full scale-up and rollout of the redesigned CFS/ES programming within the
context of wider educational reforms.
4. Identify opportunities and constraints from current programming thrusts and draw
lessons and good practices from ongoing processes in the selected countries to move
towards strengthening school climate, school persistence (versus dropping out), and,
ultimately, educational, and behavioural outcomes.
The ToR states that evaluation findings will inform education approaches and management
practices to foster more inclusive and supportive school environments in which students
feel appreciated, encouraged, and supported in their development as well-rounded
individuals. These approaches will in turn influence student engagement, persistence, and
performance.
3.3 Evaluation scope
The evaluation ToR served as the basis for the thematic, geographic and chronological
aspects of the scope of work, which are elaborated in this section.
63 We have made some line edits to these objectives to match the rest of the evaluation framework but have maintained
the core objectives as presented in the ToR.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 23
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
3.3.1 Thematic scope
This evaluation covered the CFS/ES framework in its entirety for both primary and
secondary government-operated schools. The evaluation looked at the relevance of the
CFS/ES framework at the regional, national and school levels; its coherence with other
initiatives within schools and across systems and programmes; its consistency with norms,
values and standards for children’s education and development; the adequacy of resources
allocated to CFS/ES and where efficiencies could be improved; the extent to which CFS/ES
can be implemented as intended; its effects on the extent to which schools implementing
CFS/ES provide students with a safe and supportive learning environment; its effects on
student engagement and success in education; and its sustainability. The focus was on
government-run primary schools that have adopted CFS. For secondary schools, ES is a new
initiative in most cases; therefore, for secondary schools, the evaluation focused on
readiness and the enabling environment for ES.
3.3.2 Geographic scope
This evaluation had both a regional and country-specific focus. We gathered data from
stakeholders who work across countries in the region, plus spoke with at least one
stakeholder in each of the region’s 12 countries and territories.
At the country level, this evaluation covered three countries: Antigua and Barbuda,
Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia64 (see Figure 2). Within each country, the team
selected schools for site visits in collaboration with the CFS/ES focal point – a representative
in each country who works directly on the CFS/ES initiative and liaises between UNICEF and
their government regarding CFS/ES. The focal points identified the schools and geographic
areas for this evaluation to reflect the diversity of their country’s experiences with CFS/ES
according to the criteria in Section 7.1, as well as to enable the evaluation team to complete
the site visits efficiently. The final sample included a total of 14 schools (see Annex D).
Antigua and Barbuda: In Antigua and Barbuda, the evaluation covered only Antigua,
because schools in Barbuda were destroyed by Hurricane Irma in 2017. Students from
Barbuda were integrated into schools in Antigua. Across the six administrative regions, the
focal points selected four schools from Saint John Parish, Saint Paul Parish, and Saint George
Parish. The CFS focal point selected two primary and two secondary schools in each location
Saint Kitts and Nevis: The evaluation covered both Saint Kitts and Nevis. Across the nine
administrative regions in Saint Kitts, the sample included one primary school each from
Saint George, Saint Paul, and Saint Peter, plus a secondary school from Saint
Thomas/Middle Island. In Nevis, the two schools were located in Saint Paul Parish.
64 During the contracting phase for this study, UNICEF ECA decided to exclude Saint Vincent and the Grenadines from the
list of case study countries based on the available resources for the evaluation.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 24
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
Saint Lucia: In Saint Lucia, the focal point selected schools from three areas: Castries, Vieux
Fort and Babonneau. The sample included three primary schools and one secondary school.
Figure 2. Geographic Scope of the Evaluation
3.3.3 Chronological scope
The ToR specified that the evaluation cover CFS/ES implementation during UNICEF’s 2007–
2011, 2012–2016, and 2017–2021 programme cycles. This is the time from the introduction
of CFS/ES in the three evaluation countries through the end of 2020. For Saint Lucia, the
framework was introduced in 2008, making the chronological scope 2008 through 2019.
CFS/ES was introduced in 2012 in Antigua and Barbuda and Saint Kitts and Nevis, meaning
the chronological scope covered 2012 through 2019. Note that historical information was
mainly gleaned from documents, and data collection was mainly focused on the present.
4. Methodology
The evaluation was designed to address the evaluation criteria, answer the research
questions, and ultimately achieve UNICEF’s objectives for this work. The team conducted a
process evaluation of the CFS/ES framework; the evaluation included a desk review, primary
qualitative data collection, and analysis of extant data. This section articulates (a) the
research questions and evaluation criteria, (b) the evaluation design, (c) data sources and
sampling, (d) stakeholder participation, (e) ethical considerations, (f) analytical process, and
(g) constraints and limitations.
4.1 Research questions and evaluation criteria
e. We then present an evaluation matrix that describes the methods by which we will
answer those questions.
The ToR listed 23 research questions, organized into the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) evaluation
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 25
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability.65 UNICEF’s evaluation
guidelines specify that the number of research questions ideally should be limited to 10. In
addition, the OECD-DAC criteria were expanded in 2019 to include the criterion of
coherence.66
Based on these considerations, we modified the initial 23 research questions to prioritize
the following 12 key questions, aligned with the OECD DAC criteria. We based these
modifications on a combination of desk review of the CFS/ES framework;67,68,69 input from
the Evaluation Reference group; and our team’s knowledge of safe and supportive learning
environments, CFS models, and the regional context for education. The research questions
are detailed by evaluation criteria below (see Table 3).

65 Based on input from the Evaluation Reference Group, we reallocated research questions from the ‘impact’ category to
the ‘effectiveness’ category, and no longer have any questions that explicitly assess impact.
66 Coherence is critical for the effective implementation of education initiatives/reforms. If an intervention has internal
coherence with other objectives and programming within classrooms and schools, then educators can more easily integrate it
within school operations. If an intervention has external coherence, then it fits well with the goals and activities of system-
level actors, such as governments and other child-serving entities.

The evaluation framework, presented in Annex C, anchors the evaluation. The framework
(matrix) is arranged by evaluation question; for each question, it specifies the judgement
criteria, indicators, sources of information, and data collection methods that the evaluation
team will use to answer the question (see Annex B). There is some variation in respondents
by country, and we have articulated the details in an annex (see Annex D). We also provide
greater detail regarding the documents and secondary data sources that we used to answer
the research questions (see Annex C).
4.2 Evaluation design
Our non-experimental, primarily qualitative evaluation design aligns with the ToR and is
consistent with the evaluation goals and the research questions. This evaluation included a
desk review, remote data collection with regional and national key informants, and
fieldwork data collection across the three evaluation countries. The team conducted key
informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) with national-level
stakeholders involved in the implementation of the CFS/ES framework; and school-level
stakeholders, such as school heads, guidance counsellors, teaching staff, non-teaching staff,
parents and students. We finalised this design in collaboration with stakeholders during the
inception phase. However, due to COVID-19-related disruptions in education systems, we
later decided with UNICEF to use an online survey in place of FGDs in Saint Lucia. We
included schools at both the primary and secondary levels and ensured that our sample
included boys and girls, as well as stakeholders from marginalised groups (such as students
who were at elevated risk for school failure/leaving). Given that we have information about
implementation from three different countries, we compared data both within and across
countries to ensure that findings reflected common experiences as well as differing
perspectives.
4.2.1 Data sources and sampling
Our methodological design is consistent with the recommendations in the ToR, with some
modifications to facilitate data collection given the COVID-19 pandemic (which closed
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 27
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
schools). This section presents our data sources and purposeful sampling strategy, which we
carried out in four phases: (a) desk review, (b) remote data collection with regional and
national stakeholders, (c) fieldwork, and (d) data analysis. We then present a description of
our quality assurance (QA) approach to this project (see Section 8). Finally, we provide a
project work plan and description of deliverables, including our approach to reporting
results (see Section 9).
Desk review. As shown in the evaluation matrix, we included both document review and
review of extant education system data to help answer the research questions. We
assembled a list of key documents and data sources that we used to answer the research
questions (see Annex C ). We obtained 85 documents from UNICEF at the regional level,
from country-level stakeholders, and from direct searches.
Sampling strategy. Our sampling strategy started at the regional level with the selection of
countries and relevant regional entities (see Annex D); then at the national level to sample
key informants and schools; and then at the school level, where we sampled administrators,
school staff, students and families. We designed our sampling approach to provide
information on:
• The use and effectiveness of the CFS/ES framework to drive improvements in education
at the regional level;
• The use and effectiveness of the CFS/ES framework to drive improvements in education
at the national and local levels;
• The extent to which school administrators are able to adopt and apply the CFS/ES
framework;
• The extent to which the CFS/ES framework reaches school staff, is acceptable to them, is
feasible, and becomes a part of how they do their work;
• Student experiences in the areas that the CFS/ES framework is meant to address; and
• Parent experiences in the areas that the CFS/ES framework is meant to address, the
extent to which parents currently find CFS/ES values and approaches acceptable, and
the extent to which the promotion of CFS/ES values drives change in key aspects of
parenting (such as use of positive discipline).
By engaging with these diverse stakeholders, we followed the implementation of CFS/ES
from the regional levels to the national and school levels to identify challenges, facilitators,
and bottlenecks. Because secondary schools are just starting to engage with the ES
framework, we also focused on the enabling environment for future adoption or expansion
of the framework.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 28
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
The evaluation team collected data in three countries identified in the ToR: Antigua and
Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia (see Table 4).70 The countries captured a
diversity of experiences with CFS/ES implementation, including timing. Within each country,
we conducted KIIs with national-level stakeholders (such as CFS/ES focal points, education
officials, and heads of teacher training institutions). Table 4 shows the final sample.

School selection. The evaluation team selected four schools for site visits in each country,
with a mix of primary and secondary schools. In each country, the CFS focal point
purposefully selected primary schools that had a history of poor conditions for learning and
that varied in the extent to which the CFS/ES focal point perceived that they had improved
since the introduction of CFS. Variation in the level of improvement was important for
understanding a range of barriers and facilitators of implementation. Because schools at the
secondary level had not yet begun to implement the ES framework (or were in the early
stages, as in Saint Lucia), the country’s CFS/ES focal point recommended schools that were
70 The ToR also included Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, but this country was dropped from the sample during the
contracting phase based on the availability of resources for this study.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 29
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
struggling to provide good conditions for learning (such as a safe environment). Note that
the evaluation team did not intend for the sample to be representative, but rather
purposely selected a combination of schools that the team felt would be most informative
given the research questions and objectives for this work.
Sampling within schools. In Antigua and Barbuda, and in Saint Kitts and Nevis, we
conducted KIIs with school heads and guidance counsellors and FGDs with teachers, non-
teaching staff (e.g., bus drivers, custodians, canteen workers, security personnel), parents,
and students (separately for girls and boys). In Saint Lucia, we conducted KIIs with school
heads and guidance counsellors, and used online questionnaires to reach teachers, non-
teaching staff, parents, and students.71 For student sampling, we asked schools to help
select students who were at elevated levels of vulnerability and risk due to issues such as
poor attendance or poor academic performance. Such students tend to be more sensitive to
and influenced by their psychosocial environment and therefore are the least likely to thrive
in school.72 Similarly, for the parent FGDs, we included parents who were not involved in the
school, and whose children had average or lower levels of success. This parental FGD
composition would inform the reach and acceptability of the CFS/ES initiative for all parents.
4.2.2 Instruments
We designed seven KII protocols, eight FGD protocols, and 10 questionnaires based on the
evaluation matrix and in consultation with UNICEF staff based in the ECA region. Each
protocol began with a description of the evaluation, details of participation, a discussion of
use of data and confidentiality, and a request to audio-record the KII or FGD. The evaluation
team also discussed ground rules for FGDs (such as keeping what others say private).
Protocols included a stopping point before beginning to gain assent for participation and
permission to audio-record.
Given the holistic nature of CFS programming, the protocols for primary school teachers and
primary school non-teaching staff were quite long. To ensure that there was enough time to
gain in-depth information on each of the topics, the evaluation team split the protocols so
that respondents covered a portion of the FGD protocol questions at each school, and all
questions were answered across all schools. The split of the questions was indicated at the
top of the protocols (see Annex F ). Evaluation team members spoke to school-level
respondents at both primary and secondary schools. Focus groups included a mix of boys
and girls.
In Saint Lucia, the evaluation team developed questionnaires that included both closed and
open-ended questions. Questionnaires were only conducted in Saint Lucia in lieu of KIIs and
FGDs. We attempted to balance gaining in-depth information with not overburdening
71 As noted above in section 4, because of COVID-19-related school closures in Saint Lucia, we were unable to conduct
focus groups, and instead used online questionnaires to reach participants.

Influences in School Contexts, edited by Kathryn R. Wentzel and Geetha B. Ramani, Routledge, New York City, pp. 384–404.

participants. We ensured that the reading level and wording for questionnaires were at a
reasonable level for participants, to help ensure adequate comprehension. The
questionnaires were administered using SurveyCTO software, which enabled us to share a
survey link with each participant using contact information provided by the school. The
table below summarizes the method, respondent(s), and purpose for each data collection
tool (see Table 5). A detailed summary and the full tools can be found in the annexes (see

The in-region data collection partner, TDC, drew on its pool of experienced enumerators in
each country to conduct KIIs and facilitate FGDs. AIR conducted virtual training to inform
enumerators about the evaluation, the key objectives, and the research questions;
introduce the protocols; and emphasise data security, consent, and confidentiality. AIR and
TDC trained enumerators in gender-sensitive and rights-based approaches and providing
support to respondents who may find some topics, such as school safety, traumatic. The
team also trained enumerators on approaches that maximise the safety of the respondents
and the security of evaluation data (see Section 4.2.6). The training also aimed to ensure
that protocols were appropriate for the Caribbean context.
4.2.4 Data collection
The evaluation team carried out data collection in two phases to collect as much data as the
team could while waiting for schools to reopen (as they were closed due to the pandemic).
In Phase 1, the team completed 29 KIIs and two FGDs remotely at the regional level and
national level (through an online platform). We used the information from Phase 1 to refine
our protocols for the Phase 2 data collection at schools. We completed school-based data
collection November 2020-December 2020, involving 26 KIIs and 51 FGDs, and administered
10 online questionnaires December 2020-January 2021.
TDC worked with national-level education officers to coordinate visits and schedule
interviews so that no enumerators had to travel between countries. National education
officers used our sampling criteria to contact school principals and request their assistance
in recruiting participants for KIIs and FGDs with school-level actors (e.g., guidance
counsellors and students). Students were recruited only after a parent or guardian has
provided permission on the child’s behalf.
In each country, the evaluation team first briefed the CFS focal point at the country’s
department/ministry of education. The teams then conducted interviews with education
officials, followed by teacher training institutions. After initial interviews at the national
level, the team continued to fieldwork at the school level.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 32
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
With permission from each participant, the evaluation team audio-recorded KIIs and FGDs.
For FGDs, one data collector asked questions and another took notes. At the end of each
day, TDC uploaded audio recordings to a secure server, and then prepared transcriptions for
coding and analysis. The team used Rev to provide automated transcripts within a few hours
of audio-recording submission.73 We tested this software to ensure that it could transcribe
with reasonable accuracy English spoken in a wide variety of accents. The team reviewed
each transcript for accuracy against the original audio recording before uploading to our
secure server for analysis.
For student FGDs, we conducted separate groups for girls and for boys because (a) girls and
boys in the same school may face different psychosocial conditions and concerns, and
(b) students may speak more freely in single-sex groups. The FGDs included anywhere from
five to eight participants. Empirical research shows that three to six focus groups are
sufficient to reveal 90 per cent saturation – that is, when no new information is gleaned
from additional focus groups.74
4.2.5 Stakeholder participation
We engaged country-level CFS/ES focal points (who all worked in government education
systems) to ensure that our protocols and approaches were appropriate for their country
contexts. To answer our research questions, we engaged duty bearers such as implementing
agencies (UNICEF, CARICOM, and other partners), plus educators at national and school
levels who are (or should be) involved in the implementation of the CFS/ES framework. We
also engaged rights holders, such as students and their families. All of these stakeholder
groups made substantive contributions to the findings we present in this report.
4.2.6 Ethical considerations
AIR adhered to strict requirements for the protection of human subjects. We completed the
work in line with the United Nations Ethical Guidelines for Evaluations,75 the United Nations
Guidance for Integrating Human Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluations,76 and UNICEF’s
requirements for ethical research involving children.77 AIR’s in-house institutional review
board (IRB) approved this evaluation (see Annex H). The team considered the risks versus
benefits, gender and equality, and the use of incentives throughout the study (see Annex G).

Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
4.3 Analytical process
This evaluation included analysis of text from documents, transcripts, notes, and open-
ended questions on questionnaires; production of summary statistics from questionnaires;
then triangulation and synthesis of the data across sources.
4.3.1 Analysis of documents
The project team analysed documents using a template that mirrored the evaluation
framework, focusing on the research questions that required document analysis. A team of
coders reviewed each document, extracted text that corresponded to each indicator, pasted
that verbatim text into the template, and then summarized the key information. The
research team then reviewed the material for themes related to the indicators.
4.3.2 Analysis of qualitative data
The research team analysed qualitative data in three steps: sensitisation, coding, and
interpretation of data. We conducted data analysis using NVivo®, a qualitative data analysis
software programme.
We created a preliminary coding structure based on the theory of change, research
questions, interview protocols and memoranda of themes that emerged during data
collection. Coders then selected, read, and reread a small, representative sample of
transcripts that included a diverse set of respondents to finalize the coding structure, ensure
interrater reliability, and formulate initial themes to respond to the research question. This
coding outline served as the tool for organizing and subsequently analysing qualitative
information, but was modified as new themes and findings emerged during data analysis.
We then coded the remainder of the transcripts.
4.3.3 Analysis of Survey Data
The evaluation team ran frequency reports for the questionnaires we used in Saint Lucia.
We did not have a large enough sample size to run any statistical tests. We qualitatively
coded open-ended responses from online surveys from parents, teachers, non-teaching
staff and students in NVivo along with qualitative data from KIIs and FGDs. We triangulated
this information with closed-ended responses from the survey questionnaire, as well as
qualitative data from other locations on similar topics.
4.3.4 Data Interpretation and Triangulation
During this process of data analysis, reduction, and synthesis, we characterised the
prevalence of responses, examined differences amongst groups, and identified key findings
and themes related to the research questions. After analysing documents, transcripts and
questionnaire data, we triangulated across sources and critically reviewed the categorised
data against the research questions to create summaries of key findings. We compared the
findings across respondents (for example, whether boys and girls shared similar
experiences), within countries, and across countries to understand any common trends in
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 34
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
the region. However, the generalizability of our findings is limited due to our
nonrepresentative sample.
4.4 Constraints and limitations
This evaluation faced five main limitations. This section summarizes the limitations and
associated mitigation measures:
First, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted data collection. Earlier in 2020, the countries closed
their schools. By fall of 2020, schools in Antigua and Barbuda and in Saint Kitts and Nevis re-
opened but operated with a modified programme (such as split shifts). In Saint Lucia,
schools opened in September 2020 but then closed down again before we could gather data
from them. We worked with the CFS/ES focal points in each country to ensure that the team
was fully aware of any modifications to how schools were operating, and to planned
accordingly. In sum, due to the pandemic, schools were not operating as usual, and it is
possible that stakeholder input regarding school functioning was based on this unusual
situation (rather than business as usual).
Second, because this is a retrospective evaluation, rather than a quantitative evaluation
with a comparison/control group or a qualitative comparative analysis, the research team
was not able to specify the extent to which the CFS/ES caused any observed improvements
in conditions for learning or student outcomes. As noted earlier, through our approach, we
gained an understanding of whether CFS/ES was implemented as intended, whether schools
changed and whether observed student outcomes improved. This information may suggest
that the CFS/ES framework caused observed outcomes, but we can never state this
definitively (because only a quantitative impact evaluation can truly establish causal links).
In the course of KIIs, we asked system-level participants about monitoring and evaluation,
including how they know if schools are able to implement CFS/ES, if the implementation of
CFS/ES changes the school environment, and if students have improved outcomes.
Third, given the retrospective nature of this evaluation, we had to rely on participants’
memories to tell us about changes that occurred in their schools. These memories may not
be strictly accurate, and we also face the risk that school personnel have changed over time,
and that the current staff do not have historical information (or may only know it second-
hand). To address this issue, we spoke with multiple stakeholders and, where possible,
triangulated results to the extent possible with any extant data that tracked implementation
from the beginning.
Fourth, our sample was representative of the countries/territories served by the UNICEF
ECA. The evaluation sample included three independent countries (Antigua and Barbuda,
Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts and Nevis) out of eight served by the UNICEF regional office, and
none of the four United Kingdom Overseas Territories. We anticipated that our sample
would reach saturation of data in each of the three countries where the evaluation took
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 35
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
place, and that we would be able to draw indicative conclusions within each of the countries
where the CFS/ES framework was implemented, as well as identify lessons learned to
improve implementation of the CFS/ES framework and inform scaling across the region.
However, because this sample was not representative of the entire region, the evaluation
team contextualised the results and used caution when making statements about the
generalisability of those results.
Finally, within countries, our sample of schools and participants was not representative of
the country as a whole but should give an indication of implementation of the CFS/ES
framework across the targeted schools. We intentionally sampled schools in each country
that had significant difficulty in the past in terms of providing students with a safe and
supportive learning environment. Within that group, we selected a mix of schools that
noticeably improved since the introduction of CFS/ES, and schools that made less or no
improvement. We are also included only government-run schools, not private schools.
Within schools and amongst students, we intentionally sampled those who experienced
difficulties (poor attendance, behaviour, and academic progress) because we expected them
to be more sensitive to the quality of the school environment than students who were doing
well. Therefore, we efficiently crafted our sample to help us answer the evaluation
questions, but in reporting results, we must explain the extent to which results can and
cannot be generalised.
5. Findings
In this section, the results of this evaluation are specified by research questions under each
of the OECD DAC criteria. Given the holistic nature of the CFS/ES framework, there are many
areas of overlap between sections. In these instances, the report specifies cross-referencing
to minimize repetition.
OECD DAC Criterion 1: Relevance
5.1 What core features of the CFS/ES initiative should be maintained
and/or strengthened to improve behavioural and learning outcomes in the
short and long term?
As noted above, the ECA CFS/ES framework was based on UNICEF’s global framework, which
was evidence-based (see Section 2.1.1). Question 5.1 focused on whether the CFS/ES
framework has been operationalized in the ECA region in ways that are evidence-based
and/or consistent with known best practices (while still allowing for adaptation to the
regional context). To answer this question, the evaluation team examined documentation
from the ECA region related to capacity building in CFS/ES. The table below presents the
judgement criterion, indicators, key findings, and key progress for what works to provide a
safe and supportive learning environment (see Table 6).

UNICEF, CARICOM, and other stakeholders in the region have introduced various evidence-
based resources intended to build capacity in the region on CFS/ES and its specific elements.
As noted below, stakeholders strongly valued the technical assistance they received from
the regional level (see Section 5.3.1). Several regional documents present overarching
guidance on CFS/ES, such as UNICEF’s Implementing CFS Framework in Eastern Caribbean
Schools,78 its Effective Schools Framework for Secondary Schools,79 and its Effective Schools
Monitoring Tool.80 The OECS also contributed the 2009 CFS Revised Child Friendly Schools
Policy Framework.81 Regional stakeholders have provided guidance that aligned with CFS/ES
and promoted its principles, such as CARICOM’s 2019 Standards for the Teaching
Profession,82 and a 2014 article that provided the rationale for why the region needed to
continue moving toward a positive youth development orientation.83 Finally, UNICEF has
issued several publications that provide more specific guidance in priority areas, such as
PBM and the creation of safe and protective school environments.84,85
The evaluation findings indicated that schools need additional guidance on evidence-based
practices in a few areas. One critical area is around PBM, especially regarding what to do if
their initial attempts at PBM are unsuccessful in resolving challenges with students. While
educators had mostly bought into the ideas of PBM (particularly rewarding positive
behaviours), they were still using corporal punishment “as a last resort.” In addition, schools
were still using disciplinary practices that are harmful for children – although staff may not
have believed these were harmful because they did not involve physical contact with the

child. These approaches included forcing children into stress positions (such as holding their
arms above their heads for long periods of time), exclusionary discipline such as
suspensions, and the use of “scared straight” programming.
In the area of school safety, stakeholders were concerned about student bullying and were
trying to address the issue. However, the issue of teachers bullying students did not seem to
be addressed in the available materials regarding the promotion of CFS/ES (beyond PBM).
Secondary students also reported that there were issues of inappropriate touching between
boys and girls, and sexual harassment did not seem to be addressed in the available CFS/ES
materials (yet can be a common way schools become unsafe).
Countries did not seem to be prioritizing the area of inclusive education. So, it is difficult to
ascertain whether the available CFS/ES supports are well matched to country needs.
In the area of life skills, countries seemed to be introducing HFLE that was acceptable to
stakeholders. No particular gaps are apparent in the use of evidence-based practices in this
area.
Finally, educators were ambivalent about students’ participation. Students did seem to
participate at the classroom level, but there were few mechanisms for them to participate
at the school level with any real voice. There was some concern amongst stakeholders that
student participation meant the children would be in charge.
5.2 To what extent does the presence of the CFS/ES framework drive
efforts to improve the psychosocial environment in schools?
This section discusses findings related to stakeholders’ efforts to improve the psychosocial
environment in schools. The table below shows the judgement criterion, indicators, key
findings and key progress areas related to how the CFS/ES framework drives change (see
Table 7).

5.2.1 Governance, coordination, and management of school safety and security,
student participation, and life skills at national and school levels
Beyond initial introduction of the framework and some ongoing support from UNICEF, some
stakeholders expressed difficulty in ensuring a continuous focus on the CFS/ES concepts at
various levels. A respondent from OECS described the difficulty with distributing ownership
among ministries and different levels of implementation: “While we're all working towards
this, there are so many pieces of policy […] The process for policies, I think, operationally
how we put these things into our work […] is not one person, but it should be across
[actors]. We see right now, HFLE, it's actually recent in some of the school's curriculum,
but… some ministries did, and some did not promote it.”
There was some evidence from regional and national level KIIs that a consistent and
ongoing approach to implementation has been lacking at the school level, despite there
being widespread agreement with the usefulness of the framework itself. For example, a
government respondent from Grenada said, “The buy in is there, people see it as a good
thing. But a commitment to doing it scientifically and structured over time has been a
challenge.” A government respondent from Barbados described that they are working to
translate policy into practice, “We do have a policy here and administering that CFS should
be integrated and practice in school. We have a code of discipline: the code of conduct for
the schools that include how all persons supposed behave in and out in the premises,
including principals, teachers, parents, ancillary staff. So, we are getting there.”
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 39
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
5.2.2 Evidence that CFS/ES encouraged consolidation of policy documents to
support safe learning environments
The evaluation found some evidence for the consolidation of policy documents to support
safe learning environments. A key document in this area is the 2017 Antigua and Barbuda
Declaration on School Safety in the Caribbean,86 which has been signed by countries across
the region. At the national level, respondents were focused on coordination of policies
across sectors, consistent with the holistic and whole-child approach of the CFS/ES
framework. Some key informants described policy coordination among the education,
health, and social development sectors. A government education officer in the British Virgin
Islands said they had coordinated with the Ministry of Health to ensure overlap between
CFS and health policies, “Yes, there is some collaboration with the Ministry of Health, in
terms of pushing the whole idea of holistic development, for all children. So, when you look
at the Child Friendly School, and you look at the entire framework, and the policy, part of
that is developing the child holistically, including their health.”
Other key informants said they thought there could be more coordination across sectors,
especially with more resources; for example, a primary school supervisor from Antigua and
Barbuda said, “All those agencies work together with us to ensure that the holistic
development of the child is realized as best as possible with the resources, sometimes only
limited resources that we have.”
However, some evidence points to the fact that there may be a gap between the policy level
and the actual implementation of elements of the CFS/ES framework. For example, a
respondent from the government in Monserrat said, “We had a discipline policy right in the
secondary school. We had one in the primary school, but what we need to do now is tie the
discipline policy to PBM.”
5.2.3 Evidence that stakeholders reviewed policies to ensure students have
decision-making power
There was evidence that stakeholders at the regional and national levels reviewed policies
to increase student decision making power in various aspects of education. For example,
the CFS focal point from Dominica said, “We had to ensure that whatever it is that we were
doing it embrace the CFS/ES principals. So, we look at inclusive education for special
education: what do you put in place for children with disabilities? We look at sensitive and
friendly environment. So, a lot of work was done on that with the development of this plan,
which is supported by [the Caribbean Development Bank], gender sensitive component in
the development of the sector plan.”
However, some stakeholders felt that the focus on student decision making power should
be increased, which aligns with our finding that schools in the region lack of strong student

Barbuda. St. John, Antigua, Government of Antigua and Barbuda, 2015
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 40
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
councils. For example, a government representative from the government in Grenada said,
“We talk about establishing student councils, but student councils are supposed to have a
serious voice in a time like, know, as it relates to how schools are going to be structured.
What are student is inputs? But I think the policies don't usually tailor to that kind of thing,
so I think that is a major positioning resource that we need.” In addition, few stakeholders
discussed how to encourage student decision-making power beyond student councils,
suggesting that such policies are not necessarily permeating the classroom.
5.2.4 Presence of policies on structure, responsibilities, and function of student
councils
The evaluation found very little documentation of policies related to student councils and
had mixed information on the extent to which they exist. For example, in Saint Kitts and
Nevis, a CFS/ES baseline report87stated that 93 per cent of students confirmed that there
was a student council at their school, and that all teachers surveyed agreed that students
should take part in classroom management. However, there was no mention of policies
related to student councils. Likewise, a 2016 UNESCO education policy review for Saint Kitts
and Nevis made no mention of student councils.88
There were limited opportunities for students to participate in student councils, or other
opportunities for students to influence what happens at the school level (see Section
5.11.1). A non-teaching staff member from a secondary school in Saint Kitts said, “Students
do not have a voice because there is no current student body council active in the school to
highlight the concerns of students.”
5.3 To what extent do stakeholders believe that the CFS/ES initiative is
relevant to their goals for children’s education?
This section discusses stakeholders’ opinions on the relevance of CFS/ES to their goals for
children’s education. The table below shows the judgement criterion, indicators, key
findings and key progress areas on stakeholders’ perceptions of whether the framework was
relevant to contextual goals (see Table 8).

5.3.1 Evidence that stakeholders have received communication regarding the
CFS/ES framework and understand it, and that CFS/ES communication is active and
reliable at all levels
The evaluation found evidence that stakeholders had received communication about the
CFS/ES framework, but there were varying levels of ongoing communication on its
implementation. For example, a government respondent said, “The principals, especially in
the rural areas, embraced the program. And so, they were also very instrumental in the
reporting and seeking advice on wanting to know how they could improve and give more
value to their students. And we were all, we also did a lot of work, in terms of
communications. So that, too, ensure that we're all, we will always add the school's
recording, what schools were doing, best practices.”
However, the respondent referred to the communications prior to Hurricane Maria,89 and
said that the monitoring efforts had since decreased. In Saint Lucia, principals from all four
schools indicated effective communication on the CFS/ES principles from the CFS focal
point and opportunities for workshops and trainings. Two schools set up coordinating
committees which consisted of the principal, CFS coaches, and teachers. A principal
explained that the committees help the school to make collective decisions on strategies
and helped to get immediate buy-in from teachers. In the absence of a committee, the
schools embraced and incorporated CFS principles into school management and leadership
89 Hurricane Maria was an important inhibitor for much of the implementation in Dominica since 2017. Antigua also faced
challenges that resulted from Hurricane Irma, which destroyed large parts of Barbuda.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 42
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
activities. One principal also stated that the support and communication on CFS was
overwhelming, including training, resources, and ongoing support.
Further, a government respondent from Tobago said they had engaged parents on the
CFS/ES framework, “We recognize our parents to be critical stakeholders, and therefore, we
held a meeting apart from lobbying with the head of the PTA executive on the island. We
also invited a sample group of parents, from every sector of our education system here in
Tobago to a mass meeting that we held, educating the parents about child friendly schools
and effective school framework and what they ought to expect. And parents were very
excited about it.”
Many respondents seemed to focus their implementation of CFS primarily on PBM and
emphasized the implementation of other elements to a lesser extent. One respondent
government respondent said, “We've realized that CFS can be broader than behaviour
management. And it really has to do a lot with providing that safe space where students can
thrive, which is, of course, at the core of the goals of education in Dominica though, which is
that every one of us succeeds.” Another government respondent from Tobago also said that
schools were most interested in the PBM aspect, “A lot of principals, gravitated to the area
that speak to positive behaviour management. For them, a lot of it had to do with the
behaviour of students and grappling with that especially at the secondary level.”
A government stakeholder observed that it may be overwhelming for schools to try to
implement all aspects of the framework at once; the respondent said, “With each school,
they have the guidelines, they have the checklists, and they are trying to incorporate each of
the elements for full implementation. Some areas fall shorter than others.” A CFS focal point
from the British Virgin Islands similarly observed a potential challenge with the number of
aspects in the framework, despite trying to build the principles into existing initiatives; the
respondent said, “I wouldn't say they are resistant. It's just that it's a whole lot.” Some
teachers in Saint Lucia reported that they receive information about an initiative before
they get an opportunity to test or see the initiative through, including the CFS initiative.
5.3.2 Evidence that stakeholders feel CFS/ES is aligned with their goals for children
and education
There was widespread agreement among stakeholders that the CFS/ES framework
principles are aligned with their goals for children and education. One example came from
a government representative, who said, “Many of the schools that we involved, you could
tell they really liked the idea of coming up with creative ways to reward children, for good
behaviour. So, in the early phases of the program, when you visited schools, you would see
that their rewards shop was probably the point of most pride at the schools.”
Respondents from teacher training institutions indicated that CFS guidance and principles
are aligned with elements of their teaching curriculum. With regard to student participation,
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 43
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
a key informant from the Department of Teacher Education at the University of the West
Indies said, “I think it's fully in sync with what we recognize to be best practice, it's fully in
sync with what we know isn't necessary in order for students to not just learn science and
math, social studies, and so on, but to be fully rounded individuals, to be good citizens, and
so on and so forth, it's something that we embrace at least as part of the initiative.”
Although the elements of the CFS/ES framework were aligned at the institutional level,
there were challenges with ensuring CFS/ES principles were applied at the school level.
For example, a respondent from CARICOM said, “If you look at the department as a whole,
we are in complete agreement, if you sit in the class and listen to the lectures, we are in
complete agreement but what we find is, when you hold discussions with teachers, you hear
the individual differences come in. And you hear the struggles and the struggles for the
large part, they are individual struggle, not as an institution.”
In Saint Lucia, teachers indicated how useful CFS/ES approaches were (or would be) for their
school, given the local values and culture. All teachers who responded reported that it was
(or would be) mostly useful or very useful to use student-centred approaches. Nearly all
thought that it was (or would be) mostly useful or very useful for their school to (a)
encourage student participation – especially from students who may not typically
participate; (b) communicate positive behavioural expectations; and (c) develop students’
self and interpersonal relationships skills. Additionally, principals and counsellors in Saint
Lucia said the CFS and ES principles fit into the goals of children’s education, because they
provided guidelines to ensure the safety and protection of children and to stop corporal
punishment, and aligned with the goals outlined by the Ministry of Education. For example,
two principals from Saint Lucia said the framework helped schools to embrace the
development of the ‘Ideal Caribbean Person’ and shared the schools’ vision of graduating
21st century citizens. Further, amongst non-teaching staff in Saint Lucia, most thought that
it would often be useful for their school to support student protection and safety, and to
promote positive student behaviour.
5.3.3 Evidence that stakeholders have reached consensus on key elements of life
skills education
Respondents across the region said HFLE was not prioritized, and implementation varied
from school to school. A government respondent from Monserrat said the HFLE component
is still in development, and that they aimed to tie that component into the other aspects of
the framework; the respondent said, “And I think to do that we need to start with producing
a national curriculum. We have sent a request to UNICEF for assistance there.”
However, respondents most commonly noted that HFLE topics included sexuality, sexual
health and HIV, healthy eating, fitness, and environmental protection. One primary school
teacher FGD in Saint Kitts demonstrated a farther-reaching conceptualization of life skills,
including considering the self and improving interpersonal relationships, encouraging
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 44
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
students to be expressive beyond gender norms, encouraging self-awareness, and having a
nurturing approach to students.
Overall, parents and teachers agreed that HFLE classes were beneficial to students, helping
them become more well-rounded individuals by developing soft skills. According to the
teacher survey, many teachers recognized the importance of HFLE, especially given the high
rates of diabetes within the region. However, many respondents felt that life skills
education was not prioritized in the school curriculum. This resulted in some topics like
health being integrated into other subjects like social studies. When schools held separate
HFLE classes, they were often taught by guidance counsellors instead of qualified teachers.
A few teachers noted that they felt uncomfortable discussing sexual health with students.
Finally, parents believed that life skills education was valuable for their children and felt that
topics such as sexual health were appropriate for students.

5.4.1 Evidence that schools take concrete steps to ensure that all types of students
participate
FGDs respondents may not fully understand the concept of student participation, as many
referred to students taking part in extracurriculars, rather than ensuring all different types
of students participate in the classroom. FGD respondents mostly said that teachers try to
“motivate” students individually to participate, while there were few mentions of specific
tools, such as group presentations, that teachers used to encourage student participation.
Some respondents mentioned student councils as a measure to promote student voices,
though it was not clear that student councils were prevalent among participating schools.
One regional level key informant explained a potential difficulty with the concept of
participation: “This whole idea of changing attitudes and approaches and engagement with
students: this is what I found teachers and principals found really hard to do […] because
again, traditionally in our schools, our students are seen and not heard. So, to have
approaches, which allow for student voice, whether it's in the classroom, or to have student
councils, that's something completely new in many countries.” A focal point from Turks and
Caicos Islands said, “Some think you're giving the child more authority. Some teachers or
some parents may say that the child now seems to be more in control, while that is not
really the case.”
Teachers survey respondents from Saint Lucia also provided open-ended responses that
gave some insight into the difficulty with the concept of student participation. A few
teachers said that time constraints made it difficult for them to incorporate student-centred
techniques; one teacher said, “Sometimes the teachers become overwhelmed by the
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 46
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
volume of work during the process of training students differently (routines, to be in charge,
etc.) and we give up.” Teachers mentioned other challenges including varying levels of
teacher confidence in the methods and difficulty engaging shy students. One respondent
said, “Students sometimes do not have that level of confidence in themselves. It takes a lot
of encouragement from the teacher and other teachers as well to motivate the students.”
Most school-level respondents did not provide input on concrete steps available to ensure
participation of students with disabilities or who may be marginalized. A few examples
included provision of homework clinics and purchasing of food or personal items for
marginalized students. Further, responses also implied that both boys and girls had the
same opportunities to participate in activities in school.
There was more evidence of understanding of what student participation includes (including
equitable participation) among respondents from Saint Lucia than from the other two
countries of Antigua and Saint Kitts and Nevis. School-level respondents from Saint Lucia
indicated that some principals identified students who needed more support and
encouragement, such as underprivileged children and children with disabilities, and had
teachers assigned for additional support. One school also had an active program that
assessed students and provided appropriate accommodation and support. This also
included a special needs program. The same school also encouraged participation from all
students. A principal noted, “The general school ethos is to do whatever has to be done for
the students within their care. Therefore, when a student comes to the school, the school
generally accommodates and tries to cater to the needs of the student. The teachers give
them various classroom responsibilities to help as well, so that it is not seen like it is the
child from the affluent home who does XYZ.”
Additionally, a counsellor from another school said students also had the opportunity to
select a group activity of their choosing, allowing students to holistically participate in
activities of their interest. Further, about half of the Saint Lucia teachers who completed the
survey indicated that they “often” took steps to encourage participation amongst students
who may otherwise be overlooked (such as students who are not high achievers, or
students who have disabilities). Open-ended responses from the Saint Lucia teacher surveys
showed a better understanding of how to encourage student participation (see text box).
Examples from Teachers in Saint Lucia to Encourage Student Participation
• Offer students opportunities to voice their opinions on any matter
• Offer students chances to showcase their talent/creativity during lessons
• Ask students to explain their ideas
• Involve students in classroom decisions
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 47
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
• Use anonymous expression boards where students express themselves respectfully in
public
• Use role playing and group presentations
• Give students space to share their ideas with each other
• Permit students to create guidelines for the daily routine of the classes
5.4.2 Evidence that schools take concrete steps to ensure that all types of students
are recognized
Schools were engaging in student recognition activities, and some were taking steps to
promote recognition in a more inclusive way – with attention to student accomplishments
in areas beyond just sports and academics, and recognition of the positive contributions or
accomplishments of students who may be struggling in other ways. A guidance counsellor
from a secondary school in Antigua and Barbuda said that student recognition was a “work
in progress” that “needs to be recognized.”
Most schools reported that students were recognized during certifications and award
ceremonies, during assemblies, during sporting and cultural events. For example, a
secondary school implemented a “Doing Good Initiative” to encourage and acknowledge
students’ good deeds. Further, some students were recognized through a reward system,
receiving “CFS points” to exchange for treats at the school shop or receiving treats or gifts.
Saint Kitts and Nevis and Saint Lucia offered good examples of inclusive student recognition.
A guidance counsellor from Saint Kitts said that the school was referred to as the “dumping
ground,” where students who are troubled often get transferred from other schools, but
that the school then makes efforts not to overlook these students by recognizing students
who make a ‘good turn’. In addition, some parents from a Saint Kitts secondary school said
all students are recognized through a ceremony where students are rewarded for their best
attributes, thus ensuring that each student receives recognition. A primary school in Saint
Kitts also utilized social media platforms to recognize student achievements. According to
parents, this approach seemed to be an inclusive way to acknowledge student
accomplishments outside of the classroom. Similarly, a principal from Saint Lucia also
indicated that students’ accomplishments are profiled on the school’s Facebook page. The
principal said, “Parents love to see their children there. I mean, if you visit our Facebook
page, you realize that there is very little about the staff, very little about principal.
Everything was about the students. That has helped.”
Most Saint Lucia teacher survey respondents said that recognition of students’ contributions
or accomplishments outside of academics and sports “sometimes” happens, with the
remainder saying that it “often” happens. Most non-teaching staff said that this kind of
student recognition “often” happens at their school. About half of the parents also reported
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 48
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
that their child’s school “often” recognizes students outside of academics and sports. Most
primary school parents and all secondary school parents surveyed though that their child’s
school recognized girls and boys equally. And a sizeable majority of primary and secondary
school parents said their school gave equal recognition to wealthier and poorer students.
Similarly, data from interviews with principals and guidance counsellors indicated that two
schools in Saint Lucia implemented a “Caught Being Good” initiative, which recognized
positive student behaviour and students’ improvements. Students were also recognized at
assemblies for non-academic related accomplishments such as demonstration of positive
values and other activities such as creative writing. Speaking on the recognition of students,
a principal said, “Everything is a big deal at the school. Everything is celebrated. When I
speak of, ‘I do my best work’ – one of the questions we ask the students is whether you felt
you did your best irrespective of the outcome. And as long as they can look at me and smile
and say that they have done their best, that is something that is celebrated. We had various
ceremonies highlighting all aspect of aspects of students. The students were recognized for
being safe, for being respectful of others, for being cooperative. Students who changed their
behaviour would have been highlighted at the school.”
5.4.3 Evidence that schools take concrete steps to ensure that all types of students
experience a safe and supportive learning environment
This indicator addresses both safety and support for students overall, and the extent to
which students with different characteristics experience an equally safe and supportive
school environment. Here, we focused on safety. In other sections, we address the provision
of a supportive learning environment in terms of student participation and recognition (see
Sections 5.4.1 and 5.4.2), flexible approaches to instruction that account for diverse student
needs (see Section 5.6.1).
The data suggested that guidance counsellors Some schools attempted to address

and improving the school’s physical
environment to be safe for students. Anti-bullying strategies included school-based talks on
the harms of bullying, class mandated or school mandated virtues and expectations for
students to follow, role-plays, and anti-bullying videos to spread awareness. In Saint Lucia, a
school head emphasized that school safety was a major focus in the school, with one of the
school’s expectations as “I am safe,” which recognizes the essence of safety for oneself and
others in the classrooms, playgrounds, and bathrooms. Further, a national-level respondent
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 49
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
said school safety officers stationed in schools ensured that school spaces and grounds were
safe and conducive to students. In Antigua, a national level respondent indicated that
schools implemented an anti-bullying programmes and had no-tolerance policies on
bullying. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, a primary school implemented a “ROARS (ROARS-
Respectful Obedient Attentive Responsible Safe) rule” as one of the school expectations to
prevent and address concerns of bullying.
CFS implementers also described experiences where parents and bus drivers who received
training in positive behavioural management changed the way they dealt with children who
demonstrated negative behaviours outside of the classroom.
Most primary school students from Saint Lucia answered that the school rules were fair.
However, half of students said different groups of students received different consequences
for breaking the rules, with the other half about evenly split between those who thought
the rules were applied fairly and those who were unsure. Saint Lucia parents of both
primary and secondary students were more positive on this topic, with most believing that
the rules were applied fairly.
Schools struggled with limited resources to improve student protection and safety. With
regards to a safe physical environment, both the guidance counsellor and principal from a
secondary school in Nevis suggested there were financial constraints which prevented the
school from meeting basic safety standards. The respondents confirmed that the physical
environment was unsafe for students and that there is an imminent risk of some
infrastructure harming students. Despite the perceived immediate risk, there seemed to be
no concrete steps in place to have safer environments.
5.5 What is the larger context for how families and communities engage
with children, in terms of norms and culture? And to what extent is this
context consistent with/enabling of CFS/ES goals and values?
The table below presents the judgement criterion, indicators, key findings and key progress
areas related to the alignment of the framework’s implementation to contextually
appropriate norms, goals, and values (see Table 10).

received almost no attention.
5.5.1 Systems of rewards/sanctions are consistent with norms and culture
Section 5.4.2 addressed student recognition and rewards; this section focuses on
discipline/sanctions. Respondents noted that traditional views were a barrier to
implementation of PBM under CFS/ES and said that the system of sanctions in schools
differed from the local culture and norms related to discipline. For example, a respondent
from CARICOM noted that across the region, “There'll be some persons who believe that the
framework is a little soft. Because we still have some people in the system with traditional
views. [They believe] that you should be fairly hard on children to get them to do what you
want them to do.”
Despite the efforts across the region to eliminate corporal punishment in schools, it still
seemed to be a regular practice. For example, students recounted that children who
misbehave get lashes or ‘hot chocolate’ from teachers and principals. However, teachers
and principals often reported using corporal punishment as a “last resort.” Amongst non-
teaching school staff in Saint Lucia, all felt that positive discipline was useful at least
sometimes, and most felt that it was “often” useful.
Most parents in Saint Lucia responded that their child’s school gave the right consequences
for student behaviour (the remainder were unsure). However, we are unsure whether this
response reflects agreement with new positive methods, or reflects the fact that schools are
still using corporal punishment at least some of the time, though most parents viewed
corporal punishment as acceptable.
5.5.2 Evidence of strengthened collaboration between stakeholders on
child/community health, development, and wellbeing
National level respondents described what they considered to be robust cross-sectoral
coordination involved in the implementation of the CFS/ES framework. For example, a
Ministry of Education official in Antigua and Barbuda said, “I would say that we have had a
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 51
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
good and long-standing relationship. And even as we consulted on like a discipline policy
and a discipline code, we included many sectors of society that external to the education
system.” Multiple stakeholders said they rely on collaboration with the social protection
sector; for example, a government respondent said, “The social welfare division, for
example, is a very reliable partner that they have the correct linkages in the community and
the children, and they are able to step in where they need to – to intervene when and
where they need to assist our children and help them to access better education.”
The evaluation found some evidence for collaboration at the school level. For example, a
school principal from Saint Lucia described how collaboration with community government
has facilitated implementation of the framework, “We also have our community
development offices and governmental level. They have actually stepped in and last year
based on a request by me to assist my students from the poorer families, we were able to
start an afterschool program. And then our practices were positive and student focused,
and we saw that by the end of the program that our students had developed a more
positive outlook in terms of how they viewed themselves.”
However, a respondent from the Ministry of Education in Saint Kitts thought the
collaboration in terms of the CFS/ES framework specifically could be strengthened, “While
we have connections in partnership, I wouldn't say that we have perhaps built anything,
system-wide or nationally that ties strongly back to effective schools as compared to like
school safety where we have done so.”
5.5.3 Evidence of community collaboration on inclusive education
There was little evidence that countries and schools were focusing on inclusive education.
The issue did not seem to be resistance to the idea of inclusion, but rather lack of attention.
For example, education officers from Antigua and Barbuda said, “The inclusiveness goes to
the point to where all schools really need to put in a little more with regards to physical
access, like for wheelchairs, and bathrooms need to be retrofitted, where students who
have these kinds of disabilities can go to school, they should be able to, but sometimes the
physical aspect is just not there.”

Introduction of ES into secondary

combination of lack of buy-in and
lack of resources.
Despite these challenges, schools
were making progress in adopting
CFS/ES.
5.6.1 Evidence that staff have knowledge to foster flexible teaching and learning
methods that respond to student needs
Above, this report discussed steps teachers were taking to provide a supportive learning
environment (see Section 5.4.3). Students across countries agreed that teachers generally
used interactive methods in the classroom, but few reported that teachers provided
individualized support. Some respondents felt that teachers needed more practical training
to encourage implementation. One respondent suggested that teachers valued the concept,
but this did not necessarily translate into implementation of student-centred approaches. A
secondary school teacher explained, “I don’t think teachers are truly aware of what student-
centred really means. Additionally, we are confined to teaching to the curriculum and we
haven’t been able to merge the expectations of the curriculum and CSEC exams with the
tenets of student-centred learning. I think essentially some teachers have not fully grasped
the idea of letting go and allowing students to participate in leadership roles, for example.
Additionally, I think that teachers need the necessary training.”
Most teachers reported incorporating student-centred learning through several
approaches including differentiated learning, incorporating different learning styles into
lessons, using participatory methods (e.g., group work, student-led activities, and learning
through play), and incorporating technology. Teachers from Saint Lucia said they actively
monitor student needs for behavioural supports, and provided insights into what helped
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 53
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
them adopt student-centred practices. One teacher said (s)he had been helped by “a
realization of students being more focused and motivated to learn when student-centred
approaches are used,” while another suggested, “Knowing [students’] strengths and
weaknesses and placing them in activities that they will be able to do.”
In Saint Lucia, about half of the students reported that they often got help from teachers
when they needed it, and only a handful said that they rarely got needed help (with the
remainder reporting that they received help sometimes). Just over half felt that teachers
equally helped different groups of students (such as girls and boys, or students from poorer
families and from wealthier families), with the remainder divided between saying teachers
did not give equal support or being unsure. However, the open-ended responses from
student surveys indicated a more positive view on student support, indicating that the
majority of students felt teachers were equally helpful and cared about all types of students.
Though the majority of students surveyed from Saint Lucia answered that the school did
care about whether all types of students were successful, some students pointed to a
concern that participation is a challenge for some classmates. One student said, “Some
teachers always try to get in touch with the students but then it is a bit difficult, so the
teachers give up on the students.”
Although respondents from teacher training institutions were familiar with the CFS/ES
framework, they had not fully incorporated principles from the framework into the
teacher training curriculum. One respondent thought that because UNICEF typically
engages with ministries of education, education initiatives are not immediately
institutionalized beyond that. A key informant from the Department of Teacher Education at
the University of the West Indies said, “I don't think they've reached the point where they
have actually incorporated It fully into the written curriculum, but I know that the lectures
have been involved and actually students have been exposed to the initiative. And there is,
there has been, quite some bits of discussion, debates, about the cultural significance of it,
the cultural impact of the Child Friendly School initiative and the possible ways in which it
could be factored into our school climate.”
An education officer from Saint Kitts and Nevis described their new curriculum, introduced
in 2020, as child-centred, saying, “That new curriculum is very focused on child-centred
learning, centred on differentiation, in terms of instruction, in terms of assessment. And so,
that whole child friendliness - taps into the needs of individual students and what their
needs are, and to make their learning environment suitable for their needs.”
5.6.2 Evidence that educators are able to seamlessly integrate CFS/ES
programming and approaches into their day-to-day activities and responsibilities
Leadership buy-in from school principals and teachers helped improve the progress of CFS
implementation, along with the understanding that CFS should be integrated into all
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 54
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
aspects of a school. A national-level respondent said, “If the mechanisms are not there to
get staff buy in, then the whole CFS framework within the school could be slow in getting
implemented or not at all.” Similarly, an education officer stressed the importance of
“whole-school” buy-in, stating, “You have to ensure that persons have sufficient buy in, so
that they can volunteer to engage students and do some of those things. And [buy-in
affects] whether or not the teachers themselves see [the CFS/ES framework] as something
that is productive for them and for their schools.” Further, buy-in at the ministry level and
technology-based awareness programmes helped improve the understanding of what a CFS
includes. Further, the presence of sector-wide buy-in to the CFS/ES framework likely
improves implementation of the framework. For example, a CFS/ES focal point suggested
that the presence of ministry-level ownership, with the understanding that CFS/ES falls
under the responsibility of the entire education sector and is not just the responsibility of an
appointed focal point, is a key facilitator for successful implementation.
Some respondents recounted progress related to integrating the CFS/ES framework at the
school level. For example, a respondent from Antigua and Barbuda explained that although
teachers may not strictly adhere to each aspect of the framework in secondary schools,
there are still positive results, saying, “You will find that teachers would reward students,
you will find that during assemblies, students will be highlighted for something that would
have been done. You will see areas within the classroom where there's an affirmation, or
you will also see the wall or hall of fame [where] students’ photos are being posted and
what they would have accomplished and so forth.”
However, national- and school-level respondents indicated that limited funds and resources
were a major barrier for the continued implementation of CFS. For example, a national-level
respondent from Antigua said a lack of funding forced discontinuation of a rewards-based
PBM system in some schools. Under the reward system, teachers provided rewards from a
school shop to children who demonstrated positive behaviours.
Teachers said limited resources affected their ability to implement CFS/ES programming. For
example, primary school teachers from Saint Lucia said limited time and financial resources
made implementation of the HFLE component, student-centred teaching, and encouraging
individual student participation difficult. Teachers at a secondary school also said currently
available resources were not sufficient to implement the student-centred classroom
approach. Principals and teachers requested more Information and Communications
Technology -based supports such as computers and projectors to support implementation.
Other factors that delayed or interrupted CFS/ES implementation included high staff
turnover, heavy reliance on one staff member’s knowledge and capacity, and lack of follow-
up training sessions. For example, a secondary school principal requested more guidance in
the wake of turnovers: “[CFS/ES] was discussed at a school level with tentative plans for
implementation. The teacher who was spearheading the process was recently transferred to
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 55
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
another school. The main person is no longer on staff; guidance is needed.” Similarly, at the
school level, the integration of the CFS/ES elements into daily activities was limited due to
the heavy reliance on only one person, such as a guidance counsellor. Most of the CFS/ES
elements related to student development and skills were largely the responsibility of the
guidance counsellor, who was the key person to address matters of interpersonal
relationships, bullying, behaviour management, HFLE, and sexuality.

5.7.1 Evidence that CFS/ES programming is integrated with other sector-level
initiatives and requirements
A majority of informants at the regional and national levels believed that CFS/ES
programming is coherent with other initiatives, norms, and standards. A regional
stakeholder said, “From our understanding of the Child Friendly initiative, or the school
effectiveness aspect of it, it's been intertwined in what we do in trying to shape teachers
into quality teachers overall, and schools, into places where children learn in holistic and
healthy ways.” A CARICOM official described how the CFS model followed closely from the
efforts under the Caribbean New School Model, which is the education sector’s portion of
the initiative that aims to promote social resiliency throughout the CARICOM region; the
official said that related education issues, “Have to be given consideration when we are
thinking about safe school designs. And safe school designs not just to be used for school,
normal school learning during, eight to three period, not just to be used in case of an
emergency for shelters, but schools that are also designed in such a way that can also be
used for community initiatives, within member States.”
At the country level, a key informant from Dominica said, “The CFS/ES framework, it has to
be embedded in what is within that sector’s plans.” The key informant continued, “Dominica
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 56
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
has been ensuring that this child friendly framework, the principles, practices, theory, are
reflected in our sector plan, in our curriculum and in practices within the schools.” Similarly,
a school principal from Anguilla said the secondary schools’ current mission and vison
statements bring together recommendations from a review of the secondary education
sector, child safeguarding policies, and elements of the ES. A primary school head from Saint
Lucia also mentioned having incorporated CFS policies into the mission and vision
statements. And a government respondent from the Turks and Caicos Islands said, “[CFS/ES]
fits well into our overall planning because the elements are key things that we would want
to see within our school system, as it relates to rules and expectations as it relates to
positive management behaviour, safety and security, as it relates to the establishment of
student councils, not only establishment, but establishment and operation and links to the
community and our various projects.”

wide-scale teacher and principal training on areas addressed by CFS/ES, and that the
Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) and UNICEF supported the
development of policies and capacity across the region for schools to have effective
safety/emergency management planning and disaster risk management.90 Relatedly, in
2018, UNICEF ECA (a) provided technical and financial support across the region for
education in emergencies, disaster risk reduction, and building resilience to disaster-related
shocks in schools; (b) facilitated CFS/ES training across countries; and (c) provided countries
with C4D support related to CFS/ES.91 At the country level, there is documentation of
investments in areas that are consistent with the values and goals of CFS/ES, such as
programming in Antigua and Barbuda that provides school uniforms and school feeding,92
and steadily increasing budgetary allocations to meet the needs of students in special
education in Saint Lucia.93 However, the evaluation team did not find documented examples
of earmarks specifically for CFS/ES.
Despite these efforts, school-level and national-level qualitative data suggest that monetary
resources were insufficient and always welcome. School-level respondents reported
instances where implementation of a CFS element was halted due to lack of funds, or where
teachers pitched in their own money to help sustain the framework’s concepts. Speaking to
the PBM reward system described earlier, district education officers from Antigua said that
teachers were often required to purchase the rewards from their own pockets and the
district officers suggested fundraising activities or donation of rewards.
Additionally, for the safe schools component of the framework, some schools in Saint Lucia
and Nevis required monetary resources to improve physical infrastructure through the
fencing of school compounds, installing working toilets and safe roofs in classrooms. A
national-level respondent from Saint Lucia listed several infrastructure related changes that
a school still required to be called a “child-friendly school,” citing an example where a child
was hurt when a school balcony caved in and the use of termite-infected benches in
classrooms.
As also mentioned below, the evaluation data shows that CFS/ES focal points across the
region were stretched for time and the types of support they could offer to schools, such
as follow-up trainings (see Section 5.9). For example, a focal point from Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines stated, “From a human resource standpoint, it is very challenging because I
am the focal point person and I'm also senior education officer. There are about 70 primary
schools, and we have three senior education officers who are assigned to them … I have 30
[primary schools] to look into. And sometimes, the time that you would like to spend in

schools is severely hampered.” However, there is evidence that focal points provided
technical support and guidance whenever schools asked for support. Further, education
officer from Saint Kitts and a principal from Nevis reported that though some schools
received technical assistance from a focal point, the schools still struggled to implement the
framework due to a shortage of staff.
There were few examples where school leadership were able to effectively mobilize the
trainings provided by the CFS/ES focal points to train teachers and ancillary staff, though
interviews with principals and teachers suggested that only a handful of principals who
received training were able to effectively train teachers on the framework and its practices.
For example, a school head from a primary school in Saint Lucia said additional training
sessions with school staff and the CFS focal point enabled staff to develop a school
behaviour matrix to help with PBM. Additionally, a national-level respondent said one
primary school principal in Saint Lucia was able to effectively mobilize parents through
parents’ councils and parent workshops. Similarly, in Saint Kitts and Nevis, providing CFS/ES
trainings directly to teachers enabled teachers to integrate CFS/ES concepts into their
classes.
With regard to other non-monetary resources, better material and physical resources were
needed. Education officers from Antigua suggested that though there were material
resources such as brochures that spoke to the framework, they were not adequately used
because of teachers’ limited time. The officers suggested that more innovative tools such as
charts or videos could be more effective. Similarly, a national-level respondent from Nevis
said the technical resources available currently were not context specific: “I remember
seeing videos from different regions. I noticed a deficit in terms of locally produced
resources in promoting the framework.”
5.8.2 Evidence that CFS/ES activities are combined with/leverage other activities as
appropriate
There is limited evidence that stakeholders leveraged existing activities at the national or
school level to improve CFS/ES uptake. Overall, it seemed that most stakeholders had
trouble visualizing the framework as embedded within other regular school activities. For
example, a national-level respondent from Antigua indicated that the CFS/ES framework
was sometimes perceived to be a separate entity and hence there was limited collaboration
between different agencies and led to duplicative efforts when resources are already limited
and need to be effectively utilized. The same respondent suggested that mechanisms for the
implementation of CFS/ES be streamlined between different ministries and agencies such as
the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, police departments, and department of social
transformation. Further, a primary school principal from Antigua suggested that the CFS
framework only fits with 50 percent of other existing standards and requirements of the
education system in the country. The principal stated, “It appears as if they want to break
down everything that is already established. There was always behaviour management
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 59
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
taking place and each school has a set of guidelines. Now, everything must be done
according the CFS model … when some of the things in behaviour management are similar.”
There were a few examples of schools beginning to find approaches to leverage other
activities as part of CFS, such as initiatives such as breakfast club which is sponsored by a
community organization. A principal from Antigua explained that this initiative was child
friendly as it allowed underprivileged children to be fed and participate in school activities.

CFS/ES Educators appreciated the support they
received from the regional level, but still
struggled with how to implement CFS/ES
on the ground.
There were requests for additional
training, technical assistance and
examples/models that could help build
educator capacity.
5.9.1 Evidence that staff have developed adequate capacity and mechanisms for
implementation of CFS/ES
Schools across the three sampled countries relied heavily on the focal points to support the
implementation of the framework and professional development. Though respondents at
the national level appreciated the support from focal points, they also pointed out that
reliance on one person is unsustainable. A chief education officer suggested that more staff
to implement the CFS/ES framework at the ministry level would be helpful: “The focal point
needs support to get it together, because if an education officer has to make a decision with
reference to what takes priority, obviously the primary responsibilities would take priority.
So, I think, more hands-on deck is important.”
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 60
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
National education officers in Antigua and Barbuda and Saint Lucia highlighted the gaps in
capacity for monitoring implementation. Some suggestions included building capacity of
teachers and/or principals on monitoring and supervision at the school level to guide the
implementation of the CFS/ES framework. An education officer stated, “I am thinking that if
there was someone else with that responsibility [of ensuring the initiative continues] and
also because of the number of schools that have to be monitored and supervised, I am
thinking that we could have seen more.” Another recommendation was to develop a
committee dedicated to directly monitoring implementation.
Some regional and national stakeholders expressed concern that teachers were not fully
understanding the framework. In addition, schools seemed to rely heavily on the work of
guidance counsellors to implement the framework. One respondent elaborated on the
difficulty of getting teachers to fully understand and implement the framework, “I think part
of the challenge has been … breaking down the mentality or the thinking patterns of
teachers. And their block in terms of seeing CFS as something that is targeting of the
removal of corporal punishment. And then … being open to understanding what it's about.
And then teaching it in ways that the teachers themselves will buy into it. And then ensuring
the teachers are able to learn to demonstrate it in the class.” This finding is consistent with
what we reported above – that educators tended to think of CFS/ES as a positive discipline
initiative (see Section 5.3).
Multiple stakeholders indicated that lack of material and human resources was a
constraint for implementation. A respondent from Dominica said that although UNICEF
support was present, there are aspects of local level support that could be strengthened:
“As relates to the support we get from UNICEF that’s fine; they are really hands on… They
offer a lot of support. They share best practices all the time, which we benefit from. So that
aspect of it is not an issue. I think locally, though, we may need a little bit more manpower
to ensure that the program is properly administered or rather implemented in schools.” An
education officer from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines agreed, while a respondent from
CARICOM added that, “Outside the resourcing constraint, the other constraint could be a
lack of consultations, the timeliness of the public good.”
Respondents said the trainings that UNICEF provided to school-level stakeholders were
useful. A school head from Saint Lucia said, “I was exposed to just about every aspect in
terms of the expectation, where we actually looked at the schools that had made strides in
the Caribbean. We looked at how CFS was imparted and how engaged the entire community
was.” Some of the resources used to implement CFS/ES include a PBIS website link provided
to school staff for positive behaviour support alternatives, a pre-referral intervention
manual and a checklist provided to teachers to help manage students’ behaviours and seek
support from a district councillor if certain strategies do not work.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 61
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
A national-level respondent from Saint Lucia emphasized that there was a need for
increased capacity and called for the continual training of teachers. The respondent stated,
“I think that a lot of our teachers are very competent, very good, empathetic, but some of
our schools, we need to do a lot more in terms of improving that … to continue to make
children feel and know that they're valued within the system, how teachers can speak to
children. How do you support children? How do you show children that they've valued
within the system that they're in?”
There was also a need for more “hands-on examples” for teachers. A national-level
respondent from Saints Kitts and Nevis explained that school staff understand that teaching
and learning should be child centred and that the learning environment should be safe for
children, but they do not have the adequate knowledge to adopt the strategies to their
school or class context. The respondent stated, “Exactly what does making children feel safe
look like? What does that look like at playtime? What does that look like in my math class?
What does that look like in my science class in terms of having hands-on examples? And
then being able to get that support to say … ‘OK, that's how it looked in Saint Lucia, but in
Nevis we're going to have to do it this way to make it work for us.”
The evaluation data suggested that the national and school levels focused on just some
elements of the CFS/ES framework – typically chosen based on a national or school priority.
A national-level respondent stated that there was support from the ministry at the national
level on PBM strategies, which revived the importance of the PBM strategies and
encouraged implementation of the PBM element in schools.
Most teachers in Saint Lucia reported that they only sometimes received the support they
needed to effectively promote student participation, but most of the non-teaching staff said
they often received this support. In the area of PBM, about half of the teaching staff and
half of the non-teaching staff reported that they often received the support they needed to
effectively use positive discipline (and all but one of the remainder said this was true
sometimes). Teachers had mixed opinions about whether they received adequate support
to effectively promote student protection and safety. However, non-teaching staff
consistently reported that they did receive this support.
Teachers and other school staff in Saint Lucia indicated how often they were able to engage
in implementing different aspects of CFS/ES. About half of primary teachers said they used
student-centred approaches “often” and the remainder used them “sometimes.” Most
secondary teachers just used them “sometimes.” Most primary teachers said they often
promoted (a) student participation in their classrooms, (b) student development in the area
of self and interpersonal relationships, (c) the development of a safe and protective
environment in the classroom, and (d) the communication of positive behavioural
expectations. At the secondary level, teachers were also beginning to adopt these
approaches, but they were somewhat less prevalent. The majority of non-teaching staff at
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 62
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
both the primary and secondary levels reported that they often promoted the provision of a
safe and protective school environment. Most primary school non-teaching staff promoted
student participation, but this was less common at the secondary level. All non-teaching
staff at the primary level reported that they often communicated positive behavioural
expectations to students, and most non-teaching staff at the secondary level did so, as well.

above (see Section 5.5.1), teachers and (https://doi.org/10.1787/54d45980-en)
principals were still using corporal
punishment, though they said it was a “last resort.” Students recounted getting lashes or
being forced to stand in stress positions when they misbehaved. Schools also used
exclusionary discipline (such a suspensions) for more serious infractions.
There is little evidence of parents incorporating PBM at home. Several parents recounted
hitting their children at home when they misbehaved. Respondents noted that more
communication with parents was needed to ensure that practices to encourage positive
behaviour translated from the school to household level.
5.10.2 Evidence that schools have developed and implemented preventive
measures to promote and support positive behaviour amongst students.
Teachers encouraged positive behaviour by recognizing students’ achievements, as noted
above (see Section 5.4.2). All primary teachers surveyed in Saint Lucia reported that they
sometimes or often taught students positive behaviours. A respondent from Antigua noted
positive practices at the school-level, “I know for a fact that efforts have been made to
motivate our students academically. Every end of term, there is an award ceremony where
students are awarded ice cream vouchers.” A primary school principal added, “We have a
mural in the schools wall where students’ names are listed so they are highlighted for their
exemplary behaviour, and they get to choose [a gift] from the school's shop.”
However, a school principal from Antigua and Barbuda noted the challenge of using
monetary rewards: “After a time it became monotonous because what we were offering,
the students were not interested [in]. They were asking for things that we could not afford.
So, how do you move the PBM strategy from ‘behaving for things’ to behaving because that
is what students should do? Another thing we thought of was to educate students so that
they would behave without receiving anything. That was the ultimate plan.”
Respondents agreed that schools communicated positive behaviour expectations by
posting signs with rules and reinforcing expectations during events like school assemblies.
Teachers also highlighted these expectations in the classroom setting. An education officer
recalled efforts to embed expectations in schools, saying, “The display of affirmations in the
classrooms, they repeat these affirmations, and that really assists as well. They have
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 64
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
different expectations posted for different settings within the school, what are the
expectations for the bathroom, expectations for the classroom [etc.].”
Students were aware of the rules at their schools, reciting them during focus groups.
Students noted the need to be respectful to others and follow their schools’ dress code,
among other rules. Schools also relied on after-school activities to encourage good
behaviour like scouting and sports. In Saint Lucia, almost all parents reported that their
child’s school sets clear expectations for student behaviour.
All primary teachers surveyed in Saint Lucia said they reached out to parents to help them
learn how to promote their child’s positive behaviours. Almost all parents confirmed that
their child’s school sometimes or often provided families with information about how to
address children’s behaviour through positive methods. Nearly all of the teachers said
parents were only sometimes receptive to their efforts to promote the recognition of
positive behaviours at home. Yet nearly all participating parents reported that they agreed
that the information the school provided was appropriate.
All primary- and secondary-level non-teaching staff in Saint Lucia said they often promoted
development of positive student behaviours. In addition, almost all said that when students
did not behave well outside of class (e.g., playing field, hallways, lunchroom, etc.), the
school “often” provided that student with support to help him/her behave better (and did
not just punish the student).
5.10.3 Evidence that schools provide a healthy learning environment that protects
all students
Despite the presence of anti-bullying initiatives and awareness of anti-bullying, as well as
indications that schools are taking steps to provide a healthy learning environment (Section
5.4.3), FGDs with students from schools across the region indicated that physical aggression
is still high, and students are bullied if they are unpopular, have a disability, are perceived
to look “different” or have different sexual orientations. Students commonly reported that
older students picked on the younger students. Of the 41 students surveyed in Saint Lucia,
14 said their peers at school physically hurt one another, and 14 reported that some groups
students were more often physically hurt by peers than others. Further, secondary school
girls and boys from Saint Kitts and Nevis said they felt unsafe on the school premises and
stated that there were incidents of inappropriate touching between boys and girls. A
majority of students felt that girls and boys were equally safe at their school.
Survey data from parents in Saint Lucia showed that about half felt that students at their
child’s school were safe from bullying, teasing and/or exclusion by peers. Nearly all of the
parents said the level of safety was equal for girls and for boys, for students from wealthier
and poorer families, and for different types of students.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 65
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
FGDs with parents and students indicated that some teachers also bullied students, ranging
from aggressively touching students to showing favoritism to some students. For example,
some students from a boys’ secondary school in Saint Kitts said there were instances where
teachers aggressively touched students (though that was not common). Of the 41 students
in Saint Lucia who completed surveys, 18 said that students at their school were physically
harmed by teachers (such as being hit or being forced to stand in a painful position),
although just two said this happened often. When asked if teachers physically harmed some
groups of students more than others, 26 said no, but 13 were unsure.
5.10.4 Evidence that schools promote awareness of life skills throughout
community and home
Several respondents noted that school curriculum is focused on academics, placing less
value on subjects like life skills. Teachers also noted that the community is most interested
in their children exceling in subjects like math and science. An education official agreed,
stating, “Our school culture is exam driven and more focused on delivering content and not
effectively equipping students with skills for independent life skills.” The report discussed
HFLE above (see Section 5.3.3), and here focuses on what schools do to promote health
through direct activities (rather than instruction).
Teachers, students, and parents agreed that schools stressed healthy eating and fitness.
Many principals, teachers, parents, and students mentioned that their schools have ‘fruit
days’ and ‘water Wednesdays.’ Students also reported participating in physical activity and
believed that it was important to exercise. Yet, several respondents believed that these
messages needed to be translated into action by offering more healthy meal options in
primary and secondary school cafeterias and encouraging healthier eating in households.
In Saint Lucia, all surveyed teachers thought it was useful for their school to develop
students’ healthy eating and fitness habits given the needs and values of the students and
the community. However, teachers’ and parents’ responses were mixed regarding whether
schools provided parents with information about children’s healthy eating and exercise. All
parents surveyed who had received information from the school about children’s healthy
eating and/or exercise said they agreed with the information. Most teachers also said it
would be useful for students to learn about managing the environment.
5.10.5 Evidence that students are valued and acknowledged at school and
classroom levels
There was evidence that schools were making an effort to value and acknowledge
students, and educators seemed to be aware of the benefits of doing so. See above for
more information about these topics (see Sections 5.4 and 5.11).
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 66
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
5.10.6 Evidence that students are provided with a safe and supportive learning
environment
There was substantial room for improvement in the extent to which schools provided
students with a safe and supportive learning environment. Please see above for a detailed
discussion of the evaluation findings in this area (see Section 5.4.3).
5.10.7 Evidence that students are provided with an inclusive environment
At a macro-level, respondents felt that norms and legislation promoted equal learning
opportunities for all children. For example, stakeholders in Antigua noted that universal
primary and secondary education help children attend school, despite their socioeconomic
background. Respondents from Saint Kitts noted that initiatives such as their Universal
Uniform Program helped promote inclusion. This program was open to all parents and
students who were unable to afford uniforms due to job losses and/or poverty.
Respondents recounted several school efforts to promote inclusiveness. Parents reported
that schools recognized achievements outside of academics. For example, parents in Saint
Kitts explained, “This recognition is displayed for students who have participated in
environmental projects, community religious youth groups, cadets and other extracurricular
activities.” A principal added that his school encouraged students who did not excel
academically to participate in other activities like sports or poetry.
However, students reported that teachers often displayed favoritism in class for the higher
achievers. Primary and secondary students often felt that teachers focused most of their
attention on certain students which discouraged other children. Respondents felt that
preferential treatment resulted in a less inclusive classroom environment. Students felt that
teachers especially had little patience for troublemakers.
Respondents agreed that improvements are needed to make schools more inclusive for
students with disabilities. The requirements related to teacher training in special education
differed across countries, with Antigua requiring students to take special needs courses,
while it was often an elective in other countries. As a result, teachers are often ill prepared
to support students with special needs. Other respondents agreed that schools needed to
take a more holistic approach to supported disabled students with one teacher stating,
“Inclusion of the disabled should go beyond building of ramps.”
5.11 Since the introduction of CFS/ES, to what extent have students become
more engaged in education?
The table below presents the judgement criterion, indicators, findings and key progress

5.11.1 Evidence of opportunities for students to participate in decision making in
and outside of the classroom, and that their participation is actively monitored and
evaluated
There were limited opportunities across the region for students to make decisions
regarding their school environment. Very few school-level respondents indicated a
functioning student council that served as a platform voicing students’ concerns. Amongst
students in Saint Lucia, only one in five said that adults in their school asked students for
their opinions about how the school should be run. With regard to currently available
opportunities, a secondary school principal from Antigua stated that students make
decisions on what they need from the school, and that a Student Leader Group consisting of
prefects, student monitors, head boys and head girls represented the students.
Some teachers from a Saint Lucian school confirmed that students received opportunities
to lead class recess and class discussions and have opportunities to voice their opinions
and interests through an active student council which included student representatives
from lower to upper grades. Similarly, a senior teacher who serves as a CFS coach for a Saint
Lucian school said class representatives in the Student Council made decisions on issues
outside the classroom, such as fundraising activities. The respondent explained, “They are
also encouraged to think of ways that they can be empowered by raising their own funds to
do things for themselves. We have a particular fundraiser just to do an activity.”
Participation in decision-making outside the classroom also included identifying ways to
help the community, “At one time we had what we called ‘Kindness Day.’ We would identify
persons in the community, we would get a hamper together for them, or go and visit them;
so, the students were now instrumental not just in class and in the school compound but in
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 68
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
the community.” One primary school in Saint Kitts also stated that students developed
leadership skills outside of the classroom through opportunities to lead prayer sessions in
community churches. Further, teachers from a secondary school in Saint Kitts and Nevis
suggested that an elected student body council instead of the current Young Leaders
program and Prefect program would provide better decision-making opportunities for
students.
With regards to monitoring and evaluation of participation, as noted above (see Section 5.9),
there was a capacity gap in monitoring and evaluation at both national and school levels and
on all CFS/ES elements. For example, an interview with a guidance counsellor from Nevis
suggested that there were weekly class observations but called for more school wide
monitoring to take place.
5.11.2 Student attendance
Of the three evaluation countries, we were only able to obtain longitudinal attendance data
for Saint Lucia. This section provides observations about the data on student attendance,
though it is not possible to directly attribute any of the trends to the CFS/ES framework.
Student attendance was very static from 2009 to 2018 amongst primary school and
secondary school boys and girls (see Figure 3).

5.11.3 Student persistence (versus dropping out)
Rates of primary school completion in Antigua and Barbuda and Saint Kitts and Nevis
surpassed 100 percent when the CFS was introduced in 2007 and 2012, respectively (likely
due to over-age enrolment or grade repetition). Since the framework’s introduction,
primary school completion rates have stayed close to 100 percent in both countries. Primary
school completion rates in Saint Lucia prior to the framework’s introduction are not
available, but estimated rates since 2016 have also been between 90 and 100 percent.
At the secondary level, completion rates are lower than at the primary level in all countries
except Saint Kitts and Nevis (see Figure 4). In Antigua and Barbuda, the completion rate
increased from 88 percent at the start of the program to 99 percent (see Figure 5). And in
Saint Lucia, the completion rate increased from 85 percent in 2008 to 92 percent in 2018
(see Figure 6). However, we note that there were periods between 2008 and 2018 when the
completion rate dropped in both countries. Additionally, there are some years for which
data was not available. Therefore, completion rates have not continually improved since the
framework’s introduction.

5.12.1 Extent to which education system policies are aligned with the CFS/ES
framework
The evaluation answered this question based on desk review. There has been ongoing
progress in the region in the alignment of education system policies with the CFS/ES
framework. For example, at the regional level, the Caribbean Development Bank’s 2017
Education and Training Policy and Strategy is aligned with CFS/ES.98
A 2013 UNICEF and OECS review of education plans and policies noted early adoption of
child-friendly policies by name in some places in the region, such as Grenada’s 2012
curriculum policy objective to provide learner-centred, child-friendly, health promoting
schools.99 In 2014, Saint Kitts and Nevis aligned its education policies with CFS.100 In Saint

Lucia, we saw no mention of CFS in its Education for All 2015 National Review, although its
2015 – 2020 education sector plan was shaped by CFS/ES.101,102
Countries have adopted policies related to components of the CFS/ES framework such as
PBM, school safety, inclusion, and life skills. In 2014, Saint Kitts and Nevis developed
legislation that aligns with the components of the CFS/ES framework, including policies on
the use of restraint and PBM in schools, special education, and HFLE. One policy requires
that schools move HFLE beyond the classroom and put systems in place to facilitate its
application at the school and community levels.103 In terms of school safety, countries
within the region adopted the School Design Guidelines to promote resilient schools
following the Antigua and Barbuda Declaration on School Safety in the Caribbean.104
However, it does not appear that countries have adopted policies on student participation
specifically (such as through student councils).
A critical gap in progress is in the area of PBM – a priority for regional stakeholders. The
CARICOM 2017 Final State of the Caribbean Child Report noted that ECA countries had
signed onto the Convention on the Rights of the Child, but lacked legislation to guarantee
children protection from physical or mental violence, injury or abuse (including the corporal
punishment in schools).105 The 2017–2021 Education Sector Plan for Saint Kitts and Nevis
noted that the existing legislation on corporal punishment was a barrier to effective
implementation of the CFS/ES framework.106 As of 2019, UNICEF ECA’s Country Office
Annual Report was still calling for increased regional attention to the need for policies that
abolish corporal punishment in schools.107
One of the best ways to ensure uptake of an education initiative is to integrate it into
oversight and accountability systems. As of 2017, the CARICOM monitoring system for
education and development of young people specified that there should be regulation
under legislation for the minimum standards for child friendly schools. At that time, only
Guyana had legislation in place that specified minimum standards for child friendly
schools.108 Other countries have also instituted legislation aligned with the components of
the CFS/ES framework. As noted above, the government in Saint Kitts and Nevis developed

several policies as part of its CFS implementation related to PBM, school safety, inclusion,
and life skills.109
5.12.2 Extent to which governments allocate funding for ongoing implementation
of CFS/ES
The document review did not find mention of government funding for implementation of
CFS/ES by name, though the government may have allocated funding for aspects of
education that are part of the CFS/ES framework.
As noted above (see Section 5.8), respondents described challenges in having adequate
financial and human resources to implement and sustain CFS/ES. At the same time,
education systems and schools were not leveraging other initiatives or activities to promote
CFS/ES, and many schools seemed to be focused on rewarding students with material goods
(which then became unavailable when funds ran out), rather than less costly options such as
privileges or public recognition.
One key informant from the Ministry of Education in Grenada expressed concern about the
sustainability of the initiative because of changing political priorities, “I think the political
overtones often override many of these official policy things… even those structures that
are well put together by technical educators' and persons who have all of the necessary
know-how and knowledge, sometimes that gets put in the background as whatever is more
politically expedient what comes close to some manifesto, what becomes important to
some political deliverable looms larger than the continuity in programs like these.”
A government officer from the British Virgin Islands expressed concerns about sustainability
with regard to resources and support from UNICEF, “Yes, that's a fear of mine… a concern
that if we do not have that sort of support from UNICEF in terms of the human resources.”
5.12.3 Extent to which the CFS/ES framework is reflected in EMIS and/or QA
mechanisms for schools
Key informants across countries said that monitoring mechanisms had been discussed or
started, but were not in place or consistent. A respondent from CARICOM noted that
generally speaking, “We still have significant work to do as it relates to the monitoring and
evaluation. So, the work is happening, and we are supporting, but we were required, and we
requested the secretary provides the technical support to individual members States on a
particular issue.” Respondents from Tobago and Granada referred to having monitoring
instruments and plans, but that they had not followed through on the process. Respondents
suggested that better capacity in monitoring and evaluation will improve CFS/ES
implementation – and more importantly the quality of implementation – because through
monitoring, evaluation and assessment, focal points or education officers and even school

Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
staff will be able to easily identify what is working and what is not, and where more support
is required for implementation.
Lack of dedicated personnel for monitoring seemed to be a common reason for lack of
strong QA mechanisms for the framework. A respondent from Saint Kitts and Nevis said,
“Well, we have no personnel dedicated to that. And so, it has just now become part of our
observations as we go through and visit the schools, for our normal visits. One respondent
from Antigua and Barbuda was not aware of any monitoring, but said, “The education
officers and would be responsible for monitoring what happens within schools and as part
of their responsibilities they would also monitor the framework I believe. I know, I shouldn't
say, I believe, they should be responsible for monitoring as well.”
Another barrier was in the area of data analysis. A focal point from Antigua and Barbuda
explained, “There is a CFS monitoring tool. And I will tell you that's one of the challenges
that we have, the schools are familiar with it, but we'll do it. We have decided that we
would have administered it twice in a given year, but when it came to the analysis of it, we
have been very weak. ... And again, it's not collected from all of the schools readily. … So,
there is a monitoring tool that UNICEF supplies in terms of monitoring our school's progress
and even our overall progress in CFS. But I will tell you right now, it is not being used as you
would have liked.”
Respondents seemed to buy into the idea that the framework would become part of school culture,
as opposed to a separate program to implement over time. For example, a government
official from Granada described, “It was never conceived of that you have to continue
supporting and you have to continue doing this because we wanted this to become
mainstreamed into education. So, it becomes a child friendly school becomes the normal
way of life. We've tried to build it in … we've instructed [schools] to develop behaviour
policies, and to document practices so that whether or not principals change or goals there
are documented policies that govern how this school treats with A, B, C, D.” An education
officer from Turks and Caicos expressed, “These are things that should be in the life of the
school, the daily operation of the school.”
6. Conclusions
Overall, there was broad agreement that the CFS/ES framework and initiative were relevant
to stakeholders at all levels and coherent with other ongoing initiatives in education and
other sectors. The efficiency, and thus effectiveness, of the initiative was less of a focus,
indicating a gap in understanding of how the framework should fit into and guide other
initiatives rather than stand alone. As such, the sustainability of the initiative is currently not
a focus, as stakeholders are still working on communicating the concepts in an efficient and
effective way and ensuring understanding across actors.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 75
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
The evaluation also found broad alignment with the results of UNICEF’s 2019 surveys to
assess the effect of training and sensitisation on positive behaviour management. In
particular, schools had demonstrated notable progress in multiple areas, including in the
adoption of policies related to CFS/ES principles as well as widespread buy-in with regard to
the theoretical concepts, especially regarding PBM. Schools had received strong technical
assistance and communication from CFS focal points, and, in turn, were communicating
some of the key concepts – such as HFLE and PBM – to parents. There was also evidence
that educators prioritized anti-bullying awareness, took steps to promote student
recognition in a more inclusive way, and worked to use more student-centred teaching
practices in the classroom. Finally, as is consistent with UNICEF’s 2019 surveys, teachers
made progress with regard to implementing some practices related to PBM, including
acknowledging positive behaviour, giving positive affirmation, and allowing student
participation.
The following sections detail conclusions on the relevance, coherence, efficiency,
effectiveness, and sustainability of the CFS/ES initiative.
6.1 Relevance of the CFS/ES framework and initiative
Overall, the CFS/ES framework and initiative was perceived as relevant to stakeholders at
the regional, national, and school levels. There was buy in at all levels, especially from key
stakeholders such as policymakers, principals, and parents. Actors also saw the value and
relevance of governance, coordination, and management in areas related to CFS/ES.
However, collaborating specifically to carry out the principles of the CFS/ES framework
could be strengthened—especially at the school level.
Despite the overall relevance of most of the key areas of the framework, countries and
schools were more focused on some areas than others, and felt some cultural pushback in
elements such as corporal punishment and elevating student voices. Though most teachers
thought the concepts were useful, newer concepts—including elements of inclusion,
student recognition, PBM, and student participation—were not fully understood in terms of
how the ideas translated into practices, indicating that teachers and other actors required
more training and hands-on practice to ensure the concepts were relevant to the context.
6.2 Coherence of CFS/ES with other initiatives
In terms of external coherence, at the national level, the CFS/ES initiative was coherent with
other initiatives within the education sector, as well as those in adjacent sectors, such as
child protection. However, there was little evidence for cross-sector collaboration at the
school/local level. In terms of internal coherence, schools and teacher training institutions
across the region had already been working to adopt approaches that characterized CFS/ES
principles, such as differentiated instruction and student-centred learning, making the
principles of CFS/ES aligned with existing efforts. However, implementers, particularly at the
local level, missed opportunities to streamline CFS/ES with related efforts, potentially
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 76
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
because they perceived the principles as separate tasks rather than guiding principles for all
of their work.
6.3 Efficiency of the CFS/ES initiative
Despite the relevance of the initiative and its coherence with other goals and programs
throughout the region, the CFS/ES initiative lacked efficiency in implementation, particularly
because of the lack of understanding that CFS/ES principles could and should be integrated
into other regular activities. The perception on the part of some stakeholders, especially
those at the school level, that CFS/ES was a separate and additional activity meant that the
principles were less frequently implemented, and that CFS/ES activities were seen as
requiring more monetary and human resources than were available. Schools also tended to
select costly ways to reward students – then ran out of resources – when many less
expensive options are available. In addition, schools did not leverage the activities of other
entities in their communities to help them promote elements of CFS/ES.
6.4 Effectiveness of the CFS/ES initiative
Our research was not designed to fully assess the effectiveness of the CFS/ES initiative on
student outcomes; however, our qualitative information indicates that the challenges in
streamlining the initiative with other areas and teachers’ feelings that the framework was
extra work meant the initiative was not yet effective in making schools child friendly on the
whole. Dissemination of CFS/ES has thus far seemed to focus on national focal points and
guidance counsellors, meaning the program has not fully prioritized ownership by education
systems and educators more specifically. Because of these gaps in the initiative’s expected
outcomes, including school level ownership and teacher understanding and application of
the initiative, important elements of student-centred learning, PBM, school safety, and
inclusion have not systemically or effectively reached students.
Some of the key mechanisms for implementation of CFS framework in schools included
strong ownership and buy-in from the school head, and ample support by the focal point.
6.5 Sustainability of the CFS/ES initiative
The current approach to implementation of the initiative, in which implementers perceive
the need for extra time and resources to implement CFS/ES principles, is not sustainable;
however, the CFS/ES model itself is sustainable if stakeholders are facilitated to understand
ways in which elements of the model can be implemented as part of regular classroom
practice. In addition, a lack of monitoring and QA systems embedded into practice make it
less likely that actors will be held accountable to ensuring that positive practices are
sustained. Similarly, persistent policy gaps in critical areas such as positive discipline make it
less likely that CFS/ES principles will remain in practice.

7. Lessons Learned
In the course of this evaluation, we learned six lessons that have implications beyond the
CFS/ES initiative:
1. Trust is at the core of buy-in, and educators can be reluctant to adopt new methods if
they fear that doing so will make things worse (such as trusting that if you give students
a voice in decision-making, it will not ruin the school). Educators need to be provided
with information and learn from credible sources that new approaches are a good idea
and can work for them.
2. Educators may not know how to apply new methods in their own schools/classrooms,
including those that address alignment and integration with existing frameworks,
systems and practices. and need practical tools and solutions to do so.
3. As long as educators see an initiative like CFS/ES as a “program” that they must do in
addition to the rest of their responsibilities, there will be significant barriers to its full
implementation.
4. Students need to play an active role in the creation of a safe, supportive and inclusive
learning environment at their schools.
5. Bullying is typically viewed as a student problem, but adult behaviour and interactions
with students is equally important. There was evidence that some teachers were
engaging in bullying behaviour.
6. Educators need to know what to do when new methods do not work for all students.
Otherwise, they may default to previous methods to cope with the situation (such as
adopting PBM, but then resorting to corporal punishment for students who still
misbehave).
8. Recommendations
Based on the evaluation findings, the team has formulated five key recommendations. All of
these recommendations are for UNICEF and other actors in the region (such as CARICOM
and the OECS). There are two priority recommendations (around student discipline and
monitoring and evaluation), but otherwise the timeline is left open, because timing will
depend on the resources and priorities of the stakeholders.
8.1 Training and technical assistance
Policy development and coordination is challenging for many countries in the ECA. Regional
actors should provide countries with technical assistance to further consolidate policy
documents and draft model policies for new initiatives (such as the establishment and
functioning of student councils).
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 78
Evaluation of the Implementation of the CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
Countries also require technical assistance to help them better align their efforts across
government ministries, non-governmental organizations, and community-based
organizations. This technical assistance should start with a mapping exercise, and result in
increased engagement and efficiencies for the implementation of CFS/ES (as well as other
efforts to improve children’s healthy development and wellbeing). How can schools
leverage or combine with the work of other organizations that are trying to achieve similar
or related goals? These kinds of collaborations can also improve supports for students and
their families who are experiencing difficulties.
At the country level, CFS/ES should be made more prominent and integral in pre- and in-
service teacher professional development. Regional teacher training colleges should help
prepare teacher professional development materials and disseminate them to ministries of
education so as to build understanding and facilitate uptake amongst educators.
Within countries, teachers could benefit from ongoing coaching on the various aspects of
the framework, potentially focusing on one concept per week or month and facilitating
teachers to employ the aspects in their classrooms and discuss ways to integrate concepts
into existing activities. This applied learning approach where teachers can try things in their
class and get support may (a) increase buy-in as teachers try things for themselves; (b) help
teachers determine how to adapt CFS/ES elements for their particular classroom context;
and (c) improve the extent to which CFS/ES becomes ingrained in business as usual. Such
coaching could be added to the ongoing in-service teacher training already in use.
8.2 Information sharing
There should be increased advocacy within countries to sensitise stakeholders across the
education system (such as education officers, curriculum officers, and senior education
administrators) and in other relevant systems (such as child protection) regarding CFS/ES.
This work should be undertaken by the CFS/ES focal points, with guidance from the regional
level. Additionally, if resources permit, UNICEF should help add deputy or assistant CFS/ES
focal points in each country to support the work of the national focal points.
The OECS Learning Hub is a new resource designed for teachers, parents, and students in
the region.110 It serves as a repository of best practices from/for the region; it is important
for the OECS and other regional actors to ensure its visibility. It would be very useful for the
learning hub to have information about best practices in the implementation of aspects of
CFS/ES that is easy for educators to find (and perhaps parents and students, as well). In
addition, educators from the region should be encouraged to share their own best practices
in the implementation of CFS/ES.

8.3 Disciplinary practices
Educators in the region were using practices that were harmful to children, but that the
educators might not recognize as such – particularly in the area of student punishment. It is
critical that educators in the region learn that (a) negative forms of discipline such as forcing
students into stress positions are also forms of mistreatment; (b) exclusionary discipline
makes students more likely to drop out, increases community crime, and does not make
other students and teachers feel any safer; and (c) “scared straight” types of approaches
cause children psychological harm, and tend to make their behavioural issues worse rather
than better. This issue should be addressed immediately through the CFS focal points to try
to halt these harmful practices as quickly as possible.
8.4 Curriculum reform
Fully integrate into current plans for curriculum enhancement and school improvement
planning (through the OECS Education Sector Strategy) in the Eastern Caribbean. This is an
opportune time to integrate CFS/ES into curriculum reform, as implementation of the OECS
Education Sector Strategy 2012–2026 includes a comprehensive curriculum enhancement
initiative and continuous school improvement through professional development (among
other strategies).
Student-centred approaches should be integral to the curriculum enhancement efforts.
With their recent incorporation of CFS/ES into curriculum reform, Saint Kitts can serve as a
best practice model for the region.
8.5 Monitoring and evaluation
It was very difficult for countries to know how well they were making progress in CFS/ES due
to a lack of ongoing monitoring and evaluation. For example, it is difficult to know how well
PBM is working in the absence of student discipline data, or how well school safety
initiatives are working in the absence of school safety data. If countries had better data
available, they would be able to track progress on key aspects of CFS/ES. Where there is
progress, this is encouraging for schools and shows what is working. Countries also need to
know where their efforts need to be strengthened for CFS/ES to achieve its goals. A
monitoring and reporting framework should be developed that would align with existing
monitoring frameworks developed under the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) OECS
Education Support Project (Antigua, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Dominica, Saint Vincent,
Saint Lucia) as well as the USAID funded Early Learners Programme (ELP) in the same 6
countries.

countries and schools have been able to implement the Child Friendly Schools/Effective
framework so far, and where changes or additional supports are needed to improve the
initiative.
This interview should take about an hour. I will tell you more about the activity, and you can
decide if you want to take part. I will ask questions about the rollout of the Child Friendly
Schools/Effective Schools framework in the region. These questions are not about you
personally and are not intended to judge you or your organisation. If you do not know how
to answer a question, or do not want to answer a question, that is fine. You are not required
to answer any questions.
We cannot promise that your responses will be confidential. We will not use your name in
any reports, but it is possible that a reader could determine that you were the source of
information based on your organisation and/or position. Before we start, I would like your
permission to audio record this discussion. Only members of the research team will be
allowed to listen to this recording.
[Confirm willingness to participate and to be audio recorded.]
I would like to begin our conversation with a few questions related to your position.
1. Please tell me a bit about your background and responsibilities in your current position.
2. Could you briefly describe your role and responsibilities with regards to the CFS/ES
initiative?
3. How much of your job is dedicated to CFS/ES (versus other areas of focus or kinds of
work)?

students should not do. To what extent does your school do this? [If does not
do this, or does inconsistently, probe for barriers.]
b. How well does the approach of communicating positive behavioural
expectations fit with the needs and values of your school?
c. A second aspect of PBM is actively teaching positive behaviours through
dedicated activities, or by integrating opportunities and examples into other
activities (such as a writing assignment for English class). To what extent
does your school do this? [If does not do this, or does inconsistently, probe
for barriers.]
d. How well does the approach of teaching positive behaviours fit with the
needs and values of your school?
e. A third aspect of is PBM is reaching out to parents or guardians to help build
and reinforce positive behaviours at home. To what extent does your school
do this? [If does not do this, or does inconsistently, probe for barriers.]
f. [If any outreach] To what extent are parents or guardians receptive to your
school’s efforts at building and reinforcing positive behaviours at home?
Does it make a difference?
g. A fourth aspect of PBM is ongoing monitoring to identify students who need
greater behavioural supports. To what extent does your school currently
monitor student needs for behavioural support? How does that monitoring
happen? [Probe for school staff intentionally observing student behaviour
outside of class, such as during recess or lunch.]
h. In every school, there will be some students who need some extra support
for their social and behavioural functioning, and then a smaller group of
students who have more serious social and behavioural challenges. Is your
school able to provide different levels of supports for students from these
different groups? [Probe: This is sometimes called a multi-tiered system of
support, or Positive Behavioural Interventions and supports.]
4. To what extent does your school encourage student participation at the school level
(beyond the classroom)?
a. [If any participation] What does this participation look like?
b. Are there differences in participation for boys and for girls?
c. [If any participation] Does the school take steps to encourage participation
amongst students who may otherwise be overlooked, such as those with
disabilities, those who do not do well academically, or those living in
poverty?

5. To what extent does your school formally recognise student accomplishments at the
school level (beyond the classroom), in areas outside of academics or sports?
a. [If any recognition] What does this formal recognition look like?
b. [If any recognition] Does the school take any special steps to formally
recognise students who may otherwise be overlooked, such as those with
disabilities, those who do not do well academically, or those living in
poverty?
6. The Child Friendly Schools framework is intended to promote a safe and protective
school environment.
a. Does your school do anything to provide students with a physically safe
environment – that is, an environment where students are safe from harm to
their bodies? If yes, what?
b. Does your school do anything to protect students from bullying or abuse by
other students? If yes, what?
c. Does your school do anything to protect students from bullying or abuse by
school staff? If yes, what?
d. Does your school do anything to protect students from other threats to their
psychosocial well-being, such as being teased or left out? If yes, what?
e. Does your school take any steps to actively protect and promote the safety
of students who are at higher risk for being bullied or marginalised? If yes,
what?
f. Has anything made it difficult for your school to promote student protection
and safety?
7. The Child Friendly Schools framework also addresses the provision of health and life
skills education. This includes self and interpersonal relationships, sexuality and sexual
health, healthy eating and fitness, and managing the environment. In terms of
‘managing the environment,’ the framework focuses on equipping students with critical
thinking and problem-solving skills to respond to natural and human-caused
environmental threats.
a. Does your school do anything to promote student learning and development
in the area of self and interpersonal relationships? If yes, what do you do? If
no, why not?
b. Do you think that the way your school approaches developing students’ self
and interpersonal relationships is appropriate, given the needs and values of
your students and the community?

Evaluation of the Implementation of CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
e. Does your school share information with parents about the promotion of life
skills? If yes, does it make a difference?
f. Does your school do anything to promote student learning around healthy
eating and fitness? If yes, what do you do? If no, why not?
g. Do you think that the way your school approaches developing students’
habits of healthy eating and fitness is appropriate, given the needs and
values of your students and the community?
h. Does your school share information with parents about the promotion of
healthy eating and fitness? If yes, does it make a difference?
i. Does your school do anything to help students learn how to protect the
environment? If yes, what do you do? If no, why not?
j. Do you think that the way your school approaches teaching students about
managing the environment is appropriate, given the needs and values of
your students and the community?
8. And finally, does your school do any work with the community to help promote inclusive
education? Here, inclusive education’ means children with disabilities, and also children
who may be marginalised for other reasons, such as poverty.
9. Is there anything else that you want to tell me about your school?
Those are all the questions that I had. Do you have any questions for me? [Answer any
questions.]

Introduction
Hello, my name is [__enumerator’s name__]. [Also introduce any other observer/note
taker.] Thank you very much for being here today.
I work for Targeted Development Consulting/American Institutes for Research. We are
conducting an independent evaluation of the Effective Schools initiative. UNICEF has been
supporting the roll-out of Effective Schools to help provide secondary students across the
Eastern Caribbean with a safe and supportive learning environment. UNICEF commissioned
this study to learn about schools’ readiness to implement the Effective Schools framework,
and where changes or additional supports are needed to improve the initiative. It’s okay if
you’re not familiar with the Effective Schools framework. We still want to hear from you!
This interview should take about an hour. I will tell you more about the activity, and you can
decide if you want to take part. I will ask questions about your school in areas addressed by
the Effective Schools framework, such as student engagement and school safety. These
questions are not about you personally and are not intended to judge you or your school.
Rather, we are here to learn more about the Effective Schools framework. If you do not
know how to answer a question, or do not want to answer a question, that is fine. You are
not required to answer any questions.
No one in your school or this community will know how you answered any of the questions.
We will never use your name in any reports for this study or provide information in reports
that could identify you indirectly (such as stating your school and position). Before we start,
I would like your permission to audio record this discussion. Only members of the research
team will be allowed to listen to this recording.
[Confirm willingness to participate and to be audio recorded.]
Interview Questions
First, to what extent does your school currently collaborate with other community
organisations to meet the needs of your students?
a. [If any collaboration] What service areas are addressed through this
collaboration? [Probe for health, children’s well-being]
1. How does your school currently approach student behaviour management?
2. One aspect of the Effective Schools framework is communicating positive behavioural
expectations for students (such as, be respectful, be diligent) rather than focusing on

Introduction
Hello, my name is [__enumerator’s name__]. [Also introduce any other observer/note
taker.] Thank you very much for being here today.
I work for Targeted Development Consulting. We are working with American Institutes for
Research to conduct an independent evaluation of the Child Friendly Schools initiative.
UNICEF has been supporting the roll-out of Child Friendly Schools to help provide primary
students across the Eastern Caribbean with a safe and supportive learning environment.
UNICEF commissioned this study to learn how well schools have been able to implement the
Child Friendly Schools framework so far, and where changes or additional supports are
needed to improve the initiative.
This focus group will take about an hour. I will tell you more about the activity, and you can
decide if you want to take part. I will ask questions about your school in areas addressed by
the Child Friendly Schools framework, such as student engagement and school safety. We
have many questions, so we will only talk about some parts of the framework at your school
(and will hear from other schools about the other parts). The questions are about your
school. They are not about you personally and are not intended to judge you or your school.
Rather, we are here to learn more about the Child Friendly Schools framework. If you do not
know how to answer a question, or do not want to answer a question, that is fine. You are
not required to answer any questions.
Outside of the people in this room, no one in your school system or this community will
know how you answered any of these questions. We will never use your name in any
reports for this study and will never provide information in reports that could identify you
indirectly (such as stating your school and position). Before we start, I will ask for permission
from each of you to make an audio recording of this discussion. Only members of the
research team will be able to listen to this recording. You will see we gave you blank name
cards. You can pick a nickname for yourself and write it on the card, and we will use that
nickname during the discussion to help keep your name out of the recording.
I am going to ask each of you if you agree to be in this study. Before that, does anyone have
questions?
Interviewer: After answering all questions, ask each teacher whether he/she agrees to be in
the study, and whether he/she agrees to be audio recorded. For anyone who says no, thank
and excuse him/her. For the teachers who remain, ask them to write a nickname on the
name cards. These can be something silly or meaningful for them – Sunshine, Cricket Champ,
Snoopy, Loves to Dance, Bookworm, etc.
Before we begin, we need to agree on some ground rules so that everyone feels
comfortable and is heard. First, what is said in the room, stays in the room. We want
everyone to agree to keep what the others say private. Do you each agree to keep with the
others say private? [Get agreement from each.] Second, please be sure to give each other
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 130
Evaluation of the Implementation of CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
time to talk without interruption. If you have something to say, please wait and we will
make sure everyone has a chance to speak.
Are we ready to begin?
Focus Group Questions
I would like to start with some general questions about your school.
What do you think is the best thing about this school?
1. What do you think is the worst thing about this school?
Now I’m going to ask you questions about the teaching and learning environment at your
school.
2. One area of focus for the Child Friendly Schools framework is the promotion of student-
centred classrooms.
a. What does a ‘student-centred classroom’ mean to you?
For the next questions, ‘student-centred’ means that the teacher adjusts his/her
teaching based on student needs, learning styles and interests (rather than pushing out
information the same way for all students).
b. To what extent does your school currently use this approach?
c. [If already in use] What are some examples of the ways teachers at your
school use student-centred approaches?
d. [If already in use] What has helped your school adopt this approach?
e. [Ask all] What has made it difficult for your school to adopt this approach?
f. [If already in use] Do you think this approach is useful at this school? Why?
g. [If not already in use] Do you think this approach would be useful at this
school? Why?
h. Do you think parents and the community are or would be supportive of this
approach? Why?
i. [If already in use] How well does student-centred teaching fit in with
everything else teachers here need to accomplish during the school day?
j. [If not already in use] How well do you think student-centred teaching would
fit in with everything else teachers here need to accomplish during the
school day?
k. To what extent do teachers here get the support and resources they need to
use student-centred teaching?
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 131
Evaluation of the Implementation of CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
3. The Child Friendly Schools framework promotes student participation in the life of the
school at all levels.
a. What does ‘student participation’ mean to you? How would that look?
For the next questions, we will assume that ‘student participation’ means that students
are allies and partners with adults in improving their school; that students are trained to
lead effectively; and that students’ voices are heard, acknowledged and considered.
b. To what extent do teachers at your school currently promote student
participation in their classrooms?
c. [If already in use] Would you please give me some examples of how teachers
at your school promote student participation? [Probe for different kinds of
participation, based on definition we just provided.]
d. [If already in use] Do teachers at your school take any steps to encourage
participation amongst students who may otherwise be overlooked (such as
students who are not high achievers, or students who have disabilities)?
e. [If already in use] Do teachers at your school take any steps to recognise
student contributions for accomplishments outside of academics and sports?
f. [If already in use] Do teachers at your school take any steps to recognise the
contributions of students who may otherwise be overlooked (such as
students who are not high achievers, or students who have disabilities)?
g. [If already in use] What has helped teachers at your school adopt these
approaches?
h. [Ask all] What has made it difficult for teachers at your school to adopt these
approaches?
i. [If already in use] Do you think that encouraging student participation helps
or hurts your school? Why?
j. [If not already in use] Do you think that encouraging student participation
would be useful at this school? Why?
k. Do you think parents and the community are or would be supportive of
student participation at school? Why?
l. [If already in use] How well does the recognition and participation of
students fit in with everything else teachers here need to accomplish during
the school day?
m. [If not already in use] How well do you think the recognition and
participation of students would fit in with everything else teachers here need
to accomplish during the school day?
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 132
Evaluation of the Implementation of CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
n. To what extent do teachers here get the support and resources they need to
effectively promote student participation?
4. The Child Friendly Schools framework is intended to promote a safe and protective
school environment.
a. What does ‘safe and protective’ mean to you? How would that look?
For the next questions, we will assume that ‘safe and protective’ means that the school
promotes both physical and psychosocial safety, and protects students from bullying,
abuse, or marginalisation.
b. To what extent do teachers currently promote a safe and protective
environment at your school?
c. [If already in use] Would you please give me some examples of how teachers
at your school promote a safe and protective environment? [Probe for
different kinds of safety and protection, based on definition we just
provided. Make sure that the discussion goes beyond overt violence and
bullying to also address microaggression such as teasing and exclusion]

protect and promote the safety of students who are at higher risk for being
bullied or marginalised? If yes, what do teachers do?
e. [If already in use] What has helped teachers at your school to promote
student protection and safety?
f. [Ask all] What has made it difficult for teachers at your school to promote
student protection and safety?
g. [Ask all] Is promoting student protection and safety is necessary at your
school? Why?
h. [If already in use] How well does the promotion of student protection and
safety fit in with everything else teachers here need to accomplish during the
school day?
i. [If not already in use] How well would the promotion of student protection
and safety fit in with everything else teachers here need to accomplish
during the school day?
j. To what extent do teachers here get the support and resources they need to
effectively promote student protection and safety?
5. Another area of focus for the Child Friendly Schools framework is the use of PBM. ‘PBM’
includes several aspects.
a. One aspect of PBM is communicating positive behavioural expectations for
students (such as, be respectful, be diligent) rather than focusing on what
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 133
Evaluation of the Implementation of CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
students should not do. To what extent do teachers at your school do this?
[If they do not do this, or do so inconsistently, probe for barriers.]
b. How well does the approach of communicating positive behavioural
expectations fit with the needs and values of your school?
c. A second aspect of PBM is actively teaching positive behaviours through
dedicated activities, or by integrating opportunities and examples into other
activities (such as a writing assignment for English class). To what extent do
teachers at your school do this? [If they do not do this, or do so
inconsistently, probe for barriers.]
d. How well does the approach of teaching positive behaviours fit with the
needs and values of your school?
e. A third aspect of is PBM is reaching out to parents or guardians to help build
and reinforce positive behaviours at home. To what extent do teachers at
your school do this? [If they do not do this, or do so inconsistently, probe for
barriers.]
f. [If any outreach] To what extent are parents or guardians receptive to your
school’s efforts at building and reinforcing positive behaviours at home?
Does it make a difference?
g. A fourth aspect of PBM is ongoing monitoring to identify students who need
greater behavioural supports. To what extent does your school currently
monitor student needs for behavioural support? How does that monitoring
happen? [Probe for teachers and other school staff intentionally observing
student behaviour outside of class, such as during recess or lunch.]
h. If students at your school need additional behavioural supports, do they
receive them? What happens next?
i. Thinking across these areas of PBM, do teachers here get the support and
resources they need to use effective PBM strategies?
6. The Child Friendly Schools framework also addresses the provision of health and life
skills education. This includes self and interpersonal relationships, sexuality and sexual
health, healthy eating and fitness, and managing the environment. In terms of
‘managing the environment,’ the framework focuses on equipping students with critical
thinking and problem-solving skills to respond to natural and human-caused
environmental threats.
a. In the area of self and interpersonal relationships, do you as teachers do
anything to promote student development in that area? If yes, what do you
do? If no, why not?

b. Do you think that the way your school approaches developing students’ self
and interpersonal relationships is appropriate, given the needs and values of
your students and the community?
c. In the area of sexuality, sexual health and HIV, do you as teachers do
anything to promote student development in that area? If yes, what do you
do? If no, why not?
d. Do you think that the way your school approaches developing students’
understanding of sexuality, sexual health and HIV is appropriate, given the
needs and values of your students and the community?
e. In the area of healthy eating and fitness, do you as teachers do anything to
promote student development in that area? If yes, what do you do? If no,
why not?
f. Do you think that the way your school approaches developing students’
habits of healthy eating and fitness is appropriate, given the needs and
values of your students and the community?
g. In the area of managing the environment, do you as teachers do anything to
promote student development in that area? If yes, what do you do? If no,
why not?
h. Do you think that the way your school approaches teaching students about
managing the environment is appropriate, given the needs and values of
your students and the community?
Those are all the questions that I had. Do you have any questions for me? [Answer any
questions.]

FGD-3: Teachers at Secondary Schools
Introduction
Hello, my name is [__enumerator’s name__]. [Also introduce any other observer/note
taker.] Thank you very much for being here today.
I work for Targeted Development Consulting. We are working with American Institutes for
Research to conduct an independent evaluation of the Effective Schools initiative. UNICEF
has been supporting the roll-out of Effective Schools to help provide secondary students
across the Eastern Caribbean with a safe and supportive learning environment. UNICEF
commissioned this study to learn more about how to make the Effective Schools framework
a success as it is being introduced into the region’s secondary schools. It’s okay if you have
not yet heard about the framework or don’t know much about it.
This focus group will take about an hour. I will tell you more about the activity, and you can
decide if you want to take part. I will ask questions about your school in areas addressed by
Effective Schools framework, such as student engagement and school safety. These
questions are not about you personally and are not intended to judge you or your school.
Rather, we are here to learn more about the Effective Schools framework. If you do not
know how to answer a question, or do not want to answer a question, that is fine. You are
not required to answer any questions.
Outside of the people in this room, no one in your school system or this community will
know how you answered any of these questions. We will never use your name in any
reports for this study and will never provide information in reports that could identify you
indirectly (such as stating your school and position). Before we start, I will ask for permission
from each of you to make an audio recording of this discussion. Only members of the
research team will be allowed to listen to this recording. You will see we gave you blank
name cards. You can pick a nickname for yourself and write it on the card, and we will use
that nickname during the discussion to help keep your name out of the recording.
I am going to ask each of you if you agree to be in this study. Before that, does anyone have
questions?
Interviewer: After answering all questions, ask each teacher whether he/she agrees to be in
the study, and whether he/she agrees to be audio recorded. For anyone who says no, thank
and excuse him/her. For the teachers who remain, ask them to write a nickname on the
name cards. These can be something silly or meaningful for them – Sunshine, Cricket Champ,
Snoopy, Loves to Dance, Bookworm, etc.
Before we begin, we need to agree on some ground rules so that everyone feels
comfortable and is heard. First, what is said in the room, stays in the room. We want
everyone to agree to keep what the others say private. Do you each agree to keep with the
others say private? [Get agreement from each.] Second, please be sure to give each other
time to talk without interruption. If you have something to say, please wait and we will
make sure everyone has a chance to speak.
Are we ready to begin?
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 136

Focus Group Questions
I would like to start with some general questions about your school.
1. What do you think is the best thing about this school?
2. What do you think is the worst thing about this school?
Now I’m going to ask you questions about the teaching and learning environment at your
school.
3. One area of focus for the Effective School framework is the promotion of student-
centred classrooms. Here, we will assume ‘student-centred’ means that the teacher
adjusts his/her teaching based on student needs, learning styles and interests (rather
than pushing out information the same way for all students).
a. To what extent does your school currently use this approach? How does that
look at your school?
b. Do you think this approach is or could be right for your school? Why or why
not?
4. The Effective Schools framework promotes student participation in the life of the school
at all levels. ‘Student participation’ means that students are allies and partners with
adults in improving their school; that students are trained to lead effectively; and that
students’ voices are heard, acknowledged and considered.
a. To what extent do teachers at your school currently promote student
participation in their classrooms? [Probe for different kinds of participation,
based on definition we just provided.]
b. Do teachers at your school take any steps to encourage participation
amongst students who may otherwise be overlooked (such as students who
are not high achievers, or students who have disabilities)?
5. The Effective Schools framework is intended to promote a safe and protective school
environment. Here, ‘safe and protective’ means that the school promotes both physical
and psychosocial safety, and protects students from bullying, abuse, or marginalisation.
a. To what extent do teachers currently promote a safe and protective
environment at your school? [Probe for different kinds of safety and
protection, based on definition we just provided. Make sure that the
discussion goes beyond overt violence and bullying to also address
microaggression such as teasing and exclusion]
b. Do teachers at your school take any steps to actively protect and promote
the safety of students who are at higher risk for being bullied or
marginalised? If yes, what do teachers do?
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 137
Evaluation of the Implementation of CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
c. Is promoting student protection and safety is necessary at your school?
Why?
6. Another area of focus for the Effective Schools framework is the use of PBM. ‘PBM’
includes several aspects.
a. One aspect of PBM is communicating positive behavioural expectations for
students (such as, be respectful, be diligent) rather than focusing on what
students should not do. To what extent do teachers at your school do this?
b. How well does or would communicating positive behavioural expectations
fit with the needs and values of your school?
c. A second aspect of PBM is actively teaching positive behaviours through
dedicated activities, or by integrating opportunities and examples into other
activities (such as a writing assignment for English class). To what extent do
teachers at your school do this?
d. How well does or would the approach of teaching positive behaviours fit
with the needs and values of your school?
e. A third aspect of is PBM is reaching out to parents or guardians to help build
and reinforce positive behaviours at home. To what extent do teachers at
your school do this?
f. [If doing this] To what extent are parents or guardians receptive to your
school’s efforts at building and reinforcing positive behaviours at home?
Does it make a difference?
g. [If not doing this] Do you think parents or guardians would listen if your
school tried to help build and reinforce positive behaviours at home?
h. A fourth aspect of PBM is ongoing monitoring to identify students who need
greater behavioural supports. To what extent does your school currently
monitor student needs for behavioural support? How does that monitoring
happen? [Probe for teachers and other school staff intentionally observing
student behaviour outside of class, such as during recess or lunch.]
i. If students at your school need additional behavioural supports, do they
receive them? What happens next?
7. The Effective Schools framework also addresses the provision of health and life skills
education. This includes self and interpersonal relationships, sexuality and sexual health,
healthy eating and fitness, and managing the environment. In terms of ‘managing the
environment,’ the framework focuses on equipping students with critical thinking and
problem-solving skills to respond to natural and human-caused environmental threats.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 138
Evaluation of the Implementation of CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
a. In the area of self and interpersonal relationships, do you as teachers do
anything to promote student development in that area? If yes, what do you
do? If no, why not?
b. Do you think your school has a role to plan in the development of students’
self and interpersonal relationships? If yes, what role?
c. In the area of sexuality, sexual health and HIV, do you as teachers do
anything to promote student development in that area? If yes, what do you
do? If no, why not?
d. Do you think your school has a role to plan in the development of students’
understanding of sexuality, sexual health and HIV? If yes, what role?
e. In the area of healthy eating and fitness, do you as teachers do anything to
promote student development in that area? If yes, what do you do? If no,
why not?
f. Do you think your school has a role to plan in the development of students’
healthy eating and fitness? If yes, what role?
g. In the area of managing the environment, do you as teachers do anything to
promote student development in that area? If yes, what do you do? If no,
why not?
h. Do you think your school has a role to plan in the development of students’
ability to manage their environment? If yes, what role?
Those are all the questions that I had. Do you have any questions for me? [Answer any
questions.]

Introduction
Hello, my name is [__enumerator’s name__]. [Also introduce any other observer/note
taker.] Thank you very much for being here today.
I work for the American Institutes for Research/Targeted Development Consulting. We are
conducting an independent study of the Child Friendly Schools initiative. UNICEF has been
supporting the roll-out of Child Friendly Schools to help provide primary students across the
Eastern Caribbean with a safe and supportive learning environment. UNICEF is using this
study to learn how well schools have been able to implement the Child Friendly Schools
framework so far, and where changes or additional supports are needed to improve its use.
Even if you don’t know much about the Child Friendly Schools framework, we still want to
hear from you.
This focus group will take about an hour. I will tell you more about the activity, and you can
decide if you want to take part. I will ask questions about your school in areas addressed by
the Child Friendly Schools framework, such as student engagement and school safety. We
have many questions, so we will only talk about some parts of the framework at your school
(and will hear from other schools about the other parts). The questions are about your
school. They are not about you personally and are not intended to judge you or your school.
Rather, we are here to learn more about the Child Friendly Schools framework. If you do not
know how to answer a question, or do not want to answer a question, that is fine. You are
not required to answer any questions.
Outside of the people in this room, no one in your school system or this community will

Focus Group Questions
I would like to start with some general questions about your school.
1. What do you think is the best thing about this school?
2. What do you think is the worst thing about this school?
Now I’m going to ask you questions about the teaching and learning environment at your
school.
3. The Child Friendly Schools framework promotes student participation in the life of the
school at all levels.
a. What does ‘student participation’ mean to you? How would that look in the
areas where you work?
For the next questions, we will assume that ‘student participation’ means that students
are allies and partners with adults in improving their school; that students are trained to
lead effectively; and that students’ voices are heard, acknowledged and considered.
b. Does your school encourage student participation? Why do you think that?
c. [If already in use] Would you please give me some examples of how non-
teaching staff at your school promotes student participation? [Probe for
different kinds of participation, based on definition we just provided.]
d. [If already in use] Do non-teaching staff at your school take any steps to
encourage participation amongst students who may otherwise be
overlooked (such as students who are not high achievers, or students who
have disabilities)?
e. [If already in use] Do non-teaching staff at your school take any steps to
recognise student contributions for accomplishments outside of academics
and sports?
f. [If already in use] Do non-teaching staff at your school take any steps to
recognise the contributions of students who may otherwise be overlooked
(such as students who are not high achievers (the ‘bright’ ones), or students
who have disabilities)?
g. [If already in use] What has helped non-teaching staff at your school adopt
these approaches?
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 141
Evaluation of the Implementation of CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
h. [Ask all] What has made it difficult for non-teaching staff at your school to
adopt these approaches?
i. [If already in use] Do you think that encouraging student participation helps
or hurts your school? Why?
j. [If not already in use] Do you think that encouraging student participation
would be useful at this school? Why?
k. Do you think parents and the community are or would be supportive of
student participation at school? Why?
l. [If already in use] How well does the recognition and participation of
students fit in with everything else the staff here needs to accomplish?
m. [If not already in use] How well do you think the recognition and
participation of students would fit in with everything else the staff here
needs to accomplish?
n. To what extent do non-teaching staff at this school get the support and
resources they need to effectively promote student participation?
4. The Child Friendly Schools framework is intended to promote a safe and protective
school environment.
a. What does ‘safe and protective’ mean to you? How would that look?
Here, ‘safe and protective’ means that the school promotes both physical and
psychosocial safety. ‘Psychosocial safety’ means that students are protected from
bullying, abuse, or being ignored or excluded.
b. Do non-teaching staff currently promote a safe and protective environment
at your school? [Probe for examples.]
c. [If already in use] Would you please give me some examples of how non-
teaching staff at your school promoted a safe and protective environment?
[Probe for different kinds of safety and protection, based on definition we
just provided. Make sure that the discussion goes beyond overt violence and
bullying to also address microaggression such as teasing and exclusion]
d. [If already in use] Do non-teaching staff at your school take any steps to
actively protect and promote the safety of students who are at higher risk for
being bullied or marginalised? If yes, what do those staff members do?
e. [If already in use] What has helped non-teaching staff at your school to
promote student protection and safety?
f. [Ask all] What has made it difficult for non-teaching staff at your school to
promote student protection and safety?
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 142
Evaluation of the Implementation of CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
g. [Ask all] Is promoting student protection and safety is necessary at your
school? Why?
h. [If already in use] How well does the promotion of student protection and
safety fit in with everything else staff needs to accomplish?
i. [If not already in use] How well would the promotion of student protection
and safety fit in with everything else staff needs to accomplish during the
school day?
j. To what extent do non-teaching staff here get the support and resources
they need to effectively promote student protection and safety?
5. Another part of the Child Friendly Schools framework is the use of PBM.
a. One aspect of PBM is communicating what students should do (such as, be
respectful, be diligent) rather than focusing on what students should not do.
To what extent do non-teaching staff at your school do this? [Probe for
examples.] [If they do not do this, or do so inconsistently, probe for barriers.]
b. Do you think that this approach is or would be a good idea for your school?
Why do you think that?
c. Another aspect of PBM is to use positive discipline when students do not
behave well. This means that when a student misbehaves, school staff does
things like talking with the student about the behaviour and giving
consequences that do not involve negative methods like hitting or shouting
at the student. To what extend do non-teaching staff at your school use
positive discipline now? [Probe for examples.]
d. Do you think that positive discipline is or would be a good idea for your
school? Why do you think that?
e. What happens if a student has ongoing difficulty behaving well outside of
class (playing field, hallways, lunchroom, school bus, etc.)? Is there someone
you go to at the school to help you with this? What happens?
Those are all the questions that I had. Do you have any questions for me? [Answer any
questions.]

FGD-7: Parents at Secondary Schools
Introduction
Hello, my name is [__enumerator’s name__]. [Also introduce any other observer/note
taker.] Thank you very much for being here today.
I work for the American Institutes for Research/Targeted Development Consulting. We are
conducting an independent study of the Effective Schools initiative. UNICEF has been
supporting the roll-out of Effective Schools to help provide students across the Eastern
Caribbean with a safe and supportive learning environment. UNICEF is using this study to
learn how to use this framework to improve secondary schools. Even if you don’t know
about the Effective Schools framework, we still want to hear from you.
This focus group will take about an hour. I will tell you more about the activity, and you can
decide if you want to take part. I will ask questions about your school in areas addressed by
the Effective Schools framework, such as student engagement and school safety. These
questions are not about you personally and are not intended to judge you or your child or
your child’s school. Rather, we are here to learn more about whether schools are ready to
begin to use new approaches. If you do not know how to answer a question, or do not want
to answer a question, that is fine. You are not required to answer any questions.
Outside of the people in this room, no one in your school or this community will know how
you answered any of these questions. We will never use your name in any reports for this
study and will never provide information in reports that could identify you indirectly (such
as stating your school and position). Before we start, I will ask for permission from each of
you to make an audio recording of this discussion. Only members of the research team will
be allowed to listen to this recording. You will see we gave you blank name cards. You can
pick a nickname for yourself and write it on the card, and we will use that nickname during
the discussion to help keep your name out of the recording.
I am going to ask each of you if you agree to be in this study. Before that, does anyone have
questions?
Interviewer: After answering all questions, ask each parent whether he/she agrees to be in
the study, and whether he/she agrees to be audio recorded. For anyone who says no, thank
and excuse him/her. For those who remain, ask them to write a nickname on the name
cards. These can be something silly or meaningful for them – Sunshine, Cricket Champ,
Snoopy, Bookworm, etc.
Before we begin, we need to agree on some ground rules so that everyone feels
comfortable and is heard. First, what is said in the room, stays in the room. We want
everyone to agree to keep what the others say private. Do you each agree to keep with the
others say private? [Get agreement from each.] Second, please be sure to give each other
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 149

time to talk without interruption. If you have something to say, please wait and we will
make sure everyone has a chance to speak.
Are we ready to begin?

FGD-8: Students
Note: Before you begin, ensure that all students in the group have written parental
consent for their participation.
Introduction
Hello, my name is [__enumerator’s name__]. [Also introduce any other observer/note
taker.] Thank you very much for being here today.
Your school is part of a project called [say ‘Child Friendly Schools’ for primary schools OR say
‘Effective Schools’ for secondary schools.] I work for an organisation called American
Institutes for Research/Targeted Development Consulting. We are doing a study to learn
about [country name’s] schools. We will be talking to students in several schools and will
use the information to help the people who run the schools in [country name] to do a good
job. So, we really want to hear from students like you!
The group discussion will take about an hour. Your parents or guardians have given
permission for you to participate. After I tell you more about this activity, you can also make
your own decision about whether you want to take part.
I will ask you questions about your school. For example, we will talk about whether students
feel safe and respected at school, and whether the school listens to what the students want.
If you do not know how to answer a question, or do not want to answer a question, that is
fine. You are not required to answer any questions.
Outside of the people in this room, no one in your school or your community will know how
you answered any of these questions. We will keep your answers private. We will never use
your name in any reports for this study. Before we start, I will ask for permission from each
of you to make an audio recording of this discussion. Only members of the research team
will be allowed to listen to this recording. You can pick a nickname for yourself and write it
on the card, and we will use that nickname during the discussion to help keep your name
out of the recording.
I am going to ask each of you if you would like to be in this study. Before that, does anyone
have questions?
Interviewer: After answering any questions, ask each student to say whether he/she agrees
to be in the study. For anyone who says no, ask a school staff member to escort them back to
re-join their class. For the students who remain, ask them to write a nickname on the name
cards. These can be something silly or meaningful for them –Sunshine, Cricket Champ,
Snoopy, Loves to Dance, Bookworm, etc.
Before we begin, we need to agree on some ground rules so that everyone feels
comfortable and is heard. First, what is said in the room, stays in the room. We want
everyone to agree to keep what the others say private. Do you each agree to keep what the
others say private? [Get agreement from each student.] Second, please be sure to give each
other time to talk without interruption. If you have something to say, please wait and we
will make sure everyone has a chance to speak.

Q-6: Parents at Secondary Schools
The American Institutes for Research doing a study of the Child Friendly Schools/Effective
Schools model. UNICEF has been supporting the roll-out of Child Friendly Schools/Effective
Schools to help students across the Eastern Caribbean have a safe and supportive school.
UNICEF is using this study to learn how well schools have been able to use the model so far,
and where changes or additional supports are needed. It’s okay if you are not familiar with
the model. We still want to hear from you!
This survey asks about your child’s school in areas covered by the Child Friendly
Schools/Effective Schools model, such as school safety. These questions are not about you
personally and are not meant to judge you or your child or the school. The purpose is to
learn more about the how well the model is working. Your answers will be confidential
(private). No one outside of the study team will know how you answer the questions.
This survey will take about 30 minutes or less to complete. This survey is voluntary, meaning
you don’t have to do it if you don’t want to. You can also skip any questions you don’t want
to answer or don’t know how to answer.
If you complete the survey, you will receive a $10 phone data top from the study team.

Evaluation of the Implementation of CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
Annex G. Ethical Considerations
Alignment with evaluation norms and standards. AIR follows the United Nations Evaluation
Group (UNEG) Code of Conduct, which requires both a conflict- and a gender-sensitive
approach to research and adherence to the ‘do no harm’ principle, as well as transparency,
confidentiality, accuracy, accountability and reliability, amongst other key principles. With
regard to the protection of vulnerable individuals and communities, AIR respects and
adheres to the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Refugee
Convention, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, as well as other human rights
conventions and national legal codes that respect local customs and cultural traditions,
religious beliefs and practices, personal interaction, gender roles, disability, age and
ethnicity. We also conducted this evaluation in accordance with the evaluation principles of
openness, transparency, and participation. Further, AIR and TDC ensured that the
evaluation complied with UNICEF Procedures for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation,
Data Collection and Analysis. And finally, the evaluation was guided by the ethical principles
of independence, impartiality, credibility, responsibility, honesty, and integrity.
The AIR Institutional Review Board (IRB) follows the standards set forth by the American
Evaluation Association Guidelines and the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational
Evaluation. Three general principles define these standards: (a) evaluators will conduct
evaluations legally and ethically, taking into account the welfare of those involved in the
evaluation, as well as the general public; (b) evaluators will conduct evaluations in a
competent and efficient fashion that will lead to reliable and accurate results; and
(c) evaluators will design evaluations and report the results in a manner that is useful to and
appropriate for the intended audience. Clear guidelines exist regarding the expectations
with which local data collectors must comply (e.g., how to document informed consent,
how to store and restrict access to physical files and electronic data files, and how to handle
identifiable information).
Ethical approval. All AIR staff, subcontractors and consultants involved in the collection of
data from human research participants (including children) adhered strictly to the
requirements of AIR’s IRB. AIR’s internal ethical review mechanism was used for approval,
given that AIR’s IRB mechanisms comply with the minimum quality standards established in
UNICEF’s policy. AIR’s IRB (IRB00000436) is registered with the Office of Human Research
Protection as a research institution (IORG0000260) and conducts research under its own
Federalwide Assurance (FWA00003952). The IRB must pre-approve (a) all research activities
and protocols involving human subjects and (b) an information security plan to protect the
confidentiality of data from research participants. AIR’s IRB gave approval for this evaluation
to proceed (see Annex G). Note that the focus groups with students were subject to IRB
oversight as human subjects research, but the IRB determined the other data collection
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 202
Evaluation of the Implementation of CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
activities were exempt because they did not involve human subjects research (that is, the
participants provided information about the CFS/ES framework and/or their school or
institution, not about any individual persons).
Protection of human subjects. Before evaluation data were collected, AIR’s IRB approved a
comprehensive plan to protect the privacy and confidentiality of participants during
recruitment, data collection, transmission, analysis and storage. Upon hiring, all AIR staff are
required to complete a comprehensive course in the ethical conduct of research. All
individuals and organizations that collect data on behalf of AIR are required to sign our IRB’s
Participant Protection Assurance to certify that they are aware of, and will comply with, the
requirements for the protection of human subjects in research. All TDC staff and
enumerators who collected or handled evaluation data signed the Participant Protection
Assurance form.
Training of enumerators. All individuals who collect data on behalf of AIR undergo training
in the protection of human research participants and the gathering of sensitive information.
Data collectors received training in areas such as (a) respectful interaction with participants,
including ensuring that one’s words, nonverbal expressions or actions never convey
judgemental attitudes; (b) the rights of individuals to not answer questions; (c) information
sharing (e.g., never discussing evaluation participants with people outside of the research
team or in public places); and (d) the handling and storage of data. The research team
respected the dignity and diversity of all individuals interviewed, and took into
consideration respect for human rights, gender equity and equality. In addition, members of
the evaluation team were never be permitted to be alone with participating children beyond
the sight and hearing of responsible adults (e.g., parents, school staff).
Use of informed consent. Parents/guardians provided written informed consent for their
child to participate in a student focus groups (see Annex H). The consent language included
(a) a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a
prospective participant in understanding the reasons that one might or might not want to
participate in the research; (b) a statement that the evaluation involves research, an
explanation of the purposes of the research and the expected duration of participation, and
a description of what will happen if students participate; (c) a description of any reasonably
foreseeable risks or discomforts to the participant; (d) a description of any benefits to the
participant or others that may reasonably be expected from the research; (e) a statement
describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of records identifying the participant
will be maintained; (f) an explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent
questions about the research and research participants’ rights; and (g) a statement that
participation is voluntary, that refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of
benefits to which the participant is otherwise entitled, and that the participant may
discontinue participation at any time without penalty. In addition, we obtained verbal
assent from participating students for both their participation and to be audio-recorded. For
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 203
Evaluation of the Implementation of CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
all other types of participants, this evaluation was exempted from gaining written informed
consent from them (given the activity is not human subjects research). However, we
included introductory language for all the KII and FGD protocols to explain the purpose of
the evaluation, what the participants will be asked to do, and to what extent we will protect
the privacy of their responses. We also explicitly asked participants for verbal agreement to
take part in the KII/FGD and to be audio-recorded. (We did not ask for written consent, as it
was not required, and obtaining written consent would provide identifying links between
participants and data that would not have existed otherwise, placing their privacy at greater
risk.) Also, given the nature of the questions we asked the students (about things like
bullying at their school), enumerators were instructed to watch carefully for any signs that
students were becoming distressed discussing these issues, and each school had an
identified point of contact (such as a guidance counsellor) who could be informed and
follow up if there are any concerns that a student experienced any distress.
Data storage and security. AIR adheres to all data storage and security requirements
involving personally identifiable information on project participants for multiple
government as well as non-government organisations. AIR is a registered institution with
the Office for Human Research Protections and has signed an assurance statement that we
will abide by federal regulations.
The AIR Information Security Policy states that all personally identifiable information that is
accessed, stored or transmitted on AIR-managed networks and computers is protected in
accordance with a written, project-level information security plan, upon which all personnel
on the project are briefed and required to comply. The project information security plan
includes a statement of applicable laws and regulations, the definition of the boundaries
and security category of the information that requires protection, and a description of the
appropriate security measures and procedures that are commensurate with the sensitivity
of the data in both the electronic and hard-copy domains. Laptops used by staff who collect
and manage data were protected with whole-drive disk encryption that prevents data
access should the laptop be lost or stolen. Sensitive identifiers were not permitted to be
stored on memory devices or transmitted over unsecured networks.
Special protections for children. AIR is strongly committed to the protection of children
across all aspects of our work. No member of the evaluation team was ever permitted to
take any child out of sight and hearing of adult guardians (such as parents or teachers), or to
be alone in any enclosed space with any child. Enumerators were instructed to always notify
an adult guardian if a child required the bathroom or any similar assistance, with the adult
guardian taking responsibility for addressing the child’s needs. AIR implemented a policy of
immediate termination of any project staff member for any violation of these rules, no
matter how slight. All enumerators were trained in AIR’s safeguarding procedures and
required to follow a code of conduct for conducting research with children.
AMERICAN INSTITUTES FOR RESEARCH® | AIR.ORG 204
Evaluation of the Implementation of CFS/ES Framework in Three Eastern Caribbean Countries
Ethical considerations. We did not anticipate any ethical concerns related to this evaluation
and did not experience any in the field. However, the team did take active steps to protect
evaluation participants from risk of exposure to COVID-19 during data collection. Enrolment
in this evaluation did not in any way affect the services or benefits available to participants.
Risks versus benefits. The evaluation activities do not impose any risks to participants
beyond what they would encounter in daily life. The greatest risk to participants was
potential embarrassment or other consequences should any identifiable information that
they provide become public knowledge. We took steps to minimise this risk by (a) training
enumerators in the protection of data, (b) setting ground rules at the beginning of FGDs
regarding the sharing of information by participants, (c) following the data protection
procedures we described earlier, (d) taking care not to include any information in evaluation
reports that could directly identify evaluation participants, and (e) notifying participants
during the informed consent process of any risks that they could be identified indirectly
based on their position (for example, there may only be one head of a teacher training
institution in a country). To reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the course of data
collection, enumerators followed national and school guidelines (such as wearing masks and
physical distancing) and conducted some KIIs with school staff remotely.
We could not promise any direct benefits to respondents based on their participation, but
they may benefit in the future if the evaluation strengthens the CFS/ES initiative (which
may, in turn, help people at systems levels to carry out their work better, and/or improve
conditions in schools for staff, students and parents).
Inclusion and equality. We did not exclude any subpopulations from this evaluation. At the
systems level, and with school staff, we expected the sample to reflect the population
holding those positions (whether mostly male, mostly female, or balanced; and other
characteristics such as disability and ethnicity). For focus groups with parents, whilst both
mothers and fathers were welcome to participate, only two fathers did so (and all other
parent participants were female). When holding FGDs with students, we held separate
groups for girls and for boys (with roughly equal numbers of girls and boys overall), to help
students feel comfortable speaking freely about their experiences.
Use of Incentives. We provided focus group participants with refreshments. For adult
stakeholders who completed questionnaires (teachers, non-teaching staff, and parents), we
provided a USD $10 top-up to their mobile data. For students who participating in FGDs or
completed questionnaires, we provided packages of school supplies.

Annex I. Parent/Guardian Consent for Child’s Participation
Dear Parent or Guardian:
The American Institutes for Research and Targeted Development Consulting are carrying out
a study of schools in [country]. This study is sponsored by UNICEF. The purpose of this study
is to help UNICEF learn how best to support schools to provide all students with a safe and
supportive learning environment.
What will my child be asked to do?
If you agree to your child’s participation, we may ask him/her to join a one-hour focus
group. For this ‘focus group,’ we will sit with a group of 6 to 8 children and ask them for
their opinions about different aspects of their school and school experiences. We will take
notes and also make an audio recording.
Is my child required to participate?
No, your child is not required to participate. At any time, you and/or your child can decide
to stop participating. There will no consequences for your child or your family if you decide
not to be in the study.
Why should my child participate in this activity?
Both UNICEF and the [country name] government are working to improve schools, so that
all students can feel safe, respected, welcome and encouraged. It is important for us to hear
directly from students about their experiences.
What are the risks and benefits if my child participates?
There are no known risks to your child if he/she participates. This study is not going to judge
any individual children or schools. We will ask your child to talk about what he/she observes
at school, not personal questions about his/her own individual experiences.
There are no direct benefits to your child if he/she participates. He/she will not be paid to
participate. Your child may indirectly benefit from taking part in this study, because the
information we learn from students may help UNICEF and the government improve schools.
How will you protect my child’s and family’s privacy?
We will never include your family’s or child's names any reports. The information your child
provides will not be shared or used outside of this study. The audio recordings from the
focus groups will only be accessible to members of the research team and will be destroyed
when the study finishes.
