EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Programme Description
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) North Macedonia 2016–2020 Country Programme highlighted the inclusion
of children with disabilities and introduced a disability component to all programmes. These efforts align with several
sustainable development goals (SDGs): SDG 1 as it relates to the financial costs to families of children with disabilities; SDG
3 as it relates to providing equitable and quality health care to children with disabilities, including identification and
habilitation/rehabilitation services; SDG 4 as it relates to providing quality inclusive education; and SDG 10 as it relates to
reducing inequalities between people with and without disabilities.
At the mid-point of programme implementation in early 2018, UNICEF, in collaboration with the government and key
partners, conducted a Light Strategic Review of the country programme, resulting in a shift in the program’s strategic
direction and a broadened focus from specific groups of vulnerable children to major issues concerning all children. While
this shift was considered necessary to accelerate reforms for the social good of children given the country’s readiness in
light of a leadership change, addressing the needs of children with disabilities and the commitment to inclusion remained
in UNICEF’s programme.
UNICEF North Macedonia’s most prominent efforts toward policy reform and advocacy for the rights of children with
disabilities can be summarized in the following six sectors.
1. Social Protection: Introducing a new model of disability assessment based on the International Classification of
Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) and adopting a rights-based model of disability in the country’s welfare
system.
2. Child Protection: Supporting the country’s effort to strengthen the childcare system, ensuring the
deinstitutionalisation of all children, and developing community-based services for children with disabilities and their
families.
3. Education: Developing a legal framework and inclusive practices that support the inclusion of children with disabilities
in the mainstream education system by 2023 and transforming ‘special’ schools to resource centres that support the
effort toward inclusion.
4. Health: Enhancing the capacities of front-line health care workers, including family doctors and patronage nurses,
and training them in early detection and early intervention for children with developmental disabilities.
5. Communication: Communication for social and behaviour change initiatives included awareness campaigns to
address the public’s negative attitudes and perceptions toward disability, community dialogue events, public
advocacy to support sector-specific reforms, and partnerships to promote inclusion in sport and culture.
6. COVID-19 Pandemic Response: Developing online individualized support for children with disabilities and their
families in early intervention, early stimulation, speech therapy, and psychological support.
Evaluation Purpose, Methodology, and Limitations
The purpose of this evaluation is to examine how and to what extent UNICEF North Macedonia’s inclusion programming
from 2016-2020 has contributed to addressing system-level bottlenecks impacting access to social, health, and education
services for children with disabilities and their ability to live in caring family environments, as is their right. The objective of
the evaluation is to inform UNICEF’s ongoing and future programming on behalf of children with disabilities and their
families. The intended audience is UNICEF country office programme officers and relevant duty bearers within and outside
of the government. UNICEF formed an Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) composed of duty bearers and other
stakeholders from across sectors, including government officials, advisors, and implementers. The ERG convened during
the inception phase of the evaluation as well as at its conclusion, to hear the findings and refine and prioritize the
recommendations.
Inclusive Development Partners (IDP) used the below methodologies for the evaluation:
• Planning and programme inquiry meetings with UNICEF programme officers to guide the evaluation design and
methodology and to validate findings.
• Desk-based review and portfolio analysis of UNICEF’s existing documentation and other existing documentation,
reports, and data.
• Country mission and data collection. Overall, feedback was collected from 42 stakeholders through key
informant interviews and focus group discussions and from 2,552 stakeholders via online surveys.
5
• Data analysis using evaluative frameworks (rubrics) based on the quality of the data and its alignment with global
normative standards for best practices in inclusion, per the CRPD and existing evidence.
This evaluation’s primary limitation was the lack of reliable or consistent data related to children with disabilities from
before and during the period of this evaluation. The sectorial approach used by UNICEF was an additional limitation, as it
focused not only on children with disabilities but also on other vulnerable categories of children. This created some
methodological challenges because it was necessary to extract interventions targeting children with disabilities from those
that, to some extent, also targeted other children. In order to mitigate this, the team conducted a set of targeted meetings
with relevant representatives of the different sectors in order to extrapolate the specific interventions that were related
to inclusion of children with disabilities, and following data collection, held additional meetings to validate findings.
Evaluation Findings
Relevance: UNICEF interventions were internally coherent and contributed strongly to producing the intended outcomes
(though, in some cases, outcome measurement data was not available). The work led to significant progress in addressing
the needs of children with disabilities and their families, but within each sector, some needs or intended outcomes have
not yet been met. UNICEF made strong efforts to involve relevant partners, but perceptions of stakeholder involvement
varied by stakeholder, and not all felt sufficiently involved.
Coherence: UNICEF worked to align actions and interventions and they were, to a significant extent, mutually
complementary and harmonized. UNICEF engaged multiple actors from the government, organizations of people with
disabilities, and the international donor community, and worked hard to align with other activities and to ensure the
synergy of all efforts.
Effectiveness: UNICEF-supported interventions contributed greatly to increasing the availability and supply of services as
well as qualified human resources. Children who have benefitted from the deinstitutionalisation process have much better
living conditions, but those living in small group homes need more individualized support than they are receiving.
Educators found that the training on inclusive education was very effective and expressed that they need more training
and additional personnel to support children with disabilities in mainstream schools. Medical professionals found their
training helpful in understanding and identifying disability and reducing unnecessary referrals; however, the overall lack
of health system personnel and infrastructure remains a barrier. The presence or absence of political will is a critical factor
in achievements and challenges related to UNICEF objectives. Social perceptions are also a key a factor.
Efficiency: Stakeholders agreed that UNICEF’s budget and human and technical resources were adequately budgeted
across all sectors, and a good division of expenses among donor organisations avoided the multiplication of costs. The
same programme results could not have been achieved with less resources; many stakeholders observed that more
resources were and are needed.
Impact: Although available data for rigorously measuring impact is limited, existing data and stakeholder reports indicated
that UNICEF’s inclusion programming made a significant impact, although geographical disparities in programme reach,
and gender and socioeconomic differences also exist generally and in relation to location (urban versus rural). UNICEF
significantly helped to positively shift the paradigm and improve public understanding on disability, but also acknowledged
that more work is needed to eliminate stigma and discrimination. Tangible services offered within and across sectors
(especially in social and child protection and education) contributed to needs being met to varying degrees, and UNICEF’s
simultaneous communications campaigns reinforced these efforts by pushing citizens to confront their assumptions and
biases. Caregivers, especially, were pleased that the public’s perception of their children had improved.
Sustainability: UNICEF interventions are integrated into national policies, though with varying degrees of detail and
specificity to enable implementation. Similarly, budget allocations exist in all sectors, but many stakeholders and
beneficiaries deem funding to be inadequate. Quality-assurance mechanisms are lagging and may need further
development; however, direct training in relation to this has taken place in the education sector with state education
inspectors. The country remains dependent on foreign technical and financial support for quality-assurance mechanisms
and capacity-building mechanisms. Long-term sustainability requires local governments to be more actively engaged in
the process.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Relevance
Conclusion 1. UNICEF’s interventions, which were based upon needs assessments, were relevant to the needs of
children with disabilities and their families, addressed many of these needs, and were planned and implemented with
the inclusion of key stakeholders. Participation from caregivers and OPDs could be strengthened, and data points to
gender disparities in access to services.
Strategic Recommendation (SR) 1. To ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and their inclusion in society is set
on the political agenda and that policies are relevant and include measures for ensuring sustainable provision of social
services, facilitate networking and opportunities for advocacy between rights holders, particularly representatives of OPDs
and parents of children with disabilities, with duty-bearers, particularly members of parliament and representatives of
political parties. Priority: MEDIUM. Responsible party: GOV.
• Operational Recommendation (OR) 1.1 Support and facilitate the work of the members of the National Coordination
Body for implementation of the CRPD related to inclusion of CwD. The support should focus on improvement of
coordination among the members and cooperation with CSOs and OPDs.
• OR 1.2 Provide support for implementation of the measures and activities planned in the National Strategy for
Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities related to inclusion of Children with Disabilities. The Strategy and corresponding
action plan should ensure that the interventions in this area are well planned, coordinated among different sectors
and in accordance with the HRBA, the CRPD and the latest global evidence on best practices.
• OR 1.3 Support coordination, networking and coalition building activities for OPDs advocating for inclusion of children
with disabilities in different sectors and on behalf of different disability types. Establish a structured consultation
mechanism for engaging OPDs and parents of children with disabilities in the planning and implementation processes
within UNICEF as well as in sectors where UNICEF works.
SR 2. Take measures to understand and address the gender gap in children with disabilities accessing social services.
Conduct research to examine the cause(s) behind fewer females than males using social services as well as whether there
are different needs across genders, and, based on the findings, design or adjust training and programme interventions to
close gaps and target needs more accurately. Priority: MED. Responsible party: UNICEF.
• OR 2. Conduct another KAP study that includes collecting data related to gender disparities, support gender
mainstreaming in policy making processes, and develop training modules for duty-bearers on gender-specific aspects
of service provision.
Coherence
Conclusion 2. Across all sectors, UNICEF engaged multiple actors and made concerted efforts to align with other
activities and efforts in the country. Nevertheless, the lack of a clear, detailed TOC to drive and focus programming, as
well as the lack (in many cases) of baseline data to inform goal and target setting as well as measurement of progress,
may have limited the potential for even greater coherence and synergy.
SR 3. Develop a robust and detailed TOC that is informed by baseline data, which allows for outcome goals related to
increases, decreases, and improvements to be set and measured with more rigor than stakeholder perceptions can
provide. UNICEF would lead this effort but validate assumptions, goals, and targets with both Government duty bearers
as well as rights holders among the disability population. Priority: MED. Responsible party: UNICEF.
• OR 3. Conduct another KAP study to continue measuring changes in the general population. Also conduct baseline
studies of duty-bearers, by sector, ahead of interventions, to understand needs and assess skills and knowledge.
Analyse data for themes that transcend sectors and can inform the ToC and support alignment and coherence during
intervention planning.
Effectiveness
Conclusion 3. UNICEF-supported interventions contributed greatly to eliminating bottlenecks by increasing the
availability and supply of services as well as qualified human resources and facilitated large positive changes in public
perception of disability and inclusion.
7
SR 4. Carry forward capacity-building activities with targeted trainings as well as develop other tools, such as long-term
mentoring and peer-to-peer activities, which are approaches that educators, social workers and other service providers
view as successful and desired. Priority: HIGH. Responsible party: GOV.
• OR 4.1 Introduce methodologies that will measure the impact of the capacity-building activities for a long period of
time after they have been completed.
• OR 4.2. Provide a clear transition plan for supporting students’ move from primary into secondary school, which
includes training secondary school teachers and support staff and ensuring that the adequate support measures are
in included in plans and budgets. Support Resource Centres to engage and train additional staff and provide technical
resources for effective support to schools.
SR 5. Enhance the development of a diverse and functional set of services for children with disabilities such as: alternative
care units’ foster care as a substitute for small group homes, support for the transition of existing day care centres into
Disability Support Centres, tailored services for social inclusion of children with disabilities, and gender mainstreaming in
service planning and provision. Priority: HIGH. Responsible party: GOV.
• OR 5.1. Provide technical support to the MLSP and other relevant stakeholders for further development of alternative
and foster care, including support in development of policies and standards, trainings as well as direct support to
alternative and foster care units.
• OR 5.2. To better ensure that children with disabilities living in small group homes have access to educational and
other activities necessary to support their inclusion in communities, provide children currently residing in them with
better supports, including personal assistants outside of the care provided by the SGH staff and increased involvement
and engagement from the children themselves, their parents, and the surrounding communities in planning and
carrying out services. In addition, support municipalities, local CSOs, sport clubs, and cultural centres in developing
and conducting cultural, sport and other socially meaningful activities for inclusion of children with disabilities living
in small group homes, alternative care units and foster care.
SR 6. Promote legislative amendments that will ensure that families of children with disabilities are subsidized for specific
disability-related costs (e.g., medical treatments and diagnostics, specialist care, medication and supplements, assistive
devices, transport costs, etc.), so that those costs do not create or exacerbate a state of poverty for these families. Priority:
HIGH. Responsible party: GOV.
• OR 6. Collect healthcare needs and cost data from families through the KAP survey mentioned above in OR 2. Work
with relevant government ministries and agencies to assess the feasibility of covering additional costs as well as to
identify and negotiate efficiencies with service or product providers. Explore social entrepreneurship as a means of
supplementing outstanding benefits (see SR 10 below).
Efficiency
Conclusion 4. While in-depth financial analysis was outside the scope of this evaluation, stakeholders agreed that
UNICEF funding as well as human and technical resources were adequately budgeted across all sectors, and there was
a good division of expenses among donor organisations to avoid the multiplication of costs.
SR 7. Advocate for greater and more efficient public spending on children with disabilities, including better and more
equitable availability of support services. Priority: HIGH. Responsible party: GOV.
OR 7. A state-conducted financial analysis of current spending could uncover ways to increase efficiency among
existing service providers as well as inform the provision of new services in areas of the country that still lack support
for children with disabilities. Service providers themselves, as well as families of children with disabilities, are likely to
have useful insights into how to make the most of public spending.
Impact
Conclusion 5. Many sectors lacked clear, measurable targets for intervention outcomes related to inclusion at the start
of the 2016-2020 programme. However, M&E reporting showed progress on the majority of output indicators related
to inclusion of children with disabilities, and all stakeholders as well as documentation pointed to UNICEF’s positive
impact on shifting public perception of disability.
8
SR 8. Further strengthen internal monitoring systems for tracking progress and support and impel State efforts for setting
up an adequate and accessible unified system for collecting and processing data on children with disabilities. Do this in
cooperation with relevant ministries, institutions, and the State Statistical Office. Priority: HIGH. Responsible party: GOV.
• OR 8.1 Negotiate and facilitate collaboration and sharing between the health, education, and social protection
management information systems (HMIS and EMIS), so that all relevant data regarding children with disabilities is
accessible by qualified service providers. Such data will also provide baseline figures that can inform UNICEF
programming, which will further enable impact evaluation.
• OR 8.2. Developing a more robust and detailed ToC (SR 2) and using baseline data to set targets can drive robust
impact and outcome measurement, which will enable more targeted planning for future and ongoing interventions.
SR 9. Continue and expand efforts to shift public opinion on disability through communications and awareness raising
campaigns that draw from and highlight recent successes. Priority: MED. Responsible party: UNICEF
• OR 9. Work with families of children with and without disabilities, OPDs, educators, and heath care providers to
share positive experiences within schools, health centres, and during daily life of children with disabilities being
included in ways they were not previously.
Sustainability
Conclusion 6. Across all four sectors, UNICEF interventions are integrated into national policies and budgets, which is an
important outcome and a strong foundation for sustainability.
SR 10. Encourage efforts for the increased sustainability of social services through decentralising and introducing social
entrepreneurship as an innovative means for funding social services. Priority: LOW. Responsible party: GOV.
• OR 10.1 In cooperation with other international donors, support local government efforts to set up and implement a
local social protection program that will be focused on inclusion of children with disabilities. Social services could be
much more cost-efficient if planned and implemented by the local government, which is closer to the citizens. Support
the Government to strengthen the donations from the central budget to the local government and require that they
match the funds from their own sources or local donors. In addition, track spending to ensure that the funds are used
for children with disabilities.
• OR 10.2 Train OPDs and other CSOs that provide services to introduce and utilize social entrepreneurship endeavours
as a means to enhance sustainable funding for service provision. Train service providers on skills for fund-raising and
conducting economic activities for funding their efforts so that they can secure additional sources of financing that
will allow for continuous provision of services that are less dependent on international donor support.
Lessons learned
1. The interventions implemented by UNICEF would have benefited from a more detailed ToC document which
precisely defines the causal linkages within and across its programs and the potential internal and external factors
which may impede or slow down implementation of sector-level interventions. This would have also enabled more
effective progress monitoring and measurement of outcomes and impact.
2. UNICEF’s inclusion interventions were gender-neutral in design, but data showing disparities in boys’ and girls’
enrolment in social services and education indicates that more attention should be paid to the different and unique
needs of girls, and programming should include gender-specific elements and associated training for service
providers.
3. Although UNICEF interventions are national in scope, the consultative and decision-making processes were mainly
centralized and did not always consider the regional perspectives and specifics. This resulted in the centralization of
services and prevalence of the needs of rights holders from the capital city.

PART 1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the main findings, conclusions, and recommendations of an evaluation of UNICEF Interventions
Addressing Inclusion of Children with Disabilities in North Macedonia implemented from 2016 to 2020. The
evaluation was commissioned by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and conducted by Inclusive
Development Partners (IDP) in 2022.
The purpose of the evaluation was to examine how and to what extent UNICEF North Macedonia’s inclusion
programming has contributed in addressing system-level bottlenecks impacting the access to rights for children with
disabilities in the area of social protection, healthcare and education, their ability to live in caring family
environments, as well as their right to equality in line with the international conventions for human rights protection.
The objective of the evaluation is to inform UNICEF’s ongoing and future programming in order to ensure full
realization of the rights of children with disabilities and their families and addressing any gender gaps that may exist
in the access to rights. The intended audience is UNICEF country office programme officers and relevant duty
bearers within and outside of the government.
This report of findings is organised in three parts, structured as follows:
Part 1 describes the country context within which UNICEF’s disability inclusion efforts took place and includes a
description of the interventions; an overview of the evaluation, including the purpose, objectives, and scope as well
as IDP’s approach and methodology; and a summary of the evaluation’s limitations.
Part 2 presents the evaluation findings in relation to six Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development/Development Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC) evaluation criteria and the practice sectors of
interest, as required in the Terms of Reference (TOR).
Part 3 provides conclusions and recommendations.
Country Context
Republic of North Macedonia is located in south-eastern Europe. It is a NATO member and a candidate for
membership in the European Union (EU). On 19 July 2022, the EU opened accession negotiations with North
Macedonia1. North Macedonia has ratified most international human rights instruments on both the United
Nations (UN) and European levels, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and
the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).
North Macedonia has a multi-ethnic society with a resident population of 1,836,713.2 It faces negative population
growth of -5.4% (data from 2021). The main ethnic groups are Macedonians who comprise 58.4% of the population
and Albanians who are 24.3%. Other ethnic groups include Turks, Romani, Serbs, Bosniaks, and Vlachs.3 The
Macedonian and the Albanian languages are the official languages;4 however, in local self-governments, other
languages may also have official status.
The country is governed by a centre-left led coalition of political parties with a mandate until 2024, and this coalition
holds a narrow majority in the legislature. The current ruling coalition took power in 2017 following a severe and

long political crisis5. Since then, reform efforts have been implemented in the areas of judiciary and rule of law,
electoral reform, media, social protection, prevention of discrimination as well as inclusion of persons with
disabilities. However, the country still struggles with corruption, cronyism, and poor democratic capacity in key
political factors.
North Macedonia is an upper middle-income country that has made great strides in reforming its economy over the
last decade; however, it remains one of the poorest countries in Europe with poor living standards and a significant
percentage of the population living below the poverty line. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the country
significantly. By the end of September 2022, North Macedonia had recorded in total around 342,519 cases and
about 9,527 deaths related to the pandemic,6 which is one of the highest mortality rates per million in the world.7
Around 41% of the population was fully vaccinated by the end of September 2022.
There is a lack of consistent and comparable statistics on persons with disabilities in the country8 and the only official
statistical data from the State Statistical Office provides data on minors with disabilities who receive certain types of
social services. According to these data, there were 4,433 children with disabilities registered in 2020.9 On the other
hand, the government’s deinstitutionalisation strategy calculated a total of 7,346 children with disabilities already
registered with social services, 43 in institutions, and another 700 under the general social service net, estimating
the overall number as 8,388 children with disabilities in North Macedonia in 2018. Until the adoption of the
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) assessment as an official state policy in 2021,
the approach towards disability was, to a large degree, aligned with the medical model. This contributed to high
levels of stigma and discrimination towards persons with disabilities. Two local surveys conducted in 2018 found
that persons with disabilities and parents of children with disabilities do not consider themselves as equal with other
citizens (99.5%), do not enjoy equal protection of the law in comparison with other citizens (83%), and that they are
discriminated against (87%).10 While the situation is slowly changing both on policy level and on level pf perceptions,
as the two consecutive KAP surveys (elaborated below) indicate, there is need for developing an improved human
rights culture and embedding child rights in social behaviour.11
UNICEF Programme Description
UNICEF adheres to the CRPD definition of persons with disabilities: Persons with disabilities include those who have
long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which, in interaction with various barriers, may
hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others. UNICEF’s North Macedonia 2016–
2020 Country Programme highlighted the inclusion of children with disabilities and introduced a disability
component to all programmes. These efforts align with several sustainable development goals (SDGs): SDG 1 as it
relates to the financial costs to families of children with disabilities; SDG 3 as it relates to providing equitable and
quality health care to children with disabilities, including identification and habilitation/rehabilitation services; SDG
4 as it relates to providing quality inclusive education; and SDG 10 as it relates to reducing inequalities between
5 The crisis originated in 2015 with allegations of massive wiretapping but was exacerbated in April 2016. A sequence of protests followed
by a protocol to the Przino political agreement resulted in early parliamentary elections in December 2016. The election results also
complicated the crises by igniting inter-ethnic tensions that escalated into the events of 27 April 2017.

people with and without disabilities. In line with the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy and the principle of
Leave No One Behind, UNICEF is making disability an integral component of its own policies, programmes and
operations.
At the mid-point of programme implementation in early 2018, UNICEF, in collaboration with the government and
key partners, conducted a Light Strategic Review of the country programme. This resulted in a shift in the program’s
strategic direction and a broadened focus from specific groups of vulnerable children to major issues concerning all
children. While this shift was considered necessary to accelerate reforms for the social good of children given the
country’s readiness in light of a leadership change, addressing the needs of children with disabilities and a
commitment to inclusion remained in UNICEF’s programme.
UNICEF North Macedonia’s most prominent efforts toward policy reform and advocacy for the rights of children
with disabilities from 2016-2020 were national in scope and can be summarized in the six sectors described below.
Annex H contains a table describing the key stakeholders, including their relationships and contributions to the
interventions.
1. Social Protection: Introducing a new model of disability assessment based on the International
Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) and adopting a rights-based model of disability in
the country’s welfare system. UNICEF allocated $496,102 to these efforts.12
2. Child Protection: Supporting the country’s effort to strengthen the childcare system, ensuring the
deinstitutionalisation of all children, and developing community-based services for children with disabilities
and their families. UNICEF allocated $191,546 to these efforts.
3. Education: Developing a legal framework and inclusive practices that support the inclusion of children with
disabilities in the mainstream education system by 2023 and transforming ‘special’ schools to resource
centres that support the effort toward inclusion. UNICEF allocated $3,402,200 to these efforts.
4. Health: Enhancing the capacities of front-line health care workers, including family doctors and patronage
nurses, and training them in early detection and early intervention for children with developmental
disabilities. UNICEF allocated $752,018 to these efforts.
5. Communication: Multimedia campaigns for social and behavioural change to address the public’s negative
attitudes and perceptions toward disability, including community dialogue events to open discussions at
the community level on inclusion, public advocacy to support sector-specific reforms, and partnerships to
promote inclusion in sport and culture.
6. COVID-19 Pandemic Response: Rapidly developing and launching a study on the social and economic
effects of the pandemic on children, noting that children with disabilities are among the most vulnerable
to wide ranging impacts from COVID-19, and preparing online resources through the Social Protection and
Education sectors.
Evaluation Purpose and Methodology
Evaluation Purpose, Objective, and Scope
The purpose of this evaluation is to examine how and to what extent UNICEF North Macedonia’s inclusion
programming has contributed to addressing system-level bottlenecks impacting access to social, health, and
education services for children with disabilities and their ability to live in caring family environments, as is their right.
The objective of the evaluation is to inform UNICEF’s ongoing and future programming on behalf of children with

disabilities and their families, including any gender-specific needs that should be considered. The evaluation
assesses UNICEF programmes’ effectiveness and devises a guide for any further plans or programmes targeting the
inclusion and participation of children with disabilities and their families in all aspects of life.
This evaluation focuses on all UNICEF North Macedonia programming related to the inclusion of children with
disabilities during the five-year period of the 2016–2020 country programme. The evaluation is primarily national in
scope and considers UNICEF’s efforts across five sectors: education, child protection, health and nutrition, social
protection, and communication. Additionally, UNICEF provided support to families of children with disabilities
during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and the evaluation also examines these activities through 2020 as well. The
evaluation was conducted in three phases: inception, data collection, and reporting.
The findings and recommendations contained within this report will be used by UNICEF North Macedonia during
strategic planning for future programming related to disability inclusion and will also provide actionable information
that can be used by the Government during policy and implementation planning discussions. The evaluation
commenced in November 2021 and concluded in October 2022.
Evaluation Frameworks
IDP applied a multi-method approach that blended participatory quantitative and qualitative methods and followed
the revised OECD/DAC evaluation criteria13 appropriate to including the voices of diverse stakeholder groups. During
the inception period, the research team reviewed the 26 evaluation questions (EQs) listed in the TOR and, in light
of the available documentation and anticipated limitations impacting evaluability, and in consultation with UNICEF
about prioritization of questions, IDP proposed a reduced list of 15 EQs to which UNICEF agreed. (The EQs are
included in the findings section of this report, and the full evaluation matrix is included in Annex A.)
To frame the evaluation, the evaluation team initially examined materials provided by UNICEF. The Country
Programme Document (CPD) for 2016–2020 included a results framework with indicators relating specifically to
children with disabilities. However, baseline information and targets were missing for several indicators, not all
sectors were included, and the CPD lacked an overall theory of change (TOC) describing the assumptions underlining
how UNICEF’s efforts to focus support for children with disabilities could lead to positive outcomes within and across
sectors. A ‘think piece’ that was developed during the planning stages of the 2016–2020 country programme
provided information to create a reconstructed TOC, which is included in Annex D. This was the evaluation team’s
initial attempt to mitigate this limitation. However, the team determined that the reconstructed TOC was not
sufficiently robust to frame the evaluation, given the inconsistency or lack of data to use for measuring “increases”
and “reductions” as specified in the TOC. Instead, in consultation with UNICEF, the evaluation team proposed to
present the evaluation findings in the following ways:
Firstly, in the findings section below, the report contains narrative findings organised by criterion and sector. In
Annex B, each subsection has a corresponding table summarizing the finding by EQ and sector. The table includes
two rankings. The first refers to the coherence and quality of the evidence gathered by the team (Evidence
Ranking),14 which the team viewed as important to include given the lack of quantitative and comparative data as
well as sectors or EQs lacking multiple sources of data to consider for triangulation. The other ranking refers to the
extent to which the outcome(s) articulated in the EQ were met by the programme (EQ Answer) based on available
evidence. A brief justification is also included in the tables. The table below provides definitions for each ranking.

Secondly, it is important to situate the evaluation within a global normative framework based on the principles of
the CRPD, including progressive realization,15 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To this end and
because the OECD/DAC evaluation criteria—while thorough—are not specific to disability inclusion, the evaluation
team used separate normative frameworks to apply an additional layer of evaluation to UNICEF’s programming.
These were developed based on the existing global evidence base for practices relating to disability inclusion and
contain evidence-based standards. The team scored the UNICEF interventions against these standards by sector.
These findings are woven throughout the report and summarized in the conclusion section. The frameworks, scores,
and evidence base are in Annex C.
Methodology
The below methodologies were used for the evaluation. The evaluation team held bi-weekly quality assurance
meetings to review data collection methods and primary data collected to ensure evaluative rigor and relevance. In
addition, UNICEF formed an Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) composed of duty bearers and other stakeholders
from across sectors, including government officials, advisors, and implementers. The ERG convened during the
inception phase of the evaluation as well as at its conclusion, to hear the findings and refine and prioritize the
recommendations.
Planning and Programme Inquiry Meetings: To ensure that the evaluation team understood the scope of UNICEF’s
15 According to Art. 4, Sec. 2 of the CRPD, ‘Each State must take measures to realize economic, social, and cultural rights progressively,
using the greatest amount of available resources to do so. This obligation, commonly referred to as progressive realization, acknowledges
that it often takes time to realize many of these rights fully, for example, when social-security or health-care systems must be created or
improved.’ This evaluation will incorporate the view of progressive realization as a pathway approach to inclusion for children with
disabilities.
14
relevant programming, IDP’s evaluators began the evaluation by holding inquiry meetings with UNICEF programme
officers and held additional meetings as necessary. These meetings added contextual information to guide the
evaluation design and methodology and to validate findings. They also allowed the team to identify and obtain
relevant documents and materials and collect contact information from stakeholders.
Desk-Based Review and Portfolio Analysis: IDP conducted a desk review, including a review of UNICEF’s existing
documentation, evaluation reports, and relevant programme documents; academic and grey literature research
and studies; government strategies; legal and policy documents; and primary and secondary data reports. The desk
review included a focus on gender-specific data on children with disabilities in the country.
Country Mission and Data Collection: For qualitative data collection, this evaluation used a combination of
purposive sampling (specific individuals or organizations identified by UNICEF and the team of evaluators as
stakeholders within each sector) and snowball sampling (additional informants identified during data collection or
document review) to identify relevant stakeholders who had knowledge and experience in the respective areas of
evaluation. Caregivers of children with disabilities were recruited through organisations of persons with disabilities
(OPDs). For quantitative data collection, IDP conducted online surveys of personnel in the education sector (teachers
and school support staff as well as resource centre coordinators) through the “Eduino”16 platform and the health
sector (family doctors and patronage nurses), though their professional associations. The evaluation team applied
cognitive testing to the surveys with individuals from the stakeholder populations prior to conducting surveys, and
the surveys preceded interviews with members of these groups. Wherever possible, the team collected data on the
gender of stakeholders and survey participants. Respondents to the survey indicated their willingness to be
contacted for a follow-up focus group discussion, and participants were selected from this list.
The sample was designed in collaboration with UNICEF and included geographic and gender representation.
Representatives from relevant ministries and state institutions as well as from implementing partners (IPs) and
service providers were among those interviewed. Overall, feedback was collected from 42 stakeholders through
KIIs and FDGs and 2,552 stakeholders via online surveys. The sample is outlined in the table below, and a more
detailed Stakeholder Map is included in Annex H.

Government Beneficiary Data
Interview and discussion protocols served as a framework, rather than a script, in that protocols included more
questions than a given interview or discussion allowed. (See Annex G for protocols.) The data points yielded in this
phase helped shed light on many of the evaluation questions and revealed key findings that were triangulated
against the desk review and quantitative sources of data collection, as possible.
Data Analysis: IDP compiled and triangulated the different data sources to evaluate trends, good practices, future
opportunities, and potential areas of growth in alignment with the OECD/DAC evaluation criteria and sectors of the
evaluation. Qualitative data was analysed using a rapid-analysis approach. Quantitative data complements the
qualitative data and is especially helpful in examining the effectiveness of a program, though rigorous measurement
of impact is limited, as described below. Quantitative data analysis was applied to survey data collected directly
through the evaluation and primarily includes simple descriptive statistics and reporting frequencies. Because many
indicators are measured through both quantitative and qualitative analysis, this evaluation largely used a multi-
method approach.
Evaluation Limitations
This evaluation’s primary limitation was the lack of data related to children with disabilities from before the period
of this evaluation (prior to 2016), the lack of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) data during the period of the
evaluation (2016–2020), and in some cases, the inconsistency or confusing nature of the data from 2016-2020 that
was available. Such data includes numbers of children with disabilities (including disaggregated demographic data),
numbers of programme beneficiaries in different sectors, detailed budgetary and finance data (most relevant to the
efficiency and sustainability criteria), and educational performance data. This limitation relates to the lack of a robust
TOC, mentioned above. This lack of data hindered the research team’s ability to assess the impact of UNICEF’s
programming and increased the importance of the qualitative data that the team collected from stakeholders,
although quantitative data is included wherever possible.
The sectorial approach used by UNICEF was an additional limitation, as it focused not only on children with
disabilities but also on other vulnerable categories of children (e.g., Roma children, victims of violence). This created
some methodological challenges because it was necessary to extract interventions targeting children with
disabilities from those that, to some extent, also targeted other children. (For example, the deinstitutionalisation
process was focused also on children without paternal care, children with behavioural problems and at social risk,
etc.; the educational inclusion interventions in the beginning phases also included socially disadvantaged children,
with a focus on Roma children). In order to mitigate this, the team firstly conducted a set of targeted meetings with
relevant representatives of the different sectors in order to extrapolate the specific interventions that were related
to inclusion of children with disabilities. Based on these meetings, the team purposefully focused the interview and
survey questions to refer only to children with disabilities. After collecting data, the team conducted validation
meetings with the UNICEF sectoral program managers in order to ensure that the data gathered corresponded with
the specific interventions targeting children with disabilities.
16
Ethical Considerations
The IDP research team followed the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards17, and adhered
to UNICEF’s procedure on Ethical Standards for Research and Evaluation18. Team members completed training on
research ethics through the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) program, and upheld the obligations
of evaluators to maintain independence, impartiality, credibility, and accountability and disclose and avoid conflicts
of interest. IDP formally applied for and received ethical clearance from UNICEF before conducting primary data
collection with caregivers of children with disabilities, who were selected with support from OPDs (see Annex K).
Informed consent to participate as well as to be audio recorded was (separately) obtained from all participants prior
to data collection, and participation in the evaluation was completely voluntary. IDP did not conduct research with
children. Fortunately, at the time of data collection, local COVID-19 rates were low. However, the team adjusted the
format of key informant interviews (KIIs) (online or in person) according to the availability and will of interviewees
and took safety precautions when meeting in person. The focus group discussions (FGDs) were all conducted
virtually to allow a range of stakeholders across the country to easily participate. All data remained anonymous, and
identifying information was redacted. Data was stored on a secure server that is only accessible by the research
team.
PART 2. EVALUATION FINDINGS
This section presents the evaluation findings by sector and in relation to the six OECD/DAC evaluation criteria.
Summary tables with answers to the evaluation questions, rankings, and justifications can be found in Annex B.
Relevance
EQ 1.1 Was the design of the programmes and interventions/activities internally coherent and adequate for
producing the intended outcomes?
Across all sectors, stakeholders and available supporting documentation confirmed that UNICEF’s interventions were
internally coherent and contributed strongly to producing the outcomes intended by UNICEF (though, in some cases,
outcome measurement data was not available). Nevertheless, rights holders identified outcomes that were not within
UNICEF’s plans, but were desired by rights holders and have not been realized.
All sectors
UNICEF’s actions and interventions in different sectors were, to a great extent, internally coherent, with some
exceptions expressed by stakeholders. For example, the ICF reform was a precondition for the inclusive education
interventions. However, stakeholders had some concerns that the process was not accompanied with sufficient and
necessary preparatory and capacity-building activities. There was a one-year vacuum at the beginning of the
programme when the school inclusion teams (SITs) were not yet prepared, and schools referred all children with
disabilities for an assessment at the ICF centre in Skopje because the other centres were not yet established.
As another example of coherence, the ICF model makes it possible for children with disabilities who are
deinstitutionalised to have their abilities adequately identified so that they may benefit from inclusive education
that is tailored to their individual abilities. New social services, especially personal assistance, have the potential to

perspectives on the part of various ministers can affect the
overall approach to disability inclusion. In order to enable
implementation of policies, UNICEF frequently played a role of mediator between ministries of different political
party background.
Additionally, there were some concerns expressed particularly by caregivers concerning the scope and the content
of the interventions. According to them, the interventions, though comprehensive, did not address all challenges
impeding inclusion of children with disability. Several examples were shared. Firstly, the social protection reforms
were not accompanied with a parallel support for the health insurance system reform, indicating that better
coordination mechanisms are needed. More specifically, children with disabilities and their families are exposed to
additional poverty risks because their health insurance does not cover the costs of supplements and some of the
medications children with disabilities must take.20 Even with reforming the cash benefits system, escaping poverty
is difficult for families of children with disabilities if they do not have access to affordable health care. This, in turn,
can impact children’s ability to consistently attend and participate in school. Secondly, related to healthcare is the
lack of tangible improvement in access to adequate healthcare services on the secondary and tertiary level. And
thirdly, the interventions, while (justifiably) focused on inclusion in primary education, had limited outreach in pre-
school and secondary education.
EQ 1.2 To what extent did the interventions address the needs of children with disabilities and their families,
including any gender-specific needs?
Across all sectors, stakeholders and available documentation confirmed that UNICEF’s interventions led to significant
progress in addressing the needs of children with disabilities and their families, but within each sector, some needs or
intended outcomes have not yet been met. The design of interventions was gender-neutral, an approach that was
accepted by the vast majority of stakeholders. Stakeholders did not identify many gender-specific needs, except for the
stigma towards disability which was assessed as more characteristic for girls with disabilities in traditional communities
but was not specifically targeted by the interventions.

Social Protection
While stakeholders agreed that the old model needed to change, there was no consensus about the extent to which
social protection interventions met the needs of intended beneficiaries. Support in developing and setting up an
entirely new model21 for disability assessment was singled out as the key element from which all other reforms
were dependent. The existing assessment model was outdated, based on the medical approach on disability, and
not in line with the human-rights based approach as assessed by CRPD. This so-called categorization model ensured

about whether the new model is adequate to respond to their
needs. One positive change is that parents’/guardians’ salary
compensation was increased almost threefold for their shorter working hours due to caring for their child with a
disability.23 The amendments to the Child Protection Law brought a 20% increase in the Special Benefit for children
with disabilities from 4.202 MKD to 5.020 MKD. However, if a child with a disability is in assisted living, foster care,
or other institution, they are not eligible for this support. Data from the State Statistical Office shows that there is a
slight decrease in the poverty rate and that social transfers are contributing to this decrease.
None of the stakeholders identified gender-specific needs with regards to the availability and use of services by girls
and boys with disabilities. In addition, no need for more effective gender responsive practices by duty bearers was
noted. However, a government and a CSO representative each mentioned that families of children with disabilities
sometimes do not provide equal opportunities for access to services to girls with disability compared to boys with
disability, especially in rural and traditional communities. This may result in girls experiencing unequal enjoyment of
rights, which can be seen in the lower use of social and educational services (see under Impact).
21 The new model foresees the establishment of nine assessment bodies in the larger towns throughout the country. Each assessment
body will work with children and families at their place of residence in the respective region. Its main task will include information
gathering about a child and his/her environment; assessment of functioning and setting diagnosis of general health conditions; and
regular follow-up with families and service providers. The assessment body shall consist of four permanent members (paediatrician or
general practitioner, defectologist, psychologist, and social worker) as well as other non-permanent members. The number of non-
permanent members varies depending on the needs of the child. The parent and/or a person of trust who is selected by the parent is a
non-permanent member of the body.
22 Personal assistance service was firstly restricted to persons 18 years of age or older; however, after significant public reactions, it was
change to 6 years old and above with an amendment of the Social Protection Law from July 2021. Yet it is still limited to persons with
physical disabilities and persons who are blind.
23 The amount increased from 4.800 MKD to 50% from the actual average salary that the parent received in the previous year but not
more than 50% from the average salary in the country – cir. 13.000 MKD. (Art. 55 from the LSP).

Child Protection
The interventions contributed to ensuring that the rights of children with disabilities, who are protected through
both the CRC (Arts. 2, 3, 19, and 23) as well as the CRPD (Art. 19), are implemented in practice. Stakeholders consider
UNICEF’s support essential in the progress made, but not all desired outcomes of the DI process (outside of the
scope of UNICEF interventions) have been achieved. The conditions for children with disabilities living in residential
institutions were very poor and inhumane.25 With support from UNICEF, children with disabilities were resettled to
facilities with far better living conditions than what they experienced in institutions. The resettlement in small group
homes and UNICEF’s support contributed to children with disabilities having access to services (educational, social,
etc.) that were not available to them in institutions.
Education
The inclusive education interventions provided a significant step forward to meet the needs of students with
disabilities to learn in an inclusive setting, both in policy and practice, and helped to illuminate additional needs. The
vast majority of educators surveyed agreed that the new educational inclusion policies and associated interventions
are relevant to the needs of children with disabilities and their families. Specific policies that educators considered
are listed in Figure 1 below. Across these policy points, less than 8% of educators rated any as irrelevant, and the
largest proportion of educators rated them as very relevant, with the highest being 64.7% for educational assistants
(EAs) and the lowest being 46.1% for individualized education plans (IEPs).

During the FGD with educators, it was evident that implementation can vary widely by school. One educator said,
‘The policies have been in place for [a] few years now, and I think they are well interrelated. However, the
implementation is not always as it should be.’ Another said, ‘We teachers do not have the needed resources and
trainings…. [Since] inclusion is a national policy, there should be national trainings. I don’t think enough is being
invested in this field.’26 Yet, despite feeling a need for more training and noting the relevance of EAs, some educators
also expressed that they were able to bring more professionalism and relevant experience to teaching students with
disabilities than the special educators or EAs in their schools. Resource centre personnel shared similar concerns
about implementation quality. One example provided during the FGD related to a school where parents were not
included in IEP development.

representatives noted that UNICEF managed to detect all bottlenecks with regards to the needs of children with
disabilities and address them through the program. Overall, the shift from segregation to inclusion is taking place,
and while the education sector is only in partial alignment with several normative standards, progressive realization
is well underway.
Health

problems remain with the lack of access to
specialized health care services.28 All
stakeholders interviewed indicated that some
medicines and supplements necessary for
children with disabilities are not on the Health
Insurance Fund list of approved medicines. As
such, they cannot be purchased via the
insurance scheme and the families incur the
cost, which is a significant financial burden for
many families. Additional barriers include the
long waiting list for diagnostic procedures and
treatment, and the lack of good quality health
care outside of greater urban centres or the
capital. This results in parents of children with
disabilities detouring from the public health
care system into private hospitals where, again, they face a significant financial burden in covering costs. Lastly,
health care providers typically do not have access to sign language interpreters, and medical reports are not
available in braille. A situational analysis from 2021 referred to health care providers’ lack of trainings on how to
communicate with persons with disabilities; this lack of training impedes patients’ right to information and reduces
the judgment capacity of the health care providers.29 Because of these issues, more work is needed to be in full
alignment with normative standards.

Across all sectors, stakeholders and available documentation confirmed that UNICEF made efforts to involve relevant
partners, but perceptions of stakeholder involvement varied by stakeholder, and not all felt sufficiently involved.
Social Protection
Key stakeholders were involved in programme design, implementation, and evaluation, however, with differing
roles and impact. Stakeholders named UNICEF as one of the international organisations that permanently conducts
consultations with the government, and all interventions were planned in cooperation and coordination with
government units. Evaluators assessed that the process for introducing the assessment model was inclusive, with
ownership shared by different institutions as well as organisations of practitioners.30

30 The new assessment model for additional education, social, and health support to children and youth, based on the International
Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF), was also piloted in cooperation with the Association of Special Educators.
22
With regards to the other stakeholders, they shared that their involvement was secured through their participation
in working groups for drafting the laws, in public consultations and hearings, and in commenting on draft
documents. Various interviewees voiced concerns about the extent to which the voices of people with disabilities
and parents were taken in consideration. While parent organisations were invited to provide feedback, they and
OPDs were consulted only at the later stages of the policymaking process. Parents also reported that a wider
outreach would have ensured more parents’ views were represented in the process. Once reforms were in the
implementation stage, OPDs played a key role in informing families of children with disabilities about social
protection programmes. While there is room for improvement, UNICEF’s intentional inclusion of stakeholders
within the disability community in discussions about social protection programmes represents full alignment with
normative standards.
Child Protection
All UNICEF interventions in this sector were planned in advance, following a consultation with the Ministry of Labour
and Social Protection (MLSP), other relevant governmental institutions, social care institutions, other donors, and,
to a certain extent, relevant civil society organisations (CSOs) and OPDs.
Parents of children with disabilities were informed about the deinstitutionalisation process; however, their attitudes
diverged, and support was not unanimous at the planning stage.31 According to FGDs, caregivers were concerned
that no available services could support children with disabilities after their resettlement and that they would not
have the means to take care of their children (if children with disabilities are resettled with the family). Some parents
contributed to the development of work plans for small group homes. Overall, within the child protection sector,
policies on the deinstitutionalisation process were developed with the participation of OPDs; however, the extent
to which their input was incorporated in the processes was disputed, representing partial alignment with normative
standards.
Education
Perceptions of stakeholder involvement varied by stakeholder, but not all felt sufficiently involved. IPs shared they
were mostly involved in implementation and some evaluation activities, but not involved in programme design. One
IP did note that the Bureau of Development of Education (BDE) was involved in design and planning, and in turn,
engaged school representatives in the process, particularly staff from the first group of pilot inclusive schools. Still,
they added that families were not adequately or sufficiently involved, particularly over the relatively long
programme implementation. On the other hand, one IP indicated persons with disabilities and their parents lacked
unified goals, which was an issue, considering only parent organisations were included in the consulting process,
while ODPs, who belong to and represent persons with disabilities, were only consulted after the process was
completed.
Caregivers who participated in FGDs mostly spoke about their experiences within the education system. Some
caregivers interviewed were consulted about intervention planning and others were not. One parent said, ‘UNICEF
had a big share [in changing things]. In terms of institutions, nothing has improved. The problem exists with the
institutions. They are not sensitized. There should be a parent [of a child with a disability] in all institutions.’
Government representatives, however, described a very inclusive process of design, planning, and
implementation—including adjustments based on feedback along the way—that included all relevant stakeholders:
‘In both the design and implementations…we and UNICEF included all stakeholders (beneficiary groups, parent
organisations, schools, resource centres, etc). It was probably one of the most inclusive processes I was involved in,
in the Ministry.’
31 Excerpt from the interviews: ‘In the first phase of the process, there was some opposition from the parents. The opposition was justified
by the fact that the parents did not have the means nor the support to take care of their children who have special care needs.’
23
Health
UNICEF actively engaged the MoH as well as the professional organisations of general practitioners and nurses in
planning and implementing the capacity-building activities. Aside from these stakeholders, UNICEF also involved the
Association of Special Educators in planning additional activities on early identification and interventions.
Coherence
EQ 2.1 Have UNICEF actions and interventions in different sectors been mutually reinforcing to improve the inclusion
of children with disabilities? To what extent?
Across all sectors, UNICEF worked to align actions and, in several cases, interventions in one sector paved the way for
interventions in another sector. Still, improvement, coordination, and quality of implementation is dependent on the
interest and commitment of those in leadership.
All Sectors
As described in response to EQ 1.1 under Relevance, UNICEF’s interventions were designed to reinforce and
complement each other. This was largely achieved, with some temporary gaps in services due to the timing of
actions and the levels of support and urgency from duty bearers. Caregivers and implementers identified some
areas where there is a lack of coherence, such as after-school care, personal or educational assistance, and health
care shortages and uncovered costs.
EQ 2.2 Have UNICEF interventions complemented any existing programmes and/or policies implemented by the
government, UN agencies, or other international donors (i.e., EU), thereby enhancing their effect? Or, in contrast,
have they possibly undermined such programmes and/or policies?
Across all sectors, UNICEF engaged multiple actors and worked hard to align with other activities and efforts in country.
At times, the sequencing of interventions across sectors created new gaps in service while others were resolved.
Social Protection
Government stakeholders stated that the UNICEF intervention was well planned and complemented existing
national policies. UNICEF took the lead role in introducing the ICF model while other UN agencies and donors took
further actions with regards to children with disabilities, specifically, and people with disabilities, generally. The
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) supports the process of decentralising social service provision
from the central to the local level; the adoption of the Social Protection Law in 2019 set the legal groundwork for
this change. Under government leadership, UNICEF supported an inclusive dialogue on advancing the rights of
children with disabilities and helped create a consensus on shifting to a human rights-based approach in working
with these children.
Child Protection
Representatives of key ministries stressed that UNICEF actively engaged them in the planning of its interventions to
ensure that the interventions were necessary, in line with strategic priorities, and coordinated with other donors’
efforts. UNICEF interventions were harmonized and coordinated with the governmental policy on
deinstitutionalisation, defined in the second National Strategy for Deinstitutionalisation 2018–2027 ‘Timjanik’
adopted in 2017.32 The deinstitutionalisation process was supported by a wide list of donors. Several EU donors,
UNDP, GIZ, and the World Bank, supported/are implementing projects in this area, primarily focused on the
deinstitutionalisation of adults. UNICEF, in accordance with its mandate, focused solely on the deinstitutionalisation
process for children, while other donors supported deinstitutionalisation for adults, including institutional

24
refurbishment (with certain exemptions) and technical assistance. All major donors have supported residential
institutions in their transformation efforts. Some of the transformation plans were developed jointly with external
experts and are contained in reports to the MLSP (this was the case in UNDP-supported Banja Bansko). UNICEF has
supported the development of transformation plans for the ‘25 Maj’, ‘Ranka Milanovikj’, the Home for Infants and
Small Children in Bitola, and ‘11 Oktomvri’ residential institutions’ transformation to service providers.
Education
Stakeholder perceptions generally agreed regarding coherence and complementarity. IPs agreed that UNICEF’s
programming was coherent with and complimentary to other programmes, while noting the limitations and
challenges of working with institutions and educators that have varying levels of commitment. However, the
interventions were fully aligned with the national strategic goals; as one government representative noted: ‘MoES
provisioned that the Education Strategy 2018–2025 envisages inclusion. Without UNICEF support, we would not
have been able to fulfil MoES’s vision.’ UNICEF’s education programme was also designed to align with the
interventions of other major donors (UNDP and EU), and the MoES claims to have continuous joint meetings with
all institutions and agencies before each major intervention.
FGD participants from resource centres described one possible point of incoherence: a gap in after-school care for
children with disabilities in cases where their school does not provide such care for students at all, does not provide
care that can accommodate the specific needs of children with disabilities, or applies an age or grade limit to care
that prevents older children with disabilities from receiving the care they need after school. This gap emerged when
resource centres as segregated schools were phased out in favour of inclusive education in mainstream schools.
One participant stated: ‘Another problem is what to do with these children after the end of classes, while in resource
centres they are taken care of during the whole day. There are still no day centres on local levels, transport options,
etc., and this is a problem for many parents.’
Health
The MoH reported being actively engaged in all phases of UNICEF’s interventions across sectors, and the
interventions were in line with the national policy and the national action plan for implementing the CRPD.
According to the national action plan, the MoH will develop and implement a training plan for health care providers
on the rights of persons with disabilities and a rights-based approach toward disability.33 Trainings were also
included in the Strategic Plan of the MoH (2018–2020).34
Effectiveness35
EQ 3.1 How have UNICEF-supported programmes and interventions contributed to eliminating bottlenecks in
ensuring the effective inclusion of children with disabilities in the following ways?
UNICEF-supported interventions contributed greatly to increasing the availability and supply of services as well as
qualified human resources. Children who have benefitted from the deinstitutionalisation process have much better
living conditions, but those living in small group homes need more individualized support than they are receiving.
Educators found that the training on inclusive education was very effective and expressed that they need more training
and additional personnel to support children with disabilities in mainstream schools. Medical professionals found their
training helpful in understanding and identifying disability and reducing unnecessary referrals; however, the overall lack
of health system personnel and infrastructure remains a barrier. The presence or absence of political will is a critical
factor in achievements and challenges related to UNICEF objectives. Social perception towards disability is also a key a
factor, and transformation needs to go hand-in-hand with the sectoral interventions.

The table below provides a list of the bottlenecks identified by UNICEF within each sector. These lists were drawn
from UNICEF programme documentation and interviews with sector officers.
Table 4. Bottlenecks Identified by UNICEF, by Sector
Sector Bottlenecks
Social Protection - SP Legislation does not address most disadvantaged;
- no strategy to fight social exclusion (neither child protection and development; nor
prevention of family poverty were prioritized within the social protection system);
- inadequacy of budget allocations;
- SP primary and secondary legislation was fragmented;
- limited staff capacity to support inclusion of Roma children and children with
disabilities;
- outdated model for categorization of children with disabilities
Child Protection - absence of or outdated by-laws and standards to prevent and protect children with
disabilities;
- lack of programmes and standards for children in institutions;
- lack of alternative services for children in correctional facilities and children without
parents and parental care;
- CSW staff and staff in institutions lack the necessary skills and tools to provide quality of
services, result of current organizational structure and no accountability mechanism
(new standards and procedures, LIRIKUS, licensing process);
- weak system of monitoring quality of services delivered through CSWs
Education - lack of bylaw regulations and standards on inclusive education;
- lack of focus on the social model of inclusion;
- lack of explicit commitment to inclusive education;
- lack of teachers understanding their role and having capacity to support inclusive
education;
- limited resources, programmes, and special services for including children with
disabilities;
- lack of clear criteria in the funding formula to support inclusion of the most
marginalized children;
- lack of inclusive pedagogy and assessment of individual child needs;
- lack of teamwork and inclusion teams; and
- discriminatory attitudes and practices among parents of other children and among
teachers toward children with disabilities
Health - insufficient access and utilization of early detection and early intervention services
- constrained geographical access to adequately staffed community health services, in
particular patronage nursing
- stigma and inadequate health seeking practices by vulnerable groups
Availability and supply of services and qualified human resources
Social Protection
UNICEF-supported interventions contributed to increasing the availability and supply of services as well as qualified
human resources, with limits. The UNICEF-supported legislative reform introduced new services available for
children with disabilities and their families (i.e., personal assistance, temporary accommodation-relief for family
care, halfway houses) as well as improved the content and regulation of existing services (expert care and support,
day care centres, assisted living, foster care). However, the personal assistance service is limited to persons with
26
severe physical disabilities and persons who are blind, and until 2021,36 this service was not available for children
with disabilities.
The data below from the Institute for Social Affairs shows a steady increase in the number of personal assistants
and beneficiaries in total, though for children with disabilities the numbers are still very low, especially when
compared to the number of children with disabilities who are attending mainstream schools.37 There is obvious
progress; however, interviewees overwhelming agreed that there is a need for more qualified staff.

Regarding the number of assessments, a steep increase was noted once the ICF bodies were officially established.
In 2019 and 2020, the two pilot centres provided the assessment; while after 2021, this task has been performed
by the other seven bodies.

Child Protection
The completed resettlement of all children from residential care institutions is a key achievement of the
deinstitutionalisation process, and there was no ‘skimming’39 during these resettlements.40 As of 2020, the
children’s institutions have completed the resettlement of children, either to small group homes or foster families
(rarely to biological families). Most stakeholders interviewed agreed that UNICEF was a key contributor to this
achievement, as was the government’s strong political commitment. In 2016, the rate of children living in residential
care institutions was 134 per 100,000 children; by December 2019, there were no children in large-scale institutions.
North Macedonia is in full alignment with this normative standard.

disabilities
The resettled children with disabilities also are benefitting from the opportunity to undergo the ICF assessment and,
based upon the results, are engaging in certain educational activities. Depending on their residence, these children
may also use the services of day care centres for children with disabilities; however, some of these children (i.e.,
those who are living in small group homes near Demir Kapija) are isolated and have no access to local social services
(day care, rehabilitation).
Regarding human resources, family, and community-based carers of children with disabilities received initial
training, but additional supports and ongoing training targeting specific needs are needed (a process that is
ongoing). In addition, the government is funding the staffing of social workers, but there is still a need for an
increased number of professionals and additional training is necessary to strengthen the capacity of professionals.
Education
The education sector interventions addressed all the above-mentioned bottlenecks. The Law on Primary Education
was amended in 2019 with articles specifying the inclusion of children with disabilities and elaborating on different
organisational forms within the system (SITs, resource centres, learning support centres, etc.) to facilitate inclusion.
Relevant bylaws were adopted later in the program, some after 2020, but the system is completely established—
on the legal and policy side—to enable inclusion. The normative aspect was complemented with a capacity-building
process for the staff of 30 pilot schools, staff of all five resource centres, and one third of educational inspectors. The
capacity-building process was transferred to the institutions (BDE) aimed at covering all primary schools. UNICEF
supported the process by producing detailed guidelines on the roles and responsibilities of the SITs and an overall
conceptual framework on inclusive education. Though outside the scope and timeframe of this evaluation, these
efforts directly contributed to the MoES adding an ‘inclusive education’ budget line for covering inclusion-related
costs as of 2021.
When asked about the new educational inclusion policies, the majority of educators who responded to the survey
agreed that the policies were effective at achieving the goal of more qualified human resources (teachers and other
school staff) (39.6% very, 47.7% somewhat). It is worth noting, however, that this goal had the largest proportion of
educators who said the policies were ineffective (9.3%), and of those who said the policies were effective, most
perceive them to be only somewhat so, indicating room for improvement. Most also agreed that the new
educational policies were effective at improving the quality of education support for children with disabilities (42.6%
very, 45% somewhat) and that the policies led to improved curricula for children with disabilities (44.3% very, 42.1%
somewhat). They also overwhelmingly agreed that the policies were effective in increasing knowledge and
awareness among families of children with disabilities on educational inclusion services (42.5% very, 47.6%
somewhat). Caregivers also expressed gratitude that their children were able to attend school and receive services
there.
28

Health
The health sector interventions were, to a certain degree, effective to increase the capacity of family doctors and
patronage nurses. The training opportunity proved to be very popular, and 350 doctors (22% of the eligible
workforce) received training between 2018 and 2020. Trained doctors reported that they were making far fewer
unnecessary referrals, and the assessment protocols have become a standard practice and have been added to
medical school curriculum. UNICEF was also able to support training for the entire workforce of patronage nurses.
Modules included guidance on how to identify children with possible developmental delays or disabilities, when to
make referrals, and ways to help families provide needed support to children, ranging from physical and emotional
to cognitive and social supports. The majority of nurses reported that the trainings were very effective for each of
the components measured.

Family doctors who responded to the survey were more hesitant. While they also assessed the trainings as being
very effective, they reported limited effectiveness, particularly for referrals to other practitioners and services. This
finding warrants more investigation.

These trainings still are not a part of a continuous training system, nor included in pre-service education.
Financial accessibility and service eligibility
Social Protection
The government replaced the fragmented system of social benefits with a more unified Guaranteed Minimum
Allowance, for which the benefit is higher, and more people are eligible, resulting in a significant increase of the
number of children benefiting from social transfers. The new Social Protection Law, in Art. 32, states that the income
of children with disabilities or persons with disabilities who are temporarily settled in foster care, assisted living, or
other settings are not considered when deciding whether the household is eligible or not for the Guaranteed
Minimum Allowance. Stakeholders noted that children with disabilities are not eligible for a Special Allowance if
they live in assisted living facilities or foster homes.42 This can only be partially justified, given that assisted living
facilities and foster homes are subsidized, but for meeting the need for inclusion in social, cultural and sport
activities, for example, these children should remain eligible for this transfer. Risk for gender-related exclusion was
not observed.
Concerning the ICF assessment, the amendments to the Law on Health Insurance from 2021 ensured that the
assessment is covered by health insurance. Stakeholders pointed out that the access to social services is a problem.
For example, many places do not have state-funded early intervention services, and overall, very few state-funded
early intervention services exist. Some municipalities do not have speech and rehabilitation therapists. Although
they may have access to private service providers, many families cannot pay the cost for these providers.
42 Child Protection Law, Art. 34, Para. 1.
30
Child Protection
For some of the children the resettlement into small group homes created a barrier to accessing personal assistance
services that they need. Financial accessibility is not relevant for deinstitutionalisation interventions because access
to small group homes and other similar services is not conditioned by financial eligibility criteria. However, according
to the information gathered by interviews, some children with disabilities who live in small group homes encounter
problems in accessing personal assistance. The explanation they received is that these children do not have the right
to personal assistance services, either because they do not have physical disability or blindness (which is a legal
requirement) or because they already are beneficiary of the social service small group home – assisted living). During
an interview, an IP confirmed that staff who work in small group homes do not provide the same support that
personal assistants are trained to supply.
Education and Health
N/A—interventions are covered by the state budget.
Changes in knowledge, awareness, and demand
Social Protection
Families and caregivers of children with disabilities have increased their awareness about cash benefits and services.
However, access to accurate data remains a barrier in assessing the effectiveness of social protection interventions.
According to the State Statistical Office, there is a significant increase in parents seeking salary compensation for
part-time work due to their need to care for a child with physical or developmental disabilities. However, the
number of beneficiaries of Special Allowance is in decline. The declining number may only partially be attributed to
the overall decrease in the younger population (3% according to data from the State Statistical Office). The problem
that remains is the availability of services and not the awareness of parents. ICF bodies are becoming more
recognizable by the public.

Education
The vast majority of educators who were surveyed responded that UNICEF’s teacher training on inclusive education
was effective across a range of indicators related to service availability and provision, including improved
cooperation with families of children with disabilities (43.8% very, 47.7% somewhat) and within the school (46.2%
very, 46.7% somewhat) and improved skills in educational methods (36.1% very, 55.4% somewhat). Although most
agreed that the training was effective and less than 8% of educators said that the training was ineffective, the largest
proportion of educators indicated room for improvement through selecting somewhat effective. This is most
evident in relation to improved skills in educational methods. During the FGD, one educator said, ‘Trainings are good
but very theoretical. I think a simple sharing of experiences with colleagues is more effective….’ Peer-support is a
normative standard and takes place in some cases but is dependent on the school and not provisioned specifically.
Regression analyses related to training participation and the perception of current needs showed that educators
who attended training on inclusive education perceived a lesser need to improve skills for preparing IEPs and a lesser
need to improve cooperation at the school level regarding inclusion, when compared to educators who had not
attended the training.46

Educators who indicated they have experience working with children with disabilities (69%) reported observing
significantly more improvement in the following areas related to their work as educators, compared to those that
have not worked with children with disabilities:
• Improved personal skills in educational methods for children with disabilities
• Improved skills in preparing IEPs
• Improved cooperation at the school level for educational inclusion
• Changed perceptions of the functional environment for children with disabilities
• Improved support from EAs
• Improved support from school management
Shifting paradigms and reducing stigma
See Impact 5.1
Quality and adequacy of benefits
Social Protection
The amount of cash benefits to children with disabilities and their families, although increased by 20% on average,
remains insufficient to help escape the vicious poverty cycle, according to caregivers interviewed. The Special
Allowance is less than a third of the state minimum wage and only 1/6 of the minimal monthly cost of living. Cash
benefits are also not capable of covering the costs of health care. Some children with cognitive disabilities are
required to take expensive supplements not covered by the state health insurance system. They also need frequent
medical check-ups, and, due to the poor state of public health care facilities, families are compelled to go to private
hospitals and pay the whole amount of care from their limited family budget.
Child Protection
Government representatives, professionals, IPs, OPDs, and secondary documentation agreed that conditions for
children settled into community-based care homes are generally satisfactory47 but that more can be provided to
enrich and support these children’s lives. The resettled children with disabilities now have significantly better living
conditions, and personal improvements have been reported. Children with disabilities also have improved access
to some community mainstream services, for example, education and some aspects of health (however, during the
COVID-19 pandemic, for these children as well as for the general population, health care service provision was
impacted). The Institute for Social Affairs collects data regularly on institutions, and during the process of
deinstitutionalization, data was routinely collected on efforts and progress toward removing children from
institutions and placing them with family and community-based care; and following its completion, these children’s
living situations continued to be monitored, representing full alignment with normative standards. However, while
reporting mechanisms are in place for violations of policies regarding living conditions, they are not always followed
in a timely and effective manner. In addition, the State does not routinely collect data on the living situation of all
children with disabilities. Thus, there is partial alignment with these normative standards.
Unfortunately, the existing day care centres have not been transformed into the UNICEF-proposed Disability
Support Centres, though the process is ongoing. Experience has also shown that there are some problems in
ensuring that children living in small group homes have access to educational and other meaningful activities
necessary to support their inclusion in communities.

needs, including more training for teachers and EAs, as most did not feel they had sufficient skills. While most were
fully supportive of inclusion, they also described the difficulties they have faced when trying to provide individualized
instruction to a student with a disability, in terms of the time required and the challenge of navigating
accommodations or modifications while maintaining equity in the classroom (e.g., during learning assessments).
Resource centre staff in the FGD tended to agree with educators that the training provided by UNICEF was positive
but fell short of meeting their needs. One participant suggested that ‘more tandem workshops [teacher-assistant]
are needed in order to deepen their communication because, as we agree, inclusion sometimes does not work
because the assistant is left on his/her own.’
IPs concluded that the availability of services has increased, but not enough and not everywhere, considering
schools and communities differ widely regarding their preparedness for inclusion. This was confirmed during the
FGD with educators. Overall, there is general agreement among different stakeholders that the establishment of
resource centres is one of the more positive policies, as these centres now have a rightful role as trainers, mentors,
and coordinators of the inclusion processes in schools.

EQ 3.2 What factors (e.g., political, social, gender, cultural, social norms, systemic, or related to the programme and
service design and implementation or professional practices) were critical for the achievement or failure of the initial
objectives?
All stakeholders, as well as documentation, identified the presence or absence of political will as being a critical factor
in achievements and challenges related to UNICEF objectives. The prolonged time period that elapsed before laws
necessary for shifting to the ICF approach were adopted is further evidence of political will being a key factor. Social
perceptions were also named by stakeholders and in documents, which relates to political will due to a lack of sustained
pressure and demand from constituents.
All Sectors
All stakeholders overwhelmingly pointed to political will as the critical key factor for achieving objectives and noted
that, at times, this came down to a single leader. All reforms related to the inclusion of children with disabilities,
especially in the social protection area, were to a great extent pushed personally by the previous Minister for Labour
and Social Protection (2017–2020). Strong leadership could have ensured that there are no delays in adoption of
the necessary legislation to operationalize the ICF bodies. The long-standing social norms that stigmatize disability
play a role, but with political will, they can be changed. The Situational Analysis on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities in North Macedonia48, published in 2021 by UNPRPD, also identified political will as a key factor
contributing towards the implementation of the CRPD and noted the lack of established disability focal points in all
ministries and the inaccessibility of local and national government offices for persons with disabilities as some of the
examples of unequal commitment on behalf of all duty bearers. Stakeholders credited UNICEF for guiding important
discussions within the government and leading campaigns to shift the public’s perception of disability, perceptions
among educators, in particular. They also noted that the broad international support for proposed changes has
given credibility to those pushing for reforms.

Efficiency
EQ 4.1 Were UNICEF programme budgets and resources (human, financial, and technical) adequately used for
addressing priority bottlenecks? Could we have the same programme results with less resources?
Stakeholders agreed that UNICEF’s budget and human and technical resources were adequately budgeted across all
sectors, and there was a good division of expenses among donor organisations to avoid the multiplication of costs.
Available UNICEF M&E data supports this perception. The same programme results could not have been achieved with
fewer resources; many stakeholders observed that more resources were and are needed.
All Sectors
The evaluation team was provided with funding data showing budget allocations that were tagged as significantly
or principally focused on children with disabilities for the 2016-2020 timeframe (as listed above in UNICEF
Programme Description). However, detailed programme budgets were not provided, and in-depth financial analysis
was outside the scope of this evaluation.
Based on the limited information provided as well as interviews conducted, UNICEF’s budget and human and
technical resources were adequately budgeted across all sectors, and there was a good division of expenses among
donor organisations to avoid the multiplication of costs. The introduction of the deinstitutionalisation process
required significant resources, especially in the first phases of implementation. Before any institution could be
closed, new community and alternative family care services had to be established, and both systems needed to run
in parallel until the institutions were fully closed. These ‘double running costs’ require an increase in expenditure at
the start of any deinstitutionalisation process. This can be a significant financial barrier that may be difficult to
overcome without strong donor support even where strong political will exists.49 UNICEF appropriately calculated
and planned for these operational, human, and technical resource costs, and the intended outcomes have largely
been achieved. The M&E data (elaborated below under Impact) indicate high levels of budget execution coupled
with full accomplishment of the majority of targets, which indicates effective allocation and use of resources.
Likewise, IPs and government stakeholders agreed that the inclusive education programme budget and human and
technical resources were adequately used and that all allocated resources were needed. They also noted the need
for further investment to bring all schools to a level of providing quality inclusive education. In the area of health,
the evaluation team was unable to access relevant data, and thus, the team could not identify concerns regarding
the use of budgets and human and technical resources.50
Impact
EQ 5.1 How much was UNICEF able to shift the paradigm on disability and improve the understanding of disability?
All stakeholders agreed that UNICEF significantly helped to positively shift the paradigm and improve public
understanding on disability, while acknowledging that more work is needed to eliminate stigma and discrimination.
Tangible services offered within and across sectors (especially in social and child protection and education) contributed
to the needs being met, to varying degrees, and UNICEF’s simultaneous communication campaigns reinforced these
efforts by pushing citizens to confront their assumptions and biases. Caregivers, especially, were pleased that the
public’s perception of their children had improved.

Communication
Communication for social and behaviour change initiatives included awareness campaigns to address the public’s
negative attitudes and perceptions toward disability, community dialogue events to open discussions at the
community level on inclusion, public advocacy to support sector-specific reforms, and partnerships to promote
inclusion in sport and culture. The communication campaigns included numerous professionally produced videos
depicting people (adults and children) with disabilities engaging in various activities, Macedonian Sign Language
video tutorials, and an informational video featuring statistics about persons with disabilities in the country. A
second-phase campaign included messaging to promote positive norms and community events to open dialogue
at the community level. Additional campaigns and community events mobilised support for deinstitutionalisation
and promoted the right for children with disabilities to grow up in a family environment. Throughout the
interventions, the communications team made efforts to include positive models of children with disabilities from
different genders and with different types of disabilities, presenting them as active participants in society.
UNICEF’s extensive awareness-raising communication campaigns and social change activities were intended to
benefit all sectors by pushing the general public to confront and reconsider their assumptions and biases toward
children with disabilities, and all stakeholders agreed the campaigns contributed to an overall powerful message
and recognizable shifts in perceptions. Related to the awareness raising activities, the unexpected resistance by the
local population in the village of Timjanik on the opening of a small group home for children with disabilities had a
significant positive impact on mobilising the general population in support of the small group home. The approach
taken by UNICEF and the government counterparts in this case, by engaging in dialogue instead of imposing the
opening of the home, led to this small village now being a symbol for a successful story of inclusion. Although there
was not an explicit evaluation of the awareness raising activities, the two KAP studies that UNICEF conducted and
which have been referenced in this report, indicate large and positive—though by no means complete—changes in
public attitudes and perceptions. This is the best evidence of the communication activities’ effectiveness. References
to the support that the communication unit provided to other sectors is described in the below findings as well as
throughout the report.
Social Protection
Stakeholders overwhelmingly agreed that in the period of 2016–2020 the public’s perception of disability in general,
especially of children with disabilities, had changed. UNICEF has had a significant role in this change. The continuous
awareness-raising campaigns, the direct work with first line professionals (teachers, counsellors, social workers),
and the work of its IPs contributed to this change. It is evident through the increased visibility of people with
disabilities in public and in social media and the increased public criticism of actions that discriminate against people
with disabilities. Although the public was initially resistant, UNICEF’s bold move to go forward with inclusion in
schools and deinstitutionalisation also contributed to changing people’s perceptions. Stakeholders noted a shift
regarding the public’s reaction when a certain specific case of discrimination or unequal treatment of children with
disabilities is revealed either by journalists or by activists. There is now broader condemnation of such discriminatory
actions and, to certain extent, caregivers, and other stakeholders attribute this to UNICEF’s efforts to shift the public
discourse.
Stakeholders, as well as research and legal documentation, noted a concern that the medical model still remains
dominant for assessment, especially for adults with disabilities and in some cases for children (if the parents apply
only for cash benefits or for social services). Through supporting social protection reforms, UNICEF contributed to
significantly more children benefiting from cash transfers and to the reduction of child poverty. As a result,
compared to 2016, the number of children benefiting from poverty-reduction transfers increased fivefold, including
a 147% rise between 2019 and 2020. Furthermore, the reform increased the overall amount of cash benefits.
Nevertheless, a requirement introduced with the new model of so called “guaranteed minimal assistance” has
created some backlash among its beneficiaries, including children and people with disabilities. The applicant for this
36
benefit must prove that he/she is not able to secure maintenance on any other legal ground.51 In practice, the other
legal grounds are either spousal maintenance or family maintenance. According to the implementing rulebook52,
this criterion is proven by providing a copy of submitted lawsuit for maintenance against the family member or by
giving a power of attorney (authorization) to an official from the Centre for Social Protection for initiating such a
procedure. This requirement has caused hesitance and confusion among the applicants because initiating a court
procedure against a family member is not something easy to grasp.53
The interventions in this sector contributed toward realizing the outcomes related to social protection from the CPD
2016 – 2020.54 The target set in the CPD (90% of boys and girls identified using the ICF) was not realized within the
timeframe subject to this evaluation, however the data shows a significant increase in the number of assessments
in 2022.
Child Protection
At the beginning of the deinstitutionalisation process, stakeholders saw resistance at institutions and among
employees who feared for their jobs, parents who had doubts as to whether the system and society were ready for
the process, and the public in general. However, all stakeholders interviewed noted that after a period of time, all
groups—employees, parents, and the public—shifted their perceptions. This became apparent after the events in
Timjanik, a small village in the central part of the country, where locals protested against a small group home for
children with disabilities that opened in the village. UNICEF played a significant role in supporting the MLSP in
sensitively engaging with and informing the people of Timjanik, who later became very supportive of the small group
home stationed in their village and engaged with those living there, inviting them to social events and ensuring that
they are part of the local community. UNICEF efforts were also noted regarding their large-scale campaign in 2019
especially, which led to a considerable increase in the number of potential foster families.55
Education
Most educators surveyed also agreed that the new education policies were effective in reducing social stigma and
discrimination for children with disabilities in education (41.2% very, 48.1% somewhat) as well as increasing positive
social-norm changes for educational inclusion (42.3% very, 46.7% somewhat).
The responses were similar regarding the effectiveness of teacher training, specifically in reducing stigma (42.6%
very, 48.7% somewhat). Most educators also reported that the training was effective in improving their knowledge
about disability (41.9% very, 54.2% somewhat). In their responses, 50% said they had observed significant
improvement and 35.1% noted some improvement in reducing their own personal biases.

Educators who indicated that they have experience working with children with disabilities (69%) reported observing
significantly more improvement in the following areas related to understanding and bias, compared to those who
have not worked with children with disabilities:
• Improved personal knowledge on the types of disabilities
• Reduced personal biases toward children with disabilities
• Reduced biases in other educators toward children with disabilities
• Improved cooperation with families of children with disabilities
Government stakeholders and IPs also noted improvements in public perception, especially among participating
schools, but also observed that some religious and more traditional communities still retain biases. As one
participant stated, ‘There is an unevenness in the degree of sensitization of educators, which is understandable. Not
everything can be done at once.’
Caregivers agreed that perceptions toward their children have improved, though some made a distinction between
the perception of other students—their children’s peers—and that of adults. One caregiver said, ‘Consciousness is
rising, our voice is heard. We are more numerous and more connected to each other. Discrimination is not caused
by the children but by the parents.’
While noting the progress achieved in this area, especially in the perceptions of teachers, much more needs to be
done, as a lot of stigma and discrimination still exists. While public support for segregated schooling dropped
substantially between 2014 and 2018, according to UNICEF’s KAP study, a small majority (53%) still favoured keeping
children with disabilities apart from those without disabilities.56
An unintended (but limited in occurrence) effect of these interventions was the occasional petitions or reactions by
parents of children without disabilities against including children with disabilities in their children’s classrooms,
under the pretext that there are no preconditions for the inclusion. Methods for addressing such occurrences
were not put in place and they were handled differently depending on the school/community.

Health
UNICEF interventions in the health sector had a limited impact on the overall health care protection of children with
disabilities and their families. However, the trainings for medical professionals contributed to changing the paradigm
for disability among the health care providers, which is a sound first step. Changes in doctors’ attitudes and
perceptions is happening slowly, and there is an improvement in how they view disability, especially on the primary
health care level. As an indicative of the change there is one unintended and unrelated to the interventions result.
One stakeholder who advocates against discrimination said, ‘We received a request from the Faculty of Dentistry
to review a planned textbook for paediatric dentistry about whether the language used is inclusive and whether
there are offensive words and sentences. This was not initiated by us. It was [a] genuine request by the faculty to
be more careful when publishing textbooks that will train future dentists. This is a sign that something is changing. I
hope that this example will be followed by other educational institutions.’
The data from the survey with patronage nurses shows that there is improvement in all areas, though it is more or
less limited to some improvement. Improving skills on early detection and changing the dominant attitude among
health care providers are both very positive impacts. Still, the lack of a standardised introduction to this topic in
university or vocational training remains an issue as well as the limited access children with disabilities have, to
specialized health services.

Family doctors are much more cautious in assessing the impact of training. They acknowledged that there is
improvement; however, it is very limited. Contrary to nurses, the attitude change for most doctors is still in the early
stages, and there is limited improvement in the referral system.
The data from the surveys shows that Output 257 from the CPD (2016 – 2020) was achieved, in that 100% of home-
visiting nurses were trained for child health, nutrition and development including on early detection and
intervention for children with disabilities.
57 Output 2: Primary health care providers have increased knowledge and skills related to child health, nutrition and development,
including on early detection and intervention for CWD.

EQ 5.2 To what extent and in which sectors did programmes/interventions make significant impacts? Were there
any sub-group differences (urban/rural, male/female, or poor/rich) with respect to different disabilities (physical,
mental, intellectual, or sensory) or severity?
Although available data for rigorously measuring impact is limited, existing data and stakeholder reports indicated that
UNICEF’s inclusion programming made a significant impact, although geographical disparities in programme reach, and
gender and socioeconomic differences also exist generally and in relation to location (urban versus rural). Differences
were not necessarily attributable to programme design or implementation; they tended to reflect a lack of awareness
or negative bias on the part of potential programme beneficiaries and did not always follow expected patterns (i.e.,
some urban schools were less resourced than rural schools).
Social Protection
Significant differences were reported concerning the rural population and children with disabilities living in smaller
towns and communities. While those in Skopje and other major towns are benefiting from inclusion reforms
(personal and educational assistance, day care centres, etc.), this is not the case for children with disabilities living in
rural and remote areas. These areas lack accessible and available services and, therefore, families face increased
costs to travel to nearby towns for services, which are not subsidized. Analysing the data from the State Statistical
Office (Table 9) also shows gender disparity in accessing services. In 2020, only 40% of beneficiaries using the social
services were female. Similarly, only 38.6% of beneficiaries of day care centres were female. During interviews,
participants noted that some parents of girls with disabilities are hesitant to include them in social services.

Child Protection
The development of community-based services is at the heart of the new Social Protection Law (SPL), and many
new services have been established in personal and home care. However, there are geographical disparities and a
need to enhance human resources. The availability of community services in various geographic areas differs
considerably. But generally, not enough community care services exist in the field, especially those that would be
spatially and physically available and accessible for all users (personal assistance, educational assistance, transport
to services, etc.). Although progress has been made in establishing social service providers, as the number of
licensed providers, especially in relation to personal assistance and home care services, has increased from 15 to 45
providers, progress is geographically uneven. For example, the RI Demir Kapija has two small group homes in Skopje.
The first one is for children under 18 years of age. Four children live there, and one of these residents is going to a
school for people who are blind or have low vision. They are settled in apartments within buildings not physically
accessible to persons with disabilities. In all housing, accessibility standards need to be respected. In addition, the
small group homes that are near the town of Demir Kapija are isolated and have no access to local social services
(day care, rehabilitation), posing a serious problem if these children need health care. The stakeholders emphasized
that there is a need for greater individual work with children with disabilities to improve their skills and their inclusion
in communities. Greater focus on this is necessary because the objective of deinstitutionalisation was not only to
move children with disabilities into more suitable housing, but also to ensure that they are included in society.
According to the Institute for Social Affairs (ISA) report on personal assistance dated October 2021, there are 145
personal assistants in the country for 214 service users (112 male and 102 female), and these assistants are not
equally located geographically. Skopje and Strumica have high numbers of personal assistants, but Veles, Struga,
Tetovo, Gevgelija, Gostivar, Prilep, and Kriva Palanka have small numbers of assistants, despite having similar or
larger population sizes. Overall, very small municipalities and rural areas also have a lack of services. Resettled users
from residential institutions in these areas have little access to day care centres, either because they do not exist
near their small group homes or because of users’ lack of transportation.

Education
The interventions that were mentioned and discussed as being most impactful were teacher training, SITs, and EAs.
Many stakeholders stressed that these interventions varied widely from school to school and noted that what may
be expected in rural and urban contexts or for socioeconomic statuses is not always the case. During an FGD, one
educator noted, ‘I wouldn’t say that it is dependent on the urban/rural region and social status, but on the
awareness of the school management mostly and school support staff…. There are examples of rural schools that
are very open and where education assistants can be found, whereas some central schools in Skopje can have
resistance towards inclusion.’ A person from a resource centre echoed this observation during another FGD, as did
a MoES representative during an interview. This was supported by the survey findings which did not indicate
significant differences among educators from rural and urban areas on the vast majority of indicators assessed,
except for 1) the greater perceived need among educators from rural areas for reducing personal biases towards
children with disabilities and 2) greater perceived need among educators from urban areas for improved
infrastructural and material conditions enabling inclusion.
As for gender disparities, a government official and an IP representative observed that rural and more traditional
communities tend to stigmatize children with disabilities more, especially if they are girls, which reflects in unequal
inclusion in the education system. While data on the gender distribution of students with disabilities in mainstream
education were not available, the inclusion in resource centres (formerly special schools) indicates that only about
one third of students are female (Table 11).

Health
People living in rural areas and people in poverty are far more affected by the problems in accessing adequate health
care. Based on the survey of patronage nurses, the situation is very concerning for children with disabilities from
rural areas as well as those living in poor families. Although nurses did not report a significant gender disparity in
accessing services, one stakeholder in the education sector observed (and gave an example) that doctors sometimes
miss the signs of a potential disability, instead attributing these signs to developmental gender differences.

EQ 5.3 Was the implementation of programmes and interventions appropriately monitored and evaluated per
UNICEF protocols for M&E? How were the results used?
Within the 2016-2020 CPD, many sectors lacked clear, measurable targets for intervention outputs and outcomes
related to inclusion at the start of the programme, and the evaluation team received limited information related to
M&E. However, M&E reporting showed progress on several indicators related to inclusion of children with disabilities.
Indicators tended to measure outputs; outcome and impact measurement was largely lacking.
All Sectors
The evaluation team had access to limited information and data about Monitoring and Evaluation, but standard
reporting for 2016-2020 from the Country Office showed that progress was made on most indicators related to
inclusion of children with disabilities (see Table 12). The M&E data correspond to the outputs described during
interviews with duty bearers and rights holders across sectors. Of note, most M&E indicators focused on outputs;
outcome or impact measurement was lacking. Additionally, within the general indicators, desegregated data on
children with disabilities was not available.

Education
Post-training evaluations in the education sector showed that participants largely found the trainings to be positive
and useful:
• SIT members who received a 2016 training on ‘approaches and strategies related to differentiated learning and
individualized instruction in an inclusive classroom’ assessed the training’s usefulness as 3.7 points on average
(out of 4 points). They also identified several additional, related topics for which they needed support, mainly
related to providing appropriate supports to children with disabilities and their families.
• State education inspectors who received training in 2018 provided similar ratings, assessing quality, relevance,
and clarity between 3.1 and 3.7 points. They indicated that the training helped them to better understand their
role in monitoring specific elements of school inclusion.
• Preschool teachers who received training in 2019 on ‘assessing needs, developing IEPs, and inclusive
classrooms’ also gave high ratings on the same metrics at 3.6 points and above.
• Training with staff from the Centre for Protection and Rehabilitation Banja Bansko was conducted in 2018, and
the participants assessed the training on the same metrics with ratings from 3.8 to a full 4 points. Staff were
especially impressed by the literacy games for children with disabilities.
As for M&E outside of UNICEF, a government representative stated that education programs and the strategic plan
are monitored quarterly for fidelity of implementation and reported annually. An IP stated that they collected M&E
data ‘to plan activities in the next year, to prepare materials, and to determine the intensity of visits to support
schools during the year’ but noted they did not collect impact data. The State Education Inspectorate is responsible
for monitoring how schools identify students’ educational needs, prepare IEPs, and support students with
44
developmental difficulties and ‘special needs’.
The MoES’s annual monitoring of the progress of the Education Strategy’s goals for 2020 noted that by the end of
the year, all primary schools had established SITs and were preparing IEPs for each student. In addition, the MoES
noted that the process of transforming special schools into resource centres and special classes in learning support
centres was ongoing.62 However, a report from the ombudsman63 monitoring the implementation of the inclusive
education policy during the 2019/20 school year through schools’ self-assessment found that, while the vast
majority of primary schools reported to have established SITs (93%), 3% reported they do not have SITs and 4% did
not respond to the questionnaire. Moreover, 69% of schools did not have full SITs (comprised of seven members),
as per the law.64 In addition, just 66% of schools reported to have developed IEPs for all students with disabilities.
The data indicates that while the vast majority of schools are adhering to the legal requirements for inclusion, overall
capacity and human resources need strengthening.

The UNICEF 2019 Regional Evaluation on Home Visiting Services, in which North Macedonia was a case study
country, served to further build the breadth and sustainability of home visitors and the impact of their work.65
Sustainability
EQ 6.1 To what extent are UNICEF-supported programmes integrated into national policies, budgets, and quality-
assurance mechanisms?
Across all four sectors, UNICEF interventions are integrated into national policies and budgets, which is an important
outcome and a strong foundation for sustainability. There is room for improvement, as policies have varying degrees
of detail and specificity that can enable implementation, and many implementers and rights holders deem funding to
be inadequate. Quality-assurance mechanisms are lagging and may need further development, though direct training
in relation to this has taken place in the education sector with state education inspectors.
Social Protection
With legislation, the new model of cash benefits and social services advocated by UNICEF has become mandatory,
and the government is obliged to ensure adequate implementation. The social welfare budget has increased
somewhat; however, the pandemic and subsequent economic crisis are impeding these initial positive trends.
Following UNICEF’s programming, the country adopted several legislative amendments in 2021 and 2022 that were
necessary to ensure that the ICF model is in place from a legislative point of view.66
The permanent members of the ICF bodies are currently on the payroll of the MoH and are stationed in the premises
of public health care facilities. With the sole exemption of not (yet) passing amendments to the Law on Health Care,
62 The report for 2021 emphasizes that these activities have been completed.

educational needs in primary schools in the Republic of North Macedonia. March 2020.
64 The SIT has a mandate of three academic years and is composed of seven members, namely: child’s main teacher, psychologist or a
social worker at the school, two teachers from the school (one primary school teacher and one subject teacher), two parents or guardians,
special educator/rehabilitator, and the principal of the school.

66 The amendments to the Law on Health Insurance (Official Gazette No,286/2021) provided that the costs for the functional assessment
will be covered by the Health Insurance Fund. The amendments to the Law on Social Protection (Official Gazette No. 294/2021) improved
the regulatory and institutional framework for the ICF bodies and ensured that their opinion may ensure access to specific cash benefits.
The amendments also prescribed to a greater detail the bylaw that should regulate the ICF process. The amendments to the Law on
Children Protection (Official Gazette No. 294/2021) harmonized provided that the children with disabilities may have access to the special
allowance on the basis of opinion of an ICF body. This law also defines the term children with disabilities.
45
which should have established the legal framework for the assessment bodies,67 all other laws are adopted and in
force.
Child Protection
UNICEF’s child protection interventions are partially integrated into national policies and practices. UNICEF’s pledge
to ensure that there are no children in institutions has been integrated as a government policy and has been
implemented. The adequate legislative changes that will support the deinstitutionalisation process were also
adopted. UNICEF’s efforts to ensure that small group homes are solely an intermediary solution and that alternative
care units should be enhanced was reaffirmed by the Government but there is still work needed in this area. Existing
day care centres have not been transformed into Disability Support Centres as was proposed by UNICEF. Specifically,
day care centres are still not separate/independent entities with an agreed budget based on an agreed programme
of work; rather, they remain under the Centre for Social Work’s (CSW’s) administrative control. Moreover, the
midterm evaluation report on the deinstitutionalisation process indicated that the state financing of social service
delivery needs to be increased, as at present only 11% of the budget is allocated for services with the remaining
share (89%) allocated for financial services.
Education
IPs emphasized that UNICEF programmes are designed for sustainability. They believed that SITs would be sustained
and cited the recently revised second edition of the School Inclusive Teamwork Guide. They also indicated that EAs
need more attention. Among educators, 45% said they do not believe that the MoES and schools possess the
necessary capacity (human, technical) for legislative reforms to create a sustainable impact, while 17% said the
MoES and schools do have the capacity (34% said they did not know.) Given that the interventions are now formally
included in the education system and implementation is mandatory, the concerns among educators and resource
centre personnel relate primarily to a lack of capacity and will for quality implementation.
Various stakeholders noted other important aspects not part of the UNICEF programme but related to the
sustainability of UNICEF’s work: early intervention, forms of inclusion in secondary education (the law is not
amended yet), and changes in the university curricula for future teachers.
Government officials noted the numerous new laws and documentation now in place to ensure that changes are
sustained. As one official expressed, ‘There is no going back from this, the system is established.’ They also named
several intervention points that need more and continuous investment, especially related to teacher training and
EAs. Regarding quality assurance, one official described the need for improved and consistent oversight and
implementation, noting, ‘The indicators of the State Education Inspectorate are not equalized. They ask for IEPs for
every child with disabilities, but they are not required for everyone in practice, only where there is differentiation.’
An IP observed that it would be good to begin focusing more on quality, ‘especially in the area of indicators and
processes for integral evaluation and self-evaluation, continuous training of teachers and other school staff—but it
should be well thought out. And for quality implementation of the services, a thoughtful and serious support of the
schools is needed, which is designed especially in accordance with the needs of the school.’
Health
Health sector interventions are partially integrated into national policies and plans but without sufficient detail
targeting children with disabilities, jeopardizing their sustainability. As of this report, the UNICEF interventions are
integrated in the Action Plan for implementation of the CRPD from 2021,68 with an obligation to the MoH to adopt
a training plan without a clear determination about the expected results from the training plan. The evaluation team
was unable to learn whether the plan was developed or not. However, the National Strategy for Health Care (2021–
2030) is a comprehensive document outlining key reforms and policies for the decade. Unfortunately, the strategy
does not include any specific measures for persons with disabilities, generally, nor for children with disabilities,

46
specifically. Trainings of health care providers are planned, but there are no references to any issues relevant for
children with disabilities (i.e., early intervention, ICF model, accessible services, etc.). Public financing for patronage
home visits is scarce to incentivize higher performance.
EQ 6.2 What are the key factors that can positively or negatively influence the long-term financial sustainability of
the services established?
Similar to EQ 3.2, stakeholders pointed to political will as a key factor influencing financial sustainability, given the need
to add or retain budget allocations for new services. Additionally, competition and the lack of collaboration among
parents of children with disabilities across disability types can impede sustainability. Lastly, health care professionals’
migration out of the country negatively impacts the available workforce.
All sectors
In general, stakeholders agreed that during the period subject to this evaluation there was political will from the
government, but the leadership and commitment to reform varied and there were many administrative bottlenecks
impacting the sustainability of the interventions. Every new minister brings along his/her own people and
momentum, and institutional memory can be lost. Long-term sustainability is dependent mostly on strong political
will, i.e., whether the issue of the inclusion of children with disabilities will remain high on the political agenda (as it
was in the period from 2017–2020). Related to this is political stability. Early elections, political turmoil and
parliamentary blockades may impede all ongoing reform processes. Stakeholders also noted the economic situation
and the growing public debt as important additional factors. However, for now, there is no significant change in the
state’s budget on social protection.

Compared to 2015 when the country allocated 1% of its GDP to social assistance, in 2020, social assistance increased
to 1.3% of GDP. Still, North Macedonia’s social assistance spending is lower than comparative countries.69

Bank, p. 11.

as the lack of caretaking staff also may have a negative impact on the sustainability of the interventions. Parents are
organised in associations, but there is a lack of mutual coordination, and they are often not supportive of each
other’s activities and initiatives. The causes for this are most commonly related to different interests among each
type of disability, although other issues, such as scarce funding, can be contributing factors. The shortage of
caretaking staff is also an issue. Interviews and FGDs revealed that there is also a lack of leadership and ownership.
Residential institutions expect initiatives and enforcement from the central level and the MLSP. Specifically for
education, a significant factor is the availability of continued (and continuous) teacher training and support, which
public funding will need to cover in the case of in-service training. However, education-sector IPs stated that UNICEF
programs are designed to be sustainable, as institutional support is direct, and many factors have been met to
enable sustainability.
In the health sector, a specific risk that may negatively impact the sustainability of health interventions is the
outmigration of medical staff from the country. Both doctors and nurses are migrating to other countries within the
EU, putting a strain on the overall health care system, according to the National Strategy for Health Care.70 The
nurse-to-population ratio is even lower today than in 2010. All these factors will likely negatively affect the volume
and quality of services delivered.
EQ 6.3 To what extent is the participation and/or support of other partners enhancing sustainability?
IPs noted the importance and value of other partners but emphasized that ‘above all…the responsibility lies with the
system.’ The country remains dependent on foreign technical and financial support for quality-assurance mechanisms
and capacity-building mechanisms. Long-term sustainability requires local governments to be more actively engaged
in the process.
All Sectors
The country remains dependent on foreign technical and financial support for quality-assurance mechanisms and
capacity-building mechanisms. Their support remains critical for reforms to be successful. At this stage, the
government is still not able to take over the processes if donors retreat. IPs noted the importance and value of other
partners but emphasized that ‘above all…the responsibility lies with the system.’ They said the role of other
organisations should be focused on correcting or supporting the system, rather than as the system’s implementers.
Still, there are positive examples of partnerships. In the social protection sector, deinstitutionalisation would have
remained just a plan without support from partners. UNICEF provided very important contributions either through
funding, expertise, or political support. Also, although still in inception, good examples of child protection initiatives
have emerged in the period following UNICEF’s program. In addition to the services provided by Banja Bansko, the
municipality of Strumica ensures that the local municipality provides personal assistance in cooperation with the
Red Cross. Another example is UNICEF’s approach of engaging with professional associations of doctors and nurses,
instead of organising the trainings independently, which led to shared ownership and provided incentives to the
profession to continue working on this issue. Aside from the associations who were IPs, a government official noted
that the participation of key health care institutions, especially on the tertiary level, would also support the
sustainability of interventions.
PART 3. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The conclusions below are organized by criteria and are drawn directly from the findings and answers to the
evaluation questions described above. Each conclusion is followed by one or more strategic recommendations (10
total), most of which are coupled with operational recommendations. The recommendations were developed
collectively by the evaluation team and are based on identified gaps or logical next steps that flow from the findings.
Suggestions made by rights holders and duty bearers also influenced the recommendations. In addition, the
70 National Strategy for Health Care (2021–2030), p. 11.
48
Evaluation Reference Group reviewed draft recommendations and aided in their finalization and prioritization.
Some of the recommendations relate to additional research that UNICEF can conduct to better inform future
inclusion programming design, and thus would need to take place ahead of implementation. Other
recommendations will also require close cooperation with and buy-in from the government. Several
recommendations relate to ways in which UNICEF can continue or scale up the work that has already been done
with success. Lastly, there are recommendations relating to setting up better M&E so that outcomes and impact
can be more rigorously tracked and measured. All recommendations included in this report are considered by the
evaluation team to be important for furthering the work of inclusion in North Macedonia. The final priority rankings
of High, Medium, or Low represent a balance of the ERG members’ and UNICEF’s perspectives, and the evaluation
team’s consideration of UNICEF’s strengths and areas for growth. The party primarily responsible for implementing
each recommendation is also indicated.
Following the conclusions and recommendations, the report provides promising practices that can be considered
by other UNICEF Country Offices, as well as lessons learned that may be useful to consider as well. Lastly, the report
includes summaries of how each area of the evaluation (the four sectors as well as communication) aligns with the
standards outlined in the normative frameworks in Annex C.
Relevance
Conclusion 1. UNICEF’s interventions, which were based upon needs assessments, were relevant to the needs of
children with disabilities and their families, addressed many of these needs, and were planned and implemented
with the inclusion of key stakeholders. Participation from caregivers and OPDs could be strengthened, and data
points to gender disparities in access to services. UNICEF worked to align actions and interventions, such that
interventions in one sector largely aligned with and supported those in another sector, collectively contributing to
greater overall inclusion. The interventions led to significant progress in addressing the needs of children with
disabilities and their families, but within each sector, some needs have not yet been met. UNICEF made efforts to
involve relevant partners and duty-bearers, but perceptions of involvement varied by stakeholder, and not all felt
sufficiently involved. There is insufficient data to understand the cause(s) of gender disparities, but several
interviewees said that families of children with disabilities are less likely to seek support if the child is a girl. (Based
upon findings from EQ 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 2.1.)
Strategic Recommendation (SR) 1. To ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and their inclusion in society
is set on the political agenda and that policies are relevant and include measures for ensuring sustainable provision
of social services, facilitate networking and opportunities for advocacy between rights holders, particularly
representatives of OPDs and parents of children with disabilities, with duty-bearers, particularly members of
parliament and representatives of political parties. Ensuring participation of rights-holders is a key precondition for
interventions aligned with the HRBA. Such engagement should take place within and across sectors and be among
the initial steps undertaken during planning and design for new or continued interventions. Priority: MEDIUM.
Responsible party: UNICEF.
• Operational Recommendation (OR) 1.1 Support and facilitate the work of the members of the National
Coordination Body for implementation of the CRPD. The support should focus on improvement of coordination
among the members and cooperation with CSOs and OPDs.
• OR 1.2 Provide support for implementation of the measures and activities planned in the National Strategy
for Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities related to inclusion of children with disabilities. The Strategy and
corresponding action plan should ensure that the interventions in this area are well planned, coordinated
among different sectors and in accordance with the HRBA, the CRPD, the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy and
the principle of Leave No One Behind.
• OR 1.3 Support coordination, networking and coalition building activities for OPDs advocating for inclusion of
children with disabilities in different sectors and on behalf of different disability types. Establish a structured
consultation mechanism for engaging OPDs and parents of children with disabilities in the planning and
49
implementation processes within UNICEF as well as in sectors where UNICEF works. Be mindful of competition
between OPDs and between parents of varying disability types, and engage equitably, ensuring all perspectives
are heard.
SR 2. Take measures to understand and address the gender gap in children with disabilities accessing social services.
Conduct research to examine the cause(s) behind fewer females than males using social services as well as whether
there are different needs across genders, and, based on the findings, design or adjust training and programme
interventions to close gaps and target needs more accurately. Priority: MED. Responsible party: UNICEF.
• OR 2. Measures to examine and address the gender gap can include a KAP study, collecting data related to
gender disparities, supporting gender mainstreaming in policy making processes, and training modules for
duty-bearers on gender-specific aspects of service provision.
Coherence
Conclusion 2. Across all sectors, UNICEF engaged multiple actors and made concerted efforts to align with other
activities and efforts in the country. Nevertheless, the lack of a clear, detailed TOC to drive and focus
programming, as well as the lack (in many cases) of baseline data to inform goal and target setting as well as
measurement of progress, may have limited the potential for even greater coherence and synergy. Coherence
was achieved through open communication with the Government and with other donors and implementers, and
with the support of strong political will among duty-bearers, particularly during the first half of the country
programme (2016-2018). At times, the sequencing of interventions across sectors created new gaps in service while
others were resolved. (Based upon findings from EQ 2.1, 2.2, and 5.3.)
SR 3. Develop a robust and detailed TOC that is informed by baseline data, which allows for outcome goals related
to increases, decreases, and improvements to be set and measured with more rigor than stakeholder perceptions
can provide. UNICEF would lead this effort but validate assumptions, goals, and targets with both Government duty
bearers as well as rights holders among the disability population. Priority: MED. Responsible party: UNICEF.
• OR 3. Conduct another KAP study to continue measuring changes in the general population. Also conduct
baseline studies of duty-bearers, by sector, ahead of interventions, to understand needs and assess skills and
knowledge. Analyse data for themes that transcend sectors and can inform the TOC and support alignment and
coherence during intervention planning.
Effectiveness
Conclusion 3. UNICEF-supported interventions contributed greatly to eliminating bottlenecks by increasing the
availability and supply of services as well as qualified human resources and facilitated large positive changes in
public perception of disability and inclusion. Children who have benefitted from the deinstitutionalisation process
have much better living conditions, but those living in small group homes need more individualized support than
they are receiving. Educators found that the training on inclusive education was very effective and expressed that
they need more training and additional personnel to support children with disabilities in mainstream schools.
Medical professionals found their training helpful in understanding and identifying disability and reducing
unnecessary referrals; however, the overall lack of health system personnel and infrastructure remains a barrier,
including the insufficiency of specialized free or subsidized services (e.g., speech therapists, rehabilitation therapists,
etc.) for children with disabilities at the local level. In addition, the public view and perception on disability, especially
on children with disabilities, has changed, and UNICEF played a key role in this change. All stakeholders, as well as
document review, identified the presence or absence of political will as a critical factor in achievements and
challenges related to UNICEF objectives. Social perceptions are also a key a factor. (Based upon findings from EQ
3.1, 3.2, and 3.3.)
50
SR 4. Carry forward capacity-building activities with targeted trainings as well as develop other tools, such as long-
term mentoring and peer-to-peer activities, which are approaches that educators, social workers and other service
providers view as successful and desired. Elicit pledges from institutions that they will introduce these trainings in
their mandatory introductory and continuous employee training programs and provide support for developing pre-
service and routine in-service trainings. Priority: HIGH. Responsible party: GOV.
• OR 4.1 Introduce methodologies that will measure the impact of the capacity-building activities for a long period
of time after they have been completed. In addition to data collected by UNICEF, this could involve supporting
State Supervision entities to develop and routinely report on indicators related to outcomes and impact (in
addition to outputs), such as data on identification and enrolment in benefits, access to and use of services,
learning outcomes, community engagement, etc.
• OR 4.2. Ensure the inclusion of children with disabilities from kindergarten through secondary school. Continue
to provide robust inclusion training to educators and require all SIT members to participate. Provide a clear
transition plan for supporting students’ move from primary into secondary school, which includes training
secondary school teachers and support staff and ensuring that the adequate support measures (assistive
technologies, educational and personal assistance, inclusion training for teachers, etc.) are in included in plans
and budgets. Support Resource Centres to engage and train additional staff and provide technical resources for
effective support to schools.
SR 5. Enhance the development of a diverse and functional set of services for children with disabilities such as:
alternative care units’ foster care as a substitute for small group homes, support for the transition of existing day
care centres into Disability Support Centres, tailored services for social inclusion of children with disabilities, and
gender mainstreaming in service planning and provision. Priority: HIGH. Responsible party: GOV.
• OR 5.1. Provide technical support to the MLSP and other relevant stakeholders for further development of
alternative and foster care, including support in development of policies and standards, trainings as well as
direct support to alternative and foster care units.
• OR 5.2. To better ensure that children with disabilities living in small group homes have access to educational
and other activities necessary to support their inclusion in communities, provide children currently residing in
them with better supports, including personal assistants outside of the care provided by the SGH staff and
increased involvement and engagement from the children themselves, their parents, and the surrounding
communities in planning and carrying out services. In addition, support municipalities, local CSOs, sport clubs,
and cultural centres in developing and conducting cultural, sport and other socially meaningful activities for
inclusion of children with disabilities living in small group homes, alternative care units and foster care.
SR 6. Promote legislative amendments that will ensure that families of children with disabilities are subsidized for
specific disability-related costs (e.g., medical treatments and diagnostics, specialist care, medication and
supplements, assistive devices, transport costs, etc.) so that those costs do not create or exacerbate a state of
poverty for these families. Priority: HIGH. Responsible party: GOV.
• OR 6. Collect healthcare needs and cost data from families through the KAP survey mentioned above in OR 2.
Work with relevant government ministries and agencies to assess the feasibility of covering additional costs as
well as to identify and negotiate efficiencies with service or product providers. Explore social entrepreneurship
as a means of supplementing outstanding benefits (see SR 10 below).
Efficiency
Conclusion 4. While in-depth financial analysis was outside the scope of this evaluation, stakeholders agreed that
UNICEF funding as well as human and technical resources were adequately budgeted across all sectors, and there
was a good division of expenses among donor organisations to avoid the multiplication of costs. The same
programme results could not have been achieved with less resources; many stakeholders observed that more
51
resources were and are needed. (Based upon findings from EQ 4.1.).
SR 7. Advocate for greater and more efficient public spending on children with disabilities, including better and more
equitable availability of support services. Priority: HIGH. Responsible party: GOV.
• OR 7. A state-conducted financial analysis of current spending could uncover ways to increase efficiency among
existing service providers as well as inform the provision of new services in areas of the country that still lack
support for children with disabilities. Service providers themselves, as well as families of children with
disabilities, are likely to have useful insights into how to make the most of public spending.
Impact
Conclusion 5. Many sectors lacked clear, measurable targets for intervention outcomes related to inclusion at the
start of the 2016-2020 programme. However, M&E reporting showed progress on the majority of output
indicators related to inclusion of children with disabilities, and all stakeholders as well as documentation pointed
to UNICEF’s positive impact on shifting public perception of disability. Although available data (from UNICEF as
well as from the Government) for rigorously measuring impact is limited, existing data combined with the
perspectives of duty bearers and rights holders indicated that UNICEF’s inclusion programming made a significant
impact. Tangible services offered within and across sectors (especially in social and child protection and education)
contributed to the needs being met, to varying degrees, and UNICEF’s simultaneous communication campaigns
aligned with and complemented its work driving change across different sectors and at different levels (i.e., political
commitment, changes in legislation, implementation of policies, and demand for services). (Based upon findings
from EQ 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.)
SR 8. Further strengthen internal monitoring systems for tracking progress and support and impel State efforts for
setting up an adequate and accessible unified system for collecting and processing data on children with disabilities.
Do this in cooperation with relevant ministries, institutions, and the State Statistical Office. Priority: HIGH.
Responsible party: GOV.
• OR 8.1 Negotiate and facilitate collaboration and sharing between the health, education, and social protection
management information systems (HMIS and EMIS), so that all relevant data regarding children with disabilities
is accessible by qualified service providers. Such data will also provide baseline figures that can inform UNICEF
programming, which will further enable impact evaluation.
• OR 8.2. Developing a more robust and detailed ToC (SR 2) and using baseline data (including needs assessment
data) to set targets can drive robust impact and outcome measurement, which will enable more targeted
planning for future and ongoing interventions.
SR 9. Continue and expand efforts to shift public opinion on disability through communications and awareness
raising campaigns that draw from and highlight recent successes. Priority: MED. Responsible party: UNICEF.
• OR 9. Work with families of children with and without disabilities, OPDs, educators, and heath care providers
to share positive experiences within schools, health centres, and during daily life of children with disabilities
being included in ways they were not previously. Highlight the contrasting experiences of exclusion vs. inclusion,
and target groups or communities where negative perceptions remain entrenched, in addition to targeting the
general public. Find and support champions of inclusion within communities who can be a bridge between
groups, carrying the message into specific communities that have been resistant thus far.
Sustainability
Conclusion 6. Across all four sectors, UNICEF interventions are integrated into national policies and budgets, which
52
is an important outcome and a strong foundation for sustainability. There is room for improvement, as policies
have varying degrees of detail and specificity that can enable implementation, and many implementers and rights
holders deem state funding and/or long-term planning to be inadequate. Quality-assurance mechanisms within the
system are lagging and may need further development, though direct training in relation to this has taken place in
the education sector with state education inspectors. Duty bearers and rights holders pointed to political will as a
key factor influencing financial sustainability. Some also noted that competition and the lack of collaboration among
parents of children with disabilities across disability types can impede sustainability. The centralized nature of social
service funding, combined with the inadequacy of funding to meet the needs of families of children with disabilities,
hinders the full realization and sustainability of the State’s efforts to provide a robust safety net for this population.
(Based upon findings from EQ 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3.)
SR 10. Encourage efforts for the increased sustainability of social services through decentralising and introducing
social entrepreneurship as an innovative means for funding social services. Because the country is moving forward
into the EU accession process, a decrease of donor support might be expected, and the country should remain
prepared to ensure sustainability of services for inclusion of children with disabilities. Priority: LOW. Responsible
party: GOV.
• OR 10.1 In cooperation with other international donors, support local government efforts to set up and
implement a local social protection program that will be focused on inclusion of children with disabilities. Social
services could be much more cost-efficient if planned and implemented by the local government, which is
closer to the citizens. Support the Government to strengthen the donations from the central budget to the local
government and require that they match the funds from their own sources or local donors. In addition, track
spending to ensure that the funds are used for children with disabilities.
• OR 10.2 Train OPDs and other CSOs that provide services to introduce and utilize social entrepreneurship
endeavours to enhance sustainable funding for service provision. Train service providers on skills for fund-
raising and conducting economic activities for funding their efforts so that they can secure additional sources
of financing that will allow for continuous provision of services that are less dependent on international donor
support.

Promising practices
1. The institutionalization of the ICF model represented the basis for all other interventions and is one of the
practices that has the potential to shift the dominant medical model to a social-rights model for disability.
Although its implementation was postponed compared to the initial plan, its introduction entailed major
Governmental commitment based on outstanding advocacy activities and strong partnership with the
Government. The integration of the members of the ICF committees into the public healthcare systems,
including providing premises for their work, will support the long-term sustainability of UNICEF interventions.
The combination of advocacy and capacity building activities was done following the principles of the rights-
based approach. It increased the capacity of the duty bearers while at the same time requiring accountability.
2. Combining communication for social change advocacy activities with technical support for developing the
required policy and legislative adjustments and capacity-building activities has proven to be an appropriate
tactic for realizing the intended outcome of removing all children from institutions, which was achieved before
2020. UNICEF’s approach was comprehensive, coherent, and synchronized and can be replicated in countries
with similar social and child protection systems, provided it is synchronized with the necessary communication
and capacity building activities.
3. Establishing resource centres was one of the most positive policies for enabling and facilitating educational
inclusion. The policy enabled the resource centre's staff (primarily special educators and rehabilitators), to
demonstrate and apply their competencies outside of the limits of (former) special schools, act as inclusion
mentors for school staff and educational assistants, and represent a crucial link between children with
disabilities and mainstream schools. At the same time, the centres provide specialized services for children with
disabilities, to some extent overcoming the lack of free-of-charge services offered at the local level.
Lessons learned
1. The interventions implemented by UNICEF were designed to address the system-level deficiencies which
resulted in unequal treatment of children with disabilities. Because of their complexity, they required integrated
cross-sectoral programming which, although planned, was not always coherent in practice due to the different
external factors (such as uneven levels of commitment on behalf of the various ministries and state bodies).
Considering that these externalities were not sufficiently elaborated in the CPD, the interventions would have
benefited from a more detailed ToC document which precisely defines the causal linkages within and across its
programs and the potential internal and external factors which may impede or slow down implementation of
sector-level interventions. This would have also enabled more effective progress monitoring and measurement
of outcomes and impact.
2. UNICEF’s inclusion interventions were gender-neutral in design, but data showing disparities in boys’ and girls’
enrolment in social services and education indicates that, going forward, more attention should be paid to the
different and unique needs of girls, and programming should instead include gender-specific elements and
associated training for service providers.
3. Although UNICEF interventions are national in scope, the consultative and decision-making processes were
mainly centralized and did not always consider the regional perspectives and specifics. This resulted in the
centralization of services and prevalence of the needs of rights holders from the capital city.

Alignment with Normative Standards
Overall, this study found that the UNICEF-supported inclusion efforts in North Macedonia are well aligned with
international normative standards as framed by the CRPD, the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy, and the principle of
Leave No One Behind, and are on the pathway of progressively realizing the rights of children with disabilities. All
areas of evaluation are partially or fully meeting normative standards with the exception of one standard outlined
under health. For a full breakdown of definitions and ratings by sector see Annex C. Results and areas of future
growth are outlined below.
Normative Ratings by Areas of Evaluation
Children with disabilities are well represented in social protection laws and policies, which were
developed in consultation with OPDs, but competent state bodies and institutions
implementing social protection policies lack sufficient coordination and capacity. The ICF model
now determines the eligibility of children with disabilities for inclusion in mainstream education
and, in some cases, for social assistance (although the old, medical model is still used as well).
The ICF model also has laid the foundation for a national registry to be established that can be
used by various sectors to generate useful data on the inclusion of children with disabilities. While government
reforms in 2019 have increased social benefits for children with disabilities, the extra costs (direct and indirect) of
disability are not yet adequately covered, and access to services can be difficult at times due to lack of health
insurance coverage or the limited capacity of service providers. This sector has fully met 55% of normative standards
and partially met 45%.
North Macedonia’s child protection sector actively focuses on the deinstitutionalisation of
persons with disabilities, including children. National laws and policies provide resources for
family reunification and/or community care, ultimately eliminating the role of institutions, and
the government has, at times, consulted and incorporated OPD feedback in the
deinstitutionalisation process. Data has been routinely collected on the progress toward
deinstitutionalisation, but intersectoral collaboration is needed to ensure children have access
to education and health care as well. While reporting mechanisms are in place to report
violations regarding living conditions, actions to address violations are not always taken. Like other sectors, this
sector struggles with limited numbers of professionals and their lack of capacity, and more training is necessary.
Building professionals’ capacity will help with shortfalls related to supports available for carers, such as training in
caregiving and mental health services. This sector has fully met 33% of the normative standards and partially met
67%.
55
Education policies and plans are well aligned with North Macedonia Constitution, and primary
education policies meet international standards outlined by the CRPD. Plans address areas such
as budget, objectives, and targets to achieve inclusive education. Financing for inclusive
education follows a school-based model and considers students with disabilities, but teachers
reported that additional resources and training are needed. Curriculum allows for flexibility and
adapted learning, and while the principles of reasonable accommodation are in place, awareness
and training are needed in this area. Existing in-service training programs could be scaled up and,
in addition to teachers, could include school administration and all SIT members. Peer support models could also be
developed. The country’s tertiary (pre-service) teacher training programs need to incorporate inclusive pedagogy
and instil the expectation of inclusion in all new educators. A notable success is the transition of resource centre
staff to coaches and mentors for general education teachers. Despite progress in primary education, efforts are
needed in secondary education and transition planning. While legislative measures are inclusive, discriminatory
practice toward learners with disabilities still persist. This sector has fully met 39% of the normative standards and
partially met 61%.
Laws and policies include provisions for children with disabilities to have access to the same
range and quality of health care provided to others and provisions for early identification and
services. In practice, services to beneficiaries are limited, with services more readily available in
urban areas. While health insurance covers many services and devices, it does not cover all,
making some treatments and services unaffordable for families. Data is being collected through
newly formed ICF assessment bodies even though the main bylaw has yet to be adopted. Data
does not yet exist in a health information system (HIS) to collect accurate information on child functioning/disability
status and rehabilitative needs and provision, including assistive devices. No pre-service training programs for
healthcare providers were examined as part of this study; UNICEF-supported trainings provided professional
development for existing health care providers. This sector has fully met 22% of the normative standards, partially
met 67%, and not met 11%.
The area of communication is relevant to all sectors, and programmes included diverse
representation and promoted active and dynamic views of persons with disabilities, including
children with disabilities. OPDs participated in developing communication messages and were
actively engaged in supporting the dissemination to communities. However, not all UNICEF
communications were accessible to all persons with disabilities. This sector has fully met 80% of
the normative standards and partially met 20%.

EQ 6.2 What are the key factors that can positively or negatively influence the long-term financial sustainability of

Social Protection: Long-term sustainability is dependent mostly on political will. Additional important factors are the
economic situation and the growing public debt. However, for now, there is no significant change in the state’s

Findings Evidence Ranking EQ Answer Justification
budget on social protection. The decentralisation of social protection and promotion of social entrepreneurship as a
means to fund inclusion activities can contribute to ensuring financial sustainability of services.
Child Protection: While mentioning political will, the IPs also noted that additional factors impacted sustainability:
the lack of cooperation and coordination among the parents of children with disabilities and the lack of caretaking
staff.
Education: Government officials emphasized the need for continued (and continuous) teacher training and support,
which public funding will need to cover in the case of in-service training. IPs stated that UNICEF programs are
designed to be sustainable as institutional support is direct, and many factors have been met. However, it is
necessary to invest in human resources.
Health: Aside from the necessary prioritization by the government, a significant risk that may negatively impact the
sustainability of health interventions is the outmigration of medical staff from the country.

Scoring criteria:
• None: The programme design includes activities and outcomes related to the normative standard, but there is no
evidence of even partial alignment with the standard.
• Partial: There is evidence that the programme contributed to some outcomes that align with the standard, but other
elements are missing or not aligned. Thus, there is partial alignment.
• Full: There is evidence that the programme contributed to outcomes that are in full alignment with the standard.

ANNEX F: PARTICIPANT PROTECTION PROTOCOL AND INFORMED CONSENT FORM
Protection Protocol
Participant Safety:
UNICEF has contracted with Inclusive Development Partners (IDP) to conduct an Evaluation of UNICEF Interventions
Addressing Inclusion of Children with Disabilities in North Macedonia. IDP has partnered with two national experts in
North Macedonia to consult on the project and carry out the Focus Group Discussions (FGD). During the recruitment
process, our national experts who have experience and expertise in the fields of inclusive education and law, will
introduce themselves and the evaluation to the potential participants and share the informed consent form with them.
This will allow the potential participants to become familiar with the evaluation and its requirements and informally
consent to the process before accepting the invitation to participate in the FGD. During the FGD the facilitators will
repeat the introductions of themselves and the evaluation and will obtain informed consent from the participants
(regarding the study and the recording the session). The discussions will be conducted using an online platform such
as Zoom. The online platform offers both convenience and security for the participants allowing them to take the
call/meeting in an environment of their choosing (at home or in their office) and allows them to adhere to COVID-19
protocols of social distancing, if needed.
Data security:
After obtaining consent, the facilitators will record the discussion and take notes throughout the conversation, which
they will later translate from Macedonian to English to share with the rest of the evaluation team. The translated English
notes from the discussions will be shared with the rest of the team on a secure file on Dropbox that only the research
team has access to. The recording and the notes will be destroyed after the end of the evaluation in September 2022.

ANNEX J: TERMS OF REFERENCE
Terms of Reference for a Contractor
Evaluation of UNICEF Interventions Addressing
Inclusion of Children with Disabilities in North Macedonia
(August 2021)
I. Overview
This Terms of Reference is developed for a thematic evaluation, which aims to examine the extent to which
programmes supported by UNICEF North Macedonia have contributed to addressing critical system-level bottlenecks
to ensure that children with disabilities72 have access to services, live in caring family environments, and are able to
enjoy all their rights.
The evaluation is envisioned as a cross-cutting, thematic evaluation that would encompass actions implemented
during the country programme 2016-2020 across four programmes—child protection, education, social protection
and health and nutrition—as well as a comprehensive communication strategy aimed at inclusion of children with
disabilities. It will examine UNICEF’s contribution to system level changes and the transformation of nationally
developed approaches (supply and demand driven). Its overarching goal will be to contribute to ongoing reform
processes, inform policymaking and guide programme design, as well as enhance the accountability of UNICEF to key
stakeholders and contribute to learning and knowledge sharing related to the situation of children with disabilities in
the country. That said, it must be acknowledged that there might not be sufficient evidence available to systematically
examine the contribution of the country office to changes at the level of the child. In addition, the methodological
challenge of measuring child outcomes and wellbeing must also be recognized and taken into consideration.
It is expected that the evaluation will allow for gathering information to understand strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, innovations and lessons learnt (i.e. what could have been and what could be done differently), in order
to improve and sharpen further initiatives to ensure equity-based inclusive service provision for children with
disabilities.
Results of the planned evaluation will be measured by assessing the extent to which the conclusions and
recommendations from the evaluation are used to effectively inform the design of new Government policies and
approaches and inform the transformation of UNICEF interventions.
II. Context and Background
UNICEF North Macedonia country programme 2016-2020 had an explicit focus on children with disabilities, ensuring
that “all programme components will include a disability component to promote an inclusive approach, with special
attention given to the children’s development, learning and participation, as well as child-centred services.” During the
72 Article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with disabilities provides the following definition: Persons with disabilities include those who have long-term
physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal
basis with others
99 | P ag e
first half of 2018, UNICEF conducted a light Strategic Review of the 2016 - 2020 Country Programme of cooperation
with the Government and key partners. Not only was this a mid-point of the implementation of the programme, but
a need emerged to take stock of what UNICEF had been doing and focusing on given the change of the government a
year before and the reform processes that had begun. A consolidation of more recent data in the run up to the strategic
review revealed key universal challenges, particularly in health and education, that affect all children. Hence, the initial
focus on specific groups of vulnerable children changed to encompass major issues affecting all, or larger groups of
children. Despite this shift in the strategic direction of the programme, as a response to the changing national context
and new opportunities to accelerate reforms for children, interventions addressing inclusion of children with disabilities
remained part of the programme.
Throughout the country programme, UNICEF North Macedonia played a convening role and provided guidance and
technical support for policy and advocacy, elevated partnerships and supported promotion of the rights of children
with disabilities. Some of the highlights include:
Social Protection
▪ Introduction of a new human rights-based model of disability assessment, based on the International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) in the second half of 2019. The globally accepted ICF
provides a holistic model for assessing children’s potential and linking children and their families to the services
that will allow them to flourish.
Education
▪ Comprehensive technical assistance in the development of a legal framework and implementation of
education practices that support the full inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream education.
UNICEF supported the development of a new Law on Primary Education, that sets forth the legal basis for full
inclusion of all children in mainstream education by 2023, as well as the development of the Concept for
Inclusive Education, that offers specific guidance how to practically implement inclusion in education.
▪ Inclusive education practices were modelled in 25 kindergartens and 30 primary schools, and new support
services (Education Assistance and Personal Assistance) were introduced in schools. The practice of special
groups for children with disabilities in early childhood education was abolished.
▪ Support provided to the Law for primary education and related regulations, which set forward the legal basis
for total inclusion of students with disabilities in the mainstream education system. In its initial articles, the
new Law describes the inclusion of all children in education as one of the key principles and goals. The law
introduces a national concept on inclusion that will guide the process, developed with UNICEF support. It also
effectively transformed all “special” schools into resource centre schools and envisions their role as supporting
the inclusion process in regular primary schools so that, as of 2023, all children attend mainstream schools.
Health
▪ Continuous work with the home visiting services and family doctors to enhance the capacities of frontline
health workers in early detection and early intervention for developmental difficulties.
Child Protection
▪ UNICEF was among the strongest supporters of the process of deinstitutionalisation and development of
alternative care services for children with disabilities. This resulted in no children placed in large scale
100 | P ag e
institutions in North Macedonia by the end of 2019. Children are either reunited with their families, are living
with foster families, have been adopted or are residing in small group homes with up to five children per home.
In parallel, strengthening the childcare system was enabled by providing evidence through research, leading
to revision of legislative framework, followed by re-design of the engagement, preparation, monitoring and
support system for foster and kindship care provision, and capacity and community-based services
development. To prevent unnecessary separation of children from their families, introduction of a
gatekeeping mechanism was initiated. The needs of children with disabilities were specifically addressed with
newly established community and home-based early intervention services, targeted parenting support
programme, and enhancing the system for community-based legal empowerment for caregivers of children
with disabilities. UNICEF supported development of a new model of work in five day-care centres, aiming at
transforming day care centres into support centres that would offer variety of services in the community.
Communication
▪ As negative attitudes and behaviours represent a significant barrier faced by children with disabilities,
especially in realizing the right to family environment and the right to education, UNICEF has been engaged in
in addressing this barrier, having conducted Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) studies to measure
stigma and discrimination and having implemented C4D initiatives to address the negative attitudes and
behaviours towards children with disabilities.
COVID-19 response
▪ During the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF supported the provision of an online individualized support to
children with disabilities and their caregivers, for early intervention, early stimulation and speech therapy.
Parents of children with disabilities and a number of foster families were provided with psychosocial support.
In its Concluding Observations73 on the government’s report in 2018, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with
Disability expressed concern at the lack of consistent and comparable statistics on persons with disabilities in North
Macedonia, the lack of human rights indicators in the available data, and the extent to which disability-related
indicators are effectively applied in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The Academic
Network of European Disability Experts (ANED)74 also notes the limitations on policy and programme development
inherent in North Macedonia’s lack of official statistical data on persons with disabilities.
The only official data available from the State Statistical Office relates to those using some sort of social services or
claiming benefits. In 2018, a total of 7,346 children with disability already registered with social services. At the time,

there were 43 children in institutions and another 700 under the general social service net, giving an estimated total
of 8,388 children with disability in the country. This, however, is most likely a significant underestimate.
UNICEF North Macedonia Main Areas of Intervention 2016-2020
The country programme design was initially driven by the key areas in the Regional Knowledge and Leadership Agenda
(RKLA), looking at the relevant data for the specific groups of children the programme aimed to target, including
children with disabilities. The programme rationale is described in the Think Piece accompanying the preparation of
the 2016-2020 country programme.
The main areas of intervention were as follows:
• Defining policies and legal framework
• Generating political commitment, advocacy, building public awareness and demand around the inclusion of
children with disabilities
• Introducing service delivery models and supporting the development of institutional structures
• Modelling of the new types of services
• Strengthening human resources through the provisions of training materials and training
• Adaptation, testing and piloting new tools (M-Chat, ICF)
• Strengthening multisectoral approach by providing the trainings to the staff of different agencies and NGOs
• Monitoring and documenting
• Developing of data and generating evidence
III. Purpose of the Evaluation
The purpose of this summative evaluation is to provide a summary account of UNICEF’s results to date in programmes
supporting inclusion of children with disabilities in the country, including interventions designed and implemented as
part of the COVID-19 response. The evaluation will be forward looking, being an important learning opportunity, both
for UNICEF and its partners, especially the government, in deriving lessons from the experience and existing evidence
that can bring attention to the policies and good practices and inform UNICEF programming targeting children with
disabilities and their families at all levels. In particular, the evaluation would guide further programming related to
inclusive education, inclusive and child-sensitive social protection, child poverty measurement and analysis and more
equitable public finance for children.
Findings and recommendations of the evaluation will be very valuable to help UNICEF North Macedonia to reflect on
its own progress and plan next steps taking into account the lessons learned.
IV. Evaluation Scope
The evaluation is expected to encompass programmatic initiatives and actions in support of integration of children
with disabilities over the period 2016-2020. These included:
In education, UNICEF modelled the concept and inclusive education practices in 30 primary schools, and offered
professional development to 2,200 teachers (on-site) and 4,500 teachers (online). A new support service, Educational
and Personal Assistance, was established in schools. UNICEF provided technical support in drafting policies conducive
to inclusive education, including: the new Law on Primary Education, National Learning Standards, National Concept
for Distance Learning, National Concept for Inclusive Education, plan and protocols for safe school reopening during
the Covid-19 pandemic, new Law on Teachers and Support Staff and 15 bylaws for professional and career
102 | P ag e
advancement of teachers, technical support to the Ministry of Education and Science to oversee the transformation
of special schools into resource centers. The positive effect and data utilization are set to continue further with the
new Law on Secondary Education and a new concept for Primary Education, currently under development.
In early childhood education, through piloting 25 inclusive kindergartens, where capacities for working with children
with disabilities were strengthened, UNICEF established inclusive teams as essential mechanisms for inclusive ECE
practices in all kindergartens across the country. This programme also introduced a mechanism of mentoring visits to
kindergartens which resulted in improved skills and knowledge for early learning, and empowered teachers to work
together as a team. These efforts resulted in a major milestone with a legislative change that abolished the practice
of having special groups for children with disabilities in ECE.
In child protection, interventions to be encompassed include de-institutionalisation, childcare system strengthening,
and establishment of community based and support services.
In health and nutrition, capacity development for patronage nurses and family doctors on early detection and
intervention for developmental difficulties, adaptation and testing of M-Chat, piloting ICF in family doctors’ practices.
In social protection, UNICEF engaged partners from the Government and the Association of Special Educators to
develop and pilot a new model of disability assessment based on the International Classification of Functioning,
Disability and Health (ICF). The ICF framework should enable integrated response to persons with disability needs for
health, educational, and social protection support. With UNICEF support, functional assessment was incorporated in
the Law on primary education as a basis of providing educational support to children with disability, and a Rulebook
on additional educational, health and social support for children and youth was drafted – detailing the manner of
conducing the functional assessment and the roles of various institutions and authorities. By the end of 2020, with
UNICEF support, three pilot centres for ICF-based assessment of children have been established - one national and
two covering the Skopje region - and staffed with trained teams. The child’s parent(s) are now full members of the
disability assessment team, together with a qualified special educator, paediatrician, a social worker and a
psychologist. Approximately 350 children and their families used the piloted assessment services which provided
significant opportunities to learn from the process and adjust accordingly. UNICEF also provided technical assistance
and support to the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy in the 2019 reform of the country’s social protection and social
welfare systems – including the new Social Protection Law and a major revision of the Child Protection Law. The
reform overhauled and consolidated the cash benefit system, to, among other things, ensure increased coverage and
adequacy. It also to introduced new social support and care services. The disability allowance for children (special
allowance) was increased by 15%. It covered 3,275 children in 2019, raising to 3,810 in 2020. The allowance for
persons with disability was extended to also cover persons with intellectual disability. The supplement to the part-
time salary for a parent caring for a child with a disability has increased to 50% of the average net salary. A so-called
permanent allowance, resembling a pension, was introduced for parents who took care of a child with a disability up
to the age of 26. Two new services for people with disabilities were introduced - Personal Assistance and Home Care.
Respite care was also introduced to provide relief to primary caregivers.
In communication, a comprehensive communication strategy was implemented, using a mix of channels to reach and
engage the public. A major element of the strategy was a multi-year campaign that combined a strong social and
digital component, as well as selected activities targeting different audiences.
An important segment of the evaluation would be to also assess—to the extent possible—the intersectoral
dimension of the work, that is, how the work in different areas collectively responded to the needs of children with
disabilities. Gender should be also taken into consideration across the evaluation criteria.
103 | P ag e
V. Objectives of the Evaluation75
i) Assess the relevance of the disability programming taking an intersectoral approach with a strong focus
on early childhood education, education, child protection, social protection, health and communication
for development, as well as the incorporation of a gender perspective.
ii) Assess the extent to which the programmes addressing inclusion of children with disabilities have been
successfully applied and with what results – with specific reference to the scope defined above.
iii) To the extent possible, assess UNICEF’s contribution, in terms of the role the organization has played,
towards addressing systems’ level bottlenecks and improving effective coverage with evidence-based
interventions.
iv) Assess the extent to which the results achieved to-date have supported—or can support and inform
the design of new Government programmes for the delivery of accessible and affordable services for
children with disabilities.
VI. Evaluation Framework/Questions
The evaluation framework is shaped along the lines of the DAC76 criteria and the evaluation is expected to respond
to the following evaluation questions:
Relevance
1. How relevant have UNICEF interventions supporting children with disabilities and their families been?
2. Was the design of the programmes and interventions/activities appropriate for achieving the intended
results and outcomes?
3. To what extent did models and approaches to delivery correspond to and address actual needs of children
with disabilities and their families, including any gender-specific needs?
4. Were relevant partners involved in the programme design, implementation and evaluation, including
children with disabilities, their families and organisations of people with disabilities?
Coherence:
1. Have UNICEF actions and interventions in different sectors been mutually reinforcing in improving inclusion
of children with disabilities? And to what extent?
2. Have UNICEF interventions complemented any existing programme and/or policies, thereby enhancing their
effect? Or, in contrast, have they possibly undermined such programmes and/or policies?
3. Has there been complementarity and consistency with other actors’ interventions and actions in the area of
inclusion of children with disabilities? Or, in contrast, has this aspect been overseen and efforts have been
duplicated?
75 The objectives are formulated so as to address the 5 OECD/DAC standard evaluation criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and
sustainability. https://www.oecd.org/development/evaluation/qualitystandards.pdf
76 https://www.oecd.org/dac/evaluation/revised-evaluation-criteria-dec-2019.pdf

ensuring effective inclusion of children with disabilities?
i. Increasing availability of supply of services and qualified human resources for their timely
and effective delivery?
ii. Ensuring financial accessibility of services and setting eligibility criteria that do not cause
significant exclusion errors in the access to services and cash benefits, including gender
related exclusion
iii. Changing knowledge and raising awareness about and demand for services and cash
benefits
iv. Shifting the paradigm around disability, contributing to reduced stigma and discrimination
and positive social norm change
v. Ensuring quality of social services in support of children with disabilities, their parents and
families, as well as adequacy of cash benefits and entitlements.
2. What are the key benefits for children and their caregivers from the implemented programmes and
interventions/activities? To the extent possible—subject to availability of relevant data—determine if
different groups (based on gender, ethnicity, socio-economic profile, urban-rural residence, and type of
impairment) are benefitting to the same extent?
3. What factors (e.g. political, social, gender and cultural, social norms, systemic, or related to the programme
and service design and implementation, professional practices) were critical for the achievement or failure
of the initial objectives?
4. How effective were the capacity building activities?
5. Was coordination between the different sectors and sectoral programmes effective and did it contribute to
planned outcomes?
6. What is UNICEF comparative advantage and what are the synergies with other actors, programmes and
interventions? What synergies have been created (including with private sector)?
7. What worked and what did not work to reduce inequities (in child outcomes, access to and utilisation of
essential service, etc.)? What are reasons for this?
Efficiency:
1. Were programmes implemented according to initial timeline? Were there any delays in implementation and
what were the reasons for that?
2. Were UNICEF programme budgets and resources (human, financial and technical) adequately used for
addressing priority bottlenecks? Could we have the same programme results will less resources? (economic
and technical efficiency)
3. Were needs of children with disabilities and their families/caregivers clearly assessed?

(physical, mental, intellectual or sensory) or severity?
Sustainability:
1. Are legal, institutional/administrative and financial mechanisms established to ensure monitoring and
evaluation as well as sustainability of programme results (policies, strategies, services)? Are conditions
established to ensure quality of the services (service standards, training, supervision mechanisms, beneficiary
grievance and redress mechanisms, etc.)?
2. What are the key factors that can positively or negatively influence the long-term financial sustainability of
the services established?
3. To what extent is the participation and/or support of other partners enhancing sustainability?
4. Which lessons learned have external validity?
Evaluation questions will be further refined by the evaluation team during the desk review phase and in consultation
with the Reference Group and partners and stakeholders – to focus on the questions that, if well answered, have the
greatest potential to impact on policies, strategies and future programming.
The evaluation is related to the following stakeholders:
• Policy-making and coordination authorities, which design, enact and coordinate policies related to inclusion
of persons with disabilities (e.g. Parliament and its Labour and Social Policy Committee, as well as the
Interparty Parliamentary Group on the Rights of Persons with Disability; Office of the Prime-minister; National
Coordinating Body on the Implementation of the CRPD; Ministry of Education and Science; Ministry of
Health; Ministry of Labour and Social Policy);
• Service providers to children (education, healthcare, social and child protection, municipalities);
• Independent state institutions for protection of human rights (e.g. the Ombudsman’s Office and its unit for
protection of child rights and rights of persons with disabilities, the Commission for Prevention and Protection
from Discrimination);
• Civil society organizations relevant for persons and children with disabilities, including:
o Organisations of people with disabilities working on supporting persons and children with disabilities
and advocating their interests;
o Other CSOs working on policy analysis and advocacy related to improving public services, inclusive
education, access to healthcare, social and child protection, human and child rights, as well as
support to EU integration;
o Professional associations of relevant service providers (e.g. the Macedonian Medical Association,
Macedonian Association of Nurses and Midwifes, Association of Special Educators and
Rehabilitators, the Association of Social Workers);
o Academia providing education and training for relevant service providers (e.g., Faculty of Medicine,
Institute for Special Education and Rehabilitation);
• Development partners, including bilateral and multilateral donors, supporting the inclusion of persons and
children with disabilities;
• Caregivers of children with disabilities (including parents, grandparents, guardians and non-related primary
caregivers);
• Children and youth (both with and without disabilities).

The results of the evaluation will be first validated internally and with all partner governments and key stakeholders
through the Evaluation Reference Group. The evaluation report will be placed in the public domain – together with a
management response to follow up on recommendations.
VIII. Methodology and Technical Approach
The methodology will include the following elements and stages:
a) Desk Review of existing documentation, evaluation reports, all relevant UNICEF project and programme
documents, researches and studies; government strategies and policy documents, primary and secondary data
reports; initial validation of resources and final definition of the scope for the evaluation
b) Based on the desk review, the consultants will develop an Inception Report that includes:
✓ A reconstructed Theory of Change, based on the available information in the Think Piece accompanying
the preparation of the 2016-2020 Country Programme
✓ A summary of initial findings against the evaluation questions derived from the desk review
✓ Recommended methodological approach to this assignment, which takes into account the difference in
the sector, approaches and development/maturity of the programmes, including elements of both
formative and summative evaluation approaches
✓ Draft data collection instruments and the identification of any ethical considerations, if relevant
✓ Reduced and refined evaluation questions, responding to the specificities of the context and supported
by detailed evaluation matrix
✓ Propose any necessary revisions in the budget for the evaluation
✓ Propose a structure for the Final Evaluation Report
108 | P ag e
c) Country mission(s) – Depending on circumstances related to the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic77, the
evaluation team will meet with the evaluation reference group, gather additional evidence, conduct key
informant interviews, including with key stakeholders and partners, draft and present an initial analysis before
the end of the mission.
d) Report writing (final evaluation report). The evaluation team will develop an analytical report that summarizes
evidence gathered during the desk review and the data collection, drawing higher level conclusions, identifying
promising practices and important lessons learned. The draft evaluation report will be presented to UNICEF
country office as a first step in validating the findings and conclusions and refining the recommendations so that
they are both strategic and useful. Subsequently, the report will be presented to the evaluation reference group
for the same purposes.
The methodology must be agreed upon between UNICEF and the evaluators, with consultation of relevant
counterparts, prior to the start of the evaluation. The methodology should:
✓ Demonstrate impartiality and lack of biases by relying on different and solid information sources (e.g.,
stakeholder groups, including beneficiaries, etc.) and using a mixed methodology approaches (e.g.,
quantitative, qualitative, participatory) to ensure triangulation of information through a variety of means.
✓ Enable addressing the key evaluation questions taking into account the evaluability challenges, the budget
and the agreed timeframe.
✓ Use applicable international and corporate norms and standards for evaluation, including GEROS Quality
Assessment System.
✓ Ensure, through the use of mixed methods and appropriate sampling that women, girls, men and boys from
different stakeholders’ groups, including the most marginalised-participate and that their different voices are
heard and used.
✓ Consider applying evaluation approaches such as contribution analysis in support of evaluating policy
interventions.
In addition to the elements required in the Inception Report listed above, UNICEF will identify an initial list of the key
stakeholders to be met by the evaluation team; nevertheless, during the inception and fieldwork phase, team
members will be able to reach out to additional stakeholders and informants, within available resources and time.
To facilitate the evaluation process, UNICEF will assist with the organization of meetings with the relevant government
authorities, development partners, institutions, key stakeholders and beneficiaries. UNICEF will be responsible for
preparing and coordinating the full agenda of the evaluation in consultation with partners and stakeholders.
The following limitations to the evaluation are anticipated:
I. Lack of an initial overarching theory of change encompassing planned interventions under all programmatic
areas and their interplay in addressing inclusion of children with disabilities
II. Unavailability and poor quality of data related to children with disabilities, including a more accurate
estimation of the number of children with disabilities, that would allow for a better evaluation of outcome
and impact level results
77 This will depend on the development of the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic, including the status of travel restrictions.
109 | P ag e
III. Multisectorality of the programmes for children with disabilities requiring complex cross sectoral approaches.
To address some of these limitations, the evaluation will use information provided through the existing
documentation and evaluation reports and validate key determinants of inequity and trends at impact and outcome
level. Please refer to Annex A for a preliminary list of the documentation available, as well as a stakeholder list. At a
next stage the evaluation approach will be further narrowed down, examining all programme interventions and their
impact, including UNICEF’s specific role. The contracting organization/company will assess whether collecting
disaggregated data is feasible given the data limitations. The multisectorality risk will be addressed through ensuring
a multidisciplinary evaluation team able to comprehensively assess interventions across sectors.
IX. Expected Deliverables, Timeframe and Reporting requirements
The Team Leader will report to the UNICEF Child Rights Monitoring Specialist and be the main focal point within the
evaluation team for all communications. Once the documents are prepared and delivered, UNICEF shall hold the

After the opening, each proposal will be assessed first on its technical merits and subsequently on its price. The
proposal with the best overall value, composed of technical merit and price, will be recommended for approval.
UNICEF will set up an evaluation panel composed of technical and procurement staff and their conclusions will be
forwarded to the internal UNICEF Contracts Review Committee, or other relevant approving authority.
The evaluation panel will first evaluate each response for compliance with the requirements of the request for
proposal (RFP) procedure of UNICEF. Responses deemed not to meet all of the mandatory requirements will be
considered non-compliant and rejected at this stage without further consideration. Failure to comply with any
of the terms and conditions contained in this RFP, including provision of all required information, may result in a
response or proposal being disqualified from further consideration.
The overall weighting between technical and price evaluation will be as follows: The technical component will
account for 70% of the total points allocated and the financial component will account for 30% of the total points
allocated.
The assessed technical score must be equal to or exceed 42 (that is, sixty percent) of the total 70 points allocated
to the technical evaluation in order to be considered technically compliant and for consideration in the financial
evaluation.
The proposals will be evaluated against the following technical criteria:

Management of the Evaluation
The evaluation will be managed by the UNICEF Child Rights Monitoring Specialist (CRM), who will be responsible for
the day-to-day oversight and management of the evaluation and for the management of the evaluation budget. The
evaluation manager will ensure the quality and independence of the evaluation and guarantee its alignment with
UNEG Norms and Standards and Ethical Guidelines and other relevant procedures, provide quality assurance on the
relevance of the evaluation findings and conclusions, and the implement ability of recommendations, and contribute
to the dissemination of the evaluation findings and follow-up on the management response. The evaluation manager
will work in collaboration with programme sections of UNICEF North Macedonia, as well as the UNICEF regional
evaluation team. Additional quality assurance will be provided by the external quality assurance facility set up by the
ECA Regional Office. The Final Evaluation report will be approved by the UNICEF Country Office Representative.
An Evaluation Reference Group will be established to guide and oversee the implementation of the evaluation,
providing expert advice as needed. The RG will include representatives from the UNICEF Office, as well as external
experts and representatives of organisation of people with disabilities. The ERG is expected to provide feedback
during the evaluation process and on the deliverables; comment on the evaluation approach and methods and
facilitate access to data and information.
UNICEF CRM specialist will be the key focal point for the Evaluation Institution/Team.
The Evaluation Section in the Regional Office will provide support to the evaluation team throughout the process.
Representatives of partners involved in the planning and delivery of programmes in support of integration of children
with disabilities will be involved in designing the evaluation and will participate in elaboration of recommendations
through active contribution during debriefing meetings and by providing feedback to the draft Inception and Final
Reports.
