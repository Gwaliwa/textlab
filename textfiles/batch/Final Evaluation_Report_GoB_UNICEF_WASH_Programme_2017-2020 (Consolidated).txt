Executive summary
Objective of the assignment: The objective of this assignment was to conduct an end-term evaluation of the
GoB-UNICEF Bangladesh Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Programme of Cooperation (2017-2020)1, which
forms a core component of the UNICEF’s Country Programme 2017-2021. In terms of the geographical scope,
the evaluation covers 15 districts spread across six divisions of Bangladesh.2
Approach and methodology for evaluation: The evaluation methodology is guided by the Terms of
Reference (ToR) of the assignment and the evaluation questions given therein. Specifically, the overarching
evaluation framework follows the OECD DAC criteria, namely relevance, effectiveness, impact, efficiency, and
sustainability.
A mixed method approach that combines content analysis of programme documents and secondary literature
with quantitative and qualitative insights from primary data, has been adopted for the study. Further, keeping in
mind the multiplicity of interventions and actors in the WASH sector of Bangladesh and lack of availability of
unit level data on programme participants (and a possible counterfactual), the evaluation has been done from
contribution analysis perspective rather than focusing on strict causal attribution.3 Finally, the evaluation adopts
a gender-responsive approach.
Key findings and conclusions: The key findings and related conclusions have been arranged as per the
OECD-DAC criteria below.
Relevance: Under this evaluation criterion, we have assessed if the designs and strategies presented in the
current country programme document4 (CPD) are responsive to the needs and priorities of the country and the
government.5
Bangladesh’s WASH sector faces different problems in different regions, ranging from vulnerability to extreme
weather events and their knock-on effects, to arsenic poisoning, challenges of provision of safely managed
water and sanitation to low-income communities in urban centers like Dhaka, to name a few. UNICEF’s WASH
strategy in the country is well aligned to the varied needs of the country, as it is informed by a detailed and
participatory bottleneck analysis.6
Provision of safe and resilient WASH services in the face of the challenges posed by climate change is a cross-
cutting issue in Bangladesh. UNICEF has sought to address this challenge by working with the Government to
pilot innovative solutions like double platform deep tubewells with managed aquifer recharge (MAR).
As Bangladesh is gradually transitioning to a lower middle-income country, public investment in the sector is
going to increasingly account for much of the direct demand for WASH services in the country. Therefore, in
order to remain relevant and responsive to newer opportunities, UNICEF is striving to move to upstream
activities like advocacy, multisectoral discussions with Government and other development partners, evidence
generation as well as fostering the development of the WASH market in the country.
UNICEF continues to be responsive to the emerging challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing
technical support to the government in planning, capacity building, implementation of COVID-19 emergency
responses and dissemination of protocols on good hygiene practices.
Effectiveness: Under this evaluation criterion, we have checked whether the WASH programme has been able
to achieve the intended objectives and targets as presented in the current country programme document
(CPD).
1 For ease of reference, this Programme “GoB-UNICEF Bangladesh Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Programme of Cooperation (2017-2020)” has been referred
as the WASH Programme throughout this document.
2 Programme districts considered for the evaluation: Faridpur, Pirojpur, Bandarban, Khagrachari, Comilla, Jamalpur, Netrokona, Khulna, Narial, Satkhira,
Nilphamari, Rangpur, Habiganj, Sunamganj and Sylhet
3 MICS provides information between 2012 and 2019, while the period of evaluation is 2017-2020. Primary survey data at unit level on programme participants
in targeted/prioritized districts and is not available.
4 While the CPD was extended to 2021, this evaluation remained through 2020, so it does not cover the full work under the 2017-2021 CPD.
5 For ease of reference, this document “Country Programme Document and Strategy Notes; UNICEF Bangladesh Country Programme for 2017-2020; June
2016” has been referred as Country Programme document (CPD) throughout this document.
6 WASHBAT Report Bangladesh-2018 (This report is the outcome of a number of WASHBAT Divisional Workshops (total eight) steered by LGD of the Ministry
of Local Government Rural Development and Cooperatives (MLRDC) and organized by the respective Divisional Commissioners Office, with assistance from
UNICEF Bangladesh during 2018.)
Overall, the programme has been effective in creating an enabling environment for provision of safely managed
WASH facilities in communities and institutions.
Analysis from inter-temporal comparison of MICS unit level data shows that access to WASH services have
improved overall in the priority districts. Data also shows that access inequity (across different wealth quantiles)
has reduced. Note that this reduction is the net result of multiple programmes aimed to improve water and
sanitation access and service delivery in the targeted districts of which UNICEF’s interventions constitute a
part. This evaluation, however, shows that UNICEF’s programmes have made positive contribution and can be
thought to be effective in improving access to WASH services.
Gender equity and social inclusion considerations have been effectively incorporated in the programming
through gender responsive planning (design of programmes), monitoring, and reporting. Respondents from the
surveyed communities report that the GoB-UNICEF WASH programme has contributed to reduction of
instances of adolescent girls’ school dropout, implementation of inclusive toilets in the low income communities
and time spent by women to collect water. The programme also fostered innovations for need based WASH
services for the elderly and people with disabilities, residents of areas with hard-to-reach areas, etc. Some of
such solutions include the adoption of less water consuming technologies like SATO taps and SATO pans in
the water scarce areas, and provision of handholding support in developing sanitation infrastructure at the
community and institutional levels, for the elderly and people with disabilities.
UNICEF has played a critical role in policy advocacy and coordination. As the WASH cluster lead, in the
emergency response to the Rohingya crisis and COVID-19, UNICEF facilitated coordination among different
line departments. In the Rohingya camps, UNICEF played a key role in the provision of safely managed water,
sanitation, and hygiene facilities for all. UNICEF ensured protection of human rights of the refugees by
addressing fundamental issues relating to health, nutrition, education, etc. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
UNICEF developed guidelines and sector wide strategy documents for making people aware about the safety
protocols. Additionally, UNICEF assisted the government in developing a national strategy for the provision of
safe water in communities and institutions.
The WASHBAT analysis, which identified barriers in WASH sector for all eight divisions of Bangladesh by
involving around 800 professionals from WASH, education, health, nutrition sectors, is yet another example of
the crucial thought leadership role played by the UNICEF.
The evaluation has brought to light a few shortfalls from targets set in the CPD. While the recognition and
resolution of these shortfalls are a collective responsibility of various programmes, stakeholders, and donor
agencies working in the WASH sector, the evaluators note them to pave the path towards the way forward. A
few areas where some improvement could be made are as follows: (1) While there has been a rise in access to
safe water and sanitation services, the targets set in the CPD with respect to SDG 6.1 and SDG 6.2 at the
community level appear ambitious retrospectively. (2) The ‘WASH in schools’ programme could not achieve the
set targets with respect to equipping primary and secondary schools with basic WASH facilities. (3) The CPD
target of equipping healthcare facilities (HCFs) with basic WASH facilities, has not been achieved.
Efficiency: The evaluators have mapped the use of resources (time and budget) vis-à-vis the achievement of
target output and outcome indicators in the programme districts in this section.
The programme was able to achieve the utilization as well as physical progress milestones in access to safely
managed sanitation facilities. However, resource mobilization is a key challenge in equipping primary schools
and HCFs with basic WASH facilities according to the national standard. Also, UNICEF has got strategic shift
and not supporting any hardware in the institutions (Schools/HCFs) and focussed only on policy level issues.
This was reflected in the target to achievement ratios in case of HCFs and schools.
We find that there is scope for improvement in efficiency in terms of performance ratio.7,8 In terms of areas of
improvement, creating and maintaining a database for outcomes along with data on funds utilization would help
in tracking progress.
Another efficiency component in WASH could be accelerating engagement with local manufacturers in
production of low-cost (economic) sanitation equipment. For example, UNICEF has been promoting sanitation
markets at local level in collaboration with an implementing NGO. Local latrine producers are provided access
to funds through micro-entrepreneurs, micro-finance institutions and NGOs. Another example is the provision of
legal water points for urban slum dwellers in collaboration with Dhaka WASA and UNICEF. Further, UNICEF’s
7 Performance ratio = achieved/target; budget consumption = expenditure/allocated
8 As per the value for money analysis, the performance ratio was low in 2020 for providing basic sanitation facilities in: (i) primary schools (6%), (ii) HCFs (4%),
secondary schools (44%)
collaboration with KTH (Swedish Royal Institute of Technology) for developing capacity of local drillers on
arsenic safe drilling is another important example of successful local capacity building.
Impact: Under this evaluation criterion, the evaluators have assessed contribution of the WASH Programme
towards achievement of programme objectives. Using the MICS data of two years (2012 and 2019), the
evaluators have conducted a difference-in-difference (DID) analysis comparing the priority and non-priority
districts across two time periods. The analysis shows improvement of access to WASH facilities and reduction
in WASH gaps in targeted programme areas. The programme contributed to successfully ensuring an
increased use of safely managed WASH facilities through service delivery, awareness programmes, hygiene
promotion programmes, trainings, adoption of the three-star approach in schools, community engagements
through social media, tax exemption of MHM products, etc. Along with other actors in the WASH sector,
UNICEF’s interventions have positively contributed to ‘improved and equitable access to safe drinking water
and sanitation’.
Evaluators also find corroboration on UNICEF’s positive contribution from the responses of respondents from
communities in targeted areas. Respondents report that the programme has contributed to increasing the
proportion of schools and HCFs providing gender segregated sanitation facilities. Additionally, the respondents
report that there has been an increase in awareness about MHM among communities, and reduction in dropout
of adolescent schoolgirls during the last four years. Additionally, UNICEF has played a crucial role as a
coordinator and policy advocate, through the WASH in Schools programme. Through the three-star approach,
schools were encouraged to ensure handwashing with soap, access to safe drinking water, and access to
clean, gender-segregated and child-friendly toilets at school. At the community level the respondents report that
there has been a substantial increase in the awareness of safe water practices and more equitable access to
safe drinking water.
UNICEF has also contributed to improvement of access to safe water in urban areas. Korail LIC model is one
such example, which addressed the issue of lack of access to legal water connections and safe sanitation in
the urban slums and LICs. The Korail model, may be upscaled to all urban slums and LICs, which cannot
access legal and safely managed WASH facilities.
Sustainability: Under this evaluation criterion, evaluators have assessed whether the interventions under the
WASH programme will continue and the positive contributions will last after the exit of the programme. In this
section, the following components of the programme have been assessed: M&E system, market-based
approaches, community participation, capacity building, and behavior change.
The programme has assisted the government in implementing monitoring systems to some extent for WASH
interventions. However, this can be further bolstered by integrating a robust M&E system at sub-national level.
There is a need to scale-up market-based approaches and promote participation of private sector through
policy advocacy for long-term sustainability. Local entrepreneurs and communities can be encouraged to
participate in sanitation markets and businesses to develop WASH market as a long-term strategy aimed at
sustainability of the sanitation interventions.
Sustainable WASH interventions require emphasis on behavior change. Evaluators find that UNICEF has
focused on several awareness campaigns in the priority districts. As reported by the respondents in
communities surveyed, this has contributed to improved social norms on the use of safe water and safe
sanitation and hygiene practices. UNICEF has also supported the government entities particularly DPHE and
LGD in capacity building and programme implementation at the local level. This has positively contributed to
sustainability of the positive practices at the institutional level.
Cross-cutting themes: Relevant cross-cutting issues such as gender9, climate change, urbanization and
population youth trends have been targeted by the WASH programme.
UNICEF has been making constant efforts to make their WASH programme gender-responsive and socially
inclusive. This is reflected in the programme commitment to reduce existing gender-based inequality and
provide effective, efficient, and sustainable WASH services to all.
Increased demand for the WASH facilities in the urban areas is one of the key challenges for Bangladesh’s
WASH sector. Issues in urban areas like lack of fecal sludge management (FSM) need to be addressed
through engaging with the government (specifically, the ULBs).
9 For Gender considerations, we have included only key findings in this report. A stand-alone Gender Analysis report has been provided as deliverable of this
evaluation assignment.
There is further scope to build climate-resilient service delivery models to make WASH facilities more
sustainable.
Lessons learned: The following lessons were learned from evaluation of the GoB-WASH Programme 2017-
2020. These are more widely applicable for capacity enhancement process in the WASH sector:
• Clear understanding and coordination between all stakeholders of the programme regarding their roles and
responsibilities as the programming has ensured efficient implementation and timely completion of
outcomes. The programme involved active participation of the communities, youth, religious leaders,
schoolteachers, and women in policy framework and implementation.
• Encouraging and upscaling market-based approach has improved access to raw materials for WASH
infrastructure through promoting local micro-entrepreneurs.
• Engagement in PPP arrangements has helped in providing sustainable access to water supply and
sewerage services in the low-income urban areas.
Recommendations: The evaluators provide the following recommendations and sub-recommendations after
consultation, joint validation and refinement sessions with UNICEF WASH team and key stakeholders from the
GoB.
1. Development of a robust M&E system for tracking coverage of WASH infrastructure in terms of
availability, functionality, and quality. (Stakeholder: UNICEF, DPHE, Municipalities and BBS; Priority:
High)
a. Create a more robust M&E system so that evidence generation on WASH service coverage within the
prioritized/targeted districts for the period of programme implementation is available. Specifically, the
data collection may be strengthened at levels of (i) urban slums and union level, and (ii) WASH in
Institutions (Schools and HCFs)
b. Conduct evidence generation for monitoring the progress and evaluating UNICEF interventions in
WASH sector within each country programme cycle.
c. Capacity building to administer and oversee the M&E system at the national and sub-national level.
d. Create an M&E system that is GESI (gender equity and social inclusion) aware and envision the design
and creation of indictors that can be disaggregated by gender as also other vulnerable or marginalized
communities in the targeted areas.
2. Scale-up market-based approaches10 and promote participation of private sector through policy
advocacy for long-term sustainability. (Stakeholder: UNICEF, other implementing agencies, private
sector; Priority: High)
a. Advocate for a low interest sanitation financing policy for households and entrepreneurs through MFIs.
b. Encourage increased participation of local entrepreneurs and communities to develop the WASH
market as a long-term strategy aimed at sustainability of the WASH programme.
c. Promote affordable and climate resilient sanitation products in disaster prone areas by training
entrepreneurs and encouraging them to scale up the production as per the demand.
3. Develop and promote low cost, climate resilient and suitable11 WASH technologies to improve
accessibility of WASH services to the poor12, residents of urban slums and hard to reach (HtR)
areas. (Stakeholder: DPHE, PSB, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, UNICEF, and
other implementing agencies; Priority: High)
a. Promote designing, production, and availability of low-cost WASH technologies such as reusable MHM
pads, low-cost improved latrines, mid-range offset toilets with durable superstructure, affordable septic
tanks, etc. Technologies developed by the private sector such as SATO taps and pans could be
effective solutions for water scarce areas.
b. Provide legal water connections and fecal-sludge management in the urban slums.
4. Policy advocacy for factoring in the costs associated with climate change issues into the WASH
budget. (Stakeholder: UNICEF; Priority: Medium)
a. Include the cost for climate change issues such as contamination of ground water and breakage of
WASH infrastructure during natural disasters13, depletion of ground water during droughts, etc. into the
WASH budget
10 Sanitation Marketing Systems (SanMarkS) approach was adopted initially in six districts, namely, Rangpur, Bogra, Rajshahi, Barisal, Khulna and Sunamganj
districts as per the approved project under the Development Project Proforma (DPP) between UNICEF and the Local Government Division (LGD) of
Bangladesh Government in November 2015.
11 Examples of affordable sanitation technologies include plastic SATO pans (USD 1.5), gooseneck plastic pans (USD 0.12-USD 1.06); Source: Sanitation

Statistics (BBS).
13 Natural disasters such as Floods, cyclones, storms etc.
5. Increasing women entrepreneurship in sanitation markets and their participation in decision
making positions. (Stakeholder: UNICEF and other implementing agencies; Priority: Medium)
a. Adopt a pro-active and gender-sensitive approach to employ more female staff at the decision-making
positions in the WASH programme at the community level.
b. Provide training to women entrepreneurs to (i) strengthen the WASH market supply chain and (ii) make
women key value chain actors in the sanitation market.
6. Maintain WASH budget heads at a disaggregated level to better monitor and evaluate the expenses
for all WASH outputs and outcomes. (Stakeholder: MoLGRDC, GoB, UNICEF; Priority: Medium)
a. Conduct annual budget tracking study and national and sub-national accounting for WASH sector
specifically.
b. Informed decisions on funding requirements and utilization for ensuring quality and sustainability of the
WASH sector may be taken by the Government as well as UNICEF, by tracking expenditures in the
WASH sector of all stakeholders14. This will help in better monitoring of efficient and effective public
spending in the WASH sector.

1. Introduction
The GoB-UNICEF Bangladesh Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Programme of Cooperation (2017-2020) directly
contributes to the UNICEF Bangladesh Country Programme 2017-2020. The programme is in alignment with
seventh five-year plan of Bangladesh and United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for
Bangladesh 2017-2020. UNICEF appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers Pvt. Ltd to conduct an evaluation of the
programme to identify what worked well, where, why and under which circumstances. The findings of the
evaluation may help in designing the appropriate strategies for the next country programme (2022 -2026).
1.1. Background of current GoB-UNICEF CPD programme (2017-
2020)
1.1.1. Overview
The Country Programme Document (CPD) for 2017-2020 is the outcome of the collaboration of UNICEF and
the GoB in a consultative interaction. As per UNICEF’s Strategic Plan 2014-2017, the aim of the Country
Programme is to back Bangladesh’s efforts in advancing the universal realization of the rights of children
especially those belonging to the disadvantaged and excluded groups. By adopting the lifecycle approach, the
programme focuses on the welfare of individuals of all age groups living in vulnerable communities like poverty-
stricken and hard-to-reach areas prone to climate change and natural disasters, urban slums, living with
disabilities, or infected, affected or at the risk of HIV/AIDS, as well as children from ethnic and religious
minorities.
The advancement of the programme has been aligned with the seventh five-year plan, sectoral plans, the in-
country process to define Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators, the United Nations Development
Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 2017-2020, concluding observations of the Committee on the Rights of the
Child (CRC), as well as the lessons from the mid-term review of the previous Country Programme. As per the
UN-wide concurrence with the GoB, the complete range of this Country Programme has been set down to four
years to additionally align UN planning cycles with the timespan of national development plans.
The WASH programme includes the contribution of various stakeholders including national and international
NGOs. GoB joined the sanitation and water for all (SWA) in 2010. Few of the commitments made by GoB for
the WASH sector development include (i) ensuring that at least 2 million more people in arsenic contaminated
areas gain access to safe, arsenic free water, (ii) increasing access to safely managed sanitation by 5%,
bringing basic sanitation to 75% of the population,(iii) increasing at least 5% of the national WASH budget
allocated to promote hygiene for all, including handwashing and menstrual hygiene management and (iv)
increase government's yearly budget by USD 250 million for the WASH sector, reducing the budget gap by
50% in each fiscal year.15
The Country Programme Outcomes have been drafted as per the UNICEF’s lifecycle approach: (a) infants,
young children, and their mothers; (b) children of primary school age; and (c) adolescents, with the objective of
addressing multidimensional deprivations affecting children. These Programme Outcomes are supported by a
component (d) on social inclusion and increasing awareness of children’s rights. Table 1 provides an overview
of the outcomes and output for the WASH sector strategy as outlined in CPD (2017-20).

1.1.2. Programme features
The WASH Programme use an intersectoral and lifecycle approach, which recognizes that while WASH inputs
contribute directly to the realization of the human rights to water and sanitation for all, through all stages of life,
there are key points in a child's/adolescent's life when these inputs contribute to particular outcomes in other
sectors. The programme will focus its intervention on the most deprived populations in hard-to-reach and
arsenic-prone areas, bearing in mind the existing commitment in the Government-UN10EF WASH
Development Project Proposal (2015 -2018) to intervene in specific areas.
Figure 1 provides the key programme features.
Figure 1: Programme features
1.1.3. Salient features of the WASH intervention
The intersectoral and life-cycle approach is based on the design that interventions in WASH directly contributes
to the realization of human rights in all stages of life i.e., intervention in one sector contributes to three

1.1.4. Demographic patterns and WASH access in prioritized districts
The WASH programme has targeted and prioritized 15 districts located across 6 divisions of Bangladesh. The
parameters16 for selection include i) child deprivation index, ii) poverty, iii) food security, iv) open defecation, v)
arsenic contamination in drinking water, and iv) hard to reach areas. The changing demographic patterns of
Bangladesh pose a challenge to its WASH sector. Table 24 provides a detailed summary of the demographic
changes in Bangladesh using the population census (2001 and 2011)
Figure 2: 15 priority districts of the
and MICS 2012 and 2019 data. The key demographic patterns and
programme
their impacts on the WASH sector are briefly summarized below.
Urbanization
According to the population census, there has been an increase in
the urban to rural ratio of population in 12 out of 15 programme
districts between 2001 and 2011. Addressing the increased
demand for the WASH facilities in the urban areas has been a
challenge for Bangladesh’s WASH sector. Lack of tenure rights act
as a barrier to access WASH facilities in the low-income
communities (LICs). Dhaka WASA’s successful intervention in the
Korail LIC can be regarded as a replicable model that can be
upscaled to other slums and LICs (more details in impact chapter).
Lack of legal water connections in the urban slums, sanitation
facilities and fecal sludge management are few WASH related
issues that are aggravated due to the increased urban population.

dropouts. UNICEF also advocated the inclusion of menstrual hygiene management in school curriculum, to
raise awareness about menstruation among young boys and girls. However, despite the efforts, the access to
WASH facilities in schools and HCFs remain a challenge in Bangladesh.
Decrease in poverty rates
Bangladesh has experienced a drastic poverty reduction between the 2010 and 2016 from 31.5% to 24.3%17.
Figure 5 shows the division level distribution of the headcount ratios.
Figure 5: Poverty rate by division18
Increase in access to WASH facilities
By 2019, access to improved sources of water has been provided to more than 90% household members in 12
out of 15 programme districts and to more than 98% household members in 9 districts. However, safely
managed water sources19 are accessible to few. Table 25 shows that the Rangpur district has provided access
to safely managed drinking water sources to 77.9% household members. Bandarban and Pirojpur are laggard
districts with only 16.1% and 19.1% household members having access to safely managed water sources
respectively.
In terms of sanitation, Bangladesh has successfully reduced the practice of open defecation. MICS, 2019
suggests that in 10 out of 15 programme districts, less than 1% household members practice open defecation.
81.3% of the household members in the programme districts had access to improved sanitation facilities.
Among all districts, Narial stood out with 99.4% household members using improved sanitation facilities.
However, these facilities were largely shared. 65.2% of the household members in the programme district had
access to improved sanitation facilities that were not shared (also known as basic sanitation facilities).
However, the major lacuna of the Bangladesh WASH sector is the lack of treatment of fecal waste. Fecal
sludge management is completely absent in the rural areas. In the urban areas, the FSM facilities are primarily
concentrated in the Dhaka division. The lack of fecal sludge treatment continues to pose health hazards on the
residents of Bangladesh.
Finally, there has been an increase in the access to hygiene facilities (handwashing devices with water and
soap available). In 2019, 73.8% of the household members of the programme districts had access to the
hygiene facilities. Table 25 suggests that between 2012 and 2019, that access to hygiene has increased to the
largest extent compared to other two WASH indicators. Among all divisions, Rangpur has achieved the highest
access with 95.6% of the household members having access to a handwashing device with water and soap
available.
1.2. WASH issues in Bangladesh
Figure 6 presents the disparities among rural and urban population in accessing improved WASH services in
Bangladesh20. The disparities between rural and urban population in access to improved water sources and
improved sanitation is highest in Sylhet division, whereas for improved hygiene the disparities are highest in
Barisal division.

Access to safe water and sanitation remains a challenge, especially in remote or hard to reach areas such as
hill tracts, Chars (riverine islands), Beels and Haors (swamps); and for excluded or marginalized groups such
as urban slum and pavement dwellers. Safe drinking water is a key issue particularly in coastal regions due to
the frequency of disasters, climate change-related salinity intrusion and human-induced phenomenon. Figure 7

The government policies for improvement in water and sanitation started with Bangladesh Water Development
Board in 1971. The board is responsible for ground and surface water management in Bangladesh. In Table 3,
the evaluators have provided a brief overview of WASH policies in Bangladesh.

Water Supply and Sanitation groundwork for adoption of the National Policy for Safe Water Supply
and Sanitation (NPSWS) in 1998. The broad objective of NPSWS was
to facilitate universal access to a basic level of water supply and
sanitation services and to bring about behavioral changes towards
use of water and sanitation facilities.

2. Evaluation description
This chapter briefly discusses the purpose, overall objectives, and scope of the evaluation.
2.1. Purpose of the evaluation
Given the strategic importance of the UNICEF Bangladesh's CP towards achievement of SDGs, upstream
activities like policy advocacy and evidence generation, it is an appropriate time to for the programme to be
evaluated to understand UNICEF's strategic position in the WASH sector and towards design of the upcoming
country programme document (CDP) for 2022-2026.
2.2. Objective of the assignment
The overall objective of this evaluation was to conduct a programmatic evaluation of GoB-UNICEF WASH
interventions. The specific objectives of the evaluation as drawn out from the ToR are as follows:
✓ To assess the relevance of the WASH programme strategy in the context of the priorities of
Bangladesh and global priorities (SDG 6.1 and 6.2) and make recommendations
✓ To assess the effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, impacts and gender responsiveness of the
UNICEF WASH programme and value for money of the results during the country programme period
✓ To generate evidence on how gender has been integrated in the WASH programme
✓ To identify the WASH programme’s strength, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities to move into
emerging areas such as climate change within the programme intervention framework of evidence
generation, policy dialogue and advocacy, equity-responsive and resilient service delivery, partnership,
and participation.
✓ To assess the programme and identify opportunities for the WASH programme regarding the
environmental sustainability, climate change, and natural hazards, and emerging areas.
✓ To generate recommendations that inform the drafting of the next WASH strategy note in the next CPD
(2022-2026)
2.3. Scope of the assignment
As envisioned in the ToR, the evaluation took a comprehensive approach, combining inferences from
quantitative as well as qualitative data. Figure 9 summarizes the detailed scope of the assignment. Scope of
the assignment includes all activities implemented under the WASH Programme section (Dhaka and FOs -
national and sub-national, including under implementing partners) listed in the CPD, between 2017 and 2020.
Further, the evaluators look at the immediate effect of COVID-19 on WASH sector in Bangladesh.
Figure 9: Scope of the assignment
Primary and secondary users of the evaluation
The primary users of the evaluations include the UNICEF global, regional, and country offices, while the
secondary users include the government institutions and donor agencies, signatories to UNICEF’s rolling
workplan, and the agencies that UNICEF collaborates with in the programme.

3. Methodology for evaluation
This chapter provides a detailed overview of the approach and methodology adopted in this evaluation. The
chapter begins with a snapshot of the overall methodology, followed by the data collection and sampling
methodology. Detailed evaluability assessment is provided in Table 18, which establishes the rationale and
feasibility of the approach in answering the key evaluation questions. Final section provides a detailed
methodology for data analysis –both quantitative as well as qualitative.
3.1. Overall approach
The evaluation uses a mixed methods approach with a combination of primary and secondary data as suited to
answer the key evaluation questions. In addition, the evaluation adopts a gender-responsive human centric
approach in order to ensure that WASH interventions recognize the gender roles and responsibilities, which
translates into different gendered needs and priorities. Figure 10 depicts the overall approach and different data
analysis methods that have been used in this evaluation.
Figure 10: Methods for data analysis
The detailed evaluability matrix, mapping the evaluation questions and sub-questions with source of data and
analysis method are provided in the annexure (Evaluation matrix).
Adoption of the Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA) in evaluation
The evaluators assessed the WASH programme form a human rights-based approach including realization of the rights
of children and women, as laid down in the CRC and the CEDAW.
The evaluation specifically looked in the following:
• Whether the programme facilitated the awareness of the communities (right-holders) about their right to access to
safe water and sanitation facilities?
• Whether the establishment of duty bearers and a framework for robust coordination facilitated the smooth
functioning of the programme?
• Whether the programme design incorporates monitoring systems to monitor the progress achievement of the duty
bearers?
3.2. Methodology for addressing key evaluation questions

(MIC)? (staffing considerations, resource mobilization and partnerships). In addition, what are the
recommendations for programme components review, upscaling, downsizing and elimination?
3. How well is the programme preparing for climate change impacts, continuing environmental degradation,
urbanization, and population (youth) trends?
4. Where within the WASH Sector has the UNICEF WASH Programme been established as a critical actor that
must remain present? Where has UNICEF not achieved critical status and needs to either become better or
to consider engagement in favor of a better equipped stakeholder?
Approach
Through desk review, the evaluators assess whether the WASH gaps identified in SITAN and WASH bottleneck
analysis are reflected in the ToC, strategies, and interventions. Based on this assessment and through content
analysis of qualitative data, the evaluators give recommendation on how ToC should be improved for next country
programme. Desk review of SITAN, WASH bottleneck analysis, CPD and strategy notes (2017-2020) will be
undertaken.
2. Assess the effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, impact and gender responsiveness of the UNICEF
WASH Programme and value for money of the results during the country programme period
Evaluation questions
1. How effective has the programme been in achieving its expected results facilitating the following: i)
improvement of quality, equitable access, and sustainability of drinking water services in communities and
institutions ii) improvement of quality, equitable access and sustainability of sanitation and hygiene services?
2. How effective was the programme in identifying successful interventions for innovation and scaling up and
identifying the right systems for scaling up through the appropriate equitable partnerships and systems e.g.,
public, private-public, and tri-sector partnerships?
3. How successful has the programme been to date in contributing to the achievement of the multi-level
programme results of the Country Programme Document?
4. To what extent are these (early) gains directly attributable to the programme's interventions?
5. How successfully has UNICEF coordinated with other key to ensure non-duplication of efforts, maximization
of its competitive advantage a clear delineation of roles and responsibilities within joint programmes, and the
overall success of the programme's implementation?
6. To what extent have the costs been kept to an optimal level considering the budget available, the results to
be achieved and the context? If the costs have not been kept to an optimal level, why?
7. Have the results been achieved within the expected timelines?
8. Has the Bangladesh Country Office and Zonal office human resources and skills been put to best use and
what are the recommendations for greater impact and increased competitive advantage of the organization
and the GoB-UNICEF WASH programme?
9. What is the value for money of the Bangladesh WASH programme results in terms of efficiency,
effectiveness, economy, and unintended outcomes taking into consideration the various delivery modes of
the programme?
10. How successful has the programme been in equipping the government and strengthening government
systems to scale-up and sustain the successfully proven interventions once UNICEF support comes to an
end?
11. How successful has the programme been in creating an enabling environment for sustaining results and
influencing institutional awareness about gender at all levels? (Consider factors such as local ownership,
demand for services, positive social norms etc.)
Our approach
For this objective, the evaluators check whether programme results in terms of providing quality and sustainable
drinking water sources and sanitation facilities equitably have been achieved in an equitable, cost effective and

efficient manner. Equity is assessed in terms of four parameters: Geographical regions, wealth quintiles, gender, and
hydro-geological context. The evaluation team has prepared the study tools in such a manner that all criteria of
evaluation are covered through the same. Mixed methods of evaluation are used including contribution and content
analysis with contribution analysis for specific WASH parameters. All findings in this regard are triangulated with the
qualitative information collected through KIIs, community survey and online survey.
3. Generate evidence on how gender has been integrated into the WASH programme
Evaluation questions
1. How well are gender related issues, barriers, and opportunities analyzed and addressed within the theory of
change (ToC) and the programming strategies of the WASH programme?
2. How effective has the programme been in achieving its gendered results?
3. How the programme has addressed gender inequalities related to access, use, awareness of, decision-
making and control of WASH services in Bangladesh?
4. How the programme has facilitated the use of a gender responsive, participatory approach and advocated
and facilitated informed participation of women in decision making at all levels of institutions?
5. Whether programme had designed interventions to target women and girls for awareness raising and
capacity building at community, sub-national and national levels at different stages of programme
development?
6. Whether programme had incorporated gender responsive indicators into the monitoring framework?
Approach
The evaluators carry out gender analysis of the programme using desk review, content analysis and contribution
analysis using the information gathered from KIIs and community surveys as well as from available secondary
sources. The evaluators also check whether women and girls have been consulted and involved in strategy design
and monitoring of the WASH programmes at all levels.
4. Identify the WASH programme strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities to move into emerging
areas such as climate change. The SWOT analysis should occur within the programme intervention framework of:
a. SWOT analysis of Evidence Generation, Policy Dialogue and Advocacy
b. SWOT analysis of Equity-Responsive and Resilient Service Delivery
c. SWOT analysis of Partnerships and Participation
Evaluation questions
The evaluation question that needs to be answered to achieve this objective is as follows:
1. How well is the programme preparing for i) climate change impacts and continuing environmental
degradation; ii) urbanization; and iii) population (youth) trends? For each of these, focus on:
a) Evidence Generation, Policy Dialogue and Advocacy;
b) Equity-Responsive and Resilient Service Delivery;
c) Partnerships and Participation
Approach
The evaluators identify the areas where the programme has worked well and where the strategies need to be
changed. The target values of all WASH indicators at the household level given in the term of reference for the year
2019-20 are assessed based on MICS-2019 data. For WASH in schools and HCFs other sources like the JMP report
(published in 2019) are used. Further, the findings are mapped with the geographical location and spread. In the end,
the areas of opportunities, prospective partnerships, service delivery at all levels and the cross-cutting themes with
respect to different activities undertaken through WASH intervention are augmented with the information from primary
data collected through KIIs and community surveys at regional and national level.
5. Assess performance and identify opportunities for the WASH Programme regarding environmental
sustainability, climate change, natural hazards and other emerging areas
Our approach
This step of performance assessment has been covered in the previous objective. It is also covered through value of
money exercise to get findings in terms of effectiveness, cost-efficiency, and sustainability of the results. It is
assessed through documentary evidence and analysis of the primary data if WASH infrastructures are resilient
against the impacts of frequent natural hazards like flood, cyclone, earthquake, etc.

6. Generate recommendations that inform the drafting of the next WASH strategy note in the next Country
Programme 2020-2024
Approach
This is a cross-cutting objective, which will be contingent on the evaluation of the parameters set under objective 1 to
objective 5. Under this objective, the evaluators suggest changes in ToC based on key findings and also in terms of
the implementation of strategies and interventions of the next country programme in WASH area based on the
information gathered from the above-mentioned approaches towards previous five objectives.
3.3. Data collection and sampling
In this evaluation, both quantitative as well as qualitative data have been used. The evaluators have depicted
the approach for primary data collection in Figure 11.
Figure 11: Overall approach for data collection
IRB application process and ethical consideration
As the data collection process involved interviewing human subjects on topics like gender and WASH, it required an
Institutional Review Board (IRB) review. The purpose of the IRB review was to assure that appropriate steps were
included in the methodology to maintain the ethical norms acceptable to humans participating in the evaluation.
Institute of Health Economics (IHE), Dhaka University, reviewed the research proposal, methodology and study tools.
Given below the key activities undertaken to obtain the IRB approval.
• Research proposal along with other required documents including survey tools were shared with IHE, Dhaka
University, for IRB approval on 31 March 2021.
• The review board shared their comments and suggestions on the research methodology on 16 April 2021.
• The revised IRB application form was re-submitted for approval on 23 April 2021.
• IRB approval was obtained on 26 April 2021 (IRB approval letter).
3.3.1. Key informant interviews (KIIs)
The qualitative data was collected through interviews with key informants. The evaluators have described the
sampling of the respondents below.
Purposive sampling of key informants stratified by administrative level (national, divisional and district) as well as

2 The stratification schema as well as sample size allocated is given in the table below (Table 2)
January 2022
PwC 25
As per the information provided by UNICEF, there are a total of 15 districts where the WASH programme is
being implemented across the 6 divisions of Bangladesh. In order to ensure adequate representation and
coverage of views of the key stakeholders, the evaluators covered UNICEF, GoB and other partner institutions
as follows (Table 5).

The evaluators have given the list of respondents interviewed in the annexure (Table 40, Table 41 and Table
42).
3.3.2. Community survey
Community survey of 300 respondents was carried out under the assignment. Given below the sampling
methodology.
Types of respondents:
Community survey consisted of data to be collected from two types of respondents. The first type (Group A)
comprised beneficiaries at the household level corresponding to outcome areas 1, 2 and 3 of UNICEF’s results
framework as given below:
• Women in the community (aged above 18 years)
• An adult family member of households with mothers having children in the age group of 0-5 years
• An adult family member of households with adolescent girls (age between 11-18 years)
The second type (Group B) consisted of beneficiaries at community level as given below:
• Members from WASH committee/ Water Point Committee
• Community leaders (Members of Union Parishad/other representatives from community).
• School Principal/teacher from the community (Primary and secondary school)
• Staff of health center in the community
Sampling design:
The evaluators followed a multi-stage stratified sampling design ensuring representation from each intervention
district. Overall, the evaluators covered 15 districts in the survey. Further, from every district, the evaluators
randomly selected two Unions (i.e., there are 30 Unions in total in the sample).
Sample size:
For Group A, the evaluators selected two respondents of each type in each Union, giving a sample size of 30x6
=180 for this group. For Group B, the idea was to cover one respondent of each type in each of 30 Unions,
giving a sample size of 30x4=120 for this group. Table 6 summarizes the sample size.

3.3.3. Online survey
The evaluators conducted online survey with UNICEF implementing partner NGOs to better understand the
effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability aspects of the programme from an implementation perspective.
Types of respondents: Online survey was with the field level staff of UNICEF partner organizations like Green
Hill, NGO forum, VERC, etc. in the interventions Unions.
Sampling design and sample size: The selection of the respondents was done purposively from the list of
implementation partners per Union. In total, the evaluators contacted 67 respondents and got response from
60. The sample frame consisted of email address and contact information of the field level staffs provided by
UNICEF. The survey was conducted through a questionnaire administered through email.
3.3.4. U-report poll
The U-report poll was carried out on UNICEF’s U-report platform with community members (beneficiaries of
WASH programme) including adolescents. The U-report poll helped the evaluators to understand the status of
sustainable and equitable access of sanitation facilities and drinking water in the schools and institutions.
3.4. Theory of change
The GoB UNICEF joint WASH evaluation programme has 11 implementation strategies, three outputs and
three outcomes. The final aim of the programme is to achieve an improved quality, equitable access, and
sustainability of WASH services (Figure 12).
Figure 12: Theory of change of GoB-UNICEF WASH programme
Causal relationships between inputs, interventions, outputs, and outcomes
Impact evaluation is employed to assess the extent to which changes in outcome indicators can be attributed to
an intervention. In doing so, the question “how much did the treated group benefit from the intervention”,
January 2022
PwC 27
requires information on the counterfactuals, i.e., “what would have been the situation of the treated group, had
it not been given the treatment”. The ideal method for estimating the causal impacts of an intervention is to
collect a repeated sample from treated and untreated groups in the pre-intervention and post-intervention
period. The difference in the change in the outcome indicators in the period of evaluation between the treated
and untreated groups, is regarded as the causal effect of the intervention.
The evaluators use two rounds of Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) from 2012 and 2019 to estimate the
treatment effects, using a quasi-experimental design – difference in differences. The use of MICS limits the
evaluators from establishing causality due to the following barriers:
• Pooled cross-section: The MICS data draws stratified random samples that are not repeated over the
years. As a result, the data used for analysis, is a pooled cross-section, rather than a panel. Since different
households are surveyed in the two time periods, the estimated effect of the programme may not be
causal.
• MICS population weights: The MICS data allocates weights to each household to enable estimation of
national statistics. Since the evaluation focuses on the 15 programme districts, the district averages are
susceptible to sample biases. As a result, the descriptive statistics as well as the results of the multivariate
models may differ from their true value.
• Mismatch in the timeframe of the programme and MICS survey rounds: The GoB-UNICEF WASH
programme was conducted between 2017-2020 aligning with the CPD (2017-2020). However, the MICS
data is available for 2012-13 and 2018-19. As a result, the estimate derived from the statistical evaluation
would contain effects of various interventions conducted before 2017, beyond the purview of the WASH
programme.
The evaluators complement the information provided in the MICS data, primary surveys, and key informant
interviews for triangulation. Figure 13 provides a breakdown of the interlinkages between the programme
components, intermediate outcomes, and the final goal. In the second panel of Figure 13, the evaluators
present the key areas addressed by the evaluation, sources of data, and the extent to which the evaluators can
attribute the results to the implementation of the WASH programme based on the available evidence.
Figure 13: Causal pathways of the GoB-UNICEF WASH programme
Interpreting the results presented in the evaluation
Despite being a vital source of information on WASH sector progress, evidence gathered from MICS cannot be
attributed to the programme implementation. More specifically, a 20% increase in WASH access shown using
the MICS data cannot be regarded as a 20% increase in WASH access ‘caused by’ the WASH programme.
Hence, the evaluation relies on the primary survey data. The information in the primary surveys is gathered
from various strata of the society, to gain insights about the gaps and successes of the programme at the micro
level. Figure 11 provides detailed overview of the participants community survey, online survey, and U-report
polls. The scope of the primary surveys (with respect to the variety of respondents) gives the evaluation a
holistic view of the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impacts of the WASH programme.

through service delivery, coordination and policy advocacy in communities, schools and HCFs. The mixed
methods adopted by the evaluation enables the evaluators to comment on the functioning of the programme
with respect to the DAC criterion.
The theory of change presents assumptions under with the provided linkages would realize. The evaluators find
that the assumptions were largely satisfied within the period of programme evaluation. Over the period of four
years, the WASH budget allocation to WASH sector has seen a consistent rise, indicating a financial and
political support of the government for the WASH programme. Secondly, the programme design and
implementation involved the inclusion of community participation in the implementation through community
interactions, LCGs, WATSAN committees, CBOs, etc., thereby empowering communities. On the political front,
we find that the period of programme implementation coincided with a period of political stability in Bangladesh.
The General Elections took place in 2018, where the incumbent leader assumed office. However, COVID-19
pandemic and associated protocols posed a challenge to the programme implementation. Fourthly, UNICEF’s
efficient coordination with stakeholders like DPHE, LGIs, implementing NGOs, doner agencies and
development partners as well as robust monitoring and evidence generation facilitated effective
implementation. The evaluators also find that the programme facilitated the involvement of the private sector to
participate in projects like sanitation marketing. The private involvement was also critical in the background of
COVID-19 relief measures, which was incorporated by the programme. We also find that while the programme
identified and promoted climate resilient WASH technologies, it also made considerable progress in emergency
response to environmental disasters. A dedicated climate framework to ensure systematic monitoring and
rehabilitation/repairing of WASH infrastructure could be beneficial in the way forward. The following box
presents methodology and additional assumptions that were applied in the quantitative analysis.
Methodology and assumptions in the quantitative analysis (DID framework)
To capture the effect of the WASH programme, the evaluators run a Difference-in-Differences (DID) model as shown
below.
Y=β +β ∗(time dummy)+β ∗(treated dummy)+β ∗(time dummy∗treated dummy)+β (covariates)+ε
0 1 2 3 4
The interaction between the time dummy and the treated dummy is the variable of interest. The model is based on a
series of assumptions.
1. Parallel trends: The difference between the treatment and the control groups is constant over the period where
the treatment was not given. This implies that the availability of WASH facilities grew at a constant rate in both,
priority and non-priority districts, prior to the prioritization.
2. Entire district is given the treatment: The evaluators assume that all households from each district have been
impacted by the WASH programme. As a result, the evaluators assume that each household in the MICS survey is
treated and that one can generalize the effect of the WASH programme to all the households of each treated
district.
3. No change in cultural and political factors within districts over time: The cultures and political environments
may vary between districts but are assumed to be constant over time within districts.
4. No spillover effects: The evaluators assume that the welfare gains from WASH facilities provided in the WASH
districts do not spill over to the nearby communities outside the district.
5. Population estimates can be achieved by the usage of survey weights: The evaluators assume that they can
estimate the effect of the WASH programme on the entire population of the prioritized and non-prioritized districts,
using the sample weights. To calculate the sample weights, the evaluators multiply the household weights in the
MICS survey data by the household size. For each indicator, the proportions are calculated using the following
formula:
∑(𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒∗(ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠∗ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒)
𝑃𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒=
∑(ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠∗ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒)
Note: The DID model enables the evaluators to find the impact of the WASH programme on the access to WASH
facilities. However, due to the methodological issues faced by the evaluators, causal estimation is not implied (refer to
the methodology section for details)
The results provided in the evaluation primarily answer the question on “whether the outcome indicators have
seen an increase, decrease or no change over the period of programme implementation.” The results are
backed by the primary surveys, which capture the impression of the communities and stakeholders on what
worked well, what went wrong and what are the key areas of opportunity. The evaluation has faced challenges
in answering the question “to what extent the programme has been successful in causing change in the
outcome indicators” due to the limitations and constraints discussed in the following section.

Summary of main findings
Overall, the programme strategies are in alignment with the outcomes given in the ToC. However, the programme
needs to promote climate resilient WASH technologies and improve emergency preparedness including disaster-
resilient designs of water and sanitation facilities.
Bangladesh’s WASH sector faces different problems in different regions, ranging from vulnerability to extreme
weather events and their knock-on effects, to arsenic poisoning, challenges of provision of safely managed
water and sanitation to low-income communities in urban centers like Dhaka, to name a few. UNICEF’s WASH
strategy in the country is well aligned to the needs of the country, as it is informed by a detailed and
participatory bottleneck analysis.22

pipe water supply, rainwater harvester, pond sand filter,
gender-specific toilets, MHM facilities among others. It has
also successfully implemented interventions like ‘Sanitation Marketing Project’ and ‘Managed Aquifer
Recharge’ (MAR) under the programme. Given below are some of the interventions that addressed the key
gaps of Bangladesh’s WASH sector.
a) Arsenic safe villages: project for freeing villages from arsenic contamination in drinking water
The arsenic safe villages model was designed with the objective to create villages having safely managed
WASH facilities with arsenic free drinking water. The project involves creation of a community action plan and
arsenic screening and monitoring to identify the quality of WASH facilities. Based on the findings and feasibility
of installation, appropriate technology is installed for tackling the arsenic contamination – deep tube wells,
arsenic safe wells, double platform deep tubewells, pond sand filters, rainwater harvesting systems, or
groundwater/surface water based piped water supply. Evidence based decision making has been followed for
supporting poor and unserved with appropriate technologies. Further, caretakers are appointed and trained for
O&M.
Finally, community awareness programmes are run for promoting hygiene, and importance for safe water. After
all, households receive arsenic free water, the village is declared as arsenic-free. UNICEF provided GoB
technical and financial support in the success of the programme. Till 2021, 377 villages became free of arsenic
contamination.
b) Managed aquifer recharge: Innovative solution for salinity in coastal Bangladesh
Approximately 20 million people in the coastal Bangladesh face salt intrusion into drinking water sources
Saline water increases the risk of stressed pregnancy and is hazardous to the health of infants and mothers.
MAR is a technology that injects treated freshwater underground, enabling people access to safe water.
UNICEF was involved in the piloting and provision of MARs. This technology can be upscaled to ensure salinity
free water in the affected areas.

c) Hand hygiene for all (HH4A): Bangladesh roadmap (2020)
Government of Bangladesh published a roadmap with the vision of achieving universal coverage of hand
hygiene behaviour and practices through provision of facilities at communities, schools, HCFs, and other public
places. The roadmap involves inspiring behavioural change through policy framing, political support, financing,
and budgetary allocation, providing institutional arrangements for establishing and strengthening government
units for overseeing spread of hygiene practices. Short, medium, and long-term goals are set up, along with
systems for planning, monitoring, review, and coordination to achieving widespread use of hygiene facilities.

The programme made substantial efforts to ensure that the WASH needs of the vulnerable sections are met
adequately. However, these interventions should extend their reach and cater to culturally indigenous, rural,
and hard-to-reach areas. The programme should indulge more in advocacy with the government particularly in
areas where people are poor or don’t have adequate access to facilities. The next country programme should
also focus on promotion of climate resilient WASH technologies and improving emergency preparedness
including disaster-resilient designs of water and sanitation facilities and strengthening of local-level capacity,
coordination, and preparedness mechanisms. In addition, the programme needs to integrate a robust
monitoring and evaluation system including real time collection of data. Box 2 depicts the key strategies
adopted by UNICEF in the next country programme (2022-2026) to address the gaps in WASH sector.

private partners is a promising approach that needs additional emphasis. In this regard, the Sanitation
Marketing Systems in Bangladesh are important initiatives. The project is funded by Swiss Agency for
Development and Cooperation (SDC) and UNICEF. The objective of the initiative is to ensure that market-led
solutions contribute to the improved sanitation services through a range of commercial hygienic sanitation
systems and behavior change.
The nature of aid in Bangladesh has changed with increase in loan assistances and a decrease in grant
funding. With the changing needs of the country, UNICEF has been shifting its focus from service delivery to
quality and sustainability. New approaches are being formulated with a higher focus on system strengthening,
developing valuable public-private partnership and capacity building in the enabling environment. UNICEF will
focus more on evidence generation like piloting or model creation. These models once formulated can be
adapted by the government and scaled up. Given below are some of the initiatives that need upscaling.
• Arsenic safe union with open defecation free concept targeting the poor and unserved
• Better coordination with private sector, district administration to implement district level MHM

status and needs to either become better or to consider engagement in favor of a better

Summary of main findings
• The programme has played a critical role in improving accessibility to WASH infrastructure.
• Apart from access to WASH facilities, the programme is designed to build awareness about safe WASH practices,
inculcate hygiene behavior and ensure gender equitable WASH service delivery.
UNICEF has played a critical role in the implementation of the work aimed towards achieving MDGs. It has
played a major role in making Bangladesh open defecation free and improving the overall WASH situation in
the country. The Sanitation Marketing Project has been a successful intervention of the WASH programme and
has motivated households to purchase their improved toilets via local entrepreneurs. The programme has
made considerable progress in providing safe water by step by step evidence based decision making
processes for targeting the poor and vulnerable with context specific appropriate technologies.
Providing favorable learning environments, especially for girls through the provision of gender-segregated
toilets and MHM facilities in schools, has been another achievement of the programme to encourage girls to
attend school. WASH blocks and hygiene corners have been constructed to provide the basic and necessary
facilities. UNICEF has also worked extensively on raising awareness at community level on the human-induced
impacts on groundwater level.
In addition, UNICEF worked towards assisting in emergencies ensuring that Rohingya refugees in the host
community have proper access to water supply, sanitation facilities including MHM, hand washing facilities and
promotion of hygiene behavior. Box 3 depicts the human rights-based approach (HRBA) and child rights
convention (CRC) of the programme.
The consultations with stakeholders suggest that UNICEF needs to give emphasis to the following areas.
• WASH in healthcare services
• Climate-resilient WASH technologies should be made accessible across the country
• Emphasis needs to be laid on “progress with quality”
• Development of market for WASH services is another area where continuation of technical support
from UNICEF is needed

Box 3: WASH programme's CRC and HRBA approach
Human rights-based approach (HRBA) and Child rights convention (CRC)
The Human rights-based approach (HRBA) has been adopted in the programme to ensure the protection of human
rights in accordance with the internationally set standards. Considering it as a right of all citizens, the programme
aims at providing access to safely managed WASH facilities to all, leaving no one behind. Bangladesh ratified the
ICESCR in 1998. The article 11 and 12 of the ICESCR recognizes the right to an adequate standard of living and the
right to health, respectively. The article 12 ensures "the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and
mental health" which includes the access to good quality water, sanitation and hygiene services for all.
Bangladesh was one of the first countries to adopt the CRCs in 1990, committing to ensure the provision of
services such as education and healthcare to all children under the age 18. The CPD (2017-2020) was based
on the lifecycle approach as advocated by UNICEF. The outcomes drawn under the WASH programme align with
reduction in infant mortality, stunting, and wasting, increased access to quality education, increased awareness
regarding menstrual health among young boys and girls, and increased use of MHM products by women and
adolescent girls.
The WASH programme facilitated the awareness of the communities (right-holders) about their right to
access to safe water and sanitation facilities. The WASH programming has been designed to prioritize vulnerable
areas like the hard-to-reach areas, coastal areas, and urban slums, where there has been a systematic lack of WASH
coverage. Additionally, the programme incorporates gender sensitivity in the programme design. The WASH
programme encourages interaction with the community members to improve service delivery. The inclusion of the
communities in the programme implementation has contributed to widespread awareness of the rights of each citizen.
The establishment of duty bearers and a framework for robust coordination facilitated the smooth
functioning of the programme. For instance, the policy support branch (PSB) was institutionalized to support the
DPHE in strengthening the policy formulation and implementation. Targets were set for each duty bearer, to be
achieved in a defined period of time. The progress was reviewed at regular intervals to made remedial changes. The
programme further encouraged coordination between various line ministries to increase efficiency in implementation.
The programme design incorporates monitoring systems to monitor the progress achievement of the duty
bearers. Regular monitoring of the performance of various components of the WASH programme contributes to
increase in efficiency and accountability. DPHE has established MIS and other applications to track the progress of
the WASH indicators. However, stakeholder interactions suggest that while the data and technology are available,
there is a lack in the ability of analyzing and understanding the data.

Summary of main findings
• The WASH programme contributed to a considerable increase in quality, equitable access and sustainability of
water, sanitation and hygiene services through various interventions at the community and institutional levels
through effective implementation of WASH interventions of policy advocacy, coordination with focus on behavioral
change.
• The programme effectively responded to changing demands owing to COVID-19 pandemic and the Rohingya
crisis.
• In the period of programme evaluation, there has been a shortfall in the achievement of targets set by the CPD
(2017-2020) in alignment with SDG 6.1 and SDG 6.2. However, this shortfall cannot be solely attributed to the
WASH programme since the achievement of the CPD targets is a collective responsibility of various stakeholders
and programmes in Bangladesh’s WASH sector.

Effectiveness in improving access to WASH facilities23
The WASH programme contributed to an improvement in the access to water, sanitation, and hygiene.
Between 2012 and 2019, the access to the improved sources of water (97.9% to 98.5%24), improved sanitation
(76.9% to 84.6%) and handwash facilities with water and soap (59.1% to 74.8%), has increased.
Based on their prevalent socioeconomic performance, the

Table 8 summarizes the coverage of WASH services before priority districts
and after the implementation of the programme for the priority
and non-priority districts.27 The results suggest the following:
• There has been a rise in the access to WASH facilities in both priority and non-priority districts. The largest
improvement has been in the access to hygiene facilities.28
• The priority districts lagged in access to all the indicators in 2012. The inclusion of these districts in the
priority listing indicates the adoption of the equity principle in the programming.
• The increase in the access to WASH facilities in priority districts has been larger than the that of the non-
priority districts.

The analysis of the community survey suggests that a majority of the respondents believe that the WASH
programme has been effective in ensuring at least basic toilet facilities in their community (86%) and
that the toilet facilities are consistently used and equitably accessed by all (94.5%). 14.5% of the
respondents responded that some of the members of their community still resorted to open defecation.

handwashing facilities. Stakeholder interaction
brought to light that the implementation of the WASH in school programme was assigned to the education
sector. UNICEF shifted its focus to developing an integrated model for hygiene management (using the three-
star approach) to demonstrate quality WASH facilities as opposed to service delivery. Under the three-star
approach, schools are encouraged to ensure handwashing with soap, access to safe drinking water, and
access to clean, gender-segregated and child-friendly toilets at school.
The secondary data (JMP) suggests that there has been an increase in the access to WASH facilities
between 2015 and 2019
• The access to at least limited water facilities (improved water sources) increased from 88.91% (2015) to
92.07% (2019) of the total schools
• The access to at least limited sanitation facilities (improved sanitation which is shared or unshared)
increased from 97.11% (2015) to 100% of the total schools
• The access to basic hygiene facilities (handwashing facility with soap and water at home) increased from
44.44% to 50.74% of the total schools
The analysis of primary data suggests:
29 Achievement of the CPD outcomes is not the sole responsibility of the GoB-UNICEF WASH programme. It is a collective responsibility of various
stakeholders and programmes functional in the WASH sector of Bangladesh. The evaluators use the CPD targets as a benchmark.
30 Table 31 presents the list of CPD targets relevant to the evaluation along with the statistics on the achievement.
31 Evaluators find a shortage in evidence generation with respect to the WASH development in schools and HCFs of the prioritized districts within the
intervention period. The evaluators use the national JMP data, which has limited attributability with respect to the contributions of UNICEF and the WASH
programme. The evaluators use the primary survey to analyse the perception of the survey respondents on the WASH programme implementation.

Table 9 suggests that UNICEF achieved 145% of its mandated target in provision of safe sanitation and
achieved 78% of the target in the provision of safe water services in communities. However, while the CPD

Effectiveness in improving the equity in access to WASH facilities
The Country Programme document presents the need to bring about increases in the access to social
infrastructure in communities with special emphasis on the most disadvantageous groups, with respect to
geographical areas (hard-to-reach, rural and urban, disaster prone, etc.), gender, disability, etc.
The prioritized districts had lower access to WASH facilities pre-intervention. There has also been a
larger increase in the access to facilities in the period of programme implementation.
In 2012, 32.5% of the population of the priority districts had access to all WASH facilities34, while the adjacent
number for the non-priority districts was 48.1%. In 2019, the growth in households having access to all WASH
facilities was 85.2% in the priority districts and 38% in the non-priority districts (Table 10).

While there has been wealth-based access inequity in 2019, it has reduced between 2012 and 2019. To
test the effect of wealth on the access to WASH facilities, the evaluators employ the chi-squared test of
association using the household level MICS data of 2019, as presented in Table 26 and Table 27. The chi-
squared test of association tests the presence of association between two categorical variables having the null
hypothesis that the variables are independent. The null-hypothesis can be rejected, and statistical dependence
can be inferred when p-value is less than 0.1. Evidence shows that the access to WASH facilities is higher
among the (i) wealthier households, (ii) households with educated household heads, (iii) households located in
the urban areas. However, analysis also shows that the wealth-based inequity has reduced over time. This
finding is triangulated through Key Informant Interviews (KIIs).
Districts with larger inequality in the pre-intervention period have seen reduction in the inequality to a
larger extent in the period of programme implementation, pointing towards effective incorporation of equity
aspects in the programme design. The evaluators analyze the wealth inequality in the distribution of WASH
facilities with respect to the hard-to-reach areas in each division35. Figure 17 shows a positive correlation
between a) inequality in the access to all improved WASH facilities in 2012, and b) the percentage reduction in
the inequality between 2012 and 2019. In other words, the divisions having higher inequality in 2012 have
reduced inequality to a larger extent between 2012 and 2019. The width of each bubble in the bubble plot of
Figure 17, is determined by the share of extreme HTR areas in the total HTR areas in each division36. The plot
shows no visible correlation between the presence of extreme HTRs in a district and the reduction in
the wealth inequality.
Figure 17: Reduction in the wealth bias in access to WASH services from 2012 to 2019
34 All WASH facilities include i) Improved Sources of Water, ii) Improved (Shared + Unshared) Sanitation, and iii) Handwashing facilities with water and
soap/detergent.
35 Firstly, the evaluators compute the share of population having access to all WASH facilities in 2012 and 2019 per wealth quintile. Further, the evaluators
construct a ratio of the proportions of richest and poorest sub-samples for each division. For instance, if the ratio is 4 for a division ‘A’, it implies that the
proportion of population having access to all WASH services is four times that of the proportion of the poorest population for the year ‘Y’. By computing this
ratio for both years for all divisions, the evaluators find that the ratio has declined over the period of programme implementation indicating towards a reduction
in wealth-based inequality in distribution of WASH services. Next, to identify the hard-to-reach areas, the evaluators referred Ahmed and Hassan (2012)35. The
evaluators compute the fraction of extreme HTR areas in the total HTR areas for each division.
36 The graph combines the Rajshahi and Rangpur division in all the metrics. Rangpur was under Rajshahi division till 25th January 2010. (Ahmed & Hassan,
2012) uses the pre 2010 division arrangement in defining the HTRs.

Effectiveness of the programme in addressing challenges faced by vulnerable communities
The programme has been effective in identifying and addressing the challenges faced by the vulnerable
groups. In the disaster-prone areas, the programme promotes climate resilient WASH infrastructure such as
double platform tube wells and sanitation facilities (in flood prone areas), SATO pans and SATO taps in the
draught areas, etc. For the elderly and persons with disabilities, the programme has also promoted sanitation
infrastructure with railings for hand support. In terms of gender, the programme has promoted gender
segregated sanitation infrastructure equipped with MHM facilities, establishment of WASH blocks, etc.
Primary survey data suggest that a majority of the respondents believe that the issues vulnerable
groups have been appropriately addressed by the WASH programme (Figure 18).

Effectiveness of the programme in addressing gender issues
Gender inequality has been a major crosscutting issue plaguing Bangladesh, as in most other countries. The
GoB-UNICEF WASH programme has prioritized gender equality, to reach the marginalized and excluded
sections of the society through gender sensitive programming. UNICEF played a critical role in integrating
gender in the programme design and programme results. The MIS data provided by UNICEF suggests that:
• In the process of development of the Country Programme Document, the strategies are reviewed, and
gender responsive approaches are adopted. Encouragement is given to gender sensitive and responsive
planning, implementation, monitoring, and reporting.
• Multi-dimensional inequalities that shape gender vulnerabilities are addressed by strengthening sectoral
approaches
• Key strategies are adopted for the empowerment of adolescent girls through adolescent clubs, providing
them access to secondary education, life, and livelihood skills.
• UNICEF serves as the co-chair of Local Consultative Group for Women and Gender Equality for effective
coordination and leveraging of technical assistance on gender, especially adolescent girls’ issues.
School dropout of adolescent girls and early marriage are two key challenges faced by Bangladesh. Lack of
awareness on menstruation and menstrual hygiene are identified as few reasons for the dropouts of the
adolescent girls. Under the WASH programme, schools are equipped with gender segregated toilets, MHM
facilities and awareness sessions are carried out regarding menstrual hygiene. Effective implementation of

these interventions is expected to have longer term impacts through reduction in early child marriages and
overall improvement in the status of women in the society.
The primary survey analysis suggests that the WASH programme has been successful in reducing
school dropouts over the period of programme implementation in the priority districts
• In the online survey conducted on field level staff, GoB officials and other stakeholders, 83% respondents
suggested that the WASH programme successfully reduced the girls from dropping out of schools.
• Table 11 shows a statistically significant difference between the proportion of respondents agreeing that
the programme has been successful in reducing dropout of adolescent girls from secondary school. Such
results may have potential gender bias, entering through the male perception of the time investments of the
women. Hence, the evaluators further test whether the male respondents perceive differently than the
women respondents.
• Table 12 shows that the evaluators find no statistically significant difference in the responses recorded by
the female respondents and the male respondents.

Effectiveness in ensuring long term implementation of the programme and sustainability of WASH
Facilities
The GoB has strengthened budgetary and institutional capacities to ensure long term continuation of
the WASH programme. The commitment of the GoB towards the WASH sector can be derived from the
following:
• The annual budget allocations to the WASH sector have been increasing over past 7 years39.
• Policy Support Branch established to support the DPHE, to strengthen the policy formulation and
implementation.
• The community and institutional approach in supply of WASH facilities channelize the interventions.
• The establishment of the sanitation markets through the community lead total sanitation (CLTS) approach
encouraged local production of sanitation products and contributed to spreading the sustainable use of
improved sanitation commodities.

Summary of main findings
• The WASH programme partnered and coordinated with stakeholders to identify and promote innovations to
ensure access to quality climate resilient WASH infrastructure.
• UNICEF expanded the use of digital platforms to increase awareness among the communities on safe hygiene
practices. During the pandemic, UNICEF’s “Meena cartoon” spread awareness about the COVID-19 protocols
The mobilization of the government departments, NGOs and private players in the developmental sector has
become increasingly important, as Bangladesh moves towards becoming a middle-income country. As
Bangladesh progresses, funds from the donor agencies are expected to narrow down. The WASH
programme has been successful in establishing coordination between the stakeholders, NGOs, and
the community leaders. The programme has involved active participation of the communities, youth,
religious leaders, schoolteachers, and women in policy framing and implementation.
The involvement of government departments and different partners added value in the formulation and
promotion of innovative approaches. The establishment of markets for WASH services, mark a movement of
the WASH strategy from free service delivery to market-based approaches. Training sessions are carried out
for the local latrine producers to promote their products and make their business profitable. Sanitation markets

and people with disabilities, the toilets have railings have hand support. Effective innovations are identified and
promoted.
The Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is used to provide safe drinking water. In areas with high arsenic
contamination in drinking water, tools have been set up to test the levels of arsenic in source water. Treatment
plants have been installed for arsenic and manganese filtering. Finally, in the flood prone areas, climate
resilient technology of double platform tube wells was set up to ensure unhindered access to water.

In the provision of sanitation and hygiene, there have been innovations to reduce the use of water. The
introduction of SATO taps and SATO pans have made handwash and sanitation accessible in places where
water is still scarce. The SATO handwashing technology provides contact free handwashing, with the provision
for storage of soap installed within the design.
Furthermore, for increased awareness about hygiene and inducing behavioral change, UNICEF adopted
digital solutions. In 2019, the number of persons accessing online platforms significantly increased. The
popular ‘Meena Game’ was downloaded by more than 2.5 million people in 2019. Through the Meena game,
UNICEF conveyed the need for safe hygiene, especially in the context of COVID-19. The adoption of digital
assets, enhanced UNICEF’s reach to a greater extent.

results of the WASH programme?
Summary of findings
• Through the WASH programme, various stakeholders, donor agencies and national and international NGOs
coordinated to improve the living conditions of all the age groups as drawn by UNICEF’s lifecycle approach
• For each age-group of the lifecycle approach, there have been considerable improvements in the
health and hygiene indicators between 2012 and 2019.
The outcome areas of the Country Programme Document (2017-2020) have been structured to address the
problems faced by children of various age groups – infants, young children and their mothers, girls and boys of
primary school age, and adolescents. The three outcome areas drawn out by the CPD for the WASH sector
based on the lifecycle approach hence require strong coordination and partnership between different segments
of the government with UNICEF along with its external partners.
UNICEF has played a key role in establishing the coordination required for designing and achieving of the
outcomes set in the CPD. For channelizing the programme implementation, heads are deployed for
strategizing, implementation the programme, and addressing the identified bottlenecks which hinder the
programme implementation. To achieve accountability, the work of the heads is assessed, and responsibilities
are reshuffled based on the performance. In 2018, around 800 national and sub-national WASH, education,
health, nutrition professionals and policy makers contributed to the design of the WASHBAT report for
all 8 divisions for evidence-based WASH life cycle approach programming41. The WASHBAT report
created a robust framework for the identification of barriers in the programme implementation, that can be
resolved through informed policymaking.
UNICEF played a critical role in establishing collaborations in programme implementation. Following pointers
provide an overview on the key contributions.42
• A National Coordination Body on the Child-Friendly City Initiative was established by UNICEF for providing
regular guidance to all CCs on child-responsive planning.
• UNICEF supported the Dhaka South City Corporation to develop a consultative process of child-friendly city
planning for 2020-2021.
• In collaboration with the Department of Disaster Management, trainings on child-centered disaster risk
reduction (CC-DRR) with use of the approved guidelines and manuals began for city-level disaster
Management Committees, with the aim of strengthening the risk assessment capacity and ensuring child
rights and children’s participation are emphasized in the DRR process.
• Under the partnership (since 2016) with the Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre, faculty
members reviewed course curriculum and suggested further inclusion of child rights, related policy
measures and evidence.
• Partnership with Bangladesh Scouts started to integrate child protection and disaster risk management to
strengthen youth engagement in community development and scouts’ capacity development.
Secondary data analysis shows that in the period of implementation of the programme, Bangladesh43
shows experienced improvements in some indicators of the life cycle framework while showing no
change or negative growth in the others (Table 28).

Summary of main findings
• The programme facilitated increase in the accessibility to safely managed water, sanitation and hygiene services
among the communities and institutions.
• The interventions at the Korail LIC have been impactful in reaching safe water through legal connections to the
residents. These interventions can be scaled up to other LICs and urban slums.
• The programme has also contributed to positive unintended linkages such as reduction in child marriages, reduction
in gender-based violence and increase in literacy rate.
• The programme has also been impactful in providing technical support to households against the breakage of
WASH infrastructure caused by natural calamities.
The WASH programme has had various direct and indirect impacts in the priority districts. In this question, the
evaluators discuss about the intended and unintended outcomes of the programme. The GoB, Local
Government Institutions (LGIs), UNICEF and various national and international NGOs have together
contributed to successful implementation of the WASH programme.
Noteworthy impacts of interventions for provision of safe water

Through the eighth five-year plan, the GoB has planned to provide
financial and institutional support through budget allocations and fiscal decentralization49 to upscale the
installation of treatment plants all over the country including the hard-to-reach areas.
The perception of the primary survey respondents is found to be in alignment with the secondary data.
Analysis of the community survey suggests:
• 89% of the surveyed households believe that the WASH programme has increased the use of and access
to safe drinking water.
• 99% surveyed households agree that the programme was successful in reducing diarrhea and other water
borne diseases.
Noteworthy impacts of interventions for provision of safe sanitation
One of the biggest achievements of the WASH sector in Bangladesh is of being recognized as open defecation
free (ODF), where less than 1% of the population is engaged in open defecation. However, a larger challenge
in this endeavor is to inculcate the use of safe sanitation facilities and fecal sludge management. With the
objective of increasing the use of safe sanitation, sanitation marketing was adopted in Bangladesh. Between
January 2018 and June 2018, 33,018 latrines were sold to 29,716 households through the Sanitation Marketing
project.50 Dhaka North and South City Corporations constructed new community toilets and repaired existing
toilets to provide access to safe sanitation for 10,520 people living in LICs. This activity was supported by
UNICEF.51 Additionally, 1.4 million people of Bangladesh were provided with access to safely managed
sanitation facilities in line with 6.2 as a result of UNICEF's direct support.52

Noteworthy impacts of interventions for provision of hygiene facilities
Hygiene has been a challenge for the government, the development partners, and the local and
international NGOs. The NHS survey, in 2017, reported a low handwashing rate among the people of
Bangladesh, before cooking (36%), before eating (40%), and after defecation (55%). The percentage of
households having hand washing facilities within 30 feet radius from the handwashing facility was reported to
be 84%.
The above statistics brings to light an important aspect regarding the practice of handwashing. It requires high
self-motivation. In a two-pronged strategy adopted by UNICEF, handwashing points with water and soap were
provided, and awareness campaigns were run to educate the communities about the health benefits of washing
hands, during the Covid-19 period.
Some of the impactful interventions carried out by the programme53
Induction of good hygiene regarding handwashing and MHM are listed below:
behaviour done through
• Orientation on Hygiene practices: 23,762 individuals in LICs
awareness, trainings, and were oriented on hygiene practices
policy development and • Hygiene training at schools: 1,564 individuals, including
advocacy teachers, school management committee members and students,
were trained to enhance their skills on hygiene promotion.
• MHM day: In 2019, MHM day was observed at national and
sub-national level. More than 13,000 people, including policy makers and adolescents were sensitized on
MHM.
• Advocacy and designing of the “Three-star approach”: The approach was designed to improve the
effectiveness of hygiene behavior change programmes, ensuring that healthy habits are taught, practiced,
and integrated into daily school routines.
• Hand hygiene for all (HH4A) roadmap: In 2020, GoB published a roadmap with the vision of achieving
universal coverage of hand hygiene behavior and practices through provision of facilities at communities,
schools, HCFs, and other public places.
• Tax exemptions on MHM products: UNICEF and WaterAid jointly advocated the exemption of import
taxes and duties on raw materials required to produce sanitary napkins, to make MHM materials
accessible54.
The GoB, in the next five-year plan (2020-2025) has aimed to increase the levels of hand washing and hygiene
facilities. 55

However, the issues of the urban areas remain largely under-achieved. The seventh five-year plan of the
GoB targeted access to safe drinking water for all, and 100% urban population with access to sanitary
latrines58. However, JMP data shows that only 52.8% of the urban population has access safely managed
drinking water in 2020. Only 35% of the urban population has had access to latrines in 2020. Additionally,
provision of legal water connection and safe sanitation remains a challenge in most other LICs. Legal water
connections would have two crucial benefits a) Reduction in the price paid by the LIC dwellers for illegal water
connections, and b) revenue generation for WASAs through legal payment of water bills. The Korail case can
be replicated for the other LICs to ensure water, sanitation, and hygiene for all.
Korail LIC: A success story
Dhaka Water and Sanitation Authority (DWASA) with partnership of the UNICEF, designed policies provide WASH
services to the lower income communities (LICs) in the urban slums. DWASA was not allowed to provide water and
sanitation facilities to the LICs due to the inability to produce the tenure rights. Only 18% of the LIC dwellers had
access to improved water sources and 19%, to improved sanitation. The access to water was illegal and
provided by middlemen. With the help of local NGOs, who became the guarantors for water bills, DWASA
and UNICEF provided legal connections in the Korail, one of the oldest and largest LICs. The intervention had a
two-pronged impact – the price of the legal water connection reduced by 9 times and the DWASA could accumulate
funds in form of water fee, which was earlier not possible.
In 2019, 60% of the Korail residents have legal water connections
Similarly, UNICEF provided DWASA with 2 desludging trucks for Fecal waste management and carried out
sensitization sessions to promote handwashing, use of latrine and menstrual hygiene. As a result, 90000 LIC
dwellers in Dhaka got access to improved sources of water and sanitation facilities and 387000 people got legal
water connections by 2018. Additionally, a sewerage masterplan was approved by the DWASA to connect all
households to the sewerage treatment plan.

W ASH in Schools
The WASH in Schools sub-programme consists of prov iding WASH facilities in all schools to ensure high
standards of health for a long run improvement in socioeconomic indicators. The WASH in Schools programme
includes ensuring safely managed water, safe sanitation, handwashing, and menstrual hygiene management.
The efforts made by WASH programme in improving the service delivery at schools are listed below:
• Improving access: In 2018, 19,600 secondary schools were provided with WASH facilities with support of
the UNICEF.
• Monitoring: WASH in Schools programme is monitored in real time for studying the sustainability of the
WASH facilities.
• Evidence generation for awareness programmes: Some schools are selected for studying handwashing
patterns of children. Using the data on the children’s handwashing patterns, collected through sensors
attached on handwashing devices, awareness programmes are designed, to spread awareness about the
best practices.
• MHM in school curriculum: UNICEF advocated the inclusion of MHM in the secondary school curriculum
to reduce the dropout rate among the secondary school girls due to the lack of MHM facilities.
• Gender segregated toilets: In 2019, 5425 additional secondary schools were provided gender segregated
toilets with menstrual health facilities59 with support of UNICEF.

WASH in Healthcare Facilities (HCFs)
WASH in healthcare facilities focuses on the water, sanitation, hygiene and waste management in hospitals,
clinics, and health centers. The implementation of the WASH in HCFs, has been a challenge in
Bangladesh, due to lack of policies, set national standards, evidence generation and equity in service.60
Availability of more than one drinking water points is lacking in hospitals for general use. Only 28% of the HCFs
had more than one drinking water points for general use and only 34%, for patients and caregivers. However,
the sanitation facilities are clean in 82% of the HCFs and hand hygiene is maintained well in 98.75%. Finally,
the training for general and clinical waste disposal, hospital cleanliness, and sterilization of equipment is not
common. 68% doctors, 55% nurses and 73% of ward workers are not obtained any training of waste
management61.

• While the programme targeted that 500 additional HCFs would be equipped with basic WASH facilities with
direct support of UNICEF by 2020, only 18 were achieved.
• The GoB, in 2019, developed a WASH Guideline for Community Clinics, to achieve a higher level of
operation and maintenance.
• The eighth five-year plan intends to increase budgetary allocation to healthcare facilities, to enhance the
lower-level healthcare facilities and to introduce of public-private partnership (PPP) structures for the
betterment of HCFs.
Unintended impacts
Table 13 provides the responses of the survey participants on how well the programme was able to overcome
the negative unintended outcomes and achieve the positive unintended outcomes. The results suggest the
following:
• Successful addressal of the challenges associated with contamination of water during natural calamities
• Programme addressed challenges relating to breakage of sanitation facilities, both in normal periods and
periods of natural calamities
• Programme was instrumental in reducing child marriage as well as gender-based violence
• Increase in literacy rates

Summary of main findings
• There has been a significant increase in the access to improved water sources, improved sanitation facilities and
basic hygiene facilities at the community level in the targeted districts between 2012 and 2019.
• Primary data analysis suggests that a majority of survey respondents agree to an increase in proportion of
schools providing basic WASH services, availability of gender segregated sanitation facilities in schools and
HCFs, awareness about MHM among communities, and reduction in dropout of adolescent schoolgirls, in the
period of programme evaluation
In this question, the evaluators present the impacts of the programme using descriptive statistics and the quasi-
experimental statistical design DID, to find out the effects of the WASH programme on the priority districts.
Information on the implementation is gathered through a wide set of variables. Table 32 presents the variable
definitions. The results of the model are triangulated using the primary survey data and key informant
interviews.
Access to quality WASH services has increased over the period of programme implementation at the
national level as well as in the priority districts.
• Figure 21 presents the increase in the percentage of household members having access to improved
sources of water and sanitation along with basic hygiene services between 2012 and 2019.

Analysis of the primary surveys reiterate the above results. Majority of the community survey, online
survey and the U-poll report respondents believe that the WASH programme has been instrumental in
increasing the access to WASH services at the community and the institutional level66. Table 29 provides the
details on the questions asked and the percentage of respondents agreeing.
Equitable access to WASH services (heterogenous treatment effects)
The WASH programme has had differentiated impacts on the rural and urban households. Figure 23 shows the
estimated increase in the WASH access in the priority districts.
• Urban areas: Increase in the access to water, sanitation, and hygiene
• Rural areas: Increase in access to basic hygiene facilities. However, no statistically significant increases in
access to water and sanitation

The analysis of the covariates in the DID regression presents how the WASH facilities vary with socioeconomic
characteristics of the households.
• Education (above primary level) plays a major role, especially in the urban areas, in the access to
WASH facilities. Households with an educated head in the rural have an access benefit of 3.5% for
improved sanitation, 2% in basic hygiene and 3.1% in the access to all WASH facilities. In the urban areas,
the benefit alongside education is 4.2% for sanitation, 7.1% for hygiene facilities and 8.5% in terms of
access to all WASH facilities (Table 35).
• Gender and religion of the household head does not play a significant role in enhancing the access
to WASH facilities.
• A major driver of the WASH distribution is household wealth. The richest class enjoys an average
premium of 64% in acquiring access to all WASH facilities (see column 4 of Table 33) with respect to the
poorest class. The premium reduces for the fourth (44.1%), middle (30%) and the second (17%) quintile.
The primary survey provides a deeper insight into the gender equity in the access to WASH facilities. Table 30
provides the questions asked in the community survey, online survey and U poll report, and the percentage of
responses in favor of the question statement. The results suggests that the programme has made
commendable progress in the incorporation of gender in programme results.
• Increase in awareness and availability of MHM facilities.

Summary of main findings
UNICEF has efficiently coordinated with multiple stakeholders in identifying and resolving gaps in the WASH sector.
Government and non-government stakeholders have been incorporated into the WASH system to reduce the
existing inequalities and providing effective, efficient, and sustainable WASH services to everyone irrespective
of geographies or gender. UNICEF has successfully coordinated with the Ministry of Health, Ministry of
Education & DPHE for providing WASH in schools and healthcare facilities. In addition to these, UNICEF
worked with the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives to conduct the WASH-

in 2018. The success rate in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) reflects coordination among
the organizations, departments, ministries at the sub-national and national levels.
At the district level, UNICEF has collaborated with district administrations and education ministries to provide
MHM facilities in schools. Hygiene corners have been developed and MHM products have been made
available. It has worked with the DPHE to provide training and capacity building programmes. Events such as
awareness-raising, and provision of hygiene kits executed in collaboration with government stakeholders have
been instrumental in effective hygiene management during the pandemic. Private sector companies like
Unilever have collaborated with UNICEF to distribute soap in different regions in the country with the view to
encourage handwashing practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Furthermore, UNICEF has efficiently coordinated with ministries and departments such as the Ministries of
Education, MoFHW and Department of Public Health but there is further scope of improvement in strengthening
collaboration with ministries such as the Ministry of women and Children Affairs, Ministry of Environment,
Forest and Climate Change and private sector organizations.

Summary of main findings
Underutilization of funds for equipping primary schools with basic WASH facilities according to national standard.
Table 14 depicts the outcome indicator wise budget consumption ratio. The budget consumption ratio is
defined as the ratio of actual expenditure and planned budget of the programme components. As it can be seen
in the table, funds are underutilized in equipping primary schools with basic WASH facilities according to
national standard. In 2017, only 7% of the budget was spent and it has increased 68.1% in 2020. The bulk of
the funds are utilized in increasing access to safely managed water resources and safely managed sanitation
facilities in programme areas with UNICEF’s direct support.
Resource mobilization for WASH facilities in schools is one of the key challenges that is hampering UNICEF’s
expected progress in WASH in primary schools. Further, convincing donors that WASH in primary schools is a
requirement of a successful education Programme remains another challenge. Additionally, there are capacity
issues especially with respect to creating and maintaining a database for all schools including the WASH
infrastructure available in each school. The database would help in centrally managing the WASH in school
programme.

include locally made handwashing devices, Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR), solar operated water pipes in
rural areas. In the Netrokona district, low-cost safe toilets have been developed. At the district level, adequate
planning, and budgeting for WASH in schools and healthcare facilities have been one of the topmost factors

As per the WASHBAT report 2017, one of the recurring challenges is lack of trained staff, especially at the
lower government institutions (LGIs) and national and sub-national institutions. The recommendations cited in
the report include the following.
• Carrying out training workshops and awareness programmes at the community and institutional level to
increase the level of awareness on the importance of operation and maintenance of facilities.
• Harmonized and up to date tools for community mobilization
• Hygiene education, training, and incentives at Upazila and Parishad level with DPHE officials
The interactions with programme stakeholders also resonate the same. In order to increase the sustainability of
the WASH programme and make it more scalable, the government needs to upscale the involvement of human
resources. A shortage of manpower is perceptible at all levels. Limitations concerning organizational capacity
and manpower are quite prevalent at the district level and might take some time to be overcome.

following.
• Sustainable services delivery: Need for priority actions to facilitate sustainable WASH service delivery at
sub-sector level. The report highlights the need to encourage private sector engagement through public-
private sector and community engagements and development of an O&M strategy guide.
• Planning, monitoring, and review: Another recurrent theme in the report is the absence of functional and
harmonized monitoring systems. There is a need to develop inclusive and disaggregated monitoring
indicators in alignment with the SDGs. Furthermore, establishment of a Management Information System
(MIS) has been emphasized. Establishment and maintenance of a database of WASH infrastructure
available for all schools can be helpful in centrally managing the WASH programme in schools.
A larger focus needs to be given towards operation and maintenance (O&M) activities. Proper training should
be provided, and a sense of ownership needs to be promoted amongst the community level caretakers, who
oversee the maintenance of the project post its handover. In addition, UNICEF’s support in periodical
interventions and monitoring is desirable to ensure the sustainability of the programme activities.

Summary of main findings
Promotion and capacity building of women entrepreneurs has been an enabling factor for sustainable access to WASH
service.
The WASH programme has focused on creating and prioritizing an enabling environment along with advocacy,
data generation, data gaps, evidence creation and policy implementation. The programme is targeted towards
equity in addition to addressing the human rights issues. The overall programme design is drafted based on the
community action plan approach that includes social mapping, seasonal mapping, and other tools at the
community level.
The programme has integrated gender equality of WASH in primary and secondary schools to help children
and adolescents realize how WASH can benefit boys and girls alike. At the district level, the programme has
facilitated the development of village development committees constituting both male and female members.
The members have been provided with adequate training so that the activities and facilities can sustain for a
longer period. Besides, the programme also provides technical support to concerned people for carrying out
maintenance and installations of WASH infrastructure. For example, if a water pump gets damaged due to flood
or other calamities, the beneficiaries inform the project office. After field visit and investigation, necessary
January 2022
PwC 60
maintenance is carried out to make the pump usable. Sanitation marketing entrepreneurs have been shaped
through the programme. This has resulted in the availability of ready-to-use sanitary materials in rural areas.
Women entrepreneurs are encouraged to participate in the sanitation marketing business.
There is a need to adopt a pro-active and gender-sensitive approach to attract female staff in addition to
provision of capacity development and opportunities for professional advancement especially in offices with
higher male to female ratio. The workplaces should follow the diversity and inclusion strategy and more women
leaders in WASH interventions should be brought to the forefront.

Summary of main findings
The WASH programme addresses both practical and strategic needs of women by not only meeting their WASH
needs but also including them in decision making process at community level.
Addressing gender related issues is one of the topmost priorities of the WASH Programme. Gender-responsive
service delivery models and gender-sensitive programming have been developed to ensure equity. UNICEF,
along with other government agencies, development partners and stakeholders, engaged in several rounds of
consultations with women and considered their opinion in designing of interventions. Some of the outcomes of
these interventions include installation of water points at appropriate locations to save time and burden of water
collection, provision of gender-specific toilets, ensuring MHM in WASH facilities, creation of WASH blocks,
women entrepreneurs in sanitation marketing business besides spreading awareness on hygiene management
through backyard meetings, campaigns, courtyard meetings and others. Additionally, various community-level
groups entrusted with the task of creating awareness and educating the masses are headed by women.

sanitation marketing ventures.
Continuous efforts have been made to make the WASH programme gender-responsive and socially inclusive at
all levels. Various government stakeholders (Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, Ministry of Health,
Ministry of Education, DPHE, Local Governments, and non-government stakeholders (National and
International NGO’s, IDE Bangladesh, private companies like Unilever etc.) have also been incorporated to
reduce the existing inequality and provide effective, efficient, and sustainable WASH services to all irrespective
of genders, geographies etc.

Summary of main findings
The WASH programme has worked towards distributing climate-resilient WASH materials in addition to providing
technological support to mitigate the effects of climate change-related vulnerabilities. However, there is scope for
building climate-resilient service delivery models to make WASH facilities more sustainable.
Climate change impacts and environmental degradation

challenges in the country, such as waterlogging, inundation of toilets and
tube wells, climate-change-induced saltwater intrusion, depletion of soil,
damage of sanitary pipes and fittings, destruction of WASH
infrastructure as well as contamination of floodwater with feces and used menstrual products.
In 2018-19, UNICEF conducted the ‘Water Sanitation Bottleneck Analysis’ to better understand the key WASH
gap in the sector including implications of climate change. The report recommends a need-based planning and
budgeting to address issues such as equitable access to WASH services in HtR areas, impact of climate
change and response to WASH challenges during emergencies.
The key climate change issues in the WASH sector
• Saltwater intrusion in the ground and surface waters due to storms, flash floods and tidal floods and it
contributes to drinking water scarcity.
• Destruction of WASH infrastructure due to the climate induced extreme events. Rise in the number of non-
performing water infrastructure due to more intense and longer drought which causes the underground
water level to go lower than accessible level.
• The rise in temperature leads to higher humidity in the air and it results in longer dry months as well as
frequent floods.

PwC 62
• Bangladesh being a basin country, majority of water comes to the country through the mountains from India
and Nepal and other neighboring countries.
• WASH in schools and HCFs is affected because they are not functional during climate emergencies such
as storms, cyclones, etc.
• Risks of water getting contaminated with feces, especially in periods of floods contribute to higher chance
of waterborne disease among children.
Under the WASH programme, DPHE has worked towards distributing climate-resilient WASH materials and
water purifying tablets in addition to providing technological support (desalination units, iron removal units, ring
wells etc.) to mitigate the effects of climate change-related vulnerabilities. In addition, Managed Aquifer
Recharge (MAR) has been established in different parts of the country to provide clean and safe drinking water
during disasters. However, there is scope for building climate-resilient service delivery models to make WASH
facilities more sustainable. The focus needs to be on climate-resilient technologies and making them accessible
across different parts of the country.

Even though the core focus of the next CPD will be on
advocacy, evidence generation and capacity building, emphasis needs to be given on risk-informed
programming. It should be considered as one of the vital crosscutting strategies to guarantee effective
preparedness and response to natural and human-made disasters, with strengthened capacities to analyze,
manage and anticipate risks, particularly related to floods, droughts, and the impacts of climate change;
enhanced community resilience; and strengthened capacities to deliver results communities living in urban
slums.

5. Conclusions
In the previous chapters, the findings from the evaluation of the GoB-UNICEF country programme have been
given in detail. The summary of findings has been given in the conclusion section. For ease of reference, this
section is organized as per the OECD-DAC norms vis-à-vis objectives of the evaluation. Detailed mapping of
the conclusions with KEQs and findings has been given in Table 19.
Objective-1: Assess the relevance of the WASH Programme Strategy to the country priorities and context as
well as the global priorities (SDG 6.1, 6.2) and make recommendations
Assessment of relevance
The WASH programme has been structured in alignment to the objective of providing equitable access to
quality WASH service. The components of the theory of change have been designed keeping in view the need
to address the challenges faced by the WASH sector. The programme has adopted an approach of community
participation aimed at achieving behavioral change on safe hygiene practices at the community level. The need
for focus on the hard-to-reach areas (chars, hoars, CHT, etc.), coastal areas, urban slums, with respect to
reaching safely managed WASH services remain relevant. The WASH programme has also made gender
equity an integral part of the programming as a major cross cutting social issue. UNICEF’s overall response to
COVID-19 crisis is timely, however, analysis reveals that there has been an overemphasis on personal
protective equipment (PPE). The resources could have been utilized to ensure continuity of water, health, and
sanitization services.
Objective-2: Assess the effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, impact and gender responsiveness of the
UNICEF WASH Programme and value for money of the results during the country Programme period;
Objective-3: Generate evidence on how gender has been integrated into the WASH programme
Assessment of Effectiveness
The WASH programme has been effective in increasing the coverage of safely managed WASH facilities in
communities and institutions through policy advocacy, coordination, and induction of behavioural change.
UNICEF has played a major role in the success of the programme through system strengthening and
coordination. The programme period saw exogenous challenges caused by Rohingya crisis and COVID-19
pandemic. The programme effectively incorporated the changing needs and demands through provision of safe
WASH services, and ensuring needs relating to nutrition, education, and health. Provision of hygiene facilities
and widespread awareness campaigns were carried out to mitigate COVID-19 challenges. Evaluators find that
the programme has effectively created an enabling environment for WASH sector development. However,
evaluators find a few challenges too, in terms of meeting the targeted coverage of safe water and sanitation in
communities (outcome 1), equipping schools and HCFs with basic WASH facilities, and incorporating MHM in
school curriculum (outcome 2 and outcome 3)71.
Assessment of Efficiency
We do find some focus on cost-efficient technologies developed concerning the provision of WASH services,
for example locally made handwashing devices, Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR), solar operated water pipes
in rural areas. Additionally, we find that UNICEF has efficiently coordinated with the Ministry of Health, Ministry
of Education & DPHE for providing WASH in schools and healthcare facilities and at the district level with
district administrations and education ministries to provide MHM facilities in schools and madrasas. In terms of
challenges, we find some underutilization of funds in equipping primary schools with basic WASH facilities
according to national standard. Further, majority of the available budget was utilized on increasing coverage of
safely managed water resources and safely managed sanitation facilities in programme areas with UNICEF’s
direct support.
Assessment of Impacts
Evaluators find that UNICEF’s contribution through direct and indirect pathways in terms of increasing coverage
of WASH services in communities and institutions. For example, in the Korail LIC, the service provision through
the joint efforts by UNICEF and DWASA contributed to the provision of legal water connections and sanitation
71 These targets are set by the CPD and are achieved through implementation of many interventions in the WASH sector including the GoB UNICEF WASH
programme. Non-achievement cannot be a failure solely attributable to the WASH programme or UNICEF.
January 2022
PwC 64
facilities, which could be a replicable model for the other LICs. Analysis of the perception of primary survey
respondents shows that the programme has contributed on reducing adolescent girl school dropouts and early
marriages and increasing literacy rates.
Assessment of Sustainability
At the district level, UNICEF has raised awareness on WASH activities and practices along with providing
support to the Government entities particularly DPHE, in capacity building and programme implementation.
This has led to increase in proficiency of the institutions and individuals to continue with the tasks and activities
themselves after UNICEF support comes to an end. The analysis highlights the need to encourage private
sector engagement through public-private sector and community engagements. The programme has assisted
the government in implementing efficient monitoring systems and ensured proper review, implementation, and
monitoring of projects.
Assessment of gender responsiveness and integration
UNICEF has made constant efforts to make their WASH programme gender-responsive and socially inclusive.
Various government stakeholders (Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, Ministry of health, Ministry of
Education, DPHE, Local Governments, and non-government stakeholders (National and International NGO’s,
IDE Bangladesh, private companies like Unilever etc.) have also been incorporated to reduce the existing
inequality and provide effective, efficient, and sustainable WASH services to all.
Assessment of value for money (VfM)
The VFM analysis findings showed that GoB-UNICEF programme is built on the objective of ensuring equity
responsive and resilient service delivery. In the days to come more efforts will be required for the purpose of
evidence generation activities at local level and policy dialogue and advocacy for regular and timely dispersal of
funds at the local level. Regular and diligent monitoring of the planned and achieved targets on WASH
indicators, by the DPHE, Municipalities and UNICEF can help in estimating the fund requirements and ensuring
the budget flow appropriately.
VfM analysis faced two major limitations: a) Although there exists an MIS system, the data that tracks usage
and O&M of sanitation facilities on sustained outcomes is limited. b) Data on expenditure was only reported in
categories of outcomes. The data needs to be allocated to the activities by making assumptions on what type of
inputs were actually included in each category.

Assessment of Environmental Sustainability, Climate Change and Natural Hazards: Performance and
Opportunities
The WASH programme has worked towards identifying and promoting climate-resilient WASH technologies to
mitigate the effects of climate change-related vulnerabilities.
Aspect of sustainability in the WASH programme is interlinked with the consistent operation and maintenance
of the WASH facilities at community and institution level in areas frequently affected with natural hazards. While
the access to improved services has increased substantially, there are still significant challenges to ensure
safe, affordable, and sustainable services for all. Planning and budgeting for adequate WASH in communities,
schools and healthcare facilities by national and sub-national governments are extremely important to ensure
sustainability. It is pertinent to ensure both the availability and functionality of water points at community level.
In many areas geo-tagging of the non-functional water points are already being implemented. It needs to be
replicated in all areas by ensuring the availability of government staff at sub-district level and below.
There is scope for building climate-resilient service delivery models. In addition, the government may consider
allocating a dedicated budget to address WASH challenges in climate vulnerable areas.

6. Lessons learned
The following lessons were learned from evaluation of the GoB-WASH Programme 2017-2020 that are more
widely applicable for capacity enhancement process in the WASH sector:
✓ Clear understanding and coordination between all stakeholders of the programme regarding their roles and
responsibilities as the programming has ensured efficient implementation and timely completion of
outcomes as the programme involved active participation of the communities, youth, religious leaders,
schoolteachers, and women in policy framework and implementation.
✓ Encouraging and upscaling market-based approach has improved access to raw materials for WASH
infrastructure through promoting local micro-entrepreneurs.
✓ Engagement in PPP arrangements has helped in providing sustainable access to water supply and
sewerage services in the low-income urban areas.
Given below, the evaluators present what worked well (Table 17), where, why, and the key lessons learned
from the evaluation. This is based on the key findings and the stakeholder interactions.

8.2. Evaluation matrix
Table 18 presents the evaluability assessment matrix. In this matrix, the evaluators have kept the questions in two categories: key evaluation questions (KEQ) and
specific evaluation questions. The evaluators have classified all evaluation questions originally placed in the Terms of Reference (ToR) under the category of KEQ. The
simplified sub-questions of key evaluation questions have been kept under the category of SEQ. Further, the evaluators have also mapped the level of evaluability
assessment based on the three main criterion:
a) If indicators mapped to the evaluation questions are objectively verifiable
⎯ Under this criterion, if objectively verifiable indicators are available the evaluability assessment score to the question has been given ‘1’, else ‘0’
b) If reliable source of data is available
⎯ Under this criterion, origin of data as the primary survey data/Govt./UN/WB has been given the assessment score of ‘3’, Published data from
experimental/quasi-experimental research studies has been given the assessment score of ‘2’ and Other studies (grey literature, case studies,
newspaper articles, etc.) has been given the assessment score of ‘1’.
c)If the findings of the evaluation can be made attributable to the current country programme in WASH.
⎯ Under this criterion, the assessment score has been given based on the type of evaluation approach. Contribution analysis has been given the
assessment score of ‘3’, Contribution analysis only has been given the assessment score of ‘2’, and inference through content analysis or other method
has been given the assessment score of ‘1’.
Based on the score obtained on the three-criterion mentioned above, the final assessment score has been calculated after adding them. The classification of ‘low’,
medium, and high has been done on the basis of final assessment score. If the final assessment score is 3 of less, the evaluability assessment of the question has been
kept at ‘low’ level, the score of 4 to 5 has been kept at medium level and the score of 6 to 7 has been kept at ‘high’ level evaluability.

Infants and young children: The MICS surveys suggest
that the probability of death and, severe stunting among
children of age below 5 has nearly halved between 2012
and 2019. Also, the early child development index has
seen a rise. However, there has been a rise in the
percentage of children with severe stunting in the period of
programme implementation. (ii) Mothers: Maternal
mortality ratio for Bangladesh has improved from 214
deaths per 100,000 live births to 173 deaths between 2014
and 2017. However, the birth rate of young mothers
between the age of 15 and 19 has not declined over the
period of programme implementation. (iii) Primary school
aged children: The net attendance ratio of primary school
children has improved between 2012 and 2019. However,
the gender parity index has reduced marginally. (iv)
Adolescent girls and women: 82% of adolescent girls and
women of age between 20 and 49 was practiced MHM in
2018. (v) The MICS 2019 survey shows that 93.9% of
women between 15 and 49 years of age reported
menstruating in the last 12 months and used menstrual
hygiene materials with a private place to wash and change
while at home. However, in secondary schools, the gender
parity ratio in secondary schools has declined from 1.3 in

Introduction to the project:
This interview is with reference to an end-line evaluation project. The overall objective of this project is to
evaluate the GoB-UNICEF Bangladesh Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Programme of Cooperation (2017-
2020). This programme directly contributes to the UNICEF Bangladesh Country Programme 2017-2020. WASH
programme is intended to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene situation at community level and institution
level (primary and secondary school, and health center) in Bangladesh. The evaluation findings may contribute
to the appropriate strategy design of the next country programme (2022 -2026).

Executive summary
Context of the Country Programme and background
In accordance with the seventh Five-Year Plan, the Sustainable development goals82 (SDG), the Gender Action
Plan 2018-2021 and the UNICEF Bangladesh Strategy Paper on Gender 2017-20 have designed gender-
focused interventions in the current GoB-UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation (CP) 2017-2021. This
report is an assessment of the inclusion of the gender aspects within the WASH sector of the overall country
programme. It intends to assess the gender-focused programming and initiatives undertaken to integrate
gender through responsive WASH systems. The results of this report will reflect on the success, progress, and
failures of the integration of gender programming and collate inputs for the next Country Programme 2022-
2026.
Objective of the assignment
WASH facilities are essential for both men and women to live a healthy and dignified life. However, the needs
of women and girls are different and in several areas more critical. Menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, and its
aftermaths and vulnerability to gender-based violence create unique WASH needs specific to gender and age.
Additionally, women take care of the WASH needs of their families, adding to the time burden and making the
need for responding to women’s needs and their perspectives and voices in WASH-related matters critical for
the sector. The objective of the assessment is to assess how the WASH programme has addressed the gender
inequalities relating to access and use of WASH services in Bangladesh. The assignment also seeks to
understand whether gender-responsive service delivery models have been developed and gender-sensitive
programming has been performed to ensure equity.
Approach and methodology for evaluation
The evaluation is being conducted as a part of the GoB-UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation (CP)
2017-2021 commissioned by UNICEF. Gender is one of the critical priorities of UNICEF. It supports the vision
of leaving no one behind. The overall approach of this evaluation has been gender-specific, to review the
magnitude to which the UNICEF Bangladesh Country Programme has addressed the issues of gender
inequality in WASH systems.
The methodology includes systematic analysis of the gender responsiveness of the policies, interventions, and
budgets. The information is sourced from both primary and secondary sources. The primary data has been
gathered through stakeholder consultations and survey data. The secondary data has been collected through
detailed secondary research and literature review. Some of the data sources referred to include Gender Action
Plan, 2017, Gender toolkit, 2018, SITAN, 2015, MICS (2012-13 and 2019), UNICEF Bangladesh-Country
Programme for 2017-2021, and UNICEF Bangladesh Gender Strategy Paper (2017-2020). The pandemic
prevailing from March 2020 required adjustment in approaching the stakeholders for collection of data and
information, and time.
Key findings
UNICEF, along with other government agencies, development partners and stakeholders, has engaged in
several rounds of consultations with the women population of Bangladesh and has considered their opinion in
selecting and designing appropriate programmes and interventions. This can be observed in the availability of
services like installation of water points as per the convenience of the women, gender-specific toilets,
improvements in the provision of MHM facilities, creation of WASH blocks, encouraging women entrepreneurs
in sanitation business and others. The gender-sensitive findings have been studied against the key indicators
and strategies outlined within the two key guiding documents focusing on gender equality, namely the UNICEF
Gender Action Plan 2018-2021 and the UNICEF Bangladesh Gender Strategy Paper 2017-2021. These
strategies include:
Strategy 1: Ensure gender-responsive design and implementation of key programmes
Strategy 2: Build institutional capacity on gender within UNICEF and of partners
82 SDG goal 5 advocates gender equality
January 2022
PwC 198
Strategy 3: Reinforce gender equality within the organization
Strategy 4: Position UNICEF as a strong gender-responsive organization within the national development
arena
Addressing the issues faced by the population of Bangladesh, especially women, form the crux of strategies
and programmes undertaken and implemented by UNICEF in Bangladesh. To ensure women participation in
WASH governance, women and adolescent girls are encouraged and put at the forefront of decision-making.
The programme has also put in substantial efforts on gender-inclusive strategies in schools and HCFs. Gender-
specific toilets, appropriate infrastructure, MHM corners and sanitation facilities, have been promoted. Different
types of need based arrangements and support infrastructure are provided, to households and communities
having people with disabilities. Awareness campaigns with the intent to educate women on water, sanitation
and hygiene management have been organized. In addition to women and adolescent girls, men and boys
have also been adequately addressed for equal access to WASH facilities. Women entrepreneurs are being
supported and encouraged in the sanitation marketing business to make the WASH programme gender-
transformative and socially inclusive at all levels.
By adopting the lifecycle approach, the programme focuses on the welfare of individuals of all age groups and
genders living in vulnerable communities like poor and hard-to-reach areas prone to climate change and natural
disasters, urban slums, living with disabilities, or infected, affected or at the risk of HIV/AIDS, as well as children
from ethnic and religious minorities. The programme has brought out considerable improvements in the health
and hygiene indicators for all age groups between 2012 and 2019 as per the MICS data.
The Government of Bangladesh introduced Gender responsive budgeting by mandating Ministries to provide
estimates of budget allocations prioritizing gender and equity issues. The allocations are prioritized, and action
areas are determined based on 14 criteria on gender equality. The WASH programme budgeting incorporates
the gender issues in policy advocacy, policy dialogue, partnership building and service delivery.
Gender inclusion has also been made an integral part of the WASH activities during emergencies and UNICEF
has played a critical role their response. During the Rohingya crisis, UNICEF ensured the provision of safely
managed drinking water, and gender segregated sanitation facilities, considering WASH services as a human
right. Furthermore, UNICEF as a sector lead, ensured the provision of education for refugee children through
the establishment of learning centres vocational and for adolescents through life skill programmes. During the
COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF developed guidelines and sector wide strategy documents for making people
aware about the safety protocols. Through provision of hygiene material like soap, bleaching powder,
sanitizers, and masks, the people in the poor and marginalized communities were equipped to stay safe during
the pandemic.
However, there is still scope for improvement, especially to cover the last mile. The marginalized communities
(poor, residents of hard to reach areas, etc.) still lack the access to safely managed WASH services. Collection
of water from long distances, due to the lack of access to water in premises poses health risks for women,
especially during pregnancy. Continuing to follow the principle of “No-one left behind”, by focusing on the
underserved may reduce the prevalent rich-poor gap. Greater emphasis could be laid on “progress with equity
and quality”. Access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene have implicit linkages with quality of
education, school dropouts and incidences of child or early marriages. Eradication of child marriage and
violence against children may have indirect impacts on the community. The existing norm in gender relation
and inequity of power between men and women should be transformed and in the WASH sector this can be
promoted through awareness and advocacy and engagement of more women in WASH programmes. Although
it is a challenge and the progress may be slow, changes will be apparent if there is an inclusiveness of women
in all spheres.
The WASH programme has been successful in creating awareness about gender and equity. At the district
level, small village committees constituting both male and female members have been formed. These members
are given proper training so that WASH practices and facilities can be maintained and sustained. Although the
programme has contributed to creating an environment that fosters equity and gender at the institutional level, it
can be further improved through the provision of repeated/refresher awareness trainings for the stakeholders to
help them to relearn and apply more effectively. Moving forward, women should be given continued focus on
O&M of WASH facilities with the LGI’s and the Government institutions. Greater emphasis should be given to
women for participating in planning, consultation and decision making at all levels.
Conclusions
January 2022
PwC 199
In Bangladesh, women have been facing various challenges with respect to WASH services at the community
level as well as the institutional level. The challenges, including the burden of collection of drinking water for the
household members, the lack of gender-segregated public sanitation infrastructure, and inadequate awareness
and access to MHM facilities, among others, have lasting impacts on women and their family members. The
analysis finds that the WASH programme has contributed considerably to the in addressing the existing gender
inequalities relating to access and use of WASH services in Bangladesh. The programme design and
implementation has been done to identify and address the WASH-related challenges of vulnerable
communities. In order to achieve the goals of “Leaving No One Behind”, proper protocols, screening, social
mapping, site location, community discussion and other grassroot-level consultations are conducted before
taking up any programme or strategy. The lifecycle approach ensures that the challenges faced by various
groups like Infants, Young Children, and their Mothers (neonatal mortality, lack of access to safe sanitation
spaces), Girls and Boys of Primary-School Age (lack of gender-equitable access to education and WASH
facilities), and Adolescents (lack of awareness about MHM among girls and boys, lack of gender-equitable
access to education and WASH facilities) are adequately addressed.
The programme has also facilitated participation of women in policy design and implementation. To ensure
women’s meaningful participation and leadership in WASH governance, women and adolescent girls are
encouraged and placed at the forefront of decision-making at the committee and community level so that their
voices can be heard. Various community-level groups entrusted with the task of creating awareness and
educating the masses are headed by women. Additionally, women entrepreneurs are encouraged, and
women's participation is prioritized in the sanitation marketing business, especially at the community level.
More women dealers and mechanics are being supported and motivated to join sanitation marketing ventures.
The evaluators also find that the programme has adopted gender responsive budgeting whereby the gender
issues in policy advocacy, policy dialogue, partnership building, and service delivery are incorporated. MIS
systems have been instituted to collect data on the functionality of the WASH assets. However, stakeholder
interactions brought to light that the current MIS are specialized to water systems and restricted to few
geographical areas. More exhaustive MIS systems may contribute to better WASH outcomes.
The analysis of the survey responses show that the programme shows that the programme has to increasing
the access to limited or basic water services, sanitation services and hygiene facilities in communities and
institutions. Secondly, the interventions aimed at increasing post-natal hygiene practices and provision of
menstrual hygiene management for women and adolescent girls has been largely successful. In terms of the
WASH in institutions, the programme has been instrumental in (i) reducing school dropouts (ii) improving
availability of gender segregated sanitation facilities in schools and HCFs, and (iii) increasing awareness
regarding menstrual hygiene management.
Lessons learned
A list of broad learnings from the analysis of the gender aspects of the WASH programme as provided below:
• UNICEF’s global experience and partnerships in the development sector has been critical in identifying and
upscaling effective interventions intended to target the marginalized communities.
• Encouraging women to participate in decision making processes, especially by promoting them to decision
making positions, has contributed to creating an environment for gender sensitive policy design and
implementation.
• Gender disaggregated data collection on the access to WASH facilities can ensure effective monitoring of
the programme and identifying gender-related gaps in implementation.
A brief SWOT of the gender related aspects of the current WASH programme is given in Table 44.

Recommendations
The recommendations of the report are segregated into strategic recommendations and operational
recommendations. A brief description of all recommendations has been given below.
❖ Develop adequate O&M investments for maintaining female sanitation facilities (Stakeholders:
DPHE, and other implementing agencies; Priority: Medium)- Proper provisions for O&M should be
developed to ensure that the female sanitation facilities are well maintained. Proper monitoring and
maintenance systems should be instituted for ensuring the functionality of the sanitation infrastructure.
❖ Gender sensitize communities through awareness campaigns on the importance of hygiene
(Stakeholder: UNICEF, DPHE; priority: Medium)- Promotional programmes may be used for bringing
about behavioural change around hygiene. Increased WASH programmes through media- radio,
television, mobile, where internet is available, applying gender lens could be used for gender
sensitization.
January 2022
PwC 201
❖ Develop institutional mechanisms for effective implementation of gender integration in the
WASH sector(Stakeholders: DPHE, UNICEF; Priority: Medium)- A dedicated budget and resources
may be allocated for taking up activities relating to gender equality, gender mainstreaming as well as
gender integration across both institutional and programme interventions.
❖ Develop proper mechanisms for the disposal of menstrual waste (Stakeholders: DPHE, UNICEF;
Priority: Medium)- Female driven consultation methods should be opted to improve female beneficiary
involvement and buy-in throughout the course of design and implementation of interventions. Proper
menstrual waste disposal methods should be piloted both at the community and institutional levels.
Awareness campaigns might be carried out to raise awareness regarding the health hazards and
environmental impacts of open burning or sanitation pads. Women headed businesses may be
encouraged to provide menstrual waste disposal services at the community and institutional levels.
Additionally, a systematic study can be conducted on MHM waste management incorporating the
environmental context.
Introduction
The joint GoB UNICEF WASH Programme has been designed in line with the UNICEF Country Programme
Document (2017-2021) to ensure the provision of quality water, sanitation, and health (WASH) facilities for all,
at community and institution level in 15 targeted districts (Figure 25). The programme aims at providing the
services to the vulnerable groups (the poorest and most marginalized, especially women, children, and people
with disabilities) and to the vulnerable areas (rural areas, urban slums and hard to reach areas). This chapter
provides a brief overview of gender in the WASH programme and the rationale of the gender analysis.
Gender in WASH programme (2017-2021)
The male-centric nature of the society of Bangladesh is the reason Figure 25: 15 targeted districts of GoB-
for the deep-rooted gender disparities prevalent in the country. As UNICEF WASH programme
in most countries, the power structures at the grass-root levels of
the Bangladeshi communities are concentrated towards men and
boys. To ensure the protection of human rights for all, the CPD
(2017-2021) incorporates global frameworks including the SDGs,
CRC and CEDAW, UNICEF’s Global Strategic Plan and Gender
Action Plan, as well as Bangladesh’s UNDAF framework and the
7th FYP. The Gender Action Plan (GAP) published by UNICEF
provides a roadmap for gender-sensitive programming, to
integrate gender issues at the levels of programme design,
implementation, and outcome evaluation. However, the core
challenges with respect to equality in social value, rights,
responsibilities, and opportunities continue to plague Bangladesh.
In Bangladesh, the roles and responsibility of women have been
rigid. For instance, at the community level, a large proportion of
women engage in water collection. At the institutional level,
primary and secondary schools often lack the most basic WASH
facilities, like gender-segregated toilets equipped with MHM. Lack
of adequate sanitation facilities lead to girl school dropout and
early marriages.
Strengthening of national and sub-national capacities, including
building systems that enhance effectiveness and sustainability,
and addressing issues on equity and gender, lie at the core of UNICEF’s results. Supporting gender-responsive
and disaster-resilient service delivery models, for children of primary school age, have consistently been the
topmost priority of UNICEF. UNICEF also works towards promoting investments to make sure that the rights of
adolescents are addressed and the necessity for adolescent-friendly health services and counselling in public
health facilities in targeted districts, non-formal and vocational training and learning, and education in life-skills
is emphasized.83

PwC 202
As per insights derived from the Key Informant Interviews (KII), UNICEF has successfully implemented gender-
specific strategies and programmes. Considering the overall programme strategy and design, the gender
barriers and opportunities have been identified and gender sensitive WASH interventions have been designed.
In addition to that, learnings from previous country programmes have also been considered. UNICEF, along
with other government agencies, development partners and stakeholders, engaged in various rounds of
consultations with the women population of Bangladesh and considered their opinions in choosing appropriate
programmes and interventions.
Interaction with one of the gender parity respondents during the KII’s has revealed that UNICEF executes
gender-sensitive programming. This is done by collecting and analyzing gender-disaggregated data and
involving women in the decision-making process. Women are encouraged to come forward for decision-making
at the committee-level, CBO’s or groups, head WATSAN committees, and participate in community discussions
to identify gaps and challenges with regards to gender-responsive service delivery. Sufficient awareness has
been raised and issues faced by girls with respect to hygiene and MHM facilities are have been addressed.
Disability issues are also being successfully looked after, especially at the community level. Different types of
arrangements and support infrastructure are provided, as per the disability, to households and communities.
Few examples of such arrangements include disabled-friendly latrines and toilets both at household and
community level and water points in the vicinity of the households having people with disabilities.
However, even though gender issues have been addressed through gender responsive programming, pocket
areas like hard-to-reach, urban slums, rural, CHT (Chittagong Hill Tracts), Char and a few other areas remain
as areas of opportunity. These areas are either underserved or unserved and need attention. Lags in provision
of WASH services clearly indicate that there is a further scope of improvement for gender transformative
issues. Even though UNICEF has been successful in gender-sensitive programming and addressing women
and children in their programmes, there is still a vast scope for improvement and development as per the SDG
goals.
Rationale for gender analysis for this evaluation study
The GoB-UNICEF WASH programme aims at improving quality, equitable access, and sustainability of WASH
services. This includes increasing coverage of safely managed water services aligning with SDG 6.1 and safely
managed sanitation and hygiene services aligning with SDG 6.2 at the community and the institutional level.84
In the universal access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), the programme incorporates the
differentiated needs of men and women. Women specific needs include increasing access to quality education,
gender separated sanitation with MHM facilities in communities and institutions, reducing school dropouts, early
marriage, and early pregnancies, and challenging the social norms regarding the role of women in the society.
WASH, Gender and Bangladesh
Roles and responsibility
(i) The job of collection of water is primarily carried out by women
(ii) Lack of water sources in the household premises, the time spent by women in collecting water is high.
Carrying out economically productive activities is restricted
WASH needs and accessibility
(i) Lack of access to gender segregated WASH facilities is a challenge.
(ii) Lack of MHM facilities leads to school absenteeism and dropout
Institutions, laws and policies
(i) Bangladesh has committed human rights by incorporating frameworks such as SDGs, CRC and CEDAW,
UNICEF’s Global Strategic Plan and Gender Action Plan. However, vulnerable groups including women,
people with disabilities, residents of hard to reach (HRT) areas, urban slums, etc. are yet underserved
UNICEF’s gender action plan (2018-2021) focuses on two core themes to prioritize gender equality. The first
theme involves the addressal of the gaps that create an environment of gender-based discrimination for girls
and boys from birth through adolescence. The second theme is based on the care and support required by
children irrespective of age or gender. Figure 26 provides a brief overview of the gender inclusive strategies
adopted by the WASH programme to achieve gender sensitive programme design and implementation.

Policy frameworks for Gender
Several key policy frameworks have played a vital role in guiding the gender framework and influencing the
need for integration in the programme and interventions designed for Bangladesh. A brief on the crucial gender
policies and standards that have influenced the framework has been mentioned as follows.85
❖ 7th Five-year plan of Bangladesh 2016-2020
The gender aspect of the 7th Five Year Plan focuses on establishing ‘a country where men and women will
have equal opportunities and rights, and women will be recognized as equal contributors in economic, social
and political development’. In the WASH sector, the 7th FYP plans to provide Safe drinking water all rural and
urban population and increase the proportion of urban population and rural population with access to sanitary
latrines to 100% and 90% respectively.
❖ Sustainable development goal (SDG 6)
SDG was adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015. It offers a shared blueprint for peace and
prosperity for people and the planet now and into the future. There is a total of 17 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs), of which goal 6 is to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for
all. The SDGs are a critical policy framework which influences the planning of the Five-Year Plan documents
and other key aspects of policy frameworks driving the country programme.
❖ Women Development policy of Bangladesh, 2010
One of the major steps taken towards Gender has been the decision of the government to sanction the National
Women Development Policy (NWDP) in 2011. The policy intends to create a society where men and women
will have equal opportunities and will enjoy all fundamental rights on an equal basis.
❖ UNICEF Gender Action Plan (2018-2021)
UNICEF’s role in addressing the gender gap in the country is primarily defined by the Gender Action Plan 2018-
2021. The GAP elaborates the gender programmatic results from the Strategic Plan (2018-2021) and specifies
85 Evaluation Report UNICEF – Bangladesh Country Programme of Cooperation (CP) 2017-2021 UNICEF Regional Office for South Asia – PwC India

indicators that will help UNICEF better integrate and strengthen gender across its institutional systems and
strategies. GAP draws specific indicators from the five goals of the Strategic Plan.
❖ UNICEF Strategic Plan for 2018-2021
One of the cross-cutting priorities identified in the ongoing country programme is Gender mainstreaming and
gender equality. Evidence shows that the well-being of children is most dependent on women’s survival,
protection, and opportunity. Building on UNICEF’s Gender Action Plan 2018–2021 to enhance system-wide
efforts to promote gender equality, the Strategic Plan integrates gender in each of its five identified goal areas

For the primary analysis, the evaluators carry out consultation with various stakeholders using KIIs, and
surveys- community survey, online survey, and U-poll survey. The primary analysis provides specific insights
into the functioning of the WASH programme and its impacts on the communities and institutions with focus on
crosscutting issues including gender equity.
Key informant interviews
The evaluators carried out online interviews with key informants, including the UNICEF Chief (WASH),
Fundraising Specialist, C4D specialist, Gender Programme Officer, WASH Gender Focal Point, UNICEF
WASH Programme Officers, officials from GoB at national and sub-national levels (including officials from
several GoB ministries), and representatives from partner institutions. These interactions help in gaining
insights into the policy framing and implementation aspects of the WASH programme. In doing so, a wide
variety of questions are asked in the background of WASH programming. The respondents are requested to
elaborate on local ownership, demand for services, positive social norms, exit strategies and mechanisms for
replication and scaling up, with respect to gender equity.
Gender-specific questions in KIIs:
❖ How well are equity and human rights related issues analyzed and addressed within the programming
strategies of the WASH programme?
❖ How well are gender related barriers and opportunities analyzed and addressed within the programming
strategies of the WASH programme?
❖ How successful has the programme been in creating an enabling environment for sustaining results and
influencing institutional awareness about gender and equity at all levels? Have the relevant stakeholders
been adequately trained, and their capacities strengthened to ensure effective service provision?
Community Survey
The community survey collected data from two groups of respondents. The group A respondents comprised of
the women in the community, adult members of the households having mothers with children between age of 0-
5, and adult members of the households having mothers with adolescent girls. The group B respondents
comprised of members of WASH committee or Water Point committee, community leaders, schoolteachers or
principals, and the staff from HCFs. All the respondents of the community survey were beneficiaries of the
WASH programme and hence could provide their perspective on its implementation and outcomes.
Gender-specific questions in the Community Survey:
❖ What is the age and sex of the person who usually goes to this source to collect the water for your
household?
❖ Do you believe that the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene programmes’ special focus on gender has been
effective?
• Reducing school dropouts among adolescent girls

Online survey/U-poll
For understanding the perception of the community members and officials, the evaluation team conducts the
Online survey and the U-poll survey. The respondents of the online survey were the UNICEF implementing
partner NGOs, while the respondents of the U-poll survey are the selected community members. The
respondents of the U-poll survey are the beneficiaries of WASH programme, residents of the project areas and
are registered on UNICEF U-Poll portal.
Gender-specific questions in online questionnaire:
❖ To what extent has GoB-UNICEF’s WASH programme been effective in achieving the following outcomes?
• Reducing burden of water collection on women and girls
• Deceasing instances of child marriages
• Reducing school dropout rates of girls
• Improving menstrual hygiene management facilities at secondary schools
• Improving hygiene after childbirth
• Reducing violence against women and girls
Gender-specific questions in U-poll:
❖ Do you think the programme has been effective in the following areas in your community?
• Reduction in time taken to fetch water in communities.
• Reduction in adolescent girls dropping out of school.
Limitations of the evaluation
• Purposive sampling: Selection of respondents for the key informant interviews (KIIs) and surveys was
done in consultation with UNICEF Bangladesh. Interviews at sub-national level were covered in a randomly
sampled 30 Unions.
• Lack of gender disaggregated information on WASH access: The evaluators face challenges to find
gender-disaggregated data on the access and use of WASH facilities in Bangladesh. The analysis primarily
uses the information collected through primary (qualitative and quantitative) surveys to infer how the
programme addressed gender issues.
• Generalizability: The results from this report are restricted to the survey districts, and not to entire
Bangladesh. However, the data sourced from JMP applies to entire Bangladesh.
• COVID-19 challenges: In-person interviews were not done due to the pandemic. For community data
collection, Covid protocols (social distancing, Govt., and UN protocols) were strictly followed during the
survey.
Key findings
This section analyzes the performance of the WASH sector in Bangladesh in achieving gender equity. The
analysis is based on detailed review of the secondary data sources and the qualitative analysis of the primary
surveys.
Gender Integration in GOB-UNICEF WASH Programme
In this section, the evaluators assess whether the GoB-UNICEF WASH programme has adequately integrated
gender related issues in the programme design and implementation.
Gender integration in programme design
January 2022
PwC 208
Summary of key findings
- The lifecycle approach along with gender sensitive policy design has been ensured in the programme design to
facilitate gender segregated WASH service delivery in communities and institutions
- The programme has been designed to adopt the Gender Responsive Budgeting (GRB), to ensure that allocations
are prioritized, and action areas are determined based on the principle of gender equality.
- Monitoring and Progress systems are instituted for collecting reliable data on the WASH infrastructure, with the
objective of identifying and resolving systematic faults in the quality-of-service delivery.
- The programme has made institutional commitment to gender responsiveness through collection, analyses and
reporting of gender segregated data on WASH access and quality.
Tackling gender-based barriers is one of the topmost priorities of GOB-UNICEF WASH Programme. In addition
to reaching the most marginalized and excluded sections of the society, gender-responsive and disaster-
resilient service delivery models have been developed to continue improving the quality and resilience of life.
The issues faced by the population of the country, especially women, form the crux of strategies
and programmes undertaken and implemented by UNICEF. It works on achieving the goals of “Leaving No One
Behind”. Proper protocols, screening, social mapping, site location, community discussion and other grassroot-
level consultations are completed before taking up any programme or strategy. Through the online survey, the
evaluation team analyzed the relevance of the WASH programme in addressing the key WASH issues facing
Bangladesh.
As one of the major cross cutting issues, gender is an assimilated indicator that is embedded into majority of
the programming implemented across the different outcome areas. The following section highlights the findings
on successful gender integration put together in programme design and initiatives of the UNICEF.
Gender sensitive policy design by lifecycle groups
Outcome 1: Infants, Young Children, and their Mother
The major areas of gender-focused interventions in this segment include gender-responsive WASH facilities to
reduce the gaps in access to safe sanitation spaces, reducing neonatal mortality, and spreading
awareness among young mothers through counselling. UNICEF has put in substantial efforts on gender-
inclusive strategies in education, especially in secondary education and alternative learning programs.
Accelerated Sanitation, Water for All (ASWA) and Drinking Water Safety for the Well-Being of Women and
Children in Bangladesh are some of the examples of targeted interventions with gender-inclusive components.
Outcome 2: Girls and Boys of Primary-School Age
The major priority area under this segment includes gender-equitable access to education, and WASH
facilities. Different gender-transformative water and sanitation programmes have been formulated to address
the unseen reasons of gender inequality and power dynamics. Gender-segregated toilets, including appropriate
infrastructure and sanitation facilities, have been promoted. This acted as a pull factor both for girls attending
schools and female teachers. Availability of female teachers in schools, in addition to access to gender-
sensitive sanitation facilities, act as stimulus in higher attendance of girl students and lesser number of school
dropouts. Additionally, under the WASH in schools sub-programme, hygiene corners equipped with MHM
facilities were established. Teachers were given training to enable them to provide support to girls, with respect
to menstrual hygiene, when needed during the school time.
Outcome 3: Adolescents as Agents of Change
A number of gender-focused interventions have been designed in the WASH programme with the help of
Adolescent Health Corners, Adolescent Clubs as well as Primary Education Development Programmes that
intend to improve the quality of learning both at secondary and higher education levels. In addition to that, a
National Adolescent Health Strategy is in place to help shape and promote menstrual hygiene management in
the country. Interventions have been taken up to help women manage their menstruation hygienically through
the provision of menstrual products, water, and soap, both at primary and secondary schools as well as
community level. Frequent awareness campaigns and sessions are conducted to educate women on the needs
and availability of sanitation and hygiene facilities in their respective communities.
January 2022
PwC 209
Not only adolescent girls, but boys, as well, are considered for the provision of equal access to WASH facilities.
UNICEF also looks forward to engaging men and boys to deal with the gender stereotypical issues in its WASH
interventions. Gender-sensitive programming is performed by analyzing gender-disaggregated data and
relevant insights on gender gaps are derived from such
considerations. These considerations are then taken into account for

awareness and educating the masses are headed by women. Also,
- Key informant, Chittagong division
to make sure that enough emphasis is given to gender issues in
WASH activities, UNICEF, with the help of their field offices located
at the divisional level, have developed some pointers that should be
mandatorily followed while implementing and developing different
projects.
Women entrepreneurs are encouraged, and women's participation is prioritized in the sanitation marketing
business, especially at the community level. More women dealers and mechanics are being supported and
motivated to join sanitation marketing ventures. Small community groups and para-centers are set up in order
to look after the provision as well as operation and maintenance of WASH services in various regions. As per
one of the respondents from the Chittagong Division, all the community groups established in this region are
headed by female presidents or vice presidents. The para workers who work under the para centers and are
responsible for the provision of WASH activities (major component), along with health, nutrition, education,
child protection and others, are mostly (80%) women. These women or para workers are community members
who receive required training and then, disseminate their learning to others in the community.
Gender Responsive Budgeting (GRB)
Through the GAP 2018-2021, UNICEF mandates gender responsive budgeting (GRB) in programme design.
GoB introduced GRB by mandating Ministries to provide estimates of budget allocations prioritizing gender and
equity issues. The allocations are prioritized, and action areas are determined based on 14 criteria on gender
equality. 87 The WASH programme budgeting incorporates the gender issues in policy advocacy, policy
dialogue, partnership building and service delivery.
Monitoring and Progress system
The WASH programme incorporates the establishment of Management Information Systems (MIS) for
collecting reliable data on the WASH assets. Collection and analysis of the data can enable the policy makers
to find systematic faults in the quality-of-service delivery. Real time identification and resolution of the faults in
the WASH infrastructure can contribute to reducing the burden on the users, especially women. For instance,
MIS in water distribution systems can collect and transmit data on water characteristics such as level, pressure,
and quality of water. Reduction in faults and breakdowns of water points, running water in sanitation and
hygiene infrastructure provide support to women with respect to their differentiated WASH needs.
DPHE has developed an MIS with the technical assistance of UNICEF that can track government water points
and tube wells through geocoding. However, stakeholder interactions brought to light that the current MIS are
specialized to water systems and restricted to few geographical areas. More exhaustive MIS systems may
contribute to better WASH outcomes.
Institutional commitment to gender responsiveness
Through the gender strategy paper (2017-2020), the UNICEF sets specific strategies to the gender sensitive
policy making. This consists of collecting gender segregated data for key variables, gender responsive policy
design and review, and gender responsive data analysis and documentation. Through annual research
assessment modules (RAM), UNICEF has collected and reported detailed information on WASH indicators.
This consists of detailed information on how UNICEF contributed to achieving access to safe water systems,
sanitation and hygiene facilities in communities, schools and HCFs. Additionally, the RAM reports UNICEF’s
work in Cox’s Bazaar in response to Rohingya crises, hard to reach areas, and coastal areas of Bangladesh.

PwC 210
Finally, the data reports provision of gender segregated toilets, MHM facilities, safe spaces for women and
other gender-related indicators.
UNICEF has also published various annual reports to track the WASH sector development, both individually
and in partnership with the GoB and other stakeholders. UNICEF published the WASHBAT report in 2018,
which is an analysis of the bottlenecks in the WASH sector. The WASHBAT identifies and provides
recommendations to resolve gaps in the implementation of the WASH programme. The MICS survey provides
data on 29 SDG indicators relating to women and children88. The MICS data provides a benchmark for policy
design in the development sector of Bangladesh. Other key reports include the situation analysis, WASH field
notes, etc. that act as key sources of information of the WASH sector in Bangladesh.
Local market study on MHM products
The local market survey on MHM products acts as a critical source of information on the demand and supply
situation of the MHM markets.
UNICEF conducted a local market survey for the MHM products in the disadvantaged communities of Bangladesh to
study the affordability and the availability of MHM products in various local markets. Additionally, the survey conducted
interviews of adolescent girls to find whether the preferred or desired using the MHM products. The study provides a
detailed situation analysis about the menstrual hygiene management and puts stress on awareness building for reducing
the social stigma around menstruation, ensuring an increased access to good quality sanitary pads at lower prices,
ensuring environment friendly, and safe disposal mechanisms.
Source: Local market study on MHM products, 2021
The progress on the gender equality is measured through the Gender Equality Marker (GEM). The gender
equality market is a tool that measures the extent to which a programme has been instrumental in achieving
g ender equality. The GEM framework rates each component (output) of a programme between 0 and 3, where
the rating increases with increase in the importance placed by the programme on gender equality. The scale
not only includes women and girls, but also the disadvantaged boys.
UNICEF has been making efforts to make their WASH programme gender-responsive and socially inclusive.
Various government stakeholders (Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, Ministry of Health, Ministry of
Education, DPHE, Local Governments, and non-government stakeholders (National and International NGO’s,
IDE Bangladesh, private companies like Unilever etc.) have also been engaged to reduce the existing
inequality and provide effective, efficient, and sustainable WASH services across all genders and to everybody
in the country irrespective of geographies.
Gender integration in programme results
Summary of key findings
- WASH in schools programme has contributed to a rise in the access to limited or basic water services, sanitation
services and hygiene facilities.
- WASH programme’s focus on gender has been successful in the reduction in school dropouts, increasing post-natal
hygiene practices and provision of menstrual hygiene management for women and adolescent girls.
- Performance of the WASH programme has been particularly good in terms of WASH in school, with a reduction in
school dropouts.
Integration of gender-responsive and socially inclusive strategies in WASH programme have played a
considerable role in yielding positive results. Regular consultations and advocacy with people especially
women have helped in the formulation of strategies and programmes that have demonstrated better results
over time. In this evaluation, reduction in the time required to collect water, increase in access and awareness
of MHM, and access to gender segregated toilets in schools and healthcare facilities, are the indicators that
have been covered specifically in context of gender. The results are evaluated at the community as well as the
institutional (schools and healthcare facilities) level.
Installation of water points
88 MICS data
January 2022
PwC 211
About 7.6% of the poorest spend over 1 hour collecting water, while only 4.3% of the richest spent more than 1
hour for same. In addition to that, 81.8% poorest were found exposed to arsenic contaminated drinking water
below WHO standard89. Often women have to travel long distances ranging from 30 minutes to 3 hours in order
to collect safe water for their daily needs. There exist enormous gender inequalities concerning water collection
based on socio-economic status, age, and sex besides people with disabilities. As a result of this, women and
girls lose a lot of time in domestic work and miss school. Walking long distances with heavy vessels of water
may pose health hazards, especially for pregnant women. Women and girls (and transgender people, people
with disabilities, and children) are at greater risk with respect to water collection activities. A key informant
responded that the choice of the water point is also decided based on the women’s perception of safety.
Installation of water points closer to the household reduces the susceptibility towards gender-based violence.
WASH in schools programme covers the provision of safe water sources in the school premises. Figure 29
shows a considerable and consistent rise in the access to limited or basic water services. A key respondent
mentioned that awareness about the health benefits of having clean drinking water are conveyed to parents by
school going children as a result of the WASH programme. WASH in school programme hence contributes to
creating a generation of aware and responsible citizens regarding their need for safe WASH facilities.

Provision of gender segregated toilets, hygiene management and MHM facilities
MHM corners have been installed at the school level to provide girls with basic menstrual hygiene products.
This has encouraged more girls to attend school, continue with their studies as well as manage psychological
stress effectively. Child-focused hygiene promotion programmes have been formulated wherein women and
girls of reproductive age have been provided with essential hygiene management items to maintain their
menstrual hygiene better, in a safe, private, and dignified manner. Awareness-raising, hygiene promotion,
MHM sessions are being conducted and supported at the community level. Not only women but boys and men
National MHM strategy, 2020
UNICEF supported Government of Bangladesh to develop National MHM strategy. The national MHM strategy
document is a comprehensive plan to achieve awareness of menstrual hygiene management and “safe and dignified
menstruation” for all girls and women. The 8-strategy roadmap is designed with the objective to create an enabling
environment to foster the increased affordability, access and coverage of safe MHM facilities, private sector investments
in the MHM market, and coordination between various relevant stakeholders to address gaps in service provision. The
document addresses the key gaps in the MHM accessibility including lack of knowledge, inadequate disposal systems,
rigid social norms, lack of health services, and inadequate of policies and guidelines concerning MHM and gender
issues.
The National MHM strategy makes plans to provide WASH facilities to serve the differentiated needs of each gender.
This includes achieving betterment in the quality and quantity of gender segregated WASH services, MHM equipped
sanitation, and needs based services for people with disabilities, residents of flood prone areas, etc. Alongside, the
strategy document specifies the need to ensure proper use and maintenance of the facilities.
One of the most important provisions of the strategy document is to ensure safe disposal of the MHM facilities. These
provisions include the delivery of washable pedal bins with lids in all toilets at the households and institutional level. The
menstrual waste would be collected from the bins to a district level incinerator through a network of transport vans. The
financing of the bins would be borne by the institution, and that of the waste transport would be borne by the ward and
district municipality.

are encouraged to join these sessions. Conducting sessions with community people where mostly women are
seen to actively participate have brought to light instances where women make decisions on building hygienic
toilets or remodelling their existing toilets into hygienic ones at the household level. Women are seen to
mobilize and encourage their husbands for the construction of proper WASH facilities at individual homes.
With respect to the provision of safe and gender segregated sanitation in schools, 79.2% of the online survey
respondents agree to the relevance of the programme in addressing the pre-existent gaps. The analysis of the
community survey suggests that the WASH programme’s special focus on gender has been successful, as
shown in Figure 30, with respect to the reduction in school dropouts, increasing post-natal hygiene practices
and provision of menstrual hygiene management for women and adolescent girls.

Gender integration in other social interventions
Under the “Arsenic Safe Union Project,” women are engaged in social mapping intervention, community
mobilization, and others. Women are also appointed and actively involved as drillers while constructing tube
wells and as caretakers for operation and maintenance activities. This empowers women to become
independent and enable them to generate means of livelihood for their families. Along with that, a large number
of trained volunteers that include both adolescents and women are working to put off the left-over incidences of
open defecation in rural areas and villages90. Women in their neighbourhood are advocating for better
sanitation, hygiene promotion and safe water.
UNICEF spread awareness about gender issues, and WASH through the Meena game. In 2019, the game was
downloaded by more than 2.5 million people91. The digital reach of UNICEF increased considerably. Followers
to UNICEF’s Facebook page increased to 7.5 million in 201992. The platform is used by UNICEF for bringing
out behavioural change and mobilizing resources towards the vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.
WASH issues of the urban areas
As per a study on Rural-Urban Migration in Urban Bangladesh93, the population of people living in urban slums
is expected to double by 2025. A huge number of migrants from different rural areas of the country take shelter
in urban slums, footpaths, railway stations, and other places. Rural-urban migration is one of the major factors
for the increase in the urban population of the country. According to the Child Well Being Survey 2016 and
MICS, the situation of children living in urban slums is considerably poorer than in rural Bangladesh. In addition
to that, rapid urbanization is observed to impose complex impacts on social behaviour of people94.
Provision of safe WASH facilities is a challenge in urban slums. The residents of the urban slums often do not
hold tenancy rights, resulting in their inability to get access to legal water connections. The water supplied
through the illegal connections is more costly in terms of monetary payments and health risks. Dhaka WASA,
with assistance of UNICEF and partner NGOs conducted a successful intervention in the Korail LIC. NGOs
were made guarantors on the bill payments, on which the water connections were granted. Additionally,

sanitation facilities including sewerage trucks were provided with direct assistance of UNICEF. The Korail LIC
intervention can be scaled up to other LICs. The urban slums are typically characterized by lack of access to
safe water, gender segregated toilets, lack of fecal sludge management and lack of hygiene.
Some of the interventions taken up by UNICEF to manage Rural-Urban Migration have been mentioned as
follows95.
❖ UNICEF upholds the Government for enhanced planning and resource management. It also participates in
urban programming for children like identifying and addressing the needs at different stages of a child’s life,
preventing child marriage and child labor, assisting government in modelling adolescent empowerment
packages, imparting awareness on hygiene management, handwashing with soap, latrine usage and
maintenance, menstrual hygiene, and various others. To sum up, urban programming brings together all
the aspects – from health to social policy.
❖ It advocates different government ministries like the Ministry of Women's and Children's Affairs, Ministry of
Health, the Ministry of Local Government Rural Development and Cooperatives, the Directorate of
Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE), etc., to make sure proper investments in polices are made
relating to urban children.
Helping local governments in their capacity building efforts is one of the major components of UNICEF, that
according to them will lead to successful Child Friendly City initiatives. This is done by creating practical
approaches for consolidating gender equity and child rights in urban policymaking, supporting data systems
and diverse studies for monitoring and planning purpose and by identifying gender barriers with respect to
safety and limited access to quality services.
Figure 30 shows considerable success in the WASH performance of Bangladesh while focusing on the
effectiveness of the programme in providing gender sensitive service delivery. The data suggests that the
performance of the WASH programme has been particularly good in terms of WASH in school, with a reduction
in school dropouts.
Human rights based approach (HRBA)
The WASH programme has adopted the HRBA in the programme design and implementation. By adopting
UNICEF’s lifecycle approach, outcomes drawn under the WASH programme are aligned with reduction in infant
mortality, stunting, and wasting, increased awareness regarding menstrual health among young boys and girls,
and increased use of MHM products by women and adolescent girls, etc. The programme has also spread
awareness among communities as the right-holders, regarding their rights to access to safe water and
sanitation facilities, and how the duty bearers are accountable to provide the WASH services. The WASH
programme encourages interaction with the community members to improve service delivery. The inclusion of
the communities in the programme implementation has contributed to widespread awareness of the rights of
each citizen.
Through the establishment of the policy support branch, the Department of Public Health Engineering has been
strengthening the policy formulation and implementation. Institutional arrangements are made to make the duty
bearers accountable. Adequate monitoring systems are in place to monitor the progress achievements of the
duty bearers. Regular monitoring of the performance of various components of the WASH programme
contributes to increase in efficiency and accountability.
Institutional integration of gender in GOB-UNICEF WASH Programme
In this section, we discuss the integration of the gender related issues at the institutional level of the WASH
programme. The WASH programme focuses on schools and HCFs concerning the provision of gender
separated WASH infrastructure and access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities.
Institutional integration of gender in Schools
Summary of key findings
The analyses of survey respondents show that the programme has been instrumental in (i) the improvement in
availability of gender segregated sanitation facilities in school (ii) increasing awareness regarding menstrual hygiene
management (iii) increasing the proportion of primary and secondary schools having gender segregated toilets
95 https://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/en/children-cities%C2%A0

The weaknesses surrounding the education system are influenced by vulnerabilities such as gender
discrimination, socioeconomic status, and living in hard-to-reach areas. As per the SITAN Report 2015, 6.2
million children are out-of-school, with the majority of them belonging to urban slums and hard-to-reach areas,
amongst which 1.1 million are of the age of pre-primary school goers and 2.6 million of primary school age.
The reasons for school absenteeism and dropouts differ between boys and girls. Often the reason for boys is
child labour.96 On the other hand, lack of MHM facilities and gender segregated toilets are a few reasons for the
low attendance97 and school dropout of adolescent schoolgirls.98 Furthermore, these girls are susceptible to
child marriages or early marriages. According to MICS 2012-13, the percentage of women between the age of
20 and 24, who were married or in a union at the time of survey was 34% and 33% in 2019. 99 The average age
of marriage for young married women, who were in their 20s in 2015, was 16.6 years. 100,101 The WASH in
school programme’s aim to reach safe WASH services to all schools, may contribute to reduced school
dropouts of adolescent girls resulting in lower child marriages or early marriages.
The analysis of the primary data suggests that the WASH programme has largely been successful in
addressing gender issues. 98% of the community survey respondents believe that the programme was
successful in increasing school attendance of the students. Also, 94.4% of the community survey respondents
opine that the programme has been successful in ensuring a reduction in the incidences of child marriage.
Figure 31 presents the responses of survey respondents on the effectiveness of the WASH programme in
addressing the gender related issues. 89.5% of the community survey respondents believe that there has been
an increase in the availability of gender segregated sanitation facilities in school. Also, 97.7% of the community
survey respondents believe that the programme has been instrumental in increasing awareness regarding
menstrual hygiene management. Also, online survey respondents believe that the proportion of primary and
secondary schools having gender segregated toilets has increased over the period of programming. These
results have been triangulated with key informant interviews that highlighted that the WASH programming has
focused on gender issues in communities as well as institutions.

Summary of key findings
- WASHBAT report identifies the gap in implementation of WASH policies, which are caused due to a lack in policies,
set national standards, evidence generation and equity in service
- Analysis of survey data suggests that there has been an increase in gender segregated sanitation facilities in health
centers However, a recurring theme in the key informant interviews is the need to have a greater number of toilets
and water stations placed in the HCFs for doctors, nurses, patients, and their families.
The theory of change aims at reducing neonatal mortality and childhood stunting that is prevalent in
Bangladesh. The strengthening to HCFs is essential for improving overall health of the society. Discrimination
at different stages of female lifecycle enhances health disparities. Such biases include gender-biased sex
selection to lower nutrition intake and the neglect of health care needs of girls. With the view to provide an
overall advancement in WASH facilities, UNICEF has opted for a life-cycle approach that begins from pregnant
women to adolescent girls and boys thereby augmenting the role of healthcare facilities and medical care
offices. Healthcare facilities in Bangladesh are neither gender-sensitive nor geared towards girl’s health
services. Fewer number of childbirths are attended by skilled birth attendants especially in slums, backward
and hard-to-reach areas thereby leading to maternal deaths of women. As per the Annual Gender Report by
UNICEF 2017, only 42% of the births in the country are attended by skilled birth attendants102. Studies show
that the practice of handwashing in birth attendants and mothers can increase the rate of survival of newborns
by up to 44%.103
WASH in HCFs is concerned with WASH access and waste management in hospitals, clinics, and health
centers. However, the WASHBAT report identifies the gap in implementation of WASH policies, which are
caused due to a lack in policies, set national standards, evidence generation and equity in service.104 According
to NHBS 2018, only 28% HCFs made more than one drinking water point available for general use. The JMP
data suggests that the WASH coverage with respect to limited or basic facilities are better in the urban areas
than the rural area, and in the privately owned HCFs than the government owned HCFs. However, there is a
lack of data and evidence generation on the availability of gender segregated toilets in HCFs.
Analysis of the community survey suggests that the 73.9% of the respondents believe that there has been an
increase in gender segregated sanitation facilities in health centers. 90.6% of the online survey respondents
agree that the interventions in the WASH programme are appropriate to ensure an enhanced access to WASH
facility in health centers. However, a recurring theme in the key informant interviews is the need to have a
greater number of toilets and water stations placed in the HCFs for doctors, nurses, patients, and their families.
Institutional integration of gender in emergencies
Gender has been one of the major cross-cutting issues in disaster management along with children, senior
citizens (aged over 60 years) and people with disabilities.105 Uncontrollable and exogenous events such as
conflicts, natural disasters and other related crisis situations have adverse impacts on girls and, men as well as
women. The women population is more prone to risks and victimization in such cases as they tend to be less
aware of the ways of protecting themselves.106
The most familiar emergency in Bangladeshis that of the Rohingyas, who fled into Bangladesh and have a
majority of women and girl population (~52%). UNICEF works to offer assistance to local partners to build safe
spaces for girls in the camp area in addition to the distribution of dignity kits to women and adolescent girls.
With respect to UNICEF’s emergency response to the Rohingya refugee crisis, around 42 adolescent girls
residing in the areas of Kutupalong, Balukhali, Leda, and Shamlapur makeshift camps have gained from the
skills-building initiatives on MHM and have been given supplies of disposable sanitary napkins made in sanitary
marts with machinery run by trained adolescent girls. Currently, these girls are capable of producing and
marketing these sanitary products on their own107. With respect to access to WASH facilities, 250,000
refugees in camps and 119,990 people from host communities were provided access to safe drinking
water and sanitation services.

As per UNICEF Annual Report 2019, UNICEF and its partners have reached out to 274,000 children in refugee
camps and host communities with educational facilities108. Adolescent girls and boys are provided with lessons
on life skills including gender-based violence. In 2017, 43,920 community people (12,000 community-based
child protection committee members and 31,920 parents) have undergone child development training with
included lessons on gender-based violence prevention and response109.
Strategy-wise programme achievements
Strategy 1: Ensure gender-responsive design and implementation of key programmes110
❖ Technological innovations like smart handpumps are used to measure, monitor, and improve rural water
security by means of ICT’s along with engineering of water quality improvements through nanotechnology
and biosensors to provide safe water to all111. With respect to the provision of improved and equitable
service coverage achievements such as making use of vulnerability risk assessments, pro-poor water point
selection criteria and Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping for the provision of safe water in the
arsenic contaminated Upazilas has helped the WASH sector target the most vulnerable households and
provide improved WASH services to women and girls.
❖ A four-year Sanitation Marketing Project has been successfully completed with an achievement of 184%.
The project saw a total of 165,000 households purchasing their own improved toilets via local
entrepreneurs. Effective advocacy with government and other private players resulted in national up-
scaling for sanitation marketing thereby leading to no exposure of people to arsenic-contaminated water.
❖ Providing favorable learning environments, especially for girls through the provision of gender-segregated
toilets and MHM facilities in schools. The interventions are also applicable to the needs of the schools and
has witnessed active involvement of School Management Committees in planning and provision of WASH
services to ensure community acceptance in addition to gender and cultural sensitivities112.
❖ UNICEF has successfully concluded multi-year research on managed aquifer reserves. This has addressed
the challenges of climate-change-induced saltwater intrusion, collection of water from ponds and other
water sources (mostly done by women) and provision of safe drinking water for expecting women.

Interventions
❖ As of 2019, UNICEF upheld and sensitized stakeholders and partners on menstrual hygiene management
(MHM) by celebrating MHM day at both national and sub-national level. 13,000 people and more including
policymakers and adolescents were informed on MHM. A total of 1,564 people that included teachers,
school Management Committee members and students were trained to upgrade their knowledge on
hygiene promotion, including MHM.
❖ With the financial and technical assistance provided by UNICEF, 31,786 students of 277 secondary
schools obtained access to safe drinking water and hygienic toilets (gender-segregated toilets with toilets
for women having proper MHM facilities). UNICEF also assisted in the construction of WASH blocks with
facilities such as the provision of safe drinking water and group handwashing devices in 100 secondary
schools. WASH blocks in 84 schools have also been repaired with the installation of a new set of
handwashing devices.
❖ Hygiene corners have been set up and one female teacher from each of the schools was trained on good
hygiene practices with the view to imparting knowledge to the students. Around 185 School Management
Committees have also obtained training on operation and maintenance of WASH blocks.
❖ UNICEF worked to guarantee that Rohingya children in the Cox’ Bazar region have access to appropriate
WASH facilities in learning centers. Moreover, in the year 2019 it supported 110 learning centers in camps
to guarantee access to WASH services and suitable hygiene messages, which helped approximately
11,000 children. It also backed 43 schools in the host community with water supply, sanitation facilities
including MHM, hand washing facilities and promotion of hygiene behavior, which benefitted 19,533
students.
❖ UNICEF offers technical assistance through emergency and coordination staffs and provides supplies like
tarpaulins, pallets, boots, emergency recreation kits, hygiene, and dignity kits, AWD, periphery kits,
renewable AWD periphery kits, drugs, containers, fuel cost for vehicles, warehouse, and storage place
maintenance cost and various others.
Strategy 2: Build institutional capacity on gender within UNICEF and of partners113
❖ As of 2019, UNICEF sustained its collaboration with government, NGOs, and academia to scale up WASH
models providing improved water sources to about 195,598 people (127,138 women, 68,460 men) and
basic sanitation services 362,898 people (187,664 women, 175,234 men).

❖ UNICEF backed the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives to conduct
WASH-BAT (Bottleneck Analysis) with the objective of finding the gaps and the necessary steps needed to
meet SDG WASH targets in 2018. The WASH-BAT national report was drafted based on various national
and sub-national inputs and was submitted to the government for approval. The national WASH-BAT
dissemination was conducted on 12 December 2019.
❖ As of 2019, UNICEF offered technical support to the Directorate of Primary Education for designing the
WASH components of the PEDP4, launched in July 2018. It effectively upheld the “Three Star Approach”
and informed the education sector through consultative gatherings and workshops to increase the provision
of WASH in primary schools. The approach was devised to further increase the effectiveness of hygiene
behavior change programmes, safeguarding that healthy habits are incorporated, practiced, and
incorporated into daily school routines. As of 2020, an Annual Work Plan GoB-UNICEF was supposed to
begin to start with the implementation of the Three Star Approach at 72 schools (30 primary and 42
secondary).
❖ UNICEF launched the U-Report Platform in collaboration with the Ministry of Disaster Management for the
children affected by the emergencies. The platform acts as an urban joint needs assessment tool to
support better emergency preparedness and response. UNICEF Guidance on Communicating with
Children in Emergencies was included in the Government’s standing order on disaster response to
strengthen child-centric disaster preparedness and response.
Strategy 3: Reinforce gender equality within the organization
UNICEF has made considerable changes in staff structure for increasing participation of women in the
workforce. Training sessions and webinars are organized for capacity building of women staff. However, a
recurring theme in the KIIs was the need for increasing representation, and responsibilities of women within the
organization.
❖ Increase in collaborations with gender-based organizations and policy centers working primarily on gender
responsive evidence generation.
❖ Proactive policies for ensuring higher share of women in the staff.
Strategy 4: Position UNICEF as a strong gender-responsive organization within the national development
arena
❖ As per insights derived from KII’s, UNICEF is a major supporter of GoB and plays a major role in
complementing the government by testing approaches, innovating as well as creating new examples that
can be examined further to provide better services in the sector. It is firmly positioned to lead supporting
focus on national policy and design strategy interventions underlining gender mainstreaming across cross-
cutting themes and issues.
In addition to the aforementioned interventions, associations between sectoral approaches addressing multi-
dimensional inequalities that shape gender vulnerabilities have been strengthened. UNICEF has also acted on
strengthening within key management structures. Sexual Reproductive Health Education for adolescents has
been integrated into the secondary education system. The need to address menstrual hygiene management
(MHM) in the country led to a multi-sectoral National Strategy on MHM, with effect from 2020. On the occasion
of Global Handwashing Day on 15 October 2019, around 7.5 million students attending 59,631 schools
practiced correct handwashing using only resources available at the schools. Similarly, the Menstrual Hygiene
Management (MHM) day contributed to advocacy for the inclusion of age appropriate MHM content in primary
and secondary education.
Conclusions
This section is a summary of the findings from the gender analysis of the GoB-UNICEF WASH programme.
The broad objective of this analysis was to assess how the WASH programme has addressed the gender
inequalities relating to access and use of WASH services in Bangladesh and to understand whether gender-
responsive service delivery models have been developed and gender-sensitive programming has been
performed to ensure equity. The evaluators follow a Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) framework in
the evaluation to test the extent of incorporation of gender in programme design and results, and the
institutional commitments to social inclusion. This has been done through the analysis of the policies, gender
sensitive budgeting, monitoring systems and overall institutional commitments.
The evaluators adopted a mixed methods approach in this study. Firstly, a thorough literature survey has been
conducted of past reports, research papers and other policy documents. Secondly, secondary data analysis
January 2022
PwC 219
has been conducted using the MICS data. Finally, the evaluators have conducted primary data analysis
through three surveys, namely, Community Survey, Online Survey, U-poll report, along with Key informant
Interviews (KIIs) of programme stakeholders.
In Bangladesh, women have been facing various challenges with respect to WASH services at the community
level as well as the institutional level. The challenges, including the burden of collection of drinking water for the
household members, the lack of gender-segregated public sanitation infrastructure, and inadequate awareness
and access to MHM facilities, among others, have lasting impacts on women and their family members. The
analysis finds that the WASH programme has contributed considerably to the in addressing the existing gender
inequalities relating to access and use of WASH services in Bangladesh. The programme design and
implementation has been done to identify and address the WASH-related challenges of vulnerable
communities. In order to achieve the goals of “Leaving No One Behind”, proper protocols, screening, social
mapping, site location, community discussion and other grassroot-level consultations are conducted before
taking up any programme or strategy. The lifecycle approach ensures that the challenges faced by various
groups like Infants, Young Children, and their Mothers (neonatal mortality, lack of access to safe sanitation
spaces), Girls and Boys of Primary-School Age (lack of gender-equitable access to education and WASH
facilities), and Adolescents (lack of awareness about MHM among girls and boys, lack of gender-equitable
access to education and WASH facilities) are adequately addressed.
The programme has also facilitated participation of women in policy design and implementation. To ensure
women’s meaningful participation and leadership in WASH governance, women and adolescent girls are
encouraged and placed at the forefront of decision-making at the committee and community level so that their
voices can be heard. Various community-level groups entrusted with the task of creating awareness and
educating the masses are headed by women. Additionally, women entrepreneurs are encouraged, and
women's participation is prioritized in the sanitation marketing business, especially at the community level.
More women dealers and mechanics are being supported and motivated to join sanitation marketing ventures.
The evaluators also find that the programme has adopted gender responsive budgeting whereby the gender
issues in policy advocacy, policy dialogue, partnership building, and service delivery are incorporated. MIS
systems have been instituted to collect data on the functionality of the WASH assets. However, stakeholder
interactions brought to light that the current MIS are specialized to water systems and restricted to few
geographical areas. More exhaustive MIS systems may contribute to better WASH outcomes.
The analysis of the survey responses show that the programme shows that the programme has to increasing
the access to limited or basic water services, sanitation services and hygiene facilities in communities and
institutions. Secondly, the interventions aimed at increasing post-natal hygiene practices and provision of
menstrual hygiene management for women and adolescent girls has been largely successful. In terms of the
WASH in institutions, the programme has been instrumental in (i) reducing school dropouts (ii) improving
availability of gender segregated sanitation facilities in schools and HCFs, and (iii) increasing awareness
regarding menstrual hygiene management.
Lessons learned
In this section the evaluators list the broad lessons learned in the conduction of the evaluation. Further, an
analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) has been included.
Broad lessons learned
• UNICEF’s global experience and partnerships in the development sector have been critical in identifying
and upscaling effective interventions intended to target the marginalized communities. UNICEF’s strategy
to align with partners with predefined goals contributes to minimizing duplication of efforts, adding value to
the programme implementation, and providing sustainable outcomes.
• Encouraging women to participate in decision making processes, especially by promoting them to decision
making positions, has contributed to creating an environment for gender sensitive policy design and
implementation.
• Gender segregated data collection on the access to WASH facilities can ensure effective monitoring of the
programme and identifying gender-related gaps in implementation. Gender segregated data is currently
unavailable for comparing the pre-intervention and post-intervention access to safe WASH facilities that
align with SDG 6.1 and SDG 6.2. Evidence generation enables tracking of key indicators and bridging
bottlenecks identified in the process of analyzing the information.

Recommendations
Strategic recommendations
Under strategic recommendations, provisions that facilitate complete strengthening of gender integration in
addition to driving gender mainstreaming have been listed. Some of them are enumerated as follows.
❖ Develop adequate O&M investments for maintaining female sanitation facilities (Stakeholders:
DPHE, and other implementing agencies; Priority: Medium)
Female toilets even though available are often inaccessible or unusable. Hand-washing facilities, even
though available, often lack basic provisions such as soap or clean water. Proper provisions for O&M
January 2022
PwC 221
should be developed for WASH infrastructure. DPHE and implementing agencies should monitor and
maintain these services. The common water points and WASH blocks should also be maintained by
community-based organizations. A dedicated budget should be sustained for O&M activities. Issues such
as unwillingness to contribute to the tariff system by the citizens also pose challenges to O&M and
sustainability aspects and should be efficiently tracked.
❖ Gender sensitize communities through awareness campaigns on the importance of hygiene
(Stakeholder: UNICEF, DPHE; priority: Medium)
Socioeconomic reasons, norms and beliefs are the major reasons for gender disparities at the community
level. Engaging men and boys to address gender stereotyping and WASH-related issues is equally
important. The programme can further be improved by raising awareness on the importance of hygiene and
induce behavioural change among the communities. Additionally, the provision of gender segregated and
safe WASH services along with training on correct use of the infrastructure may help in improving
sustainability.
The programme can be more proactive, structured and balanced to achieve equity. Promotional
programmes with the use of IT are now a useful tool for bringing change in the mindset of the communities.
Increased WASH programmes through media- radio, television, mobile, where internet is available,
applying gender lens is a proposition to re-invent the wheel of gender sensitivity. All stakeholders in the
community should be addressed equally irrespective of gender, education, age, and class. Only if all
sectors of the community become aware of WASH will there be a balanced participation of women and
men. Rewards or incentive can be offered for inclusion of greater number of women participants in WASH.
Operational Recommendations
Under operational recommendations, provisions that support the accomplishments of the strategic
recommendations and directly influence the present institutional and programmatic bottlenecks in the system
have been listed. Some of them are enumerated as follows.
❖ Develop institutional mechanisms for effective implementation of gender integration (Stakeholders:
DPHE, UNICEF; Priority: Medium)
• A dedicated budget and resources should be allocated for taking up activities relating to gender equality,
gender mainstreaming as well as gender integration across both institutional and programme interventions.
• Promoting cross-sectional trainings such as Gender and Child-Protection, Gender and Climate Change,
Gender and Nutrition, etc.
• Equity in provision of water supply and sanitation should be done in a more structured and gender-
responsive way. CPD targets on access and use of WASH services can be segregated by gender. Also,
the target achievement status may be tracked yearly, bottlenecks can be identified, analyzed, and
addressed.
❖ Develop proper mechanisms for the disposal of menstrual waste (Stakeholders: DPHE, UNICEF;
Priority: Medium)
Female driven consultation methods should be opted to improve female beneficiary involvement and buy-in
throughout the course of design and implementation of interventions. Proper menstrual waste disposal
methods should be piloted both at the community and institutional levels. Awareness campaigns might be
carried out to raise awareness regarding the health hazards and environmental impacts of open burning or
sanitation pads. Women headed businesses may be encouraged to provide menstrual waste disposal
services at the community and institutional levels. Additionally, a systematic study can be conducted on
MHM waste management incorporating the environmental context.

8.16. Value for money (VFM) report
Executive summary
Overview
Bangladesh has achieved remarkable progress in the WASH sector in the last decade. But still about one in
every ten households lack access to arsenic contamination free water and about one third of the population do
not have access to improved sanitation. Only 64.4 per cent of the population have access to improved
sanitation facilities114 which are not shared. Moreover, about 18 per cent of the households use water with over
10 ppb Arsenic concentration and in last few years this has exposed a large section of the population with no
alternative safe water supply115.
GoB has adopted the Sector Development Plan (SDP – 2011-2025) to address the operational and technical
challenges in the WASH sector. A multi-party partnership including government, non-government
organizations, private sectors and agencies was envisaged to represent all stakeholders from the WASH sector
including the policy makers.
Budget allocations to the WASH sector has been steadily increasing over the last five years both in nominal
terms and as a share of national budget in Bangladesh. However, domestic budget remains the primary source
of the WASH sector financing, given the presence of limited number of donors in the WASH sector in
Bangladesh. In order to enhance effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability there is a need to develop and
expand financing mechanisms in the sector.
Methodology
The Value for Money (VFM) analysis for the evaluation is based on a standard logical results chain framework
(DFID). This analysis can be put into a typical WASH results-based chain, along with the six dimensions of
economy, efficiency, cost-efficiency, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability as shown in Figure 32.
Figure 32: WASH Results chain for VFM analysis
The analysis carried out by the evaluators consists of quantitative and qualitative analyzes. A thorough analysis
of the WASH budgets through qualitative analysis incorporates ratios such as the performance ratio, budget
consumption ratio, performance to expenditure ratio, and unit cost analysis. The findings from the quantitative
analysis are triangulated using qualitative studies including literature review, field visits, and stakeholder
consultations.
Challenges
Consultations with stakeholders in the WASH sector suggest that the access to water and sanitation facilities
vary between rich and poor. There are also geographical and gender-based disparities. The residents of areas
such as HTRs, urban slums, etc. have inadequate access to WASH services. On the other hand, gender
segregated sanitation facilities, awareness about MHM and access to MHM facilities is challenge. Moreover,
due to the lack of access to water in premises in majority of the households, women bear the burden of

collection of drinking water, making them vulnerable to health risks, especially during pregnancy. To address
the equity challenges, government of Bangladesh has adopted the Annual Development Programmes (ADP) by
prioritizing funding to arsenic prone, hilly areas and other hard-to-reach areas and providing subsidies as well
as a dedicated WASH budget allocation for rural and urban poor. Despite all these efforts, there are
geographical inequalities in terms of WASH budget allocation. 70% of people in Bangladesh reside in the rural
regions, including climate vulnerable areas. However, WASH budget allocation in the urban areas has been
relatively higher compared with rural areas116.
Overview of key findings
Given the challenges and financial limitations there is a need to carry out a VFM analysis to understand the
effectiveness, efficiency and cost-efficiency of the WASH programme. Given below some of the key findings of
the analysis.
• The analysis suggests that the programme interventions to equip basic WASH facilities at HCF needs
to be reviewed. About 4% of the target was achieved for an additional number of health centers
equipped with basic WASH facilities in 2020, as a result of UNICEF's direct support, however, budget
consumption for the same was 90%. The data also suggests that the actual expenditure per unit cost is
approximately 24 times higher than the planned expenditure per unit cost in 2020.
• In terms of the indicator ‘additional number of people with access to safely managed sanitation117
facilities in line with SDG 6.2 as a result of UNICEF direct support’, the achievement was 46% higher
than target number of people envisaged for 2020. Data on technical details can be collected to identify
the drivers of VFM.
• 5.6% of target was achieved for number of primary schools with basic WASH facilities according to
national standard118 in 2020. The target achievement for the secondary school for the same indicator
has been 44%
Lessons learned
Following are the lessons learned regarding designing and reporting programme activities and results.
• The VFM Indicators should be clearly defined for all outputs, assumed outcomes and sustain
outcomes, and should be summarized in UNICEF Progress Reports (RAM) and MIS data
• Even with the existence of an MIS system, the data that tracks usage and O&M of sanitation facilities
on sustained outcomes is also limited.
• Data on expenditure was only reported in categories of outcomes. The data needs to be allocated to
the activities by making assumptions on what type of inputs was actually included in each category.
Recommendations
In this subsection, the evaluators have briefly discussed the strategic and operation recommendations based
on the qualitative data collected through key informant interviews at national and sub-national.

• It is important to include sustainability as an additional layer of analysis in
the VFM framework. However, in the present VFM analysis, VFM data on
sustainability was not available.
• A dedicated MIS may be set up to collect expenditures on a regular basis by
type of outputs. This would be crucial to track and manage expenditures
and more efficiently conduct VFM analysis in the future.
Introduction
In this section, the evaluation team presents the rationale for conducting VFM analysis and methodology. The
methodology describes the six dimensions, namely, efficiency, cost-efficiency, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness
and sustainability for the calculation of VFM indicators.
Rationale for VFM for this evaluation study
Value for money (VFM) analysis is built with the objective of analyzing the effectiveness and efficiency with
which resources are used, in achieving the primary, secondary and tertiary goals of a project. The optimal
allocation and utilization of the available resources while achieving an objective is set as an end goal rather
than mere completion of the project. In the Joint GoB-UNICEF WASH Programme evaluation, the VFM analysis
uses a wide set of indicators to evaluate the efficiency in programme implementation. Further, it presents the
on-ground challenges impairing the effectiveness of the programme along with recommendations for filling the
identified gaps. The following study would not only be useful for the programme implementors within and
outside the government, but also to the financers and donors or the WASH programme.
Institutions responsible for implementation of the WASH programme
The Local Government Division (LGD) under Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and
Cooperatives (MoLGRDC) is the key agency responsible for the WASH sector. The main implementing
agencies under LGD are the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) and Water and Sewerage
Authorities (WASA) which have been established in five major metropolitan centers, namely, Dhaka,
Chattagram, Khulna and Rajshahi. The WASAs and City Corporations are responsible for supply of drinking
water in the urban areas.
The GoB-UNICEF WASH programme primarily aimed at providing sustainable supply of clean drinking water,
improved sanitation, and hygiene facilities for all residents in the 15 target districts of Bangladesh. Through the
programme documents, the focus was set on the economically and socially distressed households, disabled
population, and geographically and climatically affected areas, with special attention to the gender equity
issues. The VFM analysis would study the budgetary allocation, utilization as well as the status of
achievements of the predefined goals, to find whether the WASH programme was effective in achieving the
goals and efficient in achieving minimal exhaustion of available resources. The interest of the Government in

the success of the WASH programme was reflected in the consistent increase in yearly budgetary allocations
(Figure 33). In the period of 6 years, the WASH budget was increased from 34 billion takas to 68 billion takas.
However, concerns are risen over the equitable distribution on the allocated resources (UNICEF, PPRC,
WaterAid, 2018).

The analysis of the sub-sectors shows a reduction in allocation for sanitation and fecal sludge management
(FSM) between FY 2017 and FY 2018. Spatial disaggregation shows that the allocations for char lands, hill
areas and coastal areas have been very low in the 2016 and 2017 fiscal year. However, significant increases in
the budgets have been made in FY 2018 (see Table 1), to enhance the service delivery in these hard-to-reach
areas. In the urban areas, the Dhaka city corporation attracts majority of the WASH budget (81% to total metro
city allocation in 2018), while the allocation to Rajshahi, Comilla, Rangpur, Khulna, Gazipur and Barisal is zero
in 2018-19 fiscal year (UNICEF, PPRC, WaterAid, 2018).

The 7th five-year plan provided targets for development expenditures to be made from 2016 to 2020
(Government of Bangladesh, 2020). The outlook of the plan was to develop the Local Government Institutions
(LGIs), by investing heavily (16650 crore takas in FY 2017). The actualization of the development expenditure
between 2017 and 2021 ranged from 75% of targeted amount in FY 2017 to 105% in FY 2018. With respect to
Chittagong Hill Tracts (achievement of target in 3 out of 5 years) and Rural Development Cooperatives
(achievement of target in 4 out of 5 years), the picture is more satisfactory. Further, there have been consistent
increases in the development expenditures, which finance the WASH programme, in all three subsectors. In the
8th FYP, the GoB plans for fiscal decentralization to strengthen the lower governments, by increasing the
expenditure (revenues) shares of the LGIs to total expenditures (revenues) of the government (Government of
Bangladesh, 2020).

The preceding analysis presents a need for evaluating the efficiency, cost efficiency and operational
sustainability of the WASH programme. The underutilization of the budget clubbed with the achievement of all
the predefined goals indicates cost efficiency. However, in the case of the WASH programme, some goals are
yet to be achieved. While Bangladesh achieved the ODF status successfully, the SDGs require the use of
improved safely managed sanitation facilities for all, which would protect ground water from e-coli
contamination. Improved sanitation and hygiene are yet a challenge for Bangladesh. With respect to ensuring
support to the economically distressed populace, the allocation and utilization of WASH budgets presents
worry. The most vulnerable areas have lowest utilizations while also having lowest budget allocations. With the
given facts, there is a need for a thorough Value for Money analysis to understand the efficiency of the WASH
programme.
Methodology for VFM Analysis
The Value for Money (VFM) analysis for the evaluation is based on a standard logical results chain framework
(DFID). This analysis can be put into a typical WASH results-based chain, along with the six dimensions of
economy, efficiency, cost-efficiency, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and sustainability, as depicted in Figure
35.

PwC 227
Figure 35: WASH Results chain for VFM analysis120
The overall approach of the VFM analysis is depicted in Figure 36.
Figure 36: Overview of the VFM analysis approach
Quantitative approach
The performance ratio of the programme is ratio of targeted results and achieved results. It reflects efficiency in
planning and implementation as a good planning mechanism emphasizes on setting achievable targets and an
efficient implementation places focus on meeting the set targets. Likewise, budget consumption ratio, which is
the ratio of actual expenditure and allotted budget, shows efficiency in managing finances. Performance to
expenditure ratio is one of the key analysis in VFM study, as it combines financial performance and results and
generates evidence on the efficiency of the programme. In Table 49, the evaluators have provided the key
components of VFM analysis.

Findings of performance ratio, budget consumption ratio, and performance to expenditure ratio could be useful
for effective planning and budget allocation. As such, the VFM analysis has been an effective tool to keep track
of budget and results.
Qualitative approach
Qualitative analysis provides answers and narrative to the VFM analysis results and detailed understanding of
the programme’s objectives, implementation modalities, financing arrangements. The narrative of the
programme and main characteristics is built upon the initial consultation with programme implementation
stakeholders and secondary data sources. Key (secondary) data on the programme, objectives, main
components and activities have been collected from project documentation (CPD, Result Analysis Modules
(RAM)) and MIS data. Figure 37 depicts the evaluators overall approach to VFM analysis.
Figure 37: Overall approach to qualitative analysis
Limitations of the VFM analysis
In this section, the evaluators briefly discuss the limitations of the VFM analysis.
• The analysis is based on the outcome indicator wise expenditure data. However, it is not possible to
unequivocally allocate expenditures to different programme components and activities. Likewise, the
data is not disaggregated at division or district level, limiting the scope and accuracy of the VFM
analysis.
• Due to unavailability of disaggregated data on key inputs and sustained results, the analysis is limited
to efficiency and cost-efficiency. Moreover, the analysis on operational sustainability has been
undertaken using primary data collected through key informant interviews (KIIs), U-report poll and
community survey.

Summary of findings
• The programme has achieved the provision of more than targeted number of safely managed sanitation facilities at
the community level.
• Achievements for the outcome indicators institution level have been below the planned targets, while the
consumption of budgetary allocations has been considerable.
In this sub-section, the evaluators discuss how well the inputs have been converted into outcomes. In addition,
the evaluators have also explored the issues and implementation challenges related to the components or
other factors, independent of the ability of programme to deliver. The key indicators are as follows.
• Achievement of outcome indicators against planned targets
• Actual expenditure against allotted budget to achieve the results
• Performance to expenditure ratio of the programme outcome indicators
Figure 38 presents budget consumption ratio and performance ratio122 of UNICEF’s WASH indicators in 2020.
The programme achieved 46% more than its target in providing access to safely managed sanitation facilities to
people in programme areas in line with SDG 6.2. as a result of UNICEF's direct support in 2020, while using
only 90% of the planned budget. On the other hand, the programme achieved only 78% of its target for 2020 in
providing access to safely managed water resource in the programme areas. Performance ratio of the
programme for equipping HCFs with basic WASH facilities was 4% in 2020, while budget consumption was
90% for the same. 44% of the target was achieved for increasing the number of secondary schools with basic
WASH facilities according to national standard. On the other hand, only 6% of the target was achieved for the
same for primary schools in 2020.

installation of WASH blocks, safe drinking water, handwashing devices, and gender segregated sanitation
facilities.
UNICEF is developing and disseminating policies and national standards on MHM and WASH in primary
schools. Additionally, in order to ensure sustained O&M of WASH facilities, schools are encouraged to create a
fund to meet the expenses for soaps sanitary napkins and cleaning materials etc. However, one of the reasons
for low performance ratios for VFM indicators on policy advocacy could be due to some of the policies have
been developed but not rolled out at the time of VFM analysis. Given below some of the policies and
interventions that will be implemented in the coming years.
Development and dissemination of national standards and strategies in WASH
• In 2019, the guidelines for School Level Improvement Plan were revised and grants provided to 64,300
schools serving more than 15 million children. The revised guidelines give emphasis on safety, risk
reduction and WASH-in-Schools. The Three-Star Approach was implemented in 72 schools (30
primary and 42 secondary) through the strategy for WASH-in-Schools.
• The Three Star Approach with MHM in secondary schools, including resource mobilization, has been
the target for the WASH component of the secondary education programme in 2020.
• UNICEF is working towards T4D (Technology for Development), which will play a key role to improve
secondary schools’ WASH facilities and students’ hygiene behaviour in the coming years.
UNICEF is working on customizing an ‘EASY WASH’ device for secondary school students. EASY
WASH will help to monitor behaviour change among the students by measuring and reporting students’
handwashing frequency and patterns.
Water contamination remains a key challenge in Bangladesh especially in coastal regions such as Satkhira. It
is further aggravated due to frequent natural disasters, climate change and high salinity. Moreover,
underground water has become scarce for many districts. More research is required to make a transition from
the use of groundwater to surface water. Besides, innovative technology could be adopted where sensors will
be used to reduce wastage of water by automatically controlling the water tap.
The performance ratio for providing access to safely managed sanitation facilities to people in programme
areas in line with SDG 6.2. as a result of UNICEF's direct support has been over 100% in the last four years
(Figure 40). Whereas the same for safely managed water resources has declined from 134% in 2017 to 78% in
2020.

Although the budget consumption ratio
for equipping HCFs with basic WASH facilities is high, the performance could be improved. The performance
ratio marginally increased from 2% in 2017 to 4% in 2020, whereas the budget consumption ratio has been
more than 90% over the last four years (Figure 41).

WASH in institutions
“The healthcare centers lack proper sanitation facilities, there are no gender-disaggregated toilets” – a
programme stakeholder from Sunamganj district
As identified in the WASHBAT report 2018, there is limited data available on WASH facilities in health care
facilities (HCFs) across Bangladesh. Another key bottleneck identified by the report is lack of O&M
framework and skilled human resources for WASH. The report also emphasizes on the slow uptake of
sanitation facilities as well as poor hygiene practice by the staff in HCFs. The bottlenecks identified in the
report were triangulated through stakeholders’ consultations. Given below some of the issues and in
access to WASH at institution level.
• WASH in schools and Health Care Facilities affected especially when they are not functional
during climate emergencies such as storms, cyclones etc.
• One of the most critical factors identified by the programme stakeholders is “planning/budgeting
for WASH in schools and healthcare facilities by national and sub-national governments”. 60% of
district level DPHE officials emphasized on the importance of adequate planning and budgeting
for WASH in schools and healthcare facilities as the top factor that could influence the attainment
of programme results.
• As ownership of WASH facilities is not properly understood, it hinders funding. UNICEF needs to
develop a strategy for WASH in HCFs in collaboration with relevant government departments, and
WASH and health sector to solve this problem.
• Waste management in the HCFs to reduce the risks of medical waste contamination caused by
floods are effective and should be extended. This also helps to improve hospital management,
infrastructure, behaviour change and so on.
•
Figure 42 depicts the performance of the UNICEF’s interventions on equipping primary and secondary schools
with basic WASH facilities in Bangladesh. In 2017, the p rogramme managed to achieve 3.7% of its target
number of primary schools and it increased marginally to 5.6% in 2020, whereas the budget consumption has
increased from 7% in 2017 to 68.1% in 2020. On the other hand, in secondary schools the performance ratio
has been a lot better. In 2017, the programme achieved 68% its target secondary schools, however, it declined
to 44% in 2020. Consultations with programme stakeholders resonate the need for adequate planning and
budgeting for WASH in schools.

WASH in primary schools
With over 65,000 schools, the primary school network in Bangladesh is enormous. UNICEF has been
involved primarily in the soft aspects such as training and developing guidelines for WASH in schools.
Additionally, UNICEF has also provided hardware such as the installation of WASH blocks, safe drinking
water, handwashing devices, and gender segregated sanitation facilities.
Resource mobilization for WASH facilities in schools is one of the key challenges that has hampered
UNICEF’s expected progress in WASH in primary schools. Further, convincing donors that WASH in
primary schools is a requirement of a successful education Programme remains another challenge.
Moreover, there is no database that maintain data for all the schools including the WASH infrastructure
available in each school. The database would help in centrally managing the WASH in school programme.
Table 51 depicts the performance to expenditure ratio of the key indicators123. Performance to expenditure ratio
combines the financial performance with results and generates evidence for efficiency of the programme
implementation. As the performance ratio of the indicators increase, there is increment in the performance to
expenditure ratio of indicators. As can be seen, the programme has been able to achieve more than 100%
performance to expenditure ratio in providing access to safely managed sanitation facilities over the years.

Summary of findings
• Bulk of the actual expenditure of the programme has been utilized in providing safely managed water
and sanitation facilities at the community level.
• The per unit actual cost of providing access to safely managed sanitation facilities and safely managed
water resources has declined between 2017 and 2020.
In this sub-section, the evaluators present the distribution of actual expenditures as well as the variation
between actual and planned per unit cost of the results. However, it is not possible to calculate effectiveness of
indicators due to the lack of data on sustained actual outcomes in the form of a baseline or end line survey.
Figure 43 depicts the percentage of total expenditure of key VFM indicators in 2020. Bulk of the actual
expenditure of the programme has been utilized in providing additional number of people access to safely
managed water resource and sanitation facilities in programme areas. In 2017, it was 74% of the total
expenditure and it has increased to 84% in 2020 (Annexures).

Equity and operational sustainability of WASH
Summary of findings
• Analysis of the perception of the survey respondents show that the programme has allocated adequate
budget for sustenance of WASH facilities in schools and HCFs

sustainability of the WASH programme outcomes. There is no
specific baseline survey under the programme to establish
sustained actual outcomes. Therefore, the analysis on operational
sustainability is based on qualitative interviews with a few 17%
inferences from community survey and U-report poll.
The long-term sustainability of improved sanitation is one of the
major challenges in Bangladesh. While the access to improved
services has increased substantially, there are still significant
challenges to ensure safe, affordable, and sustainable services for 83%
all. Planning and budgeting for WASH in schools and healthcare
facilities by national and sub-national governments are important to

ensure sustainability. In addition to that, continuous monitoring and
follow-ups hold considerable significance.
The provision of WASH facilities in schools influences the health and learning outcomes of students. National
Hygiene Baseline Survey 2014 reveals that 57% of the secondary schools in Bangladesh lack separate
sanitation facilities for students. Those with separate toilets face practical issues such as non-functional toilets
or unusable toilet conditions due to lack of operation and maintenance of the facilities. Several studies have
shown that the lack of MHM-friendly facilities and support for schoolgirls and female teachers is an obstacle to
their full participation in school and therefore to quality education. The WASH programme has taken the
initiative to introduce gender-specific toilets, appropriate infrastructure, MHM corners and sanitation facilities in
schools. This has encouraged female students to attend school. Some schools have also appointed teacher to
provide necessary advice to the girls about their health during menstruation.

Figure 46: U-report poll results 83% of the community survey respondents said that
there is adequate budget for sustenance of WASH
facilities in schools and HCFs (Figure 45).
49% of the U-report poll respondents said that access
to toilets has improved. 32% agreed the same for
HCFs. On the other hand, only 24% of the respondent
agreed that Bangladesh has achieved the goal of
‘Sanitation for all’ (Figure 46).
Greater participation of women in different aspects of
WASH in HFC like designing, planning, operation and
maintenance (O&M) and others will help in improving
the equity and sustainability of the services.
WASH in communities is comparatively more
sustainable than schools and healthcare facilities due to the presence of small managing committees at the
community level who are responsible for the O&M. Field facilitators have a strong network amongst the
beneficiaries, local leaders and representatives, local elites and others who help and support each other to
ensure the sustainability of WASH infrastructure after completion of the projects. Field facilitators have also
been successful in convincing the community to have sustainable hygiene facilities. In some villages, Village
Development Committees (VDCs) are in place to assess sustainability of projects.
Conclusions
This section comprises of the summary of findings, along with strategic and operational recommendations. In
the end, the evaluators have also discussed the limitations of the VFM analysis.
Summary of findings
The VFM analysis findings showed that GoB-UNICEF programme is built on the objective of ensuring equity
responsive and resilient service delivery. In the days to come more efforts will be required for the purpose of
evidence generation activities at local level and policy dialogue and advocacy for regular and timely dispersal of
funds at the local level. For ease of reference, this section has been organized as per VFM components.
Efficiency
The VFM analysis suggests that 146% of target was achieved for additional number of people with access to
safely managed sanitation facilities in line with SDG 6.2 as a result of UNICEF direct support in 2020. However,
in HCFs, the performance ratio was only 4% in 2020. In addition, only 5.6% of target was achieved for number
of schools with basic WASH facilities according to national standard in 2020. The value for money can be
improved by collecting data on technical details so as to identify the drivers of VFM.
Cost-efficiency
There is about 24 times variation in actual expenditure per unit cost and planned expenditure per unit cost for
additional number of HCFs equipped with basic WASH facilities in 2020. Additionally, due to lack of data on
sustained outcome indicators, it was not possible to calculate effectiveness component of VFM analysis.
Regular data collection and monitoring of both output and outcome indicators should be scheduled and
continued to be collected over time and financial reporting can be improved with reconciling inputs with outputs
through activity codes by type of output.
Equity and operational sustainability of WASH
Equity and sustainability are important aspects incorporated in the WASH programme design and
implementation. 83% of the community survey respondents said that there is adequate budget for sustenance
of WASH facilities in schools and HCFs. In the way forward, planning and budgeting for WASH in schools and
January 2022

healthcare facilities by national and sub-national governments would continue to be important to ensure
sustainability.
Lessons learned
Following are the lessons learned regarding designing and reporting programme activities and results.
o The VFM Indicators should be clearly defined for all outputs, assumed outcomes and sustain
outcomes, and should be summarized in UNICEF Progress Reports (RAM) and MIS data
o Even with the existence of an MIS system, the data that tracks usage and O&M of sanitation facilities
on sustained outcomes is also limited.
o Data on expenditure was only reported in categories of outcomes. The data needs to be allocated to
the activities by making assumptions on what type of inputs was actually included in each category.
Strategic and operational recommendations
In this subsection, the evaluators have briefly discussed the strategic and operation recommendations based
on the qualitative data collected through key informant interviews at national and sub-national.
Table 53: Recommendations
S. No. Recommendations Stakeholder Priority
1. Maintain WASH budget heads at a disaggregated level to better monitor MoLGRDC, Medium
and evaluate the expenses for all WASH outputs and outcomes GoB,
UNICEF
• Conducting annual budget tracking study and national and sub-national
accounting for WASH sector specifically.
• Tracking budget at the programme component and activity level is crucial
to analyze programme output and outcome wise VFM at disaggregated
level.
• Informed decisions on funding requirements and utilization for ensuring
quality and sustainability of the WASH sector may be taken by the
Government as well as UNICEF, by tracking expenditures in the WASH
sector of all stakeholders124. This will help in better monitoring of efficient
and effective public spending in WASH sector
2 A dedicated tracking system may be employed to track and collect MoLGRDC, Medium
indicators on sustainability of programme outputs and GoB,
outcomes. UNICEF
• It is important to include sustainability as an additional layer of analysis in
the VFM framework. However, in the present VFM analysis, the data on
programme output wise sustainability was not available.
• A dedicated MIS may be set up to collect expenditures on a regular basis
by type of outputs. This would be crucial to track and manage expenditures
and more efficiently conduct VFM analysis in the future.
