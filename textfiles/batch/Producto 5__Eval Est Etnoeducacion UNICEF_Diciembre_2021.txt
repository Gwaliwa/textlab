Introduction
This evaluation analyzes the UNICEF ethnoeducation strategy in the departments of
Cauca and Chocó for the 2016-2019 period, with regard to the level of effectiveness, relevance and
Sustainability, as well as the degree of inclusion of the gender and equity approach. The evaluation is
carried out by the Temporary Union (UT) Isegoria - Ethnollano Foundation under contract made between the
months of August 2020 and November 2021.
The evaluation of the strategy is carried out after the completion of the implementation, under the intention
of UNICEF to establish what the achievements and learning have been, as well as the adjustments that are
necessary for their achievements to be sustainable and replicable, and establish the improvement needs.
Likewise, it is part of a request from the Quality Directorate of the Ministry of Education
National to UNICEF for accompaniment in ethnoeducation and peace processes. It is expected that
The results of the evaluation are used to support the national government in the definition of
Guidelines for the resignification of community educational projects in populations
Afro -descendants, given that the latest version produced by the Men data 2010 (terms of
Evaluation reference, UNICEF 2020).
The geographical scope of the evaluation is given at the level of the entire intervention of the strategy in the
Implementation municipalities in the departments of Cauca and Chocó. With relation to scope
Temporary, the evaluation carried out an analysis of the activities mainly in the period
between 2016 and 2019. The evaluation was framed in the policies and evaluation guides
of UNICEF and on the UNEG evaluation standards (UNICEF-AdapTed Uneg Quality Checklist for
EVALUATION TURS OF REFERENCE, 2017).
The evaluation methodology responded to the context caused by COVID-19, which represented the
Challenge of linking methodologies for obtaining distance information and through media
digital, together with the realization of instruments in person, with the respective protocols
of prevention and care dictated by the regulations from the respective health entities. The
Evaluation commitment was to cover all the actors participating in the implementation to
get a wide participatory process, seeking to generate a space of impartiality and amplitude
To cover the total understanding of the strategy from its stages, components and timeline
determined throughout the more than four years of implementation.
The evaluation contemplated a qualitative component with the application of application instruments
individual and group; a quantitative component with the completion of surveys; also covered a
Component of documentary analysis, and included the measurement of indices for each evaluation variable.
The evaluation carried out the respective systematization and analysis with the support of a software of
qualitative analysis and processing of quantitative information and then carry out the
triangulation of the analysis to obtain the findings of the evaluation and successively the conclusions
and respective recommendations.
According to the terms of reference of the evaluation, the UT of the

1. Context and presentation of the evaluation
To place the ethnoeducation strategy, the context variables are collected in this chapter
allow it to locate it at a particular moment, in a specific territorial location and in accordance with
to a specific situation that demarcates its implementation commitment. They are covered within this
apart: i) the central history of the historical regulatory framework of the
ethnoeducation; ii) the description of the strategy and its territorial context of development in the
Cauca and Chocó departments; and iii) the description and value chain of the strategy.
The ethnoeducation strategy is developed from a framework on ethnoeducation in the
country, also the historical context of the African -American population in this process and the situation and
Indicators on education in focused departments, determine the structuring of the
UNICEF strategy.
1.1. Context of ethnoeducation
1.1.1. Regulatory framework for ethnoeducation in Colombia
The integration of daily education practices carried out by ethnic groups with the
Institutional education strategies as well as the creation of pedagogical tools, materials
educational, curricula and specific concepts to each ethnic group, in the different scenarios in which
Students and the educational community participate, demarcate the expected context for a process
of ethnoeducation. The struggles that in this regard have undertaken the different ethnic groups for
Their recognition and self -determination have led to the normative frameworks for
ensure education based on ethnic particularities, which in countries like Colombia is
Recognize how ethnoeducation.
This education for ethnic groups in Colombia is included from the General Education Law
(Law 115 of 1994, Art 55). Particularly for Afro -Colombian ethnoeducation, the referent
main background is Law 70 of 1993, and a series of subsequent decrees that regulate it,
and that determine what related to the particular right to receive an education from their particular
way of life and history. While this trajectory is understood by some researchers also
From a historical process “that directs the ethnodevelopment of the Afro -Colombian people, with
foundation in their culture, recognizing the person and the community as a subject of affirmation and
Change, in interaction with other cultures (Garcés Aragón, 2008).
Ethnoeducation in Colombia has been defining during the last decades, in different laws
and decrees that have been granting their structure and operability. At a broad level, its possibility is
frames from the definition of the country as a multi -ethnic and multicultural nation, as consecrated
8
the 1991 Constitution, and the “right of peoples to decide the type of education they need to
His life plans ”, as professing the agreement 169 ILO (Law 21 of 1991) that Colombia ratifies.
According to Enciso (2004), since 1985 the ethnoeducation program was created in the
Ministry of National Education and particularly in the case of black populations, it was given
support for Afro -Colombian ethnoeducation and bilingual education projects (San Basilio de
Palenque), and the experimental Pilot/CEP centers as instances in charge in the regions. Without
However, from the normative field it is in 1991 that in the Constitution the foundational framework remains
which enables the most significant advance in this regard. While for some authors the Constitution
From 91 it went to the Afro -Colombian population plus a situation of "regulatory invisibility" (Castillo
The such, in Afro -Colombian Pedagogical Congress, Tumaco 2014), even so, is the achieved article
Transitory 55 (AT55) that gives possibility to subsequent law 70, which represents the central framework of the
which follows what we cover as Afro -Colombian ethnoeducation in the country.
The definition of ethnoeducation is consigned in the General Law of Education or Law 115 of 1993, of
the following manner in its article 55: Education is understood as ethnic groups that are offered
to groups or communities that integrate nationality and that have a culture, a language, some
its own and native traditions and fueros. This education must be linked to the environment, to
Productive process, to the social and cultural process, with due respect for their beliefs and traditions.
Ethnoeducation for the Afro -Colombian population has a history of
social and political movements since the 60s and 70s, but it is mostly delimited
from Law 70 of 1993, known as "Law of Black Communities" and that recognizes these
populations such as carriers of their own culture and their right to collective property and
Internal organization from community councils. From this milestone have been generated in the
last years a series of decrees that have delimited the different instances to ensure the
Provision of education from the concept of ethnoeducation. They stand out as centrals: the
Decree 804 of 1995 that regulates educational attention for ethnic groups; Decree 2249 of
1995 that forms the Pedagogical Commission of Black Communities to advise the Ministry of
National Education, and Decree 1122 of 1998 through which rules for development are issued
of the Chair of Afro -Colombian Studies.
While the process of claiming the rights of the Afro -Colombian population in the country dates back
to the decades after the abolition of slavery (1851), the specific regulatory framework traveled
From the framing of ethnoeducation (Decree 088 of 1976), the Constitution of 91 (1991) and the law
70 (1993), and that continue with a series of decrees that give their care to their own education as
A central right for the cultural survival of the Afro -Colombian population, frame the framework
of policy on which ethnoeducation is possible.
The regulatory framework that from 1970 and until now has developed in the country recreates the
way in which the frame has been nourishing and completing until different components such
as the general framework of law, the content of education, training processes and
administrative, territorial rights and even organizational and participation forms. He

1.1.2. Recent history of ethnoeducation
From the Ministry of National Education, ethnoeducation has been understood as a social process
permanent reflection and collective construction, through which ethnic groups strengthen their
autonomy within the framework of interculturality, allowing the internalization and production of values,
of knowledge and the development of skills and skills according to their cultural reality, expressed
In his life project (ethnoeducation: reality and hope of indigenous peoples and
Afro -Colombians, in Robinson, 2002. I National Forum of Afro -Colombian Ethnoeducation, Men). He
Ethnoeducation frame represents an opportunity for ethnic populations, which however
It continues to be a challenge in the face of real execution in many areas of the country, as well as against issues
related to quality, coverage and cultural relevance in certain regions of the country. The
cultural differences are precisely linked to particular contexts of local populations, by
both the concrete ways of transmitting knowledge to the new generations must be built
In that particular place and culture. All this represents an even greater process and challenge, in front of the
situation of pedagogical structures that have been built from Western culture and now
They need to be reviewed and adjusted, still achieving a formalization that maintains the quality of the
educational centers.
The Colombian regulatory framework recognizes the importance of guaranteeing an ethnic approach in the
educational processes, according to the worldview and cultural practices of the different peoples. TO
Despite this framework for normative possibilities, ethnoeducation still represents a marginal issue
in national educational policy. By 2002, central challenges of the
ethnoeducation to ethnic populations on issues such as: limitations in the formation of
ethnoeducators, in curricular design, and in the systematization and evaluation of experiences, and
Pedagogical Research (Robinson, in Men, 2002, in I National Ethnoeducation Forum
Afro -Colombian, Bogotá).
Other bottlenecks identified to explain the limited results of the implementation of
Ethnoeducation in the country are: i) Information about education conditions in
rural populations is scarce, dispersed and is not used for political decision making at level
national and local; (ii) ethnoeducation has no priority in educational policy and does not have a
sufficient development budget; (iii) There are no high quality ethnoeducation models
that make advances in the learning of children and adolescents of ethnic communities; (iv) Missing
of continuity in the training plans for ethnoeducadores; (v) Education Secretariats
They provide insufficient technical assistance to ethnoeducative schools; (VI) There are experiences
significant ethnoeducation that develop ethnoeducation educational models and materials
but they are not generalized and (VII) the vulnerability of the student population for being located in
areas of violence and high conflict (Brief Ethnoeducation UNICEF, 2019).
Ethnoeducation is a right and for the Afro -Colombian population implies the possibility of strengthening
own knowledge in the space of formal education and not only in community scenarios
own This path has led to more recent balance, such as the one performed in 2015 centered
in indicators and profiles of ethnoeducational institutions in Colombia from the Ministry of
National Education and UNICEF (Lanziano, 2016).
This study conducted in 2015 shows a problematic situation for students that
They belong to ethnic groups in the country. This is manifested in indicators such as low net coverage
10
(In secondary 40.31% in Chocó compared to 78.02% national, in secondary education 15.99% in Chocó and
42.8% national) or the quality synthetic index (ISC), whose national average at the secondary level
It stands at 5.27 while for indigenous groups it is 3.93 and for Afro -descendant groups
It is 3.89. In the case of secondary education, the national ISC is 5.89 while for indigenous peoples
It is 4.54 and for Afro villages it is 4.26 respectively.
These and other indicators highlight the still precarious situation of education in the territories
ethnic, and it is this situation and the particular contexts in the departments of Chocó and Cauca that
They lead to the ethnoeducation strategy, in search of “improving the capacities of the
Ministry of Education, certified territorial entities and local authorities in municipalities
prioritized, to offer learning environments adapted to the cultural particularities of girls,
indigenous and Afro -descendant children and adolescents in order to obtain better results
educational ”(terms of reference evaluation, 2020).
1.2. General context of the region
1.2.1. Cauca
Cauca Department
The northern region of Cauca is the largest subregion in extension of the department with 29%
of its population. It has a population of 417,065 inhabitants, of which 178,501 reside in the
Urban area and 238,251 in dispersed rural area, making it a predominantly rural region
(Rojas Marín, 2018). Specifically for prioritized municipalities, from census data
National Population and Housing 2018, Buenos Aires, Caloto, Miranda, Padilla, Santander de Quilichao
and Suárez, the population of girls and boys between 0 and 9 years is 32,4941 and adolescents between
10 and 19 are 36,6892. Of the total population of girls, boys and adolescents, 34.49% are
Recognize as Afro -Colombian (A), 31.04% as indigenous, 34.05% do not recognize any
Ethnicity
Regarding educational levels, according to the 2018 Census data of the DANE, in the
Department is observed an illiteracy rate3 of 8.28%, two points higher than average
National (6.06%). Of the prioritized municipalities in the department of Cauca, Buenos Aires counts
with the highest illiteracy rate (10.09%), even exceeding the national rate and
Departmental, followed by Suarez with a rate of 9.09% and caloto with 8.51%, while Miranda,
Padilla and Santander de Quilichao have illiteracy rates, close to the national average, and
Even lower, respectively these rates are 6.60%, 5.86%and 5.28%.
One of the main risks to education is the state of vulnerability to those who face
Children and adolescents being in a conflict zone, it is highlighted that, in the municipalities
Prioritized in the department of Cauca, they are reported in the Single Victims Registry (RUV) 3,4144
cases of girls, boys and adolescents victims of the armed conflict between 2015 and 2019, the
The greater number of cases registered in these municipalities is 1,514 in Suárez, the second place is Caloto
With 539, the third municipality is Santander de Quilichao with 495, followed by Buenos Aires 480 cases and

With lower number are Miranda and Padilla, respectively 336 and 50 cases. For this region, of the total
Girls, boys and adolescents The most affected group are boys between 6 and 11 years, as they represent
38.7%, followed by adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 with 37.7% and finally girls and girls
Children between 0 and 5 years with 23.6%.

1.2.2. Chocó
The department of Chocó has historically been a territory with social problems and
Economics associated with an extractivist economy, and Colombian armed conflict (Codhes, 2014).
This department is located diverse and rich in biodiversity and culture. It also has
a strategic position that connects the Caribbean and the Pacific which, added to the weak state presence
It has meant a strong interest of armed actors in this territory and has left sequels
important for populations that inhabit the department. All this considering that
There are inter -ethnic conflicts that, together with the rise in the armed conflict propitiated by groups
armed, constitute a degradation of war and the condition of human life in the
department.
Having these background and evaluate the situation of girls, boys and adolescents show that
It is remarkable that they are the main affected, since from 1985 to 2019 164,7045 are registered

Girls, boys and adolescents victims of the armed conflict in Chocó. This situation is even more acute
For the years between 2015 and 2019, when 36,165 cases were reported. When reviewing the victimizing fact
whereby children and adolescents are more violated in their rights is that it is the
Forced displacement with 86.83%; contradictory fact, because under Law 1098 of 20067 article
20, is one of the protection rights included to protect girls, boys and adolescents from the
Forced displacement, which must be guaranteed.

To these data, it is added that, in the department, the illiteracy rate is 15.72%8 for
people over 15, however, the school dropout rate is slightly lower than
the national average, being 2.8%. In the case of Nóvita, the last dropout rate recorded in the
Simat is that of 2017, and corresponds to 14.96%9.
1.3. Object of the evaluation. Description of the ethnoeducation strategy of
UNICEF
1.3.1. DESCRIPTION OF THE STRATEGY AND COVERAGE
UNICEF Ethnoeducation Strategy is a strategy that “supports the Ministry of Education
National, territorial and traditional entities and schools in the improvement of their
capacities to offer quality learning environments to children and adolescents of
indigenous and Afro -descendant communities ”(UNICEF, BRIEF Ethnoeducation). This support is given to
Through: “Training, accompaniment and design processes of relevant curricular projects
that develop knowledge and skills to learn and live according to: (i) the worldview
and the life plans of the different peoples, (ii) the ancestral knowledge and practices linked to the
teaching and learning processes and, (iii) the possibility of accessing a quality education and
Participate with equal opportunities in all other areas of life ”(UNICEF, Brief
Ethnoeducation).
Through this UNICEF ethnoeducation strategy, it seeks to respond to objective 4 development
Sustainable of the United Nations: "Quality Education". It is also aligned with politics
of ethnoeducation, following the importance of: “The conservation of culture and identities,
own educational projects, the training of ethnoeducating teachers, research and
technological development through the development of contextualized pedagogical tools, the
generation of meeting spaces and exchange of experiences at regional and national level and
Facilitation of Concertación scenarios between territorial authorities and the government in different
levels ”(UNICEF, Brief Ethnoeducation).
The ethnoeducation strategy for the departments of Cauca and Chocó focused on the review and
Resignification of the PEC. Thus, UNICEF, together with two local partners organizations, “designed
and implemented a methodological route to resignify community educational projects
(UNICEF, Iceland Report, 2020). ”UNICEF along with the implementing partners, Corporation Region
and the Afro Caucanas Organizations Unit (UOOFROC), as well as local schools and secretariats
of education prioritized, thus including teachers, managers, adolescents, boys and girls of
These institutions. In line with a community participation approach, the strategy has also
Lining to include families, traditional authorities, knowledgeable and knowing, in the processes,
Community tips, leaders and leaders.
This two departments focuses on this evaluation, specifically in the 7 municipalities
whose schools and local secretariats of education were prioritized:

1.3.2. STRATEGY COMPONENTS
The ethnoeducation strategy starts from the principles of autonomy, community participation,
Interculturality, linguistic diversity, and social cohesion, based on territoriality. These
principles are present in their own education, in the action of the family and the community, in the
knowledge of the elderly and in the processes of consultation between the traditional authorities and the
government. The ethnoeducation strategy seeks to support children and adolescents of the
Afro -descendant communities with which they have worked, have learning environments of

15
quality that are innovative and adaptable to their contexts (UNICEF-UT 2020 contract). The strategy
It develops in seven moments and 3 components:
Yo. Improvement of ethno-pedagogical practice
This component refers to: “accompaniment to teachers, through tools and
training processes, to build curricula and pedagogical materials relevant to
ethnic peoples and communities. "This accompaniment includes the" application of tools for
context reading and training processes, methods that allow to link and integrate knowledge
of the community at school, through intercultural dialogue. It's about strengthening capacities
of teachers for planning and training evaluation, the improvement of environments of
learning, and the promotion of research from the classroom and the territory ”(UNICEF- UT
2020).
II. Integration of the school, the community and the territory
“The management of pedagogical and community actions aimed at improving the improvement of
Learning opportunities for children and adolescents (NNA) from their identities, knowledge
and own practices in an intercultural dialogue. Includes the development of: a) Ethnopedagogical initiatives
which are strategies that recover their own knowledge and incorporate them into everyday life in dialogue
Intercultural. Such initiatives are planned and developed by the ethnopedagogical team: teachers,
students, community councils, knowledgeable, families and community in general; b) School Government
In relation to the territory: corresponds to the actions promoted to strengthen participation
of the educational community in the school government and the relationship with the territory and c) families schools
and communities: corresponds to the awareness and training actions around the topics
identified in ethnoeducative initiatives, and their participation in their development ”(contract
UNICEF- UT 2020).
III. Institutional sustainability
Corresponds to: “Strengthening of the processes of agreement and management, between ethnic authorities-
territorial (community councils), institutional actors (Secretariats of Education and other
local entities), and educational institutions focused, in order to achieve the sustainability of the
own educational projects, and their institutional ethno-educational guidelines established in the
Ethnoeducation strategy frame. This is obtained through the relationship between the technical team
The implementing partners, the number of activities of the strategy with the educational community
(students, teachers, managers, families and ethnic-territorial authorities), and through the
Accompaniment to institutionality (Ministry of Education), and authorities and organizations
ethnic-territorial (community and others) on the other hand ”(UNICEF-UT 2020 contract).
“The ethnoeducation strategy is based on the resignification of educational projects
Community This seeks to improve the capacities of all actors in the sector at the local level
To offer quality learning environments to children and adolescents from communities
indigenous and Afro -descendants. This work is based on the analysis of the context of each culture, the
recognition of their different ways of generating knowledge and their own pedagogies, the
Strengthening the teaching of the mother tongue, the development of research processes
From their own referents, the critical evaluation and application of pedagogical resources of each culture and
the collective construction of curricular proposals that articulate the local context with policies
national ”.
16
“Thus, from the strategy, the exercise of resignification of the PECs should allow teachers
have curricula and pedagogical materials relevant to culture, at the same time as
strengthens the link between school, territory and educational community in accordance with the
worldview and cultural practices of each town. It also seeks to generate tools at the level
institutional, allowing education secretariats to define guidelines for education
own and intercultural and advance technical assistance strategies to schools. ”
1.3.3. Strategy value chain
As described in the UNICEF Ethnoeducation Brief, Group students
Afro -Colombians who are enrolled in the Colombian education system, and live in areas
rural, they face several educational challenges, so a strategy based on the
Resignification of Community Educational Projects (PEC), with a view to improving education to the
which these students can access, seeking relevance according to their cultures and contexts.
Thus, the ethnoeducation brief explains how “the strategy proposes six aspects that must
be considered in the review and resignification of community educational projects –PEC ",
including the following: 1). Research, understanding and articulation of contexts, knowledge and
the processes of the diverse cultures that live in the territory; 2). Recognition of diversity
Epistemic and of its own pedagogies as basic referents for the creation and didactic innovation,
research and production of educational materials. 3). Understanding of the mother tongue of
students, strengthening their forms of teaching and transition processes for
learning of other languages; 4). Development of research processes that motivate
systematization of significant experiences and the use of pedagogical and research referents
own; 5). Critical evaluation of tools, pedagogical and technological resources of different
cultures, and of its use in the teaching-learning processes, having in perspective the
strengthening of own culture and 6). Collective construction of anchored curricular proposals
to the territory and the community processes that are articulated and contributed to local educational policies
and national.
The ethnoeducation strategy contemplates the development of pedagogical tools
contextualized and the generation of meeting spaces and exchange of experiences. This is done
Through “a line of work focused on the design and implementation of“ educational projects
Community -Pec- ”so that schools in ethnic contexts develop quality curricula,
relevant to their cultures and contexts that favor learning opportunities for children,
Girls and Adolescents ”(UNICEF Ethnoeducation Brief). For this, the resignification of projects
Community educational was carried out following a route that includes 8 moments and four
Components (presented in the next section on value chain). In general, “the
Resignification of community educational projects provides a set of innovative strategies,
adaptable to contexts for teachers to have curricula and pedagogical materials
relevant to cultures; The link between school, territory, its forms is strengthened
organizational understood as collective learning scenarios and strengthening school management and
Community for children to build quality learning according to their worldviews and
cultural practices. Provides tools for education secretariats to define guidelines
for their own and intercultural education and develop technical assistance strategies to schools ”
(Brief Ethnoeducation UNICEF).
17
Thus, the strategy supports territorial and traditional entities, as well as schools “in
The improvement of their abilities to offer quality learning environments to children and
adolescents from indigenous and Afro -descendant communities. ”All this in order to achieve
relevant curricular projects that allow developing knowledge and skills to
Learn to live according to the worldview of Afro peoples, as with knowledge and
Ancestral practices linked to teaching and learning processes.
The value chain is understood as the sequential and logical relationship between inputs, activities,
products and results in which value is added throughout the total transformation process (DNP,
2012). It can be said that in a first stage of the value chain inputs are taken, which have
associated costs, and under some technology and processes (called activities), are transformed into
products (goods and services). Then, in a second stage, the products, under conditions
specific, generate results that must partially or totally meet the objectives formulated
(DNP, 2014).
According to UNICEF ethnoeducation brief, the ethnoeducation strategy was born in response to a
ethnic and rural reality of some departments of Colombia, in relation to education in these
contexts, whose situation is associated with main central challenges associated with: ethnoeducation no
It is majority in educational policy, indices do not show high educational quality, it is not counted
with continuous training strategies and technical assistance to educational institutions.
With regard to the effects, the strategy defines as central effects or expected results: the
Institutional adoption of relevant ethnocuricles within the framework of educational projects
Community (PEC/PEA/PECA); teachers, teachers and managers promoting environments of
learning that integrates their own and intercultural knowledge in their pedagogical practice; Children
and adolescents appropriate relevant knowledge that strengthen their cultural identity and their
Life projects in intercultural dialogue (Logical model Ethnoeducation strategy, UNICEF).
To implement the resignification of community educational projects, a route develops
which contemplates eight (8) moments: moment 1-previous consulsure and institutional agreements; Moment
2- "A bet of all"; Moment 3-understand the territory and schools (define
priorities); Moment 4-Definition of educational purposes; Moment 5- “Our proposal
Ethno-educational ”; moment 6-implement the school initiative. Moment 7- Culture of Peace,
Democracy and participation and moment 8- Continuous improvement. The strategy contemplates in turn
four (4) central components that are: participation, training, school-family integration
Organizations and sustainability (terms of reference UNICEF, 2020 and step by step route
PEC construction).
For the participation component, the expected central products of the implementation of the
Strategy are: ethnopedagogical initiatives, a school government in relation to the territory and schools
family (awareness and training actions). With respect to the training component or
Ethnopedagogical practice are collected as products: the formation of ethnopedagogical equipment
(students, teachers, managers, knowledgeable, and own governments); Strengthening practice
pedagogical; and the training of the teacher in ethnocurriculum. For the third integration component
They expect as results: the implementation of community ethnopedagogical actions
(research, playful, creative); and spaces for exchange of knowledge and exchange. Finally,
Faced with the sustainability component, the bet is to achieve as products: the
18
Accompaniment to traditional authorities, Secretariats of Education and Educational Institutions; and
An institutional relationship with Ministry of National Education (terms of reference
UNICEF, 2020).

The value chain is related to the production process of traditional economic theory
where, through the mixture of productive factors and a given technology, the inputs are
transformed into a good or service. However, unlike this, in this case, said goods and
services respond to a social need identified within the public sphere and have as
sole purpose, solve an adverse socioeconomic situation. Therefore, products must
contribute to the generation of results (whether immediate, intermediate or final) susceptible to
Impact measurements (DNP, 2014).
2. Purpose and objective of the evaluation
2.1. Purposes and evaluation objectives
The purpose of this evaluation is: to determine the level of effectiveness, relevance and
Sustainability of UNICEF's ethnoeducation strategy, as well as the degree of inclusion of the
gender and equity approach, in the schools focused on the departments of Cauca and Chocó
(2016-2019).
The specific objectives of the evaluation are:
• In relevance: determine the extent to which the expected result and the products of the
Ethnoeducation strategy are consistent with national guidelines and priorities and
19
Territorial established in the General Education Law of 1994; Law 70 for peoples
Afro -descendants and work documents related to the resignification of PEC.
• In effectiveness: establish the level of effectiveness (identification facilitating factors and necks
of bottle) in the planning, implementation, monitoring and reporting processes of the
Ethnoeducation strategy in focused areas and schools.
• In sustainability: determine to what extent planning mechanisms and
management to ensure that the ethnoeducation strategy is incorporated into the instruments of
school management and thirsts to be maintained once the intervention of
UNICEF.
• In Human and Gender approach: determine the extent to which planning processes,
implementation, monitoring and reporting of the ethnoeducation strategy incorporate the
Rights, equity and gender approaches.
2.2. Dimensions to evaluate
For the evaluation of the ethnoeducation strategy, 4 criteria were defined to know: relevance,
effectiveness, sustainability and the transverse approach to human rights and gender, which are defined from

2.4. EVALUATION SCOPE
The evaluation will be focused on a temporary framework for the implementation of the strategy: 2016 - 2019 (
The implementation ended in 2020). This consulting will focus on the prioritized territories
from Cauca (good Aries, Caloto, Miranda, Padilla, Suarez, Santander de Quilichao) and Chocó (Nóvita).
2.5. Ethical considerations
The evaluation was framed in the UNICEF Evaluation Policies and Guidelines and in the standards of
UNEG evaluation (UNICEF-ADAPTED UNEG QUALITY CHECKLIST FOR EVALUATION TERMS OF REFERENCE,
2017). This study is considered as a minimum risk investigation, according to article 11 of the
Resolution No. 008430 of 1993 of the Ministry of Health: “They are studies that use techniques and
retrospective documentary research methods and those in which no
23
intentional intervention or modification of biological, physiological, psychological or
social of the individuals who participate in the study, among which are: review of
medical records, interviews, questionnaires and others in which they are not identified or treated
sensitive aspects of his behavior. ”It is also an investigation without risk or damage to the environment
environment, or to people, and the fulfillment of the three great bioethical principles is guaranteed:
Respect for people, no maleficence and justice, described in Helsinki's statement (details of
Ethical considerations of the evaluation in product 1 of methodological proposal).
Additionally, during the evaluation process and when doing field work with girls, boys and
adolescents, the principles of work were established, in accordance with the document “Research
Ethics with children ”, prepared by UNICEF in 2013, these are the fundamental ethical principles, the
which are welcomed and implemented for the purposes of this research:
• Respect: in order to obtain an informed consent by girls, boys and
teenagers, it is a way of showing respect for the dignity of this person
Participant, although his father, mother or caregiver has already given the consent.
During this process the veil evaluation team for the right of protection and participation
of each girl, boy and adolescent who participated in the evaluation.
• Benefit: the evaluation team veiled by the inclusion of girls, boys and adolescents such as
participants without producing any damage. In order that, “research must be methodological
and ethically correct, rigorous, relevant and susceptible to an impact ”
(UNICEF, 2013. Page 17). The participation of girls, boys and adolescents in “research
You have many possibilities to provide elements to improve research,
Practice and policies ”(UNICEF, 2013. Page 17).
• Justice: During the evaluation process, special was provided in the relationship established
Among the investigating people and children and adolescents, based on the "
Differences of power inherent to the adult/child research relationship ”(UNICEF, 2013. p.
17). In each moment of work a respectful listening of the opinions of the
Children and adolescents, giving the importance it has and responding to their words,
This "facilitates obtaining positive research results and is in
consonance with article 12 of the United Nations Convention on Rights
of the child ”(UNICEF, 2013. Page 17).
Finally, the product review process 1 of Methodological Proposal and Instruments was completed
by the Ethics Committee of the Institutional HML Review Board (IRB) that received final approval the
July 7, 2021. Annexes is collected application document for pressures or adjustments, and document
of approval (HML IRB Review #398Colu21).
3. Evaluation methodology
The evaluation methodology was mixed, covers both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The
Evaluation route included three stages or main strategies: a review and analysis
documentary and enlistment; a application of the instruments, including the realization of a
pilot test; and another systematization and information analysis.
24
3.1. Qualitative component
3.1.1. Applied approach and instruments
According to Sandoval (2002), assuming a qualitative optics implies, on the one hand, the effort
of understanding, understood as “the collection of the meaning of what the other or others want to say
Through their words, their silences, their actions and their immobilities through interpretation and
the dialogue ", and on the other hand," the possibility of building generalizations, which allow us to understand the
Common aspects to many people and human groups in the production and appropriation process
of the social and cultural reality in which they develop their existence ”(p. 32).
The qualitative component was made from the both face and virtual application of
instruments, and in complementarity between instruments of individual application and instruments
group. The qualitative strategy thus allowed to adapt to the specific local conditions, reason
by which the definition of agendas in Cauca and Chocó Face -to -face was prioritized, and according to this
Concertation process and agreement with the participants, the agenda was defined in complement
virtual, according to the possibilities of educational institutions and other actors, as well as
particularities against the connectivity and study modality of each entity to facilitate the
Participation of actors in the evaluation.

3.1.2. Raised Information Summary
The face -to -face field work in Cauca was carried out and in previously collided with agendas
arranged by the agend team. In Cauca the face -to -face field work day
He extended for 8 days, while in Chocó it had an extension of 6 days. The virtual approach
It started a week later and extended for 3 and a half weeks.
53 instruments were applied from the qualitative component and a total of 84 participated
people. In relation to the geographical dispersion of the qualitative evaluation, 38 people were linked
In Cauca, compared to 35 people in Chocó, and it was possible to have representatives of all municipalities

The variety of qualitative instruments represented an advantage for the various types of actors
summoned, since participants could be covered both in individual spaces in which
He got depth in the issues, as in group spaces in which collective reflection
allowed the identification of experiences and assessment of results. It is also highlighted that
construction of instruments by type of actor was profitable, since it was possible to motivate the
participation of children and adolescents in instruments such as the didactic files that included
the realization of drawings, or as the digital testimonies that linked adolescents in spaces
of greater freedom of expression and complementary use of opinions through audios and emojis. Of
The possibility of conducting instruments in person or virtual, already
that, although initially a greater application was projected through virtual means, according to
the possibilities at the time of application, it was considered possible and timely to carry out a greater
number of face -to -face meetings, always with biosafety protocols, but it was possible
Make the application of several instruments at the headquarters of educational institutions.
The field work was carried out satisfactorily with the simultaneous application of
face -to -face and virtual agendas, and subject to communication measures, biosafety protocols
and achieving a high representativeness and in compliance with the projection of instruments defined in
The methodological proposal (field work results are detailed in product 3 of Le
assessment).
3.1.3. Processing and analysis
For qualitative analysis, the support of a data assisted analysis software was available
Qualitative (ATLAS TI), due to the need to have coding procedures of the
reality to standardize and rigor the analysis process. The processing was carried out
27
according to the methodological proposal described in product 1 of the evaluation. The ones are summarized
central moments of this analysis:
i) The analysis process begins with the creation of a hermeneutical unit (UH) of the project.
The files are classified taking into consideration the analysis units, and additional
classification by place of application and actors.
ii) Once the hermeneutical unit is created, a dictionary of categories is prepared. I know there
Build a categories base that allows you to encode the information. Thus, the components
They become "super families", categories to "families" and variables to "codes."
iii) An early process coding process continues. The first
Coding process seeks to respond to what happens in these data with analytical stamps

Daily the surveys were transmitted to the server and once processed, they were sent to
Its verification, which consisted of running the validation meshes, using the statistical package
SPSS, in order to detect inconsistencies such as those presented below:
• Validation of allowed values for each variable: to evaluate the consistency between the
Database and the questionnaire, each variable of the instrument was awarded a variable
dichotomic or politomics that detects whether the value reported is a valid response option
for this or not; In case of reporting as inconsistent, the reason is investigated and the
Adequate solution.
• Verification of empty fields: each form of the form must have a valid response,
Therefore, there should be no empty fields in them, unless it is part of a flow or jump
established in the design of the form. In verification the filters are taken into account
established for each variable and that each variable is answered by the people who
They meet the previously defined conditions.
• Verification of inconsistent data: In questions with multiple choice answer there are
among them options that are exclusive regarding the other options. In the process of
verification is controlled that effectively an exclusive response has not allowed the
dialing of another option or of some related question.
• Verification of the consistency of survey questions: this verification
It consists of monitoring the flow of the survey, through which
Determine whether a response field is mandatory or optional. In questions they have in their
Flow jump in the instrument according to the response over by the participant, it is verified
That the questions that cover the jump have all the response options blank.
Once the database verification was carried out, an analysis was carried out that allowed

Construction of evaluation indices.
3.3. Evaluation indices
Methodology of indicators and evaluation indices
For this evaluation, 4 indexes were built, each index responds to the criteria to be evaluated from the
Strategy which are relevance, effectiveness, sustainability and transversalization of the approach of
Gender and Humanness. An index is a “statistical number that tries to summarize in a single instrument of
measure the information provided by one or more indicators of a concept ”(Díez-Nicolás, s.f.,
p. 21).
Now, each of these indices is made up of several indicators, which yield a
relevant result of each criterion that allows to quantitatively explain the relationship between
32
various variables per criteria, in order to analyze the progress and appropriation of the strategy by
of the actors who were part of the project.
It should be clarified that an indicator is defined as an expression, either qualitative or quantitative,
which allows describing characteristics or behaviors of reality through variables that,
compared to previous periods, similar products, goals or commitments, I evaluated your
Performance and evolution, serving as useful tools for general planning and management. A
indicator must meet three basic characteristics: i). Simplification, you should consider a dimension
of reality; II). Measurement, allows to buy the current situation over time or patterns
established; and iii). Communication, you must transmit information on a particular topic (Dane, s.f.).
For construction, an matrix of indicators was developed at first in which

The second moment, a common problem is identified to any effort to measure an indicator that
It covers different dimensions (variables) is how to synthesize very different criteria. To solve
This problem is three commonly used methods: scale conversion, standardization and
Percentile range. Once any of these methods, the values of all variables
They will be within a “same range” which will allow its subsequent aggregation.
The third moment is to establish the equivalence that the different scales of
response in numerical scales that are used in the calculation of the indicators, as well as the type of
scale that are worked on the instruments.
Finally, it is the construction of the index, where once all the data has been transformed,
Follow the integration phase in a single index. To do this, there are three more methods
Used: Simple average, weighted average, main component analysis. In this this
Evaluation This calculation is carried out by criteria, and is the average of the indicators that compose it.

of improvement in the planning and implementation of the project. (For more detail about construction
of the indices, consult product 1.)
Interpretation of indicators and indexes
Each indicator and index manages its own score, which corresponds to a value between 0% to 100%.
This score can be observed under the following traffic light, which indicates if the index or

To make some variations, so Annex 2 is attached for more detail.
3.4. Documentary analysis component
For this evaluation, secondary sources review was included to respond to variables
related to the criteria belonging, effectiveness and sustainability. With respect to the variables of
relevance, through secondary sources deepened:
1. The normative context and the advances of ethnoeducation in the national and regional
2. The departmental context, the situation analysis of the educational context and the analysis of
situation of children and adolescents.
3. The institutional context of prioritized schools.
4. Municipal Development Plans
5. The community context
While, for the effectiveness criteria, the review focused on the review of:
1. Documents and means of verification provided by the project operators that
Identify the participation of the actors in the proposed activities.
2. Documentation of the PEC route (guidelines and development)
3. Pedagogical products and materials carried out within the framework of the strategy
For the sustainability criteria, the review of secondary sources focused on the review of:

3.5. Triangulation and data analysis
The triangulation of information arises as a strategy for both primary information,
quantitative and qualitative, as well as information from secondary sources can be
complementary to each other, to this extent the results that are triangulated may have greater
strength in its argumentation and construction, compared to those studies where only
used a single method.
To perform the triangulation, at first an analysis of the sources was made in a way
independent in order to identify the findings and conclusions for each of the criteria, a
Once this individual analysis was counted, the triangulation was continued by criteria. In what follows
The triangulation description for each of the criteria is presented.

Finding 1 (Question 1) The ethnoeducation strategy is aligned with the regulations
National and promotes Afro -descendant ethnoeducation initiatives to
Regional level registered in the municipal development plans.
According to the BRIEF of the Ethnoeducation Strategy, the objective of the strategy is “that schools in
ethnic contexts develop quality curricula, relevant to their cultures and contexts that
They favor learning opportunities for children and adolescents. "This objective goes in
the same direction as national regulations. First, the Black Communities Law (Law
70 of 1993), gives a central place to the community councils of Afro -Colombian communities,
In order to promote one's own culture, objective aligned with the promotion of the culture of the
strategy. Regarding the alignment of the strategy with Law 70, a rector considers that:
We know that today the law that makes visible black was Law 70, Law 70 brought with it that the
communities had to organize and organize through local community councils and
We when we create the Pedagogical Ethnoeducation Committee, in the College towards Members
of the Community Council, that is, never and in the PEC is clearly expressed its chapter of Law 70.
(Interview, rector IE, Chocó, 2021).
In the interviews conducted in the evaluation of the key actors, they agree that there was a
Alignment of the strategy with national regulations. Additionally the General Law of
Education (Law 115 of 1994, Art 55) gives the definition and purposes for group education
ethnic, category within which the educational initiatives of the communities enter
Afro -Colombians that were carried out within the framework of the strategy. The Ministry of Education defines
Ethnoeducation in: “55. Definition of ethnoeducation. Education is understood as ethnic groups
which is offered to groups or communities that integrate nationality and that have a culture, a
Language, traditions and their own and native fallen. This education must be linked to
environment, to the productive process, to the social and cultural process, with the due respect of their beliefs and
Traditions. " The national and local regulations propose that ethnoeducation initiatives must
carry out articulated with the Ministry of Education and the Secretariats of Education,
who also have ethnoeducation as a priority in their departmental plans and
Municipal
At the regional level, the departmental development plans of the departments in which
implemented the strategy, ethnoeducation as a plan to carry
carried out between 2016 and 2019. For example, in the case of PDM (2016-2019) of Chocó there is a definition
of ethnoeducation "" For us a central component of this principle is ethnoeducation, in
which tradition is a tool that links multiple black experiences, pointing out criticism
in the face of modernity, and the racist experience that becomes. The importance of tradition
Underline historical continuities, subcultural dialogues, intercultural cross fertilization and
intertextual that builds the notion of a different black culture and conscious car. There they charge
sense practices such as orality, collective memory. ", highlighting that this is a subject of
central importance. However, this PDM does not put a concrete goal to follow up.
The PDM of Cauca (2016-2019), puts a specific goal in terms of ethnoeducation “to accompany
200 educational establishments through the construction of ethnoeducative projects (Afro - Peca
and indigenous - SEIP). "They put the goal of accompanying 88 institutions that constitute
The baseline. Similarly, municipal development plans present ethnoeducation
Like a priority. For example, the PDM of Santander de Quilichao, includes a budget for
40
Ethnoeducation in the given period. Similarly, other municipalities also put themselves
Compliance goals for implementation or strengthening ethnoeducation as is the case of
Novita, Caloto, Miranda, among others. UNICEF's strategy promoted the strengthening of these
Afro -descendant educational initiatives in the territories.
Additionally, the strategy is aligned with the life plans of the community councils, where
The participating communities mostly express the need for their own education. By
Example, the Brisas Community Council expresses that it does not want to have only traditional education
issued by the Ministry of National Education, but wants education that takes into account the
local and ancestral knowledge. It wants education to respond to the particular context of the territory.
UNICEF through the ethnoeducation strategy contributed to relevance to the regulatory framework
Afro -descendant nationwide, promoting the initiatives of education that promote the
own culture. Community construction PECs are in the process of inclusion by the
Education Secretariats.
Find 2 (Question 2): The prioritized territories in the strategy have needs
felt regarding the security situation, the socioeconomic situation and other challenges
associated with rurality
In the UNICEF report and the Ministry of National Education published in 2015 “indicators and
profiles of ethnoeducative institutions in Colombia ”, the situation is analyzed quantitatively
The ethnoeducation of Afro -descendant communities in the country. It is highlighted that most
Afro -descendant students are under a traditional educational system, without a component
Ethnoeducative. Additionally, school dropout occupies an important place in characterization
of Afro -descendant schooling. Unicef's strategy aimed to prioritize
Territories of Afro -descendant communities, with latent needs in education. The plans of
Municipal development of the 2016-2019 period, emphasizes school dropout as a
educational priority of the municipalities. For example, the PDM of Santander de Quilichao raises from
Dane figures that the main problems in education are coverage, literacy and
School dropout in the municipality. Additionally, connectivity is a barrier to education
In the prioritized territories, considering that these are rural territories away from the areas
Urban
It takes a lot of internet, because children have to run for example for Suárez where there are
Internet to do homework, those things like that. (Interview, staff IE, Cauca, 2021)
However, these territories that were part of the strategy in Cauca and in Chocó not only have
educational needs. The key actors interviewed state that the population surrounding the
Educational institutions has emerging needs regarding living conditions. The
Strategy is relevant when prioritizing municipalities with these needs, in order to generate
Impact on these territories in multidimensional poverty.
Blacks also in our country's regions live in subhuman conditions to put it
Less and with many disadvantages (Interview, Community Council, Cauca, 2021).
Here also the water is a bit scarce for what it touches how to go to the jet to load those little things like this,
It takes a lot, in some parts it is pumped but it is not the same, what else can I say (interview,
IE personnel, Cauca, 2021).
41
Additionally, they are territories that have been affected by the armed conflict in Colombia, which
generates changes in young people's life plans and generally affects the educational quality of
institutions. NNA are subject to armed recruitment by armed groups to
Margin of the law. In this order of ideas, the strategy responds to the latent need to reinforce the
role of educational institutions as a protective environment, in which it seeks to show another
Life alternative for young people in the territory.
Like the rumors that were running, the situation that was being lived in Alto Tááá, with the children
and adolescents, the idea arose that NOVITA was taken to develop the strategy
Ethnoeducation with UNICEF and Corporation Region, which for us was a great contribution that was made
to the children and adolescents of the San Onofre educational center. (Interview, rector IE, Chocó, 2021)
Even when asking teachers about several educational needs
prioritized for the resignification of the PEC, these express that the three most felt needs are
The low quality of the ethnoeducation model, with 41.8%, followed by the vulnerability of girls,
children, and adolescents for being in areas of high influence due to armed conflict, with 32.9%, and
finally the need for political decisions to take into account the rural and dispersed population,
with 13.9%. This information allows you to identify that both educational institutions and team
Implementing, they find that needs derive from living conditions and lack of
adaptation of educational models to territorial contexts, so it becomes vital
work from these needs in actions that create protective and quality environments to
girls, boys and adolescents.

Work personnel and be able to continue doing the process. They were many things that put to think
in Plan A, B, C of that problem that was being lived. (Interview, Implementing Partner, Cauca,
2021)
From the opinion of the actors participating in the strategy, the prioritization responded to the
needs of the municipalities, even in the understanding that many other needs exceed the
same intervention of the strategy, but consider that it contributed to cover these problems.
While other municipalities will also require priority attention, UNICEF made
a prioritization of territories for the strategy, which allowed incidence in institutions

Find 3 (Question 3): The actors of the strategy perceived the participation of the

"They opened their doors to the community."
The construction of the PECs in the IE contemplated as a central element the participation of different

community, knowledge dialogue and collective construction as valuable resources at the time of
Exercise your vocation and nurture pedagogical components. Traditional knowledge has strengthened
the school, and have begun, in other cases, to acquire a value that was not previously in contexts
educational:
The traditional thing looked like an ancient thing "that is useful for us now." But then they start
Let's see the value, then the pedagogical value that traditions have. (Interview, partner
Implementator, Chocó, 2021)

Even community participation has been fundamental to carrying out the processes
educational, because according to the teachers surveyed they affirm that they agree11 in 93.7%
(See Graph 5), with which “the Educational Institution has validated and concerted educational goals
by the community ”, that is, it has been possible to establish guidelines so that during educational processes
The community is an active actor to consult the educational goals.

This has also caused for some cases that these same knowledgeable and members of the
community validate their knowledge and recognize themselves as agents of change because their knowledge is
Consulted when making decisions that previously made the managers of the institutions.
Because from the process of this project for the first time, the Community Council enters the
educational institutions and be part of the decision making of things because it was always the
Rector, and with this process it was achieved that the institution out of open doors. It will no longer be closed
but it will be open doors and both older adults, the knowledgeable, felt important from
to be able to contribute their knowledge to the academy and what we call empirical knowledge or
own knowledge; So, it was something that they say that they like it a lot, because
They are finally part of children's education. (Interview, Implementing Partner, Cauca, 2021)
Also, in surveys towards teachers and teachers they agree 125% that the
families and authorities during the strategy implementation process have participated
Actively in decision -making in educational institutions, that is, changes on the
Active community participation are perceived from the different actors in the community.

According to the above, it is important to highlight, that the level of participation is differentiated
In different municipalities and IE, there is a variation between the level of community linkage
In the actions, as well as the level of participation of the different actors is different. In front of this
community linking to school processes are perceived from some actors that could
be even greater, and continue continuously to the subsequent punctual process of scenarios for the
CONSTRUCTION OF THE PEC. The change is felt, although there was an opening towards the community in EI
Some against participation stand out that this participation could have been greater:
45
More information would be missing, more people participate, because there are many people than
The first days enter and do not come back, so they desert from the training do not end, so more
stake. (Mother Caregiver Interview, Cauca, 2021)
Some actors, such as parents and mothers and participants of the Community Council,
They have greater expectation in the participation of fathers and mothers, they perceive a
disinterest and lack of sense of belonging and roots to culture. Fathers and mothers
They do not attend the activities of the strategy because they usually give priority to other aspects of life
such as work and economic needs.
One of the forms, I will not say that the maximum, but one of the shapes would be to put in the head to
Parents. Because there is a problem in education there is a problem and that is that
connection between dad and institution very cut, very cut and more than anything because parents
They keep in work, for example, those who work in ingenuity, they cannot stop attending
To their work to come to a meeting of parents, but I say it would be the form, you have to do
All proceedings and sometimes have what to be returned until far but would be, for example, that
From educational institutions they will seek way to start, but from there with managers
of the mills that grant them at least in the month two opportunities to those parents who come to
face the educational institution for their children and start training the lords telling him
All our rights we have and how things are achieved with the fight. (Interview, member
of the Community Council, Cauca, 2021)
It is then observed as a finding of the evaluation that dialogue and construction spaces
community that were promoted from the strategy have been relevant in terms of need
Latent in institutions to include the community within their agendas. The voice
majority is that, from this process, in most cases the EI opens its doors to that
Community in which it is located and of which the educational community are part.
Find 4: (Question 3): The strategy contributed to the need expressed by teachers
to strengthen the training of teachers as researchers in order to rescue
ancestral knowledge of the territory
According to the theory of change presented in the Brief of Ethnoeducation, the problem is exposed
which gives rise to the UNICEF strategy to boost ethnoeducation in Colombia, identifying
The main bottlenecks: “(iii) there are no high quality ethnoeducation models that
make advances in the learning of children and adolescents of ethnic communities. ”
identified need is corroborated through interviews conducted with teachers, where
They express the need to strengthen the training of teachers:
I think that the real need of teachers is currently training on that subject,
It is training because we know that the teacher Lee can read it, but he does not have a help
Based what allows you to clarify doubts, ideas he will not get in depth, if he understands me?
So it is only believed that is that, but what we needed is fundamentally training
Train the teacher, as if he can develop in the middle where he works. (Interview, rector
IE, Chocó, 2021)
While teachers from educational institutions have a university degree, not everyone is
familiar with ethnoeducation. The traditional training of teachers does not contemplate the edges
of ethnoeducation. The members of the Afro -descendant communities in which
carried out the strategy, expressed the need to rescue their own knowledge and know the origins
46
of the Afro -Colombian people. In the 2014 Afro -Colombian Pedagogical Congress, promoted with NRC
and Save The Children, the teachers established the priorities for the development of ethnoeducation
in the territories. Among the most latent priorities is teacher training. This training,
aims to promote teachers to strengthen their role as researchers, who carry out their
own pedagogical content in relation to the territory and the community.
During the ethnoeducation strategy, a central focus of the implementing partners was to have
Associated Teachers, to promote this training in the territory. This training was
relevant because it led to the construction of pedagogical content by teachers, both plans of
classroom as interactive cards on the territory and their own knowledge; such as the card
Long live the classroom developed by the teachers of Chocó, with accompaniment of the trainers of
Region Corporation. Similarly, Uafroc made teacher training and accompaniment to
The elaboration of cards, such as that of the IE San Antonio, in Santander de Quilichao, Cauca.
Now, when surveying teachers and teachers, they consider that in 93.7% they are
According to the relevance of teachers training to support the resignification process
DEL PEC. In other words, most teachers consider the work that was taken to
to comply with the ultimate goal of the resignification of the PEC, a fact that is related to the vision
of the implementing partners on the relevance of the construction of antipedagogical content
For teachers and their reception.

is relevant to support the process of resigning community educational projects ”

However, certain teachers said that the training received was not done by people from the
territory, which for some teachers is interpreted as a mistake since they expressed the
Need for training by someone in the territory, specialist in ethnoeducative processes.
On the other hand, in some cases it was expressed for the municipalities of Chocó, the feeling that the
training was extended to a greater extent at the main headquarters and their teachers, and to a lesser extent
In rural headquarters, highlighting a situation of differentiated intervention from the
Strategy and scale. It is perceived that in spaces such as IE they focused the
interventions, feeling weaker in the other instances and actors.
47
The greatest difficulty that has always been that, the works remain at the main headquarters and the others
Heads have no access to those information. We would have to include teachers from other venues. Yeah
The program returns would be very cool, very dynamic, include teachers from other headquarters. (Focal group
Teachers, Chocó, 2021)
The training was generally received as an opportunity in response to a expressed need,
Although this process was highlighted since it implied a great job for teachers. He
process represented a change in the materials and therefore a work that fell in great
measured in teachers. He was experienced as a process and for several teachers the change represented
A great success from the strategy:
“I value that there has been my own material, with my own language, which has been designed
And printed own cards, it was a product taken directly from the actors in the environment, teachers,
family, students and community in general. " (Focal Group, Rector, Cauca, 2021)
UNICEF responded to the need expressed by teachers to receive training to empower themselves
As ethnoeducators, when creating its own content that speaks from the territory, highlighting knowledge
own Teachers training was the spine of the partners' deployment strategy
Implementers, both in Cauca and Chocó.
Find 5 (Question 4). Previous experience and relationship with the territory of
partners contributed positively in the relevance of the actions to be implemented in the
Strategy in Cauca and El Chocó
For the implementation of the strategy, UNICEF allied with strategic implementing partners or
for its knowledge of the territory, or by previous experience in issues such as gender, ethnoeducation,
participation and human rights, which contributed to nurture the ethnoeducational process in each territory.
The selection of the partner in the case of Cauca was due to the representativeness of an entity that was
in the territory and precisely brought together populations and community councils in northern Cauca
as is UOAFROC. In front of the case of the department of Chocó, a local entity was not identified that
It could be operator and the linking of an entity with themes and methodologies that
They will tune in with the objective of the strategy such as Corporation Region. Are detailed below
For each department the ways in which this experience and relations of the allied entities were
perceived as contribution to the process.
Cauca
In Cauca, the strategy was implemented by UOOFROC, an entity that since 2003 is formed as
Organization that represents Afro -descendant communities of Base of North of Cauca. The
organization has experience in creating inter -Andean community councils, gender, new
Male, agriculture and education for communities. This was an election according to
objectives of the strategy, since it is an organization that represents interests
Afro -descendants, have experience in gender approach and additionally have a great
knowledge of the territory, and therefore a knowledge of the actors of this and the different
Territorial contexts. This partner was perceived as a contributor to open the doors with
educational institutions and community actors, and achieve community participation. HE
mostly perceives as an organization committed to the territory and in this sense it is
considered relevant your action within the framework of the strategy.
48
Well, there is a responsibility because they in one way or another are an Afro organization and as such
From the person, of being as such there is a responsibility that continues to be accompanied. Of
Fact, the project stopped, but one is still called indirectly, and because if it arrives in any
Moment to continuity await us with open doors. I say the commitments are going
Beyond the papers, the commitment is to the community, with the people, with their leaders and that
It has more weight than anything else. (Interview, Socio Implementing Advisor, Cauca, 2021)
Uoafroc fulfilled a fundamental role in constant accompaniment to IE, by the
Pedagogical advisors in ethnoeducation, also called advisors of the implementing partners.
This accompaniment was perceived in institutions as an achievement of the strategy.
Then I went on to do pedagogical accompaniment and I already corresponded to accompany all the
Focused municipalities, monitoring and accompanying the entire project as such. (…)Of
All the municipalities of Cauca, I had that until the end of the project or the accompaniment of
All territories, but as in the fourth phase, an additional pedagogue was also hired
As an advisor. (Interview, Socio Implementing Advisor, Cauca, 2021)
Value the disposition a lot as the fortitude that these people had when they came to gather
With us, Milena, Gustavo who have always been very willing and other people who do not
I remember, but they were always worried because this was given. (Interview, rector IE, Cauca,
2021)
The UOAFROC selection as an implementing partner in Cauca was strategic from UNICEF,
since this allowed to make an intervention by connoisseurs of the territory and representatives
direct from Afro -descendant populations. Which also implied a feeling perception of
continuity in the processes, both in regards to the previous processes of UOAFroc that are
strengthened with the implementation of the strategy, such as the current continuity of the process due to
The continued presence of the entity in this initiative and other related.
Chocó
In Chocó, the strategy was implemented by Corporation Region, an entity with three decades of work in
initiatives that promote coexistence, justice, equity, peace and the right to education in
Children and adolescents. Corporation Region had no previous experience in the Territory of Novita
In Chocó, but contributed methodologies in participatory processes, to promote rights to the
education and gender approach. In the words of a member of the ethnoeducation table in Chocó,
who worked hand in hand with the implementing partner:
For us it has been as a region corporation, for being one as its name says it
Corporation of people who do not represent a territory is a cheese organization build the
Medellín City and who apparently have several partners for us has been fundamental, for example
because at this time the people who have been are the people with whom we have been able to
Working in an articulated way, Corporation Region has influenced this work in a positive way
because we have been able to build together and participatory in a
organization that comes to impose on the territory, is an organization that concerts, an organization that
It is articulated, an organization that plans with us, an organization that cares a lot
because the professionals that link know the territory (interview, ethnoeducation table, chocó,
2021)
Despite not being a base organization of the territory, Corporation Region could be established in
educational institutions and in communities, weaving a bond of trust. The beneficiaries
They mention that Corporation Region is perceived as a reliable implementing partner, with a good
49
Resource management for the project. Additionally, the training provided by the advisor and others
Personnel hired was sense as valuable for teachers and institutions of institutions
educational.
“The most important thing as an experience the responsibility that UNICEF and Corporation region gave to
Project, they were very responsible with the project, they never left badly, if we are coming, if we arrive,
If there are three days, it was three days, if it was a week but very responsible in the project, that made
The students of us will be fond of the project and we could get ahead in a way
Wonderful. "
The region corporation selection as an implementing partner contributed a participatory approach and
Methodological to the strategy in Chocó. Although it could be perceived as a weakness that the partner does not
be it from the territory, this relied on local knowledge to carry out the activities of
Teacher and construction training of the PEC.
The work process in Chocó has great documentation such as the PEC route, various
Materials generated as cards, and the proposed PEC for girlfriend focused on ethnoeducation.
This documentation represents a strength for the strategy in generating materials
resulting from the process with replicator potential. Region contributed in the instrumentalization of the
strategy and encouraged the reflection of the actors around ethnoeducation.
Sometimes as teachers we tend to be rigid, they incorporated us with that playful part, based on
knowledge of the boy, starting their learning from a game they put us
In that other world, they led us to unlearn, what I had rooted took me out of a
spectacular way and they taught my students yet to reach a knowledge of
Easier and more pleasant way for them, who learn without the need for me like that polizonte, than
It was more obstacle, now God thank you, I am a facilitator following what I learned with Corporation Region
and UNICEF. (Focal Group, Teacher, Chocó, 2021)
The Implementing partners of the UNICEF strategy are perceived by the participating actors
Like a strength. His role was relevant to the objectives of the ethnoeducation strategy
given their relationship with the territory and work on issues that contributed to the necessary reflections to
An ethnoeducative process. In each territory the experience had some differences that in part were
evidence from the respective implementing partner, which shows the contribution that each partner granted
to the process.
Find 6 (Question 4) The communities that participated in the strategy consider that
This is consistent with the needs of children in the territory and adapts to the
Afro -descendant community context and its culture.
The strategy responds to the context and Afro culture because there is a structural need that recognizes
And the community states to strengthen quality and access to education, to build new spaces
that are of interest to the NNA, there is a perception of disinterest towards education among some
actors as teachers and managers, many of the young people, fathers and mothers do not conceive
Education as a necessity or priority, on the contrary in these low level contexts
Socioeconomic the immediate material needs make access to education impossible.
The needs is that there are opportunities to enter a school, enter to study, but like most
From families we are of limited resources, so that makes many people for the little resource say:
“I am not going to study, I prefer to go to work because I have to help my mother, I have to help
50
To my dad.
Children desequent to study, all those things. (Interview, Caredora Mother, Cauca, 2021)
In this sense, there is a need to make education an action for equity and inclusion
social, make culture and identity Afro a political platform so that they can access the
guarantees offered by the State, there are leaders who emphasize the need to know the
scholarships for Afro people in universities, law 70 and the political processes that are
They advance from community councils as blacks.
So when we do not empower that knowledge we believe we already knew it and also
I am telling them we are losing opportunities because the boys are not
studying for a scholarship, if the boys know that they as black have laws that we
They protect and that if we make it hard we until alone we can. (Interview, teacher, Cauca, 2021)
As for the Afro, I made part of the collective degree of the municipality of Novita, I worked and I have
worked with community councils, although due to the same differences in communities and the same
lack of knowledge, those of us who did the collective degree we move away and that is why Novita has had
a lot of difficulty due to ignorance. Back and play my institution, at that time we
We invited all teachers, but they never attended, people hardly interest that because they believe
who already knows, when you are talking about blackitudes we already have knowledge that we are
Blacks, which we eat chontaduro and eat rice with cheese, and we stay in some things, but
It turns out that there are standards that have allowed us to include us. (Interview, teacher, chocó,
2021)
Therefore, strengthen and encourage spaces of interest for young people according to their culture through
of the PEC route and with it the construction of pedagogical tools for and with them (cards, games)
It has been an achievement, some of the interviews made to children are shown that they perceive the
Strategy according to your traditional interests and knowledge.
In the student a desire for solidarity is reflected by wanting to help others, she, for example, mentions
that you would like to learn about the use of plants in the region to learn to do remedies and
That way to help other people who need it. She mentions that at some point a
Teacher who is no longer in the EC told him about plants. (Didactic tab, 2021)
Participants mention the customs and history of slavery of the peoples
Afro -Colombians and, for example, Evelyn, regarding the question about what things have learned and
What are the knowledge expressed “we can learn more about that so that they do not commit again
an injustice like what they did (Spanish) with us ”(Didactic file, 2021)
Now, from the voices of girls, boys and adolescents surveyed is that in
General perceive that the actions of the strategy were relevant to their context. Well,
specifically 85.6% of the students surveyed refer to the fact that they agree with the
Actions adapted to the times and knowledge of the community. 89.7% consider that
Ethnoeducation strategy If it was thought from the knowledge of Afro -descendant ancestors.
The previous values show how girls, boys and adolescents positively evaluate the
Strategy relevance. Now, another fact to highlight is that not only students evaluate
positively the adaptation to the community context, but also, they consider positively that
The strategy adapted to their interests and needs, since 88.7% of the students are
according to that if your interests and needs were taken into account. (See graph 9).

This indicator takes reference two moments, the first, where it was inquired about the coherence of
The strategy with the principles of ethnoeducation of the referents and guidelines of the national order.
The second moment, evaluates whether local educational needs are recognized and taken into account.
Once they are consulted with implementing partners, representatives of the Ministry of Education and
Community Councils, it is found that the value of indicator 1, is 76.2%, scale assessment
very high, that is, that the actors perceive that the strategy has been relevant according to
national referents, and that from their planning it is considered that if they take into account the
needs of the territories.
Also, as refers to finding 1, the strategy from its planning manages to align with the framework
Afro -descendant national normative, and in turn manages to integrate it with the particular needs in
the territories, so that solid ethnoeducational processes can be built, which are focused not
only in traditional education but also the community ancestral knowledge is integrated.
It is also important to highlight, the assessment granted by the community to the strategy to prioritize
communities that have felt needs, a fact that is evidenced in finding 2, and where
The importance of continuing to work in the territories is also highlighted because as time
emerging needs have been generated and with the strategy one of them has been mitigating, by

Finding 7 (Question 7) The process of construction and resignification of the PEC was done in a form
Participatory, integrating the educational community with the community in general.
In the documentation of the PEC route, it is mentioned that a goal is that “the link is strengthened
Among the school, the territory, its organizational forms understood as learning scenarios
Collective. ”To meet this goal, the construction stages of the PEC route were followed,
starting with a sensitization with communities about the strategy and the importance of
This, using participation mechanisms.
PEC plans are basically resignifying, restructuring institutions educational plans
traditional that had been working, that restructuring was made by changing to PEC, where there are already
more participation of the community, of the leaders, all together with the institution; what is sought
It is that the institution is more given and represents the community more in context. (Focal Group,
Cauca, 2021)
In order to integrate the community and the educational community around this project, a
“Mapeo of ethnic-territorial, community and institutional organizations that can accompany
The PEC -construction path. At this stage allies were achieved in the territory as
Knowing, and members of the Community Councils, who contributed to boost the dissemination
of ancestral and territory knowledge in the classrooms of educational institutions.
On the other hand, it is emphasized that the teachers surveyed manifest in 87.3% that are
Agree13 with the affirmation “The Educational Institution has a PEC built in a way
participatory, that is, the entire educational community was integrated ”, perception that is complemented
With the above mentioned in the findings, and that is that the construction of the PEC tries to be a process

This led to the community of educational tools.
Let's see, the participation of the creation of the tools, because in a team called equipment
Ethnoeducative and in that ethnoeducative team, it is part of the community councils, the social leaders,
cultors, knowledgeable, students, representatives of parents, teachers and managers.
So, it is an articulated group to all school activities and that makes the tools
They respond to all the needs of the community and all the members of the community
How ethnoeducation wants to work. (Interview, Cauca implementing partner, 2021)
UNICEF in its strategy guidelines attributes a central position to construction or
Resignification of the PEC to promote ethnoeducation in the educational institutions that are part
of the strategy. The implementing partners managed to carry out this guideline, respecting the
Community and participatory component.
Finding 8 (Question 7, 10, 12) in the framework of the strategy children, adolescents
They have managed to strengthen their knowledge, skills and attitudes around practice
Ethnopedagogical.
Through the strategy, UNICEF and its implementing partners sought to generate an appropriation of the
Strategy, by developing knowledge, skills and attitudes in NNA around practice
Ethnopedagogical. In order to measure if this impacted, questions were asked to the
Theme in both interviews and focal groups and in surveys. It was found that if there is a before and a
then in NNA, which translates into an appropriation of the strategy in NNA.
• Knowledge
Both students and teachers report that young people acquired knowledge during the
Strategy, related to ethnopedagogical practice. It is stated that the students acquired
A knowledge of the own (culture, territory), with which they did not count before. This knowledge
It goes through the stories that tell the worldview of the community, to know the territory from its
Biodiversity, knowing the origin of Afro -descendant peoples in the territory, among others. By
58
example, in the words of students who were part of the strategy in Cauca and in Chocó, about
The knowledge they acquired:
Before people had them as slaves. It was when the Spaniards enslaved the blacks. The
Spaniards could do what they wanted with blacks and it is important because it represents us
We and we can learn more about that. (Focal Group, Chocó Baccalaureate Students, 2021)
We made a map on our region as a novite with all its rivers its paths corregimientos
etc. (interview, Cauca student, 2021)
In the same way, teachers also notice that following the strategy the NNA have acquired
Knowledge thanks to the ethnoeducation strategy in its educational institutions, knowledge
that they did not have before this. This knowledge is generated from new activities, which
They were not in the classroom plans in a previous way. They are the result of teachers' work, in
sake of generating innovative and didactic content about one's own culture. These noticed during the
Strategy that their own knowledge motivates students to learn new things at school.
We have worked a lot with them, it was the investigation of the ancestral to produce their texts, they from
There they made their stories, their verses, their poems, their songs (interview, teacher Cauca, 2021)
Additionally, students remember activities within the framework of ethnopedagogy, which were
significant pedagogical experiences, which allowed them to acquire some kind of knowledge.
For example, in the didactic tab that was made with children aged 5 to 12, they drew the
Experiences that remember and most marked them. Inside these we find the garden
school, dance, typical dishes, among others.

Also, as evidenced in graph 11, girls, boys and adolescents surveyed consider
in 92.8%14 that have acquired new knowledge about their culture that they did not recognize before, from
of the implementation of the strategy.

• Skills
In addition, it is reported that NNA skills were generated, related to ancestral knowledge
and the offices of the territories. Students feel they learned to do new things
Within the framework of the strategy. They even consider that these skills will be useful for their
School continuation, professional and as members of your community.
I identify myself as Afro -descendant, and have taught me about everything traditional; Mining, Agriculture,
Typical dishes, dance sauce and workshops. It seems important to me because when we go from here to another
part, we can also express things that we live here. (Interview, Student Chocó, 2021)
An important factor on the acquisition of new skills, knowledge and attitudes, is
that this has been acquired thanks to the fact that these issues are discussed in educational institutions.
As evidenced by the responses of girls, boys and adolescents, 90.7% agree15 that these
knowledge is taught in schools.
14 Agree the response options "Totally agree" and "Agree" and the options
"Totally disagree" and "Disagree" were grouped "disagree"

Through the strategy, children and adolescents could draw a life plan
and could be screened in the future, from their individual skills.
We worked a lot of fabric with nuggets making little bites and caught my attention, because most of
population is Afro, but there are indigenous and in those handles a girl mounted her business, but she drove
The bright colors, I had knowledge and she made them, combined them and sold them and there, they learn to
Have more knowledge. One learns a lot from them and the good of those practices, one is going to
benefiting those little moments to strengthen knowledge and create new ones, because they
They learn is about what they are interested in, there, we talk about meaningful learning, they are
They are appropriating their resources, one strengthens them and at the time one goes
strengthening or stimulating them, they are filled with more enthusiasm and will strengthen more
Your knowledge. (Teaching interview, Cauca, 2021)
• Attitudes
On the other hand, teachers also notice a change in students' attitudes in classrooms
class, understand how a change in behavior. Those talk about change
behavioral in situations in class classrooms, where changes in students generated
A more conducive space for learning and in exchange for knowledge.
Through this initiative that brought UNICEF here to our center, we could see that our
students became boys, because they were very shy, I don't know if you noticed with the
Students who have been, were too timid children, they are sorry to talk
Explain and when the proposal of UNICEF arrives, sometimes the boys in front of the teacher do not speak,
But when UNICEF arrived, the boys became very active, participated in the activities.
(Interview, Teacher Chocó, 2021)
61
Similarly, teachers tangible changes in NNA behaviors. As for
example, the relationship of Afro -descendant girls with their hair and the redefinition of stereotypes of
beauty.
On Afro, very beautiful verses about the black woman, as I am, my skin, my hair ... (interview,
Student Chocó, 2021)
I think so, for example I use a lot of turban and almost all girls are little that you
Go with straightening hair. And for example they take out a special day from the Afro -Colombian and dress with
outfits, mine handle a lot of turban and hair like that, they have hair like that, and youth if, I don't know
He feels black for color, but because his ethnic group is really recognized. (Interview, teacher
Chocó 2021)
On the part of girls, adolescents, positive changes are identified in attitudes due to
implementation of the strategy, at first the students recognize that they are of
Agreement16 in 76.3% who have participated in spaces for the construction of pedagogical initiatives,
Regarding their interest in the community, students respond by 82.4% that if they are from
according to that they have interest in the problems of their community, and finally, they perceive in 84.5%
They are more participatory in class. From this, it is identified that from the perception of teachers
and students if there are changes in attitudes in class classrooms and with respect to the vision they have
of your community.

An appropriation of UNICEF's strategy by children and adolescents was generated, girls and adolescents,
motivated by their own knowledge. This appropriation was given in dynamic learning spaces,
where teachers innovated in the activities presented to the students.
Finding 9 (Question 7, 10 and 12) according to interaction with children and adolescents
In the framework of the strategy evaluation, changes in their life projects have been seen.
Considering that the strategy was developed in areas with high multidimensional poverty indices,
Where school dropout is considerable and reduced opportunities, it is common for young people to
Do not have a future life plan. However, within the framework of the strategy, certain
Changes in some young people, where they are projected in the future.
They already have another attitude of wanting to get ahead of wanting to study and do other super different things
To which they were suddenly wanting to do, they are already in another way. (Interview,
Cauca caretaker, 2021)
While it is not the case with all young people impacted by the strategy, they state that, although
Before they were not projected beyond school, after the strategy they imagine possible futures. In
The conversations that were with young people on WhatsApp, they shared some of their
Life projects.
About my life project, because I plan to study fervently until I achieve the goal that I want
That if with God's help, because I do not want to make a living as well as many Q
They depend on mining, or on the street. (WhatsApp Student Testimony Chocó, 2021)
My life project, I plan to continue studying until my goal is to be a nurse and help
To those who need it, continue with the support that my family gives me and I have many projects for
achieve. (WhatsApp Student Testimony Chocó, 2021)

Now, from the consultation of girls, boys and adolescents in students' surveys
obtained the following, 93.8% of this population surveyed claim to agree17 that despite
Difficulties that may arise in life are clear about their life project. 91.7% highlight that
He agrees to "rescue and safeguard my culture is part of my life purpose."

promote learning environments that integrate their own and intercultural knowledge in
your ethnopedagogical practice, despite reports of difficulties with respect to responses from
teachers in the face of changes.
Both in Cauca and Chocó, teachers appropriated the strategy through a
Modification in its traditional pedagogical practice. First, teachers were part of the
Construction or resignification of the PEC, thus contributing their knowledge to this collective construction.
During this process, teachers formed dynamic committees with the other actors
Community- Sabbers and leaders- in order to boost the strategy. There, the importance was reiterated
of ethnoeducation within communities. And, above all, the importance of the role of
Ethnoeducator. This part of the training of the committees served, according to the implementing partners, to
Make a filter of teachers interested in participating in the strategy and those who do not.
17 Agree groups the response options "totally agree" and "agree" and the options "totally in
disagreement "and" disagree "were grouped" disagree "
64
I believe that we as teachers play a very important role, in that sense, because we are
We who must give our students, to announce everything that culture is
Afro -Colombian. (Interview, teacher Cauca, 2021)
From this stage, teachers began to make changes in their pedagogical practice. First
place, the actors of the community began to have, such as support for activities in the
classrooms, that is to say that the community began to be invited, as knowledgeable and leaders, to share their
Knowledge with students. In this sense, for students it was an enriching experience,
since he aroused interest. Counting on the presence of the community in the classrooms, the teachers
they did activities that involved their voices, thus transmitting their knowledge about the
territory.
All students who were in orality were implemented and participated, all the
students, we implemented the happy time, in that students, we brought some of the community some
Knowing and then the students had the opportunity to create, to create stories, create stories.
(Interview, Teacher Chocó, 2021)
Additionally, teachers who participated in the strategy, began to carry out activities in
classrooms and outside them, seeking to train students about their own Afro -descendant culture
and its territory. In this framework, activities such as school gardens, stations of
School radio, typical food activities with families, among others. On the other hand, the
innovation of teachers in class classrooms was seen in the construction of cards and plans
Classroom, both in Chocó and in Cauca. For teachers it was a great motivation to be able
create your own pedagogical content, tailored to your students and their territory. This content
It reflects the connection with one's own culture and the territory. For a teacher in Cauca, this was her
Experience with strategy.
(It is an integrative tool). All UNICEF tools help in class classrooms. The
Teachers share knowledge and find reasons to meet. Since each one has
different experiences and knowledge. Sharing knowledge makes activities
schoolchildren are more participatory. (Focal Group, Cauca Teachers, 2021)
Another opinions of the teachers who met through the survey, is that
They agree18 in 83.5% with which the material and guides received by the strategy have
contributed to the promotion of own and intercultural knowledge. Also, 93.7% agree
Due to the strategy they have more tools to promote these types of environments. Finally,
100% of teachers agree that they are satisfied to promote this
Comprehensive learning environments.

Although teachers feel satisfaction for promoting comprehensive learning environments,
The actors involved in the strategy express that there was resistance from certain teachers
To participate in this. While teachers in general express the need for an education that is
Base in the territory and its own culture, as the strategy was displayed, it was found
a certain difficulty on the part of the implementing partners regarding the participation of teachers.
The latter express a difficulty in the fact that this strategy requires more working hours
On your part, and in general more work. In interviews, the educational community states that
Those who started
From the beginning they, a total resistance because their word is "that is more work", then,
Of course it is more work, because they were disassembled from them and separate more work because
Well, the pedagogical tools had to be adjusted, that is, it had adjusted many things,
Then at the beginning of total resistance, after they go up to the bus, let's say they are more aware
Of the needs of their contributions, of their changes, the latter worked better. (Interview, advisor
Chocó implementing partner, 2021)
It is pointed out that in order to mitigate this resistance by teachers, a
awareness in previous stages of the strategy, where they can appropriate and empower the
process, in order to have greater participation.
Another (lesson learned) is that a great effort and awareness work is required, to fall in love
To the teacher, the manager for the ethnoeducative, yesterday we mentioned it, but that is necessary to do that
exercise and do not stay in an intellectual exercise, but has to do with what the teacher
Like. (Interview, Socio Advisor Implementador Chocó, 2021)
UNICEF facilitated the adoption of ethnopedagogical practices by the teachers who participated
of the strategy. Both the accompaniment and the pedagogical material were provided, so that the
teachers could innovate in their ethnopedagogical practice. It must be considered, of what
way the strategy I have been able to have a greater scope in how much the involvement of teachers,
in order to ensure greater sustainability of the strategy.
66
Finding 11 (Question 8) The institutional adoption of ethnopedagogical initiatives was generated
partially because of the times of the differentiated implementation, however,
From EIs they continue to execute the strategy.
Regarding the institutional adoption of the strategy we see that institutions have different
degrees of adoption of this. First, we find the institutions where the strategy is
He implemented since 2016, achieving a work sustained for approximately four years. In
This case, all stages of the construction or resignification of the PEC were carried out, until they reached the
completion of the processes.
However, when carrying out the focus groups it is also pointed out that in other institutions the
Deferred strategy, causing these processes to be partially due to lack of
time. For example, the cards received the cards after the
completion of the strategy, which implies that no training was given how to use this content
With the students.
Starting the school year since educational institutions begin. In the institutional week, arrive
At the same time, so that the schedule can be institutionalized. ... I would believe that when not entering
In the institutional week, because if we are talking about education and ethnoeducation, we have
to enter the institutional week of all schools, that is, enter in January and end
They in November, but sometimes because of things that come out of the hands, it began that, in July, that
in August and September. (Socio -implementing interview, Cauca, 2021)
Despite this differentiated report, the majority voice reports the continuity of the actions of the
Strategy, it is perceived as a process that is still ongoing and measures continued to be applied in
Virtuality times by COVID and the continuity of actions is projected with the return to the
face -to -face From the voice of a rector, the challenges and the projection of continuity of the
process:
... is that the project must be followed, the project still has challenges and challenges, the more we advance
more things have. We have raised, how do we modernize the project to today's reality?
How do new technologies help us so that the project does not stop as the one that today
Do we have (referring to the virtual modality by Covid)? That is viable. The project wanted to advance
In that, and in that we are .. (Rector interview IE in Cauca, 2021).
Finding 12 (question 9 and 10) the strategy promoted the participation of families in the
Girls, boys and adolescents learning process.
The strategy promoted a greater and more active participation of families in school in
comparison to what was being done, because after the strategy the fathers and mothers were
they link not only as passive agents who come to meetings of fathers and mothers of
family, but were linked to new teaching and learning spaces through activities
led by themselves and building pedagogical tools. It is worth noting that in
Many occasions are the same fathers and mothers who are knowing in their
communities.
67
Then, we begin to have support from the knowledgeable of the community, there is a lot of oral tradition,
So, we start working together to work to create a card; And to support
That booklet had to support the fiercers and within those fiercers are the parents of
family. Then, they work: students, parents and teachers, and although the knowledgeable do not
have children at school they are invited and they arrived at school, we did two or three meetings
times a month and we started building, making a mapping from the region, looking at the historical part,
Looking at the sites of interest at the municipality's level, we not only looked at the sidewalk, but the whole
municipality, we looked at the strengths of the community, medicinal plants, the wealth of the
gastronomy, the dances and here there are girls who have taken that from their grandmothers, in particular I have
To my niece, the grandmother is a singer and she has taken that part, make presentations. (Interview
Teacher, Cauca, 2021)
Some of the activities, apart from the construction of the cards, of which they were participating
They are, for example:
Well, my family went to what the meetings were ... the people of the community council or people
From other neighborhoods came here, I don't know for example if they did any activity we are going to make food,
We are going to do a sowing or come day that someone who is going to talk to you will come, I was going to count
The stories of our elders, of our ancestors. (Interview, Student Chocó, 2021)
The activities that were attended by fathers and mothers too
They permeated their own homes. There are those who tried to reproduce this knowledge on the outside of
The educational institution.
We try to return these ancestral arts, to say something: we will work on the ancestral games, the
Toys and games and they gather and do family activities. What is strengthened there? HE
They strengthen intergenerational dialogues, because generally those who know are the elderly. By
Example: How were the cars before? Then, a cardboard box arrives, they put tires, they make them
On paper and it is a beautiful job, because they do it with the elderly, I am talking about grandparents and grandchildren
And even great -grandchildren and that is the beautiful thing about practice. (Interview, Teacher Chocó, 2021)
How mother of family because I participated taking this to my home, like my house, with my children, looking
that are things that we have to go following them as implementing or leading them to the
families and do not miss as you are traditions, like things like that. (…) Union, a lot of union because
In this they all participated, those of the house from helping to design a dress, from helping to design what
That the girl is going to take, what she is going to say, so it was like a family union because everyone
They participated, they all gave their grain of sand. (Interview, mother caregiver, Timba, Cauca, 2021)
When investigating changes in the commitment of families around education,
teachers perceive that the three main ones are around that the families feel more welcomed
In educational institutions, specifically these changes are, families consider that
families are more aware of the educational process of girls and boys, families participate more
In the learning and meeting spaces offered by school and families feel more
involved in students' school life.

In this order of ideas, to the participation of families in new learning spaces and
teaching was a novelty and achievement that promoted the strategy, although, as described in
The finding 3 of relevance, is still expected by the educational community a major
participation and disposition of families. In this sense it is considered that the progress was evident,
Although the challenge is continuity and re -summon and keep this link active.
Finding 13 (Question 9) The articulation with traditional authorities and institutions
educational was positively evaluated by the beneficiaries, however, it is perceived that
He lacked articulation with national and local authorities.
• Traditional authorities
From the strategy, articulation of educational institutions with the authorities were strengthened
traditional in the territories. While the Ministry of National Education contemplates that the Councils
community are closely related to the functioning of institutions
Educational, with the strategy this articulation was sought to strengthen. From the initial stages of
The strategy was involved in community councils and communal action boards in the
construction of the PEC and in the discussions around ethnoeducation in the territories, for the sake of
ensure a community construction.
“The entire institution is under the orientations of the Yarumito Community Council, which covers the 4
of rural areas and here, in the two venues the new norm applies; Teachers to be linked
They need guarantee of the Community Council. In the bulk of the country the phenomenon can be presented, but
Only those of rural zone, but here it is for all, rural and urban. That is very important for us,
Because it promotes, recognizes authority and prints some commitment from the point of view
69
ethnic. It shows that the authority is here and helps in the academic and formative process, that
It is a very important peculiarity. " (Interview, Rector Cauca, 2021)
Additionally, these actors facilitated community spaces for the development of activities
Pedagogical in the framework of the strategy, contributing to innovation in teachers pedagogy
and teachers. This involvement of traditional authorities with the educational community,
He led to the presence of these territorial authorities in class classrooms, facilitating
Intergenerational Exchanges of Knowledge. Even, in the case of the San Educational Institution
Antonio in Cauca, a seedbed was created between the traditional authorities of the territory and the
students.
The Community Council, the Board and are the students and from there arises a seedbed that
We have three seedbeds, those seedlings we train them, we carry them we have agreement with
The University of Cauca, with the University of the Valley and we have an agreement with Unicomfacauca,
So we move in that sense of recognition and also the peeled taught
Research and the peeled have here an ability to speak, to say, to tell us and to them
They like it. " (Interview, Rector Cauca, 2021)
Traditional authorities have also contributed to the construction of public policies in the
Frame of the ethnoeducation tables, promoted by UNICEF and its implementing partners.
At that table there are seats of community council and organizations, so the northern region there are 4
delegates, two of community council, one of PCN and there is a person from Uafroc and the other delegates
They are from the other 4 areas where there is trend of the Afros of the department of Cauca. (Interview,
Cauca Ethnoeducation Table, 2021)
• National and local authorities
The Secretariats of Education made an accompaniment to the strategy, following the guidelines
of the Ministry of National Education. This accompaniment was given in the Technical Secretariat of the
Ethnoeducation tables, providing the guidelines for the construction of public policies of
Ethnoeducation. The secretariats were present at the initial moments of the strategy,
Accompaniment in community construction and the awareness of communities.
It is a project that starts hand in hand with Secretariat of Education, then permanently
We are in contact at meetings. In fact, UNICEF always came to meetings and
Socializations of the project and to listen, to listen to the institutions let's say so in relation to the
Project advance frame, that always happened. With many difficulties, with few difficulties and without
No difficulty in some moments, but there was always a communication because always
There were Secretariats of Education. (Interview, Socio Advisor Implementador Chocó, 2021)
However, the continuity of the articulation with the secretariats was affected by the change
constant of officials, which does not necessarily translate into a rupture of the processes. That is to say
that the articulation with the strategy was affected by external causes, of political situations
Changing in the departments.
Suddenly we had a little, problems for abrupt changes, I call, because we had
a departmental education secretary every 6 months, then it was time to do the feedback
Every time he entered. (Interview, Implementing Partner, Cauca, 2021)
70
Additionally, for educational personnel, it was a difficulty during the strategy to follow at the same time the
Guidelines of the Ministry of National Education, and carry out the PEC. Since they consider that, yes
They deviate from the PEI, they would be harming their students. For greater harmony between in Pei and the PEC, I know
I would need a greater agreement with the secretariats, in order to reach a collective construction
that contemplates the two educational models, solving that feeling of contradiction that they feel
Teachers.
Referring to the Secretary and the Ministry of National Education, they have lacked to articulate that knowledge
to educational establishments, although an ethno-pedagogical route is being proposed, in the material
that we arrive when we do self -assessment, when we make improvement plans
They send us a Pi route, a Pi route continues to arrive, from each of the moments to build
A PI, so if we see a Pi and a PEC are two different tools in its structure, the PI comes
more broken
volume and easy to understand ethno-educational policy. If the same secretariat is
Profile for ethno - educational processes, you must generate the documents that are consistent with that.
(Focal Group, Cauca Educational Institution, 2021)
While during the strategy there was a good relationship with the secretariats, allowing the realization
of pedagogical activities and political consultation spaces, this articulation was not what
solid enough to culminate in the registration of the PECs in the secretariats. It is a process
which continues, driven by the implementing partners.
Finding 14 (question 9) Strategy monitoring actions did not represent a
central instance for the periodic review of shares from the partners and from the
Educational institutions.
The implementing partners and their respective advisors report that there was constant monitoring
of the strategy during the implementation. This monitoring action was given through visits to the
territory and application of instruments for this purpose. The implementing partners traveled to

Community actors, in order to identify bottlenecks in the implementation and take
Actions. Another alternative form of monitoring that the two partners carried out together with the
institutions was the realization of reports of the meetings and the activities carried out in
territory. In parallel, UNICEF also visited the territory to make its own
Monitoring and monitoring of the ethnoeducation strategy, both in Cauca and Chocó.
The dynamics was, for example of each activity that was done, each workshop, a report was presented
detailed what was done, of planning, execution and specific reports of
Each activity, then those reports were part of the monitoring, was information that reached him
Region Corporation to systematize it. Also as part of the monitoring I mention the visits to the
territory to meet with communities, with education secretariats, with institutions
Educational, to move forward, even supporting when the occasional difficulty was presented.
(Interview, Socio Advisor Implementador Chocó, 2021)
In the documentary review, it can be evidenced that Uafroc followed up and monitoring from
of a control board, where the four components are measured: relevance, effectiveness,
Sustainability and transversalization of approaches D.D.H.H and gender. However, in the case of
Corporation Region is not evidenced by this monitoring action through a control board. HE
71
presents as a difficulty when making measurements not to have a unified mechanism
of monitoring.
A similarity in Cauca and Chocó, is that they did not generate a culture of monitoring within the
Educational institutions. In the interviews that were conducted to the rectors of these IE, they point out
that an institutional capacity in monitoring was not installed. This is why today, after
Two years of completion of the strategy, IE do not carry out a monitoring action
completely defined of its ethnopedagogical component.
Effective index
This index is made up of 3 indicators, the compilation of these indicators was built from
according to the effects expected by the ethnoeducation strategy, they also evaluate whether
offered through implementation, quality school learning environments that dialogue with
the interculturality of the territories. Specifically the first indicator, refers to adoption
Institutional of Ethnocurriculas within the framework of the PEC. The second indicator is related to the
promotion of learning environments where their own knowledge and interculturality of
Communities, by teachers. The third indicator, refers to practice
antipedagogical and perceived changes in the learning of children and adolescents in
Relationship with the strengthening of their cultural identity and life projects.

In the case of this index, a 66.2%score was obtained, which places the index on the high scale of
effectiveness. This value indicates that the strategy throughout planning and implementation improves
educational conditions of the beneficiary population, such as girls, boys, adolescents, teachers,
teachers, educational institutions, knowledgeable, own authorities, because through products
and actions manage to permeate in order to meet the objective of achieving the resignification of the PEC.
Likewise, this index allows to demonstrate that the assessment by students and teachers, on
perceived changes in comprehensive education promotion, is positive and that the level of progress of the
Strategy is in an advanced state. However, actions are still

A factor to highlight on the score of this indicator is related to finding 11 of effectiveness,
Well, although this adoption has been achieved partially in educational institutions, the time
of implementation have not been the same for all institutions, a fact that generates not

Indicator reflects that both students and teachers, perceive that within class classrooms have
There had been a relevant change regarding the promotion of comprehensive learning environments.
Likewise, teachers express that they have managed to make this change in practice

Find 15: (Question 13) Educational institutions felt their
capacities with the implementation of the strategy.
One of the achievements throughout the strategy was the implementation of the PEC route with the
Technical accompaniment that provided from UNICEF, Uafroc and Corporation Region. This
Initiative influence the strengthening of EI capacities, which arise from processes
of training to teachers in ethnodevelopment, the creation of own tools contextualized with
Culture, the development of meeting spaces that propitiate the dialogue of knowledge. In turn
Implementation of the PEC route had effects on the emergence of young leaders, in strengthening
of existing leaders and in the articulation with these.
We enter without a PEC route, we have an advance of a PEC or PEA route, we have tools
own educational, we have an installed base capacity, we have teachers
potentialized and strengthened in ethnoeducative processes, we have new young leaders who
The community councils are already being articulated with a strong ethnic rights framework, with a
Strong ethnoeducation framework, we have strengthened and respected knowledgeable from the institution
educational or education secretariats, we have cultural leaders who are articulated to all
These processes. (Interview, Implementing Partner, Cauca, 2021)
The PEC route was the opportunity for teachers to adapt the guidelines of the Ministry of
Education in order to transform them into new focused towards their own culture, although this
It was resistance from the same teachers. Throughout the process they were expanded
The conceptions about education and ethnoeducation.
And as for the part, let's say structural, also the PEC document, we have a material
Power Point that says "from Pei a PEC", how the structure of the PEI, to break with this resistance, how
The structure of the PEI passes to PEC. But here it is reflected, because sometimes they told us “teacher, but it is that
In the PEI is this and why it is not reflected ”, because if we went to do another pei for what
We do projects; We would have stayed with the PEI as it was. So there was that contribution
To these guidelines and the other important contribution was like the same attitude, the mentality that
I mentioned, that openness in many teachers to host the process and start
function as in this logic of the ethnoeducational. (Interview, Implementing Partner, Chocó, 2021)
In interviews some ethnopedagogical practices and some processes of
Systematization
The other big exercise was the investigation, the research made by the teachers with the
Accompaniment of UNICEF, Corporation Region to systematize their experiences, product of that
I work today we have experiences in the systematized teachers that allows us to identify
77
really where is the transformation of classroom practice, where is the transformation of the
Classroom planning, where the teacher was able to identify those elements that the territory has and that
They would be very useful for work with boys and girls. (Interview, Implementing Partner, Chocó,
2021)
Additionally, although in the institutions there was an installed capacity thanks to the strategy and
teachers have said they have a strengthened and dynamic speech around ethnoeducation
It is pertinent to bring up that the sustainability indicator 2 is 66% because there are difficulties in
The transmission and knowledge management described in finding 19.
Now, it was previously named that systematization is a mechanism to sustain the
Knowledge in time teachers and teachers believe that in 55.7% the
physical or virtual systematization of information on ethnopedagogical practice, on the contrary
Teachers and teachers do identify at 91.2% and 78.5% that if classroom plans and plans have been generated
of institutional areas that are compressible for the educational campus, and have been built and designed
Institutional improvement routes. Despite still strengthening some of the mechanisms, these have

Finding 16: (Question 13) The strategy encouraged the ethnoeducation speech in the
Education Secretariats.
Although the Secretaries of Education of Cauca and Chocó had already been advancing actions to provide
An education framed within its own culture, as is the implementation of the cathedral
of Afro-Colombian studies that aims to “exalt the historical-cultural contributions,
ancestral and current of Afro -Colombian communities ”(Decree 1122 of 1998), the strategy
He energized and encouraged discussion around ethnoeducation as a community project of
Collective construction especially in Chocó.
78
Then we assume ethnoeducation beyond the Afro -Colombian study chair as
The possibility of working a bit from integrality, that peoples have to understand their
conceptions, but also as a people that have a relationship with the territory, with its reality
social, with nature, then what we do is go further; That is why the importance of
Build what we call an OPEC community educational project that allows us to transcend what
It is the chair understood as an accumulated from content, but perhaps an accumulated of
Strategies that allow the knowledge of black in the establishments to be put on stage
educational, we go here further, not only the content, but life itself and then
work linguistic diversity, work for autonomy, that ethnic groups can develop
They themselves their projects. (Interview, Ethnoeducation Table, Chocó, 2021)
On the side of the secretary of Cauca it is recognized that the strategy left some guidelines and
Basic knowledge to "build the true Afro Educational Project" because the PEI built
More than 20 years ago we are already pertinent as perceived from the Ministry of Education of the
Cauca.
(…) He left managers and teachers these basic elements to build the real
Afro educational project, which would not become that PEI control, which will not continue that PEI control of
Twenty -one of years ago when Law 115 was born (…) Another thing that Simona rescue is the mobility that
You must have that project, this project is not an untouchable sacred document that must be placed in
The cleaner library corner and that nothing comes, no, that has to be a document
dynamic that is being feed daily with what has been happening from the different
efforts or parts of it, I rescued, I rescued and continue to rescue. (Interview, Secretariat of
Cauca, 2021)
Additionally, from the Secretary of Education of Cauca the value and need of the
Differential education based on their own knowledge.
(…) What we have to see is that ethnic education leads us to a differential education, it does not mean
That we are going to change theoretical concepts, there are concepts that are standards, but it is how you have
In mind the needs: how we return stronger, how we begin to make that contribution of the sector
educational is strong in that conservation of that culture, in that conservation of that Afro culture, which
Education does not become a counter to hide that differential wealth in black, so that
It is one of the needs that follows (...) because it has been many years, many years
Simona where they have tried to insert other things to get into another world, in another world
cultural, in another educational world, to the point that our communities do not see their
context, they are not important that from their places that have had a lifetime they can grow and
They can contribute to society. (Interview, Secretary of Cauca, 2021)
Finally, from the perspective of the teachers surveyed they consider that in 19.0%
It was totally adequate and in 58.2% adequate, the way in which the strategy managed to promote that the
Secretariat of Education provides technical assistance to implement ethnoeducation models.
Thus, it is perceived that from the Secretariats if an ethnoeducation speech was promoted and that this
contributed to get involved in the implementation of models of ethnoeducational practice.

Find 17: (Question 13) Ethnoeducation tables were promoted within the framework of the
Implementation of the strategy.
Both in Cauca and Chocó, the beneficiaries report that with the strategy it was possible to boost the
Ethnoeducation tables, led from the Secretariats of Education. While the concept of tables
Ethnoeducation is not born with UNICEF, these did not work dynamically before the strategy.
The table serves as a public policy discussion space around education, and as a
Work space for actors involved as social organizations, leaders and secretariats
In the territory.
The ethnoeducation tables for example that were super valuable scenarios, both in Choco and in the
Cauca, who gathered everyone, all organizations that worked on the subject, which were achieved
Make work plans, share methodologies and we are going very well even with leaderships from
own people of the Secretariat. (Interview, UNICEF, 2021)
• Cauca
In Cauca, although an ethnoeducation table wanted to be made, it had not been able to consolidate
formally. The actors involved, report that the formal consolidation of the table could take
carried out thanks to the UNICEF strategy, since the operational aspects were encouraged to be resolved
and sensitization in the secretariats, to be able to install the table from the leadership of Uafroc. The
Table is made up of Afro -descendant leaders, who discuss public policy for
For the Afro -descendant population, specifically.
Then I would say that in a certain way who encourages for the table to become public policy was
From the dynamics of UOafroc, of UNICEF. (…), Because we have begun to reference the need for
Education is really more in relation to the problem of context, one of the tasks that today has
The educational table is all those exercises that organizations have been carrying out from their
Communities end up being somewhat something to consolidate public policy. (Interview, table
Ethnoeducation, 2021)
80
• Chocó
In Chocó, the ethnoeducation table has been consolidated for more than a decade accompanied
by the Ministry of Education. In this department there was a prior development to the strategy, in
Ethnoeducation issues accompanied by the Secretariat of Education of Quibdó. HE
They advanced important processes in the high Atrato. UNICEF contributed to energize this space,
as a space for discussion and construction of public policies in relation to institutions in
which focused the strategy. With this, the link between the educational institution and
the ethnoeducation table, to promote the construction of public policy on issues of
Afro -descendant ethnoeducation. However, this space could not be resumed by pandemic
Integrally, it is in process.
With UNICEF we were able to find and articulate with them that work that projected us to carry out.
(Interview, Ministry of Education, Chocó, 2021)
Thus the strategy has already finished, UNICEF contributed to promoting these ethnoeducation tables of
in the territories. It is an important space for the maintenance and innovation of the initiatives of
Ethnoeducation in Chocó and Cauca. Now, this work in these spaces is working
more slowly because of the pandemic.
Find 18: (Question 13 and 15) The strategy shows signs of appropriation in the actors
participants.
Teachers, managers and educational institutions have adopted sensibilities around what has
Assumption the strategy, on the one hand, there are clarities about what is ethnoeducation, about the appropriate
which is to include in their classroom plans the knowledge and knowledge of the community, about the importance
to develop activities with knowledgeable and families and on the other hand, they have created different strategies
for the implementation of ethnopedagogical practices that encourage knowledge of practices and
ancestral knowledge.
As success, the inclusion of the project in the PI, inclusion of the community in the project, the community
in general, and the different curricular strategies implemented by the various teachers of the
institution, because each one having visualized what the project is can lead to class and
Share it with the student. (Focal Group, Cauca, 2021)
Through the strategy, the pedagogical components of the
Chairs, for some teachers it is transversal to include practices and knowledge within their curricula,
Among the relevant issues that were included in their ethnopedagogical practices, they come to light
Interviews: medicinal plants, traditional foods, typical costumes, dances, music, places of
Cultural importance and artisanal mining.
The essence of the ethnoeducation project was that it showed us that we had to value the territory,
Where we were, because in this territory we have everything, what we needed was to take love,
take affection, and try to develop activities within the context, that when we went to
Talk, to tell something about any activity to tell, children will be told what we
We have here in our environment, what is Borojó, what is the chontaduro, what is the marañón, then
They are activities that one by one were channeling and today we always asked teachers that
Examples do them with what we have in the middle. (Interview, rector IE, Cauca, 2021)
81
In this sense, there are significant changes in the classroom, the teacher has appropriate the strategy and many
From them they have pledged to work from the community, the teachers were established in teachers
possibility of teaching through the own, of the territory, of their knowledge, with its own social reality
and with nature around them. Even the teachers have included in classroom activities
their own knowledge about the territory and the different traditional practices.
Teachers have also started using their knowledge to adjust their curriculum, they
They have also made contributions, inclusive, there is one that taught us to make the mass meals, they were going
to her house and did the exercise and then went to sell their selected products, she
I had all the experience how it should be done, how it was ground, how it was done. (Teaching interview
IE, Cauca, 2021)
Find 19: (Question 14 and 16): Difficulty in knowledge management is evidenced in
Educational institutions to train teachers.
It is evident that the implementing partners contributed to building pedagogical content of
Participatory form with the educational community of IE where the strategy took place. During the
Construction process of this content, training was given to teachers, to
Empower them as researchers from their own territory and their culture. This resulted in modifications
of teachers's classroom plans and innovation in traditional pedagogy, adding cards
and new forms of transmission of knowledge.
In interviews and surveys, teachers express that although this pedagogical material was a
Innovation in class classrooms, this is not always used once the strategy is finished. They manifest
that there is no established mechanism for the transmission of knowledge among teachers,
which causes a break in ethnopedagogical practice every time a new teacher arrives at IE,
since there are no formal transmission spaces for new teachers. A difficulty in
replicate knowledge and training acquired during the strategy by teachers a
Once the strategy is over.
One of the lines would be like support in the training of teachers, fall in love with the teacher
for the ethnoeducative, because the ethnoeducative does not only go through academic, but also by
The attitude, for desire, wanting ours. Find one sometimes teachers who say is not that that
It's like going back to the past. Ethnoeducation is like those old things, so really how
achieve empowering the teacher and that mentality varying? (Interview, Implementing Partner,
Chocó, 2021)
Some alternatives were highlighted to strengthen this training process for the case of Chocó:
There is a big challenge in terms of training of teachers, I believe that this proposal for
Ethnoeducation should be very force on the upper normal of the department
Del Chocó that are, eh say, those who will be generating say teachers and teachers, that has been
Advanced in something (interview, implementing partner, Chocó, 2021).

Although with the implementation of the strategy, new ways of building and applying were activated
educational materials based on their own, some actors consider that there are challenges in the application
of classroom plans and update or generation of new ones to keep the strategy
Ethnoeducational in classrooms.
Find 20: (Question 14 and 16): The educational community perceives that it is necessary to strengthen the
articulation channels with education secretariats
Although education secretariats have been an important ally of the implementing partners in
The territories, the educational community highlights that it is necessary to strengthen the articulation channels
With the secretariats, once the strategy is finished.
First, in the academic part, teachers state that you need to find a
Aarmony between PEC and PEI in conjunction with the Ministry of Education. Since for them
teachers can continue applying the PEC from the institutions, this has to be recognized
by the secretariats.
Referring to the Secretary and the Ministry of National Education, they have lacked to articulate that knowledge
to educational establishments, although an ethnopedagogical route is being proposed, in the material
that we arrive when we do self -assessment, when we make improvement plans
They send us a Pi route, a Pi route continues to arrive, from each of the moments to build

volume and easy to understand ethnoeducational policy. If the same secretariat is
Profile for ethno - educational processes, you must generate the documents that are consistent with that.
(Focal Group, IE, Cauca, 2021)
On the other hand, the educational community perceives that since the end of the strategy, it has not been
continued with the articulation with educational institutions, which would allow continuity to
processes established with UNICEF and the implementing partners in participation spaces
Afro -descendants.
Because I think that, although the external people came to build that, we must give it
monitoring to be sustainable, in terms of strategy, it has simply stayed there, the
efforts to sustain it come from the institution, in the municipal administration they have not seen the
importance. (Focal Group, IE, Chocó, 2021)
Finding 21: (Question 15) The strategy is evidenced as a process that continues
The ethnoeducation strategy is a process that continues to walk, so the project has already finished
formally by UNICEF. From the institutions, continuity has been given to those established
during the strategy, such as the collective construction of pedagogical material and the investigation of the
teachers within the framework of ethnopedagogy. The implementing partners, allies in the territory for
Educational institutions and the educational community in general, have served as support to give
continuity to these processes.
Well, there is a responsibility because they in one way or another are an Afro organization and as such
From the person, of being as such there is a responsibility that continues to be accompanied. Of
Fact, the project stopped, but one is still called indirectly, and because if it arrives in any
Moment to continuity await us with open doors. I say the commitments are going
Beyond the papers, the commitment is to the community, with the people, with their leaders and that
It has more weight than anything else. (Interview, Implementing Partner, Cauca, 2021)
The selection of the implementing partners by UNICEF is presented as a certain
The point of view of continuing the processes initiated by the strategy in the territories. The
Implementing partners contribute to the sustainability of the strategy in Cauca and Chocó. In the
Two departments report continuity actions, projections to strengthen the work of
face to the beginning of face -to -face and challenges in ethnoeducation in the classrooms.
The actors highlight that the results of the strategy in addition to continuing to strengthen
A path that gives continuity potential, as highlighted from the national institutionality:
As results are these proposals in Cauca with UOAFroc that the Ministry can resume
From there and have a good level of organization in the territory. All discussions and debates in
It crashed on ethnoculture, that helps systematize this experience and build things and move forward from
There, having methodologies, tools and strategies quite strengthens what to make of them
organizations because we finally do not propose the methodology rigidly, since the
same communities design in the framework of their autonomy. (Men interview, 2021).
Sustainability Index
This index evaluates the possibility of continuity of the strategy in the time after the
implementation. The indicators that are raised for the construction of this index are related,
84
with technical strengthening to departmental education secretariats, and with how the community
Educational perceives the possibility of continuity of the strategy in educational institutions.
Below is an illustration summary of this index where the
indicators that compose them, their acronym, the information collection method and the units of
analysis.
Illustration 5. Sustainability Index Structure
Preparation: UT ISEGORIA- Ethnollano Foundation
The value of the index of is 77.6%, a score that is located in the very high range of the scale of
sustainability. This sustainability value shows two main facts, first, that the strategy
contributed to the technical strengthening of its allies and with this allow continuity. Second, that
possibility of continuity increases as the actors feel greater appropriation of the
Strategy, because it allows new initiatives to be generated over time and continue
Autonomous with processes. These factors show a positive balance for sustainability,
because although there are still elements to strengthen as with the local and national institutional articulation,
The commitment of the different actors of the educational community is observed to achieve a
Comprehensive Education

ELABORATION: UT ISEGORIA-ETNOLANO
Finding 22 (question 18): the framework of the strategy (planning, implementation,
monitoring) is given in a novel rights and gender approach in the territories
Given the nature of UNICEF on being guarantor of the rights of girls, boys and adolescents, it is
vital that in the programs, projects, strategies and research that they develop in the territories
have a rights component. In the case of the ethnoeducation strategy, from
Its planning and recognition of the municipalities, it is prioritized that a strengthening should be made
in the right to participation of girls, children and adolescents through the transversalization of the
Gender and Human approach, according to UNICEF officer to work with this approach allows to open the
88
discussion about the meaning of participating and being heard, and in turn allows you to strengthen practices
such as non -discrimination, multicultural recognition, and even guaranteeing the right to
own education.
For us it was very clear to have a very large focus of participation, to understand the right to
participation of different levels and in that understand the right to participation to be able to work with
boys, girls and adolescents through ethnopedagogical peace initiatives that were the
excuse to open the discussion of what it means to participate and the value of participating in the
school. (Education Officer, UNICEF, 2021)
Now, the peculiarity of introducing these approaches to the strategy caused a novel event
In educational institutions, since the way in which it was developed, even
It is emphasized that it was well received by teachers and students. During field work with these
teachers and students identified that activities and talks were innovative to introduce
and generate appropriation of the subjects of gender roles, non -sexist practices and resolution of
Conflicts One of the points to highlight was the importance of generating technical strengthening, as
teachers surveyed recognize 87.3% that the support of tutors, contributed to improve
Pedagogical practice in the relationship with the transformation of gender roles and sexist practices.

With what is observed in teachers' responses it reveals that there is an appropriation of the approach of
gender and human rights, and that is evidenced in learning environments, and although it was a
Innovative theme was able to introduce ethnopedagogical practices.

UNICEF, through the ethnoeducation strategy, managed to permeate and generate in the community
Educational, especially in teachers and students, an interest in gender and human rights.
During planning, implementation and monitoring, it was made clear that one of the interests of the
Strategy was to strengthen institutions on these issues, and leave a precedent for
same institutions will adapt methodologies and continue with the appropriation to create environments
of more inclusive and safe learning for children.
Finding 23 (question 18): the actions of the strategy related to resolution of
conflicts in IE, are valued as a deep change in the educational community and
Children, adolescents.
One of the most relevant aspects for the educational community within the framework of the strategy were
actions related to conflict resolution, although some actions were carried out
With peace managers some actors relate it to the strategy. Both Uafroc and Corporation
Region had in conflict resolution component, such as a key component of the
Strategy.
In interviews, the educational community said that one of the difficulties in institutions in
The day to day, it was the coexistence in class classrooms. This coexistence was problematic among students,
but also among teachers and students. Thanks to the coexistence initiatives, the students of each
institution learned methods to arbitrate their own conflicts, and give them the best
way, without going through physical violence.
I stay with the resolution of conflicts between young people, a lot that improved discipline in the
institution, the boys took the lead and they saw that fellow minors were in
Riña, they approached them, they spoke to them, that is very strengthening in an institution (Focal Group, teachers
Cauca, 2021)
Begins in the name of the name or in each educational institution it was not called as such but
He had a reflection. Young people have an active participation in the choice of these names and in
Give some guidelines, so that part was very pretty and above all it arranged because let's say that
90
The coexistence manuals were always imposed and were never built in a way
Community, joint; They were not socialized in the best way, it was not taken into account for example good
that is, there are, that every year they make adjustments, socialize them. It was like a dead document, let's say, here
A resignification of all that part and a participation of young people was achieved.
(Interview, Implementing Partner, Cauca, 2021)
Similarly, students are evidenced how girls, boys and adolescents have
A favorable perception of conflict resolution, that is, they have a favorable vision
to promote peaceful environments within educational institutions, specifically,
students consider 95.9% that dialogue is the best option to solve a problem and in
99% that is important during a problem to understand what is happening.

Find 24 (Question 18): The strategy managed to introduce the gender issue through
DIDACTIC ACTIVITIES AND MATERIALS
From the planning and implementation of strategy, the transversalization of the
gender approach, a fact that from the beginning made implementing partners take into account that
The strategy to be able to introduce this approach should be didactic and through activities that
generate impact on educational institutions.
Well, the gender part that was most worked were two lines. One of the lines was participation
of the girls and the other was inclusion of girls in all processes. So the participation of the
Girls was very important because they empowered spaces that were only led by the boys.
And empathy towards girls regarding the importance of the menstrual cycle and that did not compete no more
To the girl, but everyone who surrounded her. We talked about gender, but we did not leave the children apart.
(Interview, Cauca implementing partner, 2021)
Taking into account the above, and from teachers surveys it is identified that 90% of the
teachers consider that from the ethnoeducation strategy, “improving access and
appropriation of teachers of pedagogical tools for the transformation of roles and
gender relations in the school environment ”, favorable to carry out a comprehensive strategy that
Promotes ethnopedagogical practices with a gender approach.

Yes, I think it was also like not doing as sometimes people but how to integrate them
And it makes us known the importance of other people and how to integrate it and never discriminate against a
person for their gender, because they are their tastes and then we are nobody to judge and if I remember that
part that talked about gender and how we relate and how we treat people and
Well, it made us see that we are all the same and that there is no difference in case a person
He likes another person of the same sex or stereotypes. (...) We don't have to go for a stereotype
Let society put in itself, but how to love us as we are and love people who have tastes
different too. (Interview, Baccalaureate student, Cauca, 2021)

Find 25 (Question 18): A need for the tools arranged is evidenced
For the transversalization of the gender and human rights approach, they reach the entire
Educational Community
One of the most felt needs identified during interviews with different actors than
They were part of the strategy, it was that the activities, sensitizations and pedagogical tools
On the transversalization of the gender approach and Humanness, it manages to reach fathers and mothers,
caregivers, knowledgeable and traditional authorities because so far it is identified that
The people who have the greatest appropriation and knowledge about these approaches are teachers,
IE directives and students. Also, during interviews it is identified that although parents and
mothers, caregivers, knowledgeable, and traditional authorities have attended
Activities to introduce these issues, the topics are still confused.
From the purpose of UNICEF on transversalization of the gender and human rights approach, it is large
Importance that the entire educational community is permeated and appropriate of these approaches,
they understand their value to build safe environments, which guarantee the rights of people and in
special girls, boys and adolescents.
Transversalization index of gender and human rights approaches
This index evaluates whether throughout the planning and implementation of the strategy, the
Gender and human rights approaches. Additionally, it is taken into account if the actions allowed the
ethnopedagogical initiatives will have these approaches, if they were designed and implemented
Methodologies to improve pedagogical practices in favor of gender roles transformation
and discriminatory practices and that you are allowed to be promoted by teachers.
Finally, it is evaluated if changes in girls, boys and adolescents are perceived in related issues
with the peaceful resolution of conflicts, transformation of gender roles and sexist practices.
These elements will be identified through the perception of students, teachers, and the review of
Secondary sources. The illustration 6 summarizes the transversalization index of the approaches of

5. Conclusions
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS
The strategy was from most actors reported and felt as a process. From his
planning and start of the implementation, the way it was developing represented a series
of challenges, difficulties, adjustments; that apart from operational challenges implied that it has appropriated
as a process, and as such it is still considered active in its implementation. This possibility of
adequacy and specific forms in which each educational institution developed it can today
evidence as an appropriation potential of the initiative.
Relevance
The strategy is framed in the national, departmental ethnoeducation regulations and
even local. In addition to the needs and desires of the same community which makes its
implementation is felt highly relevant. In some contexts it represented a speech
novel and expected or desired, and in other cases categorical support to incipient processes from the
same vision, so it can be concluded that the strategy was of high cultural relevance.
Additionally, the strategy was implemented in municipalities with poverty rates
multidimensional, with latent problems in education in which ethnoeducation is
highly relevant to children and adolescents of the territory. The ethnoeducation strategy
It was a core mission on which the work was focused from IE in recent years and this process
It was felt as a change that led to the strengthening of the union between the school and the community,
creating an educational environment conducive to the dissemination and learning of their own knowledge.
Additionally, the choice of the implementing partners, under their previous experience in
The territory and the key issues of the strategy, such as ethnoeducation, coexistence and gender, was
relevant to guarantee the priority of these components in the implementation.
Effectiveness
In the implementation of the strategy, the construction or
Resignification of the PEC, thus allowing the participation of the educational and community community
in general. This resignification implied the empowerment of teachers, as researchers from
The knowledge of their own territory and transmitters of these, through pedagogical practices
innovative and participatory. Which is perceived as a good strategy to generate
Knowledge of the own from the participation of the community. Children, and adolescents
Afro -descendants responded to these changes in pedagogy in a positive way, since
Evidence that knowledge, knowledge and skills were generated in this population group. The
young people point out that during the strategy there were transformations in their life plans, allowing
greater visualization in the future.
Regarding the appropriation of the strategy, different scenarios were presented in the community
Educational In educational institutions, an appropriation of knowledge and
methodologies by the educational community, allowing a good implementation of the
Strategy. Although, resistance was evidenced by teachers, to participate in the
Strategy and teachers formations that it requires, which is considered as a difficulty
100
In the implementation considering that teachers are essential to carry out the objectives
Drawed in the planning stage. Additionally, no monitoring methods and
Internal monitoring in educational institutions.
Institutional articulations during the strategy were strategically, allowing
an implementation of this in the territories. An essential articulation was given with the advice
Community, a crucial ally in the selection of teaching staff and guidelines in
Ethnoeducation in communities. On the other hand, the Secretariats of Education of Cauca and Chocó
They were allies of the implementing partners, seeking to boost ethnoeducation jointly.
Sustainability
UNICEF and its implementing partners left capabilities installed both in institutions and
In teachers, thus allowing the sustainability of the strategy in the territories. Besides, I know
promoted an environment for the sustainability of the strategy, by deepening the speech of the
Ethnoeducation in the Secretariats of Education, in the two departments. They were also energized
Ethnoeducation tables, allowing a work space where policies are built
public referring to ethnoeducation for Afro -descendant peoples where the
implementation.
In order to ensure greater sustainability of the strategy, it is considered that the channels of
Communication The Secretariats of Education could be strengthened in order to give validation
administrative to the PEC in the Secretariats, thus promoting its use in the educational institutions later
After the strategy.
Gender and Humanness
Through the ethnoeducation strategy, a first and great approach to the
Educational community to leave installed capacity on gender and human rights approaches. In
Special are teachers and students who have greater appropriation of these approaches, these
new knowledge is evidenced first, in the changes of the learning environments that are
stimulate by teachers, and second, by students who express their
knowledge with the way they currently relate to other people and themselves.
Likewise, the strategy allowed the knowledge of gender approach and human rights to strengthen
at the institutional level, as rectors and coordinators also encourage the transversalization of
approaches, as an objective to generate safe spaces and environments for girls, boys and
teenagers.
Within the framework of the implementation there was an assertive planning to introduce these
Approaches, however, it is expected to cover more actors in the educational community, as
It highlights the importance that parents, mothers, caregivers are involved in these processes
and traditional authorities.
Finally, it is emphasized that in the transversalization component of gender and human rights approaches,
The topic of conflict resolution had a great reception by the educational community, as
There is enough remembrance and represents a central theme of appropriation in girls, boys and student.
For this point it is imported to clarify that, although the ethnoeducation strategy was carried out in
Simultaneity with the UNICEF Peace Managers program, the educational community identifies that the
Ethnoeducation strategy had this strong component of conflict resolution.

6. Lessons learned
Next, the lessons learned about the strategy evaluation process are presented
of ethnoeducation
1. In relation to context
- The ethnoeducation strategy manages to deal with several of the educational needs of
The communities, however, is important as time to have the disposition to
adapt to emerging needs of the territories.
- The community -based approach that involved the knowledgeable and the authorities
Traditional of the territory, it was key to the success and sustainability of the strategy.
- Involve the community through participatory means is positive: it is achieved
work from the needs and expectations of Afro -descendant communities of
Chocó and Cauca.
2. In relation to the implementation of the strategy
- The strategy managed to generate key joints with key actors, which generally does not
They were included in this type of dialogues, for example, knowledgeable and authorities
traditional
- The implementation of innovative pedagogical practices by teachers generates
an important impact on the learning process of children and adolescents since
Improves its relationship with the educational institution and motivation is generated. With these activities
views as innovative was generated a change in attitude in NNA that live in
Complex social situations.
3. In relation to administrative management with organizations
- While the articulation with Secretariat of Education was given in a timely manner to advance
With the strategy implementation process, it is important to continue strengthening this
bond.
- From UNICEF's strategy, he encouraged to continue with the ethnoeducation tables, made
which is recognized as good practice in departmental education secretariats.
- It is valuable to have an implementing partner with a knowledge of the communities where
The strategy is implemented, facilitating the creation of trusted ties with communities
(Sabbers, parents, educational institutions).
4. In relation to the results
- It is important that UNICEF ally with implementing partners with knowledge in the
territories and central themes of the strategy, to generate satisfactory results in
These areas.
- From the design of the project by UNICEF, internal monitoring must be promoted in the
Educational institutions so that they can carry their own ethnoeducational process and do
a measurement of their own achievements and results.
102
- Through implementation it is identified that not all institutions have PEC
completed, so it is important to adapt to the individual and particular processes of
The IE to advance the resignification of the PEC.
