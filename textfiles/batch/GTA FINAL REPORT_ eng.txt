EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
Preface
UNICEF Mongolia Country Office has taken an innovative approach to focus its programmatic work in a
number of selected provinces and districts in order to ensure best possible results for children for the last two
Country Programmes (2012-2016 and 2017-2021). This geographic targeting approach has enabled UNICEF
to demonstrate affordable, integrated, and highly effective solutions to bring essential services to children at
local level.
The presence at the local level has become very important in piloting innovative models as a learning experience
and expanding those models into the national level and generating evidence for national policy advocacy.
UNICEF has adopted the Child Friendly Community (CFC)- umbrella strategy to improve synergies between
the programme priority areas and enhance the capacity of local government to deliver services to children in
selected geographic focus areas (GFAs). The strategy brought together all stakeholders and UNICEF to create
inclusive and child friendly provinces, districts, and communities in GFAs.
Under the umbrella of CFC, UNICEF supported local governments to introduce numerous cost efficient
and high impact interventions in all sectors to bring tangible results for children. To highlight a few, UNICEF
supported local governments to establish innovative and climate resilient container-type sanitation units with
toilets and showering facilities in schools and kindergartens. UNICEF also introduced an innovative strategy to
deliver integrated Early Childhood Development services to work cross sectorally with health, nutrition, child
protection, governance, adolescence, gender, WASH, monitoring and evaluation, and environment. Multi-
disciplinary teams in GFAs are providing effective child protection services for children thanks to UNICEF’s
technical support.
UNICEF has successfully contributed to reducing the risks of air pollution to maternal and child health through
enhanced evidence and showcasing new energy efficient, green product and service packages on the ground.
Moreover, many children with disabilities are benefitting from inclusive education interventions that are
effectively implemented in GFAs. Children from herder families in most remote areas are reaping the benefits
of child friendly shock responsive social protection services as a result of the pilots that UNICEF led at the local
level.
By implementing the above cost-efficient and high-impact interventions at the local level, UNICEF builds evidence
to expand the successful practices nationwide by government partners. UNICEF successfully advocated to scale
up interventions in programme areas at the national level.
The evaluation of the geographic targeting approach has been conducted in a timely manner to assess its
achievements in Mongolia and inform the design of the next Country Programme. It provides evidence for
policy initiatives and validates scaling up by the central and local authorities to sustain and replicate successful
models. The evaluation offers a number of strategic and operational recommendations that will inform UNICEF’s
decision to continue using the geographic targeting approach and ways to improve its effectiveness.
I express my sincere appreciation to Cognos International LLC and its dedicated team for conducting a
comprehensive evaluation despite the challenging times of the pandemic. I also express my gratitude to all
children, local government officials, and UNICEF colleagues at Regional and Country offices for their invaluable
contribution throughout the evaluation process.

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
Executive Summary
This document represents the Evaluation Report of “UNICEF Mongolia’s geographic targeting approaches (GTA)
during the 2012-2016 and 2017-2021 Country Programmes (CPs)”. The evaluation was conducted between
February 2020 and February 2021.
Objectives and Purpose of the Evaluation
The objectives of the evaluation were the following:
1. assess the extent to which UNICEF’s GTA is contributing to achieving the results of the Country
Programme Document (CPD);
2. assess whether UNICEF’s targeting approach, as was implemented in the geographic focus areas
(GFAs) addressed the need of the most disadvantaged children in a holistic manner;
3. assess UNICEF’s contribution to enhancing local governments’ capacity to effectively plan and
manage integrated and equitable service provisions for children in a holistic manner;
4. identify lessons learned and emerging good practices, as well as to determine more effective and
efficient modalities for the implementation of the geographic targeting approaches; with the purpose
of accelerating results for children in Mongolia, and narrowing the gap with the most disadvantaged
children;
5. assess the extent to which UNICEF’s support to sub-national activities within priority GFAs contributed
to national scale-ups.
The purpose of the evaluation was three-fold: (1) to assess along verified evaluation criteria the local GTA
utilized by UNICEF in Mongolia over the past two CPs; (2) to provide recommendations regarding ways to
improve the current GTAs; and (3) to inform the programming and design of support through the new 2023-
2027 CP. While the evaluation primarily has an evaluation intent, as indicated in its main objectives, it will
also serve to help inform the implementing partnerships’ (UNICEF, Government of Mongolia (GoM)) decision
regarding the continued use of the GTA.
The intended primary users of this evaluation are the United Nations (UN) as a whole and UNICEF Country
Office (CO) from a programmatic point of veiw, and GoM, its partners, and sub-national government entities in
the selected target areas. Key GoM partners of UNICEF are the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection (MLSP),
Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Educatioin and Science (MES), the Authority for Family, Child and Youth
Development (AFCYD), the National Development Agency, the Cabinet Secretariat, and the Ulaanbaatar (UB)
City Municipality.
Evaluation Object
The object of the evaluation was the GTAs of the 2012-2016 and 2017-2021 UNICEF CPs in Mongolia, to
inform the next Country Programme.
The GTA encompasses a multi-level strategy by simultaneously providing technical assistance at the central level,
while also focusing on a package of decentralised interventions, chosen for their potential as demonstrations,
to be followed by nationwide, or broader replication. Through the GTA, UNICEF aims to amplify its impact at
the local level, by creating synergies and limiting cross-sectoral duplication and/or inconsistencies. At a higher-
level, the GTA should help UNICEF pursue its mission statement effectively, by ensuring that interventions are
inclusive of disadvantaged children and communities most in need.
During CP 2012-2016, UNICEF and its GoM partners identified two GFAs for targeted intervention, namely the
Nalaikh district (a peri-urban area) and Khuvsgul province. During CP 2017-2021, the number of selected GFAs
was increased to 4: Bayanzurkh district in UB (population 361,689), and three target aimags – Bayankhongor
(population 88,672), Govi-Altai (population 57,748) and Zavkhan (population 72,823) as per latest official
statistics of 2019 population data .
The CP 2017-2021 has 4 programme components:
10 | Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
- Outcome 1: By 2021, the most disadvantaged children in Mongolia benefit from increased access
and utilisation of services that promote health and nutrition, including water, sanitation, hygiene and
interventions that mitigate the impact of air pollution on child survival.
- Outcome 2: By 2021, the most disadvantaged children access and utilise services in a healthy,
inclusive and quality learning environment
- Outcome 3: By 2021, child-related national policy, budget and systems, including the child protection
system, are inclusive and equity focussed.
- Outcome 4: Country programmes are efficiently designed, coordinated, managed and supported to
meet quality programming standards in achieving results for children.
Evaluation Methodology
The evaluation utilised a mixed-method approach, including: a stakeholder mapping exercise, in-depth
documentary review and structured desk analysis; reconstruction and systematic testing of UNICEF’s Theory
of Change (ToC); analysis of national and sub-national quantitative data on marginalisation and deprivation
of children; adolescents and children, against UNICEF’s Results Frameworks for both CPs; elaboration of a
counter-factual through data collection in an non-GFA aimag; in-depth key informant interviews (KIIs), focus
group discussions (FGDs) and observations through the case studies developed.
The evaluation was carried out in three phases. In the Inception Phase, review of key documentation and
development of data collection and evaluation tools were carried out. An evaluation inception report was
elaborated and shared with the UNICEF CO. The Data Review and Collection Phase was devoted to the in-
depth documentary review, and collection of data from existing national surveys, as well as from the KIIs and
FGDs taking place in the GFAs between June and September 2020. In the final Analysis and Synthesis Phase,
a contribution analysis was used to identify specific changes due to the targeting approach within GFAs versus
the non-GFA control-aimag. Standard United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG)/Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) evaluation criteria analysis (relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability)
was used, in combination with a gender, equity, and human rights-based approach in order to assess the
achievement of results, identify positive stories and lessons learned, draw evidence-based conclusions, and
provide actionable recommendations.
Contextualisation of Findings and Analysis: The total population in Mongolia is over 3 million, with around a
third made up of children aged 0-17 years old. Disparities in child issues persist based on geography, income,
age, gender, and ethnicity. The national child poverty rate is 37% among children aged 0-17, with slightly lower
rates in UB where more than half of the population reside in crowded urban areas as compared to rural areas,
and acute poverty in ger communities (NSO 2020). The Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis (MODA)1
analysis notes that that the proportion of girls experiencing deprivation is slightly higher among Infant and
Young Child Feeding (IYCF), overweight, missed vaccination and antenatal care indicators.
Furthermore, according to a report by the National Statistics Office (NSO), familial and institutional violence
against children is also an issue of growing concern, with 49.1% of children aged 1-14 having experienced
violent discipline2. Herder and semi-nomadic children make up almost a third of Mongolia’s population, and
suffer worse education outcomes, with only about 14% enrolled in early childhood education (ECE) services3.
The Kazakh minority population (7%), largely located in the Western region, tends to suffer particularly high
deprivation, such as poor school attendance and malnutrition4. The Committee on the Rights of the Child
noted inequities in access to, and the quality of, social services for children of ethnic minorities.

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
The effect of COVID-19 in Mongolia: The COVID-19 pandemic created a heightened need among disenfranchised
and vulnerable groups (youth, children, women, and rural populations). UNICEF switched into emergency
programmatic mode as the GoM put in place restrictions to control the pandemic. The situation however
limited UNICEF’s ability to carry out interventions and activities at the local level – a situation they adapted to
by moving capacity building interventions on-line, which was highly appreciated.
Main Findings and Conclusions
The GTA in Mongolia related to CP 2012-2016 and the current CP 2017-2021 has been implemented in
challenging geographical conditions where existing structural challenges are compounded with the changing
urgencies and prioritisations following the COVID-19 pandemic. While UNICEF pursues its vision of assisting
the most deprived children, it aims to be holistic in its intervention strategies, working both upstream in policy
advocacy and downstream, at sub-national aimag, soum and district levels in GFAs. The feedback received
from 173 stakeholders, duty-bearers and rights holders confirms that UNICEF is a respected and appreciated
partner, and facilitators of rights based, equitable programme interventions for children, particularly the most
disadvantaged children in their target locations.
UNICEF GTA demonstrated success in reaching those most in need through an effective intersectoral and
integrated intervention packages. UNICEF contributed to enhancing local government capacity over the
evaluated period, and the transfer of good practice models from the 2012-2016 CP to the current CP was
successful, however, more is needed to ensure local financing and sector support for sustainability. More
specific findings and conclusions for each evaluation criterion are presented below:
Relevance: UNICEF uses their GTA to determine to which aimag, districts and soums they will work. This
largely internal process was done based on a mix of criteria – some evidence-based analysis of data, other
more subjective related to efficiency and other considerations. Stakeholders considered there was a good
alignment and agreement between UNICEF’s targeting approach and GoM policy priorities. The GFAs selected
were generally relevant for the GoM. Within the GFAs, how deprivation is measured and targeted was less
clear as the definition of what constitutes a “vulnerable or deprived” group or area differs. Depending on
the granularity of the data collected on deprivation, the GTA’s alignment with the reality of the geographic
distribution of poverty and need varies. The GTA thus faces an issue of consistency regarding the rationale for
area selection.
Nevertheless, UNICEF’s work at local level was considered relevant in integrating Human Rights and equity-
based approaches overall to the needs of vulnerable children, particularly children with disabilities (CWDs)
(Outcome 2). More purposeful intervention for specific sub-populations of children of ethnic, religious, or
geographic disadvantage was perceived as needed.
Effectiveness: UNICEF’s GTA has been effective in advocating for improved national laws, policies and guidelines,
integrated intervention strategies and financial budgeting arrangements relevant to child health, education,
and social service delivery. UNICEF’s was widely appreciated by stakeholders for the value of its evidence-based
advocacy and agenda-building for child and adolescent wellbeing and related outcomes
At the sub-national level, UNICEF’s support for decentralised, planning, budgeting and intersectoral intervention
strategies were considered successful by Governor’s offices, sector partners and as well as practitioners such as
social workers, and teachers (Outcome 3). Local government capacity has been developed as aimag governors
and their offices take ownership of child rights issues, improving planning and coordination processes, and
integrating inclusion of children’s voices in local priority setting.
The UNICEF Child Friendly Community (CFC) approach, based on the Convention on the Rights of the Child
(CRC) principles, has helped to create an integrated, holistic, multisectoral safety net at sub-national levels
to meet the needs of the most disadvantaged children (Outcome 2). The functionality of the CFC approach is
enhanced by the noticeable motivation and commitment of local administrators to the programme. The CFC
has proven to be a Good Practice model for replication and scale-up nationally.

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
Other UNICEF strategies to increase sub-national efforts on behalf of children were mixed. Capacity building
and advocacy for local government authorities (LGA) to increased budget allocations for children was somewhat
successful in increasing LDF contribution, however, institutional constraints necessarily limit the approach.
Likewise, while UNICEF has provided capacity building for a wide range of stakeholders as evidenced by their
appreciation of child rights and the CFC approach, the ability to effect significant change through awareness
raising is limited.
Efficiency: UNICEF’s application of the GTA in the past 2 CPs was an efficient step-wise strategy to testing
intervention models for future replication and scale up across the country. The selection of GFAs also included
efficiency criteria, which was cost-saving for logistical concerns.
The CFC strategy implicated successfully local Governors and authorities to sustain the initiative demonstrating
the catalytic power (and efficiency) of transfer of ownership to local authorities for implementing integrated
programmes for children. UNICEF’s intersectoral intervention packages involves multiple departments
and programme components within UNICEF, yet the collective package did not necessarily reduce siloed
programming by sector colleagues or within UNICEF programmes.
UNICEF has developed important partnerships with NGOs and the private sector to implement intersectoral
programmes adding to their efficiency and sustainability at sub-national level. Duplication of efforts has
reduced according to partners; better alignment of efforts under the United Nations Development Assistance
Framework (UNDAF) through joint projects could increase UN organisational efficiency.
Finally, UNICEF has a robust monitoring and evaluation results framework that is informed by administrative
data, UNICEF supported national databases and survey data of high quality. During CP 2012-2016, the outputs
and key performance indicators were rather high level and generally (with only a few exceptions) did not
include specific targeting to reach the most disadvantaged children. The current results framework for CP
2017-2021 however is more specific and targeted, offering greater opportunity to further disaggregate and
focuses on subpopulations of children in greatest need.
Sustainability: UNICEF’s GTA strategy helped to facilitate sustainable engagement of policymakers for
replicating and scale-up of pilot interventions. For instance, the human capacity built in the previous GFA
of Khuvsgul (CP 2012-2016) on the CFC provided lessons learned to these new GFAs (CP 2017-2021) which
were taken up and improved up. Successful experiences of private sector and NGOs have also been drivers
of sustainability, especially for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and Early Childhood Education (ECE)
interventions such as mobile kindergarten. In principle, LGAs are free to adopt CFC strategies and principles
but there are legitimate concerns regarding their ability to sustain financial support of activities and related
outcomes through targeted budgetary allocations. Some LGA respondents considered the extent that the
CFC work plan can be implemented depends on adjustments or increases to local public recurrent or capital
spending to better target vulnerable children, which is a challenge within current funding instruments and
rules. Alternatively, some respondents noted that new or existing plans and startegies can be made child
friendly with existing or new resources.

areas16, further exacerbating the need to address their specific issues.
Even within the capital UB, disparities persist based on living situation, and income. Mass rural-urban migration
has led many to live in large, unplanned settlements in the outskirts of cities, with around 60.0% of UB’s
population living in underserviced informal settlements or ger areas17. This leads to further disenfranchisement,
and degraded health, education, and economic outcomes.
Disparities in child issues also persist based on geography, income, age, gender, and ethnicity. The national
child poverty rate is 37% among children aged 0-17, with slightly lower rates in UB as compared to rural areas18,
and acute poverty in ger communities19. Poverty impacts child health and development at all levels; a 2014
Situation Analysis of Children Mongolian noted that “children from income poor households tend to have
worse health outcomes; do less well in school; are more likely to report low self-esteem; and, may be more
likely to come in contact with the law, or get involved in risky behaviour”20.
Figure 1. Infant Mortality by all aimags and districts
of Mongolia, 2012-2019
UNICEF notes the significant progress made by
Mongolian authorities in reducing infant mortality
rates and under-five mortality rates21,22. Successful
vaccination campaigns against measles and
rubella ensured that over 600,000 children were
vaccinated, no new paediatric cases detected, and
many lives of children and young people saved as
a result. However, improvement is not uniform
across all aimags. Umnugovi for instance reported
a higher level of infant mortality in 2019, compared
to 2017. Despite national improvements, specific
factors leading to negative health and survival
outcomes for infants remain of urgent concern to
UNICEF23. Barriers to adequate infant nutritional
health include household poverty, lack of
awareness around infant nutrition, and barriers to
breastfeeding24. The nutritional status of children under five has suffered, with the prevalence of underweight
1.8%, stunting 9%, wasting 0.9% and overweight 10.5%25.
Figure 2 shows an overall downward trend by aimag in under-five mortality. For instance, Bayankhongor
reports an under-five mortality rate of 13 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2019. Nonetheless, UNICEF Mongolia
considers the under-five mortality rate, “still a concern, with stark inequalities between remote regions and
UB”26, with some aimags (Bulgan, Dornogovi) experiencing an increase of under-five mortality since 2012.
Disparities exist across household income, with greater mortality and increased stunting amongst children in
the poorest quintile as compared to those in the wealthiest quintile (respectively, 26 vs 17 per 1000 livebirths;
13.8% vs 6.0% stunting)27.

Figure 2. Figure 2: Under 5 Mortality by all aimags and districts These disparities extend to the urban/rural divide,
of Mongolia, 2012-2019 with 10.5% stunting amongst children in rural areas
versus 5.6% in urban areas28. Such disparities
necessitate development of disaggregated analysis,
as exemplified by geographic targeting approaches
(GTA) within UNICEF Mongolia’s Country
Programmes (CPs).
Furthermore, boys and girls face separate
challenges and deprivation gender inequalities
persist, with higher rates of under-five mortality
among boys than girls (30 and 18 per 1,000 live
births)29. The Multiple Overlapping Deprivation
Analysis (MODA)30 analysis notes, however, that
that the proportion of girls experiencing deprivation
is slightly higher among Infant and Young Child
Feeding (IYCF), overweight, missed vaccination and
antenatal care indicators. Furthermore, gender-based violence predominantly impacts women and girls in
Mongolia. According to a report by the National Statistics Office (NSO), 58% of Mongolian women experienced
one or more forms of violence in their lifetime, a third of them experience sexual or physical violence in their
lifetime, and 1 in 10 women surveyed was sexually abused before the age of 1531.
Familial and institutional violence against children is also an issue of growing concern, with 49.1% of children
aged 1-14 having experienced violent discipline32. Violations of children’s rights and physical well-being are
rooted in social problems such as widespread poverty, alcoholism, the lack of awareness about child rights and
well-established systems to protect children.
Adolescents further face their own challenges, including an increasingly urgent mental health crisis. Since 2013,
there has been a five-fold increase in suicide among adolescents aged 10-14, while the share of adolescents
who have attempted suicide over the past year was as high as 14.7% in girls and 10% in boys. Other problems
faced by adolescents include adolescent pregnancy and childbirth, unsafe abortion, STIs, the incidence of
which is on the rise amongst those aged between 15 and 2433.
Lastly, herder and semi-nomadic children make up almost a third of Mongolia’s population, and suffer worse
education outcomes, with only about 14% enrolled in early childhood education (ECE) services34. The Kazakh
minority population (7%)35, largely located in the Western region, tends to suffer particularly high deprivation,
such as poor school attendance and malnutrition36. The Committee on the Rights of the Child noted inequities
in access to, and the quality of, social services for children of ethnic minorities37. Despite this, there are signs
of progress when it comes to reaching the most deprived, with a genuine emphasis on developing capacity
and addressing vulnerabilities inclusively across ethnic and geographic discrepancies, with UNICEF technical
support and guidance38.

2. Context
1.1 Government prioritizing and programming for marginalized and vulnerable children
and adolescents
Through GTA and the other thematic targeting mechanisms, UNICEF aims to assist the government in its goal
of supporting marginalised and vulnerable children’s health, education, development and protection.
Figure 3. Poverty headcount rate in Mongolia by aimag (%) The Government of Mongolia (GoM) has a
‘Vision 2050’ long-term policy document and
‘Five-year Development Guideline of
Mongolia 2021-2025,’ and ‘Action Plan of the
GoM for 2020-2024.’ In these documents, the
Government outlines its policy for economic
growth, poverty alleviation and employment;
gender equality; family development and
demographics; and developing the education,
healthcare, culture and social welfare sectors.
The General Office for Labour and Social
Welfare Services (GOLSWS) is currently in
charge of social welfare services, providing food stamps using proxy means test (PMT) the poorest 5% of
families, representing more than 118,000 children. This represents a departure from the once-universal Child
Money Programme (CMP) in 2016, which became poverty targeted and distributed MNT 20,000 (less than USD
8) per child, available for 80% of children. Recently however, the GoM has reversed back to a universal approach
due to COVID-19, increasing the amount to MNT 100,000 per child per month, reaching 1.2 million children.
As noted above, children and adolescents from ethnic minorities in Mongolia often face worse socio-economic
outcomes compounded by their remote living situation. The GoM recently adopted provisions against ethnic
discrimination in the New Criminal Code, as well as extending social protection coverage herding communities
and commitments to invest in Kazakh bilingual schools39.
In the health sector, universal access to health services is prioritized within existing relevant national
programmes. However, access and use of quality healthcare services is not universal. Children and adolescents
from the poorest quintile, living in remote areas, and from ethnic minorities such as the Kazakh have “the
lowest utilisation of health care services”40. In 2017, the Ministry for Labour and Social (MLSP) approved
a ministerial order establishing youth-friendly clinics providing a package of adolescent health services. The
Education Sector Master Plan (2002-2015) further aimed to support life skills programmes for adolescents
focusing on mental health, and specifically, young boys’ and girls’ attitude towards reproductive health and
menstruation. Other life skills programmes aim to equip them with social and emotional skills, improving
their ability to communicate effectively However, specific provisions for identified disadvantaged children and
adolescents are absent.
Delivery of quality Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities poses a significant challenge in terms of
government programming. While climactic factors, geographical remoteness, and socio-economic disparities
introduce complexity41, community-level WASH facilities in schools and infrastructural development have
been prioritized. With UNICEF support, the Commission further mitigated unequal access to quality WASH, by
addressing gaps in per-litre water pricing between ger district households and apartment households through
a new methodology for setting water tariffs42.

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
In the education sector, net enrolment rates in primary and secondary education are high, at 99.1% and 96.1%.
Priority is placed on decreasing class size while increasing enrolment and coverage for all children. Further, the
Government Action Programme for 2016-2020 has produced a series of inclusive education goals seeking to
provide a favourable learning environment and infrastructure for children with disabilities (CWDs).
On child protection, the GoM has integrated programmes inter-sectorally through Multi-disciplinary teams
(MDTs) to improve case management for violence against children43. However, despite CRC recommendations
in 2017, protection for children against economic exploitations and child labour practices are lacking. The
National Programme on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour 2012-2016 was deemed to have
been inadequately implemented due to insufficient funds and management capacity44.
Government programming on GBV and domestic abuse is principally focused on education, raising awareness
of the individual and societal effects of GBV, and changing attitudes towards gender and domestic violence.
Nonetheless, intersectional risks (compounded for example by having disability45) are not adequately
considered. Broader programming targeted towards women and girls addresses gender discrimination and toxic
masculinity within rural communities and the workplace46, gender-responsive mental health STI prevention47,
and reproductive health and menstrual hygiene, a “neglected area of sanitation” and further driver of gender
inequity48.
1.2 Governance and budgeting for children and adolescents
Governance
Mongolia is a unitary state, with 3 tiers of sub-national government: Aimags (21), comprised of 330 soums and
1,559 baghs. Ulaanbaatar (UB) is an independent administrative unit, divided into 9 districts and 151 khoroos.
Checks and balances are institutionalised between the legislative and executive branches of government at
both national and sub-national levels:
A legislative assembly, Citizen’s Representative Hural (CRH), supported by a full-time Secretary and (at aimag
level) and other supporting staff under the Secretary. CRHs serve a 4-year term; and
● An executive branch headed by a Governor and Deputy Governor. These officials are indirectly elected
for the same 4-year terms as the CRHs. The Prime Minister (for aimag governors) or aimag governor
(for soum governors) selects a candidate from a list nominated by the CRH, with oversight to:
- directly supervise the Governor’s Office (GO) and its departments and staff;
- provide administrative oversight of deconcentrated sub-national sector ministry (education,
health, etc.) departments, their facilities (schools, clinics, etc.) and staff, but who are under the
primary supervision of their central ministries or other central agencies.
The overall local governance framework in Mongolia is shaped by the Constitution (Chap. IV) and a number of
key legal instruments:
● The Law on Administrative and Territorial Units of Mongolia (2006 rev.) sets out the roles of Governors
and elected CRHs.
● The Civil Service Law (2019) sets out human resource arrangements at national and sub-national
level, within a unified civil service.
● The Development Policy Planning Law (2017) sets out broad principles and arrangements for
different types of planning instruments (area-based, sectoral, etc.) and for the planning processes
underpinning them.

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
● Most importantly for this evaluation, the Integrated Budget Law (IBL 2012), sets out sub-national
government public spending responsibilities, and for how these are financed and budgeted. More
detailed guidelines are then provided under various regulatory instruments issued by government,
by Ministry of Finance (MoF), and by sector ministries.
Budgeting and Finance
Sources of financing for local government spending are: (i) their own revenues, as defined under Article 23 of
the IBL; (ii) deficit transfers (for those aimags and soums in ‘deficit’), as defined under Arts 66.1 and 56.4 of the
IBL; (iii) special purpose transfers (SPTs) for social services, as defined under Art 61.2 of the IBL; and, (iv) LDF
transfers, as defined under Article 60 of the IBL.
Of these, the prime financing sources for child/adolescent-related local government budget spending are:
- SPTs to finance recurrent budget spending on early childhood development (ECD) and general
education, primary health care, and for child development and protection. However, local spending
from these transfers is tightly regulated by central ministry budget norms and guidelines, leaving little
scope for local authorities to change SPT allocations between sectors and very little room for any
local flexibility even within sectors.
- LDF transfers to finance minor capital investment spending on, e.g. WASH facilities, kindergartens,
improvements to school and health facilities, playgrounds, public toilets, showers, lighting, etc.
Spending from LDF transfers allows a far greater degree of local discretion than do SPTs. A participatory
process and project criteria are clearly laid down under the IBL and the LDF Regulation (2018) and
should involve citizen voices, including that of children and adolescents.
The central government is responsible for spending on child/adolescent-related activities through the various
welfare transfers to individuals or households (e.g. CMP, administered by the GOLSWS). These transfers take
place separately from local budgeting processes. The other main central government budgeting responsibility
in regard to child/adolescent support is for capital budget investments in local primary and secondary level
education and health facilities, as well as for both capital and current budgets for tertiary level facilities. Here,
local authorities may only make proposals but have no final decision-making power on investments.
3 Object of the evaluation
The object of this evaluation is the GTA of the 2012-2016 and 2017-2021 CP between the GoM and UNICEF.
3.1 Overview
UNICEF’s GTA has evolved over the last four CPs informing where UNICEF should focus its sub-national
programme efforts (i.e. selection of geographic focus areas (GFAs)); and within the programme components,
how to intervene (e.g. targeted ways of working both with LGAs, agency departments and development
partners). Prior to the start of a CP, UNICEF conducts an internal exercise to guide strategic decisions on the
selection of GFAs. This usually involves analysis and consideration of a) secondary data (e.g. of relevant thematic
data, administrative data, multi-sectoral analysis of child deprivations (i.e. MODA); b) sub-national aimag
capacity, commitment and interest; c) the partnership landscape; and d) operational efficiency considerations.
The GTA further encompasses a multi-level, multi-sectoral programme strategy to deliver a holistic package
of services and protections for all children, with special attention to the most disadvantaged. The integrated
approach to programming involves advocating and providing technical assistance at national level, while
supporting sub-national provision of interventions (in aimag, soums). This entails, working with LGAs to provide
services in a package of interventions, engaging various sectors as needed to ensure reaching all children,
including the most disadvantages. In specific cases, UNICEF supports local government agencies in their analysis
of administrative data and information to decide which communities, families and children should be the focus
of an intervention to mitigate specific vulnerabilities, deprivations or risks. Not all intervention areas, however,
are predisposed for targeting. Upholding child rights and equality demands that some interventions such as
20 | Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
access to health or school services are universal, while others are case focused (e.g. children with severe acute
malnutrition (SAM); communities in dzud (harsh winter) prone areas).
For the purposes of this evaluation, we refer to GTA as UNICEF’s general approach to targeting (both where,
and how to intervene) to meet the needs of all children, particularly the most disadvantaged children.
UNICEF Mongolia’s strategy document notes that the approach49 can be described as “diagonal” in nature
and is designed with the goal of maximizing UNICEF’s strategic impact against the constraint of its limited
resources.
3.2 Geographic Targeting Approach (GTA)
In Mongolia, geographic and programme targeting has been done since before the CP under evaluation, evolving
based on lessons learned from the previous periods. The following timeline tracks the development of the GTA
over the recent past CPs, outlining the criteria used to choose focus areas and other notable developments
influencing decision-making related to targeting.
The 2007-2011 CP (period preceding the evaluation period)
This programme included a GTA focus on 6 aimags: Uvs (Western aimag), Bayan-Ulgii (Western, Kazakh minority
aimag), Khovd (Western) and Dornod (Eastern) aimags and two districts of UB. The CP also implemented a
Reaching Every District and Soum (REDS) strategy, which targeted at least 5 districts in UB. While the CP
aimed to address challenges across many locations, later reflection revealed that the budget was spread too
thin and results diluted. A key factor contributing to this budget-stretch was the country’s relatively small child
population, leading to minimal regular resource allocation, resulting in lessons learned for the next CP (as
stated in a Country Programme Document (CPD))50.
The 2012-2016 CP
UNICEF’s chosen GFAs for this CP were the Nalaikh district (population of 30,000) and Khuvsgul aimag
(population of 114,000). There were three reported criteria used to determine the target areas: (a) Local
Development Index and a study of inequity drivers; (b) UNICEF added value and operational efficiency; and (c)
Districts designated as the most disadvantaged by the Government.
The Local Development Index
Figure 4. Map of targeted areas CP 2012-2016
identified the Western region as the
most vulnerable. A composite index
(including infant mortality rate and
under-five mortality rate) confirmed
this result (see Figures 1 and 2 in
section 1.1), while administrative
health and education data obtained
from national ministries was also
generally supported the selection.
To prevent inefficiencies among
geographically distant aimags,
intervention in one aimag and district
was considered, demonstrating how an aimag and a district with concentrated support could effectively
improve the situation for the most deprived children. An experiment in two locations (Khuvsgul and Nalaikh)
was undertaken to test integrated intervention models using a holistic, whole child approach.

The 2017-2021 CP
GFAs for CP 2017-2021 were decided Figure 5. Map of targeted areas during CP 2017-2021
through evidence provided from
Khuvsgul and Nalaikh good practices,
service delivery models and lessons
learnt. The target areas were widened to
cover Bayanzurkh district (population
361,689) and three target aimags –
Bayankhongor (population 88,672),
Govi-Altai (population 57,748) and
Zavkhan (population 72,823) in order to
test scale-up of the Child Friendly
communities (CFC) approach in different
geographical contexts, and to explore
what adjustments were needed for scaling up the other identified good practice interventions (see Table 4 in
section 5.4.3 for a summary of best practice from CP 2012-2016). This increase in GFAs represented a large
investment for UNICEF, with a total targeted area covering four times the population of the previous CP 2012-
2016.
During the design of the current UNICEF CP (2017 – 2021), GFAs were selected on a balance of factors
including multiple child deprivations (i.e. MODA); government capacity, the partnership landscape; and
UNICEF’s minimum requirements for operational efficiency. For example, UNICEF’s GTA was informed by
equity profiles (2015) they developed for Health, HIV, Nutrition, Social Inclusion, WASH, Child Protection, and
Education analysing aimag disparities, as well as factors linked to wealth and education levels. Bayankhongor
aimag was additionally chosen to explore the impact of air pollution on children’s health, social performance
management within the extractive industry, sanitation in cold weather, and the use of mobile technology for
service delivery (mHealth, e-education, U-Report, child online protection)51, despite having improved statistics
over other aimags. The Umnugovi aimag (population 60,855) was further included during UNICEF’s Mid-term
Review (MTR)52 for specific interventions starting in 2020 (although not considered as an aimag of interest in
this evaluation given the date of its inclusion)53 as a result of ongoing joint programmes with World Health
Organization (WHO) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFP) in Umnugovi.
3.3 UNICEF’s Strategic Approaches
UNICEF’s GTA aims to strengthen the overarching policy environment for children within sectors, particularly
child and social protection, and concentrate programme efforts to narrow inequality gaps sub-nationally.
Child rights are the overarching framework for UNICEF’s programming. Specifically, the GTA is implemented
through national policy advocacy, and at the sub-national level through implementation of holistic, multi-
sectoral programming approaches, particularly the CFC model to support integrated service delivery, and by
strengthening local planning and budgeting for children. The sub-national service packages are designed as
model approaches to demonstrate the synergies, added-value, and impact of intersectoral, multi-disciplinary
interventions that have the potential to be replicated nationwide.
This evaluation focuses on two primary strategies that guide UNICEF’s targeted programming at both local
and national levels as per the ToRs (see Annex 1): the CFC model, and working with decentralised authorities
to improve child focused local planning and budgeting. Both are supported by UNICEF’s engagement at
national level. These GTA strategic approaches were tested in CP 2012-2016 in Khuvsgul and Nalaikh district,

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
National level advocacy
At the national level, UNICEF focuses on providing technical assistance, advocating, and building partnerships
to create an enabling environment for the delivery of quality basic social services for children. This entails
supporting national ministries such as the MoF, and MLSP to legislate, plan and allocate budgets equitably
for child focused services that meet international standards. National level advocacy is usually done in close
partnership with development partners (e.g. United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Swiss Agency for
Development and Cooperation (SDC), World Vision (WV), Asian Development Bank (ADB), and government
sectoral partners such as Authority for Family, Child and Youth Development (AFCYD). Through collaboration,
UNICEF and partners can raise awareness and influence policy for the benefit of children. Such concerted
efforts are needed: challenges to the delivery of integrated services for children by government ministries
include sectoral siloes, duplication and fragmentation of efforts. Overall accountability for meeting the
needs of children, particularly the most disadvantaged is perceived by most government departments as the
responsibility of MLSP, either through AFCYD and the aimag MDTs for specifically vulnerable children (e.g facing
domestic violence), or through the GOLSWS, responsible for managing subsidies (e.g. to CWDs) and their line
ministries at subnational level. UNICEF works nationally and sub-nationally to clarify accountability and support
the integration of service delivery models that have improved child indicators with potential for scale up.
Child Friendly Communities
At the sub-national level, UNICEF supports implementation and scale-up of the CFC. The CFC approach,
supported by UNICEF implicates local Governors and government line ministries across sectors to support
various institutional innovations designed to raise awareness within local authorities to children’s issues and
to encourage intersectoral synergies between interventions to meet the needs of the most disadvantaged
families.
The CFC initiative (based on the Child Friendly Cities Initiative54) is a UNICEF-led initiative that supports local
governments in realizing the rights of children at the local level using the CRC as its foundation. It is grounded
in 9 building blocks: children’s participation; a child-friendly legal framework; city-wide child rights strategy;
a child rights unit or coordinating mechanism; child impact assessment and evaluation; children’s budget,
children’s report, child rights known; and independent advocacy for children. The targeted local governments
use this strategy as the main planning and monitoring tool for child rights setting accountability targets and
milestones in child survival, development, protection and participation.
The CFC model plays a key role in the functioning of the GTA as implementation will provide valuable synergies
in those areas and inspire local governments elsewhere in the country to follow suit. The model was piloted
in the Khuvsgul aimag and the Nalaikh district of UB during the CP of 2012-2016, and based on the pilot
experiences, the model has been scaled up in the current 2017-2021 CP’s four GFAs (three aimags and one
UB district). In addition, the AFCYD selected six non-GFA aimags as regional representatives to roll-out the CFC
model with minimal UNICEF technical support. The evaluation’s non-GFA comparison aimag, Uvurkhangai, is
one of the AFCYD selected aimags currently engaged in the CFC approach.
The CFC model promotes inter-sectoral coordination through the establishment of a CFC Coordination
Committee headed by provincial and district governors to prioritize the interests of children in all sectors and
develop friendly environments with child-centred decision-making, budgeting and planning. Further advancing
the principles of the CRC, targeted local governments are supported to provide an opportunity for children
to express their opinions on specific child-related issues to be reflected in local development planning and
budgeting. This entails the following activities:
● Profiling of children’s’ rights, service-access, protection and other welfare issues in the aimag
● Review of these issues at Child Forums
● Development of a CFC strategy for the aimag
● Establishment of a CFC institutional framework, with Children’s Councils and MDTs at aimag, soum
and bagh levels

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
● Recommendations for issuance of CFC policies and plans by aimag authorities
● Approval by aimag authorities and CRH of budget allocations to finance CFC activities, including a
minimum 10% allocation of aimag LDF for children’s issues.
As the foundation for advancing child rights and ensuring the needs of the most vulnerable children are ad-
dressed, the CFC approach represents an especially important focus for the evaluation.
Working with decentralised government authorities
Critical to UNICEF’s strategies is influencing national and particularly subnational resource allocation for children,
particularly budgeting and finance at the local levels, for example, through education and health departments,
and their respective agencies. UNICEF seeks to institutionalise support for children at aimag and soum level by
building capacity of local government to target planning, budgeting and investment in integrated services and
infrastructure for children, particularly the most disadvantaged. UNICEF also focuses nationally on engagement
with sector ministries and related agencies such as the MoF, Cabinet Secretariat and the Parliament, and other
local programmes.
Specifically, the UNICEF CP (2017-2021) strategy recognises the importance of decentralised decision-making
and knowledge of local context to target delivery for many child-related services. The most coherent expression
of UNICEF’s institutional and financing strategy of working with, and supporting local authorities lies in the
CFC55. As local authorities enjoy greater budgetary flexibility over LDF budget decisions (than other budgetary
mechanisms), UNICEF’s local capacity support for pro-child budgeting activities have at times focused on LDF
transfer. UNICEF supported GFA aimags and soums under the CFC strategy, to advocate use of a minimum
10% target of LDF allocations for child-critical activities, in particular for WASH and ECD investments. However,
UNICEF also recognises the need to address national policy and “systemic” issues alongside its operations at
the local level, as this is key to effecting wider change and scale-up.
Cross-cutting issues: Human rights, equity and gender approach
UNICEF Mongolia’s CP 2017-2021 ToC56 across outcomes for health, education and social protection
hypothesises that attaining child rights for every child, especially the most disadvantaged, is fundamental
for improving child-related outcomes. UNICEF human rights and equity-based approach aligns with the GoM’s
commitment to achieve child- related SDGs as evidenced in the Education Law57 and the Primary and Secondary
Education Law. UNICEF integrates rights-based measures into its results framework by setting goals and targets
to measure the progressive realisation of child rights. Key performance indicators have been established for
UNICEF and government partners to measure respect, protection and fulfilment of child rights. For example,
key performance indicators include demand for disaggregated data (the percentage of children aged 36–59
months attending an ECE programme (national/boys/girls/poorest quintile) and non-discrimination of ethnic
minorities (secondary education net attendance rates for Kazakh minority children (total/boys/girls).
UNICEF supports the GoM to make progress on child rights through support for both universal and targeted
intervention strategies such as the CFC initiative, and social protection interventions to protect children living
in harsh weather conditions and most recently, to safeguard children during COVID-19 (see chapter 4). UNICEF
principles hold that if child rights are fulfilled, the most disadvantaged children in Mongolia will be reached by
both universal and targeted approaches.
UNICEF Mongolia considers gender as a cross-cutting issue, as well as a key programming objective in adolescent
health. Gender disparities are investigated and documented as barriers in access to services and WASH facilities,
education (e.g. girls remain in school longer than boys) and health outcomes (e.g. boys suffer more injuries;
girls are subject to GBV, and risk of early or unwanted pregnancy, etc.). All products incorporate a gender lens:
routine survey data, studies and evaluative data are disaggregated by sex and other key demographic factors

or economic condition.

to allow for analysis of the gender dimensions of issues.
Gender equality has been pursued as an explicit strategy of several interventions both nationally through laws
and policy development and advocacy, and within the GFAs of the CPs. Outputs that specifically address gender
issues are notably gender responsive mental health interventions, support to girl victims of violence, abuse
and trafficking, and nutrition of pregnant women. Otherwise, gender sensitivity or awareness (rather than
transformative) is largely mainstreamed within thematic programmes, including the thematic interventions
mentioned above58.
3.4 UNICEF’s Theories of Change
UNICEF’s current CP (2017-2021) is guided by ToC per outcome area. The outcomes in full are as follows:
Outcome 1: By 2021, the most disadvantaged children in Mongolia benefit from increased access
and utilisation of services that promote health and nutrition, including water, sanitation, hygiene and
interventions that mitigate the impact of air pollution on child survival.
Outcome 2: By 2021, the most disadvantaged children access and utilise services in a healthy, inclusive
and quality learning environment
Outcome 3: By 2021, child-related national policy, budget and systems, including the child protection
system, are inclusive and equity focussed59.
Outcome 4: Country programmes are efficiently designed, coordinated, managed and supported to
meet quality programming standards in achieving results for children.
There is currently no overarching ToC that includes the GTA strategy. An evaluability study noted “that causal
linkages [and the assumptions inherent therein] between outcome areas can be missed.” It notes the difficulty
UNICEF will have “to understand whether they are achieving better results working in 1 aimag and 1 peri-
urban district (previous CP) as compared to 3 rural aimags (and 1 additional after the MTR) and 1 peri-urban
district (current CP)” and states that “the focus of the CP evaluation could be broader than just focusing on the
geographic approach”60.
Further challenging assessment of results, is the low availability of quality information and data across the
different programme outcomes and outputs. This is particularly relevant as equity and age disaggregation data
gaps that could help to integrate data and information on marginalised children into planning and programming
remain challenges across the different CP outcomes, including for inclusive education and child protection
(already identified in the Situation Analysis)61.
3.5 Reconstructing and testing UNICEF’s ToC for the GTA
For the purpose of this evaluation, a composite ToC has been developed that takes stock of the role that the
targeting plays in UNICEF’s own ToC (see Figure 6 below). The reconstructed ToC reflects the conceptual and
programmatic approaches taken by UNICEF to effectively target the most disadvantaged children and their
families, including identification of some of the most important assumptions underlying the change pathways.
Assumptions identified in the original ToCs have been tested to assess whether UNICEF’s GTA contributes
towards achieving programme strategic aims.
The additional implicit assumptions relate to working with government authorities and the CFC model,
both of which are central to reaching the most vulnerable, as requested by the Terms of Reference (ToR) for
the evaluation. For example, we observe that UNICEF’s GTA itself is based on assumptions about how local
governance, planning, financing and ways of working operate at sub-national level. Through the evaluation,
stated and implicit assumptions of the causal pathways with the CPs were tested.

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
Evaluation questions were developed to test the ToC and validate its assumptions and/or strengthen it through
revision or inclusion of new assumptions in the pathways. As the original ToCs (developed by UNICEF per
outcome area for CP 2017-2021) have not been developed for the purpose of testing GTA assumptions, some
gaps in the logical model were observed and expected. The evaluation team worked through a reconstruction
of the existing outcome area ToCs to develop a ToC for this evaluation. The evaluation ToC focuses on outputs
that can benefit from or do targeting to reach their beneficiaries. By focusing the reconstructed ToC (and the
evaluation questions related effectiveness) on intervention areas that have potentially a targeting focus (e.g.
adapting materials for ethnic minorities; identifying locations with greatest need to build ger kindergartens,
etc.), recommendations for a more robust overarching ToC for the next CP may emerge, guiding future CP
targeting approaches.
Reflections and results on the reconstructed ToC are presented in Figure 6 below.

4 Purpose, Scope and Methodology of the Evaluation
4.1 Purpose
The purpose of the evaluation is to assess UNICEF’s local GTA in Mongolia to inform the design of the new CP
to be implemented beyond 2021. The results of the evaluation will inform the decision on whether UNICEF
should continue using this approach, or adopt different approaches and recommend ways to improve the
effectiveness of the GTA.
The evaluation findings and recommendations aim to also help UNICEF to further improve the adoption of the
CFC strategies to achieve better results for children at the sub-national level.
Primary users of the evaluation include the GoM, sub-national governments in selected target areas and the UN
as a whole. Key partners in the GoM are the MLSP, Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Education and Science
(MES), AFCYD, National Development Agency, Cabinet Secretariat and UB city Municipality. Non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) partners are also considered as primary users, such as Save the Children, WV and
other NGO representatives working at the sub-national level. Main intended beneficiaries are disadvantaged
children. Secondary beenficiaries include national and sub-national government stakeholders, including local
government authorities in the GFA aimags, other implementing partners, and UNICEF itself.
Secondary users of the evaluation are communities overall.
As defined in the TORs, the specific objectives of the evaluation are:
● To assess to what extent UNICEF’s GTA is contributing to achieving the results of the CPD;
● To assess whether UNICEF’s targeting approach, as implemented in the GFAs addressed holistically
the needs of the most disadvantaged children;
● To assess to what extent UNICEF contributed to enhancing local governments capacity to effectively
plan and manage integrated and equitable service provisions for children in a holistic manner;
● To identify lessons learned and emerging good practices, as well as to determine more effective
and efficient modalities for the application of the targeting approaches to accelerate results for the
children in Mongolia and narrow gaps for the most disadvantaged children; and
● To assess the extent to which UNICEF’s support to sub-national work with priority GFAs contributed
to national scale-up.

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
4.2 Evaluation Scope
The evaluation covers UNICEF Mongolia’s GTAs employed in CP 2012-2016 and the current CP 2017-2021 in
the identified GFAs (from 2012 to the present). The scope of the evaluation includes:
● UNICEF’s GTA to programme implementation at the sub-national level as a whole, rather than sector-
specific assessment;
● Sub-national level interventions through CFC strategy in GFAs;
● The implementation period and GFAs evaluated include:
o 2012-2016 CP GFAs: Khuvsgul aimag and Nalaikh district of UB city; and
o 2017-2021 CP GFAs: Zavkhan, Govi-Altai, Bayankhongor aimags and Bayanzurkh district of UB city.
● Thematic coverage: all programme components that benefited from geographical targeting of
interventions.
For purposes of comparison, the evaluation selected one non-GFA aimag (Uvurkhangai) as a control to
provide an opportunity for a comparative analysis of UNICEF’s approach at the local level as requested in the
ToR (see Annex 1). The control aimag was chosen because of its proximity to Bayankhongor and comparable
demographics and deprivation indicators. Uvurkhangai was selected by AFCYD to roll-out the CFC approach,
making it potentially problematic as a comparison site (see section 4.6 on limitations and mitigation measures);
it was determined however that it could offer important insights on the potential for replication and sustainability
of UNICEF interventions, and has remained as a comparison site for this evaluation.
As specified in the TORs, the evaluation does not cover other aimags and districts nor the impact of the GTA
given time and resource constraints.
4.3 Evaluation Approach and Methods
Evaluation Approach and Methodology
The evaluation utilized a mixed methods approach.
Qualitative data was collected through primary key informant interviews (KIIs), focus group discussions (FGDs)
and secondary data. The secondary data reviewed provided by UNICEF included national country reports,
strategies, policies, guidelines, qualitative studies, program documents, etc. Additional secondary evidence
was collected through a literature review. The documentary evidence was reviewed using content analysis,
and then triangulated with the primary qualitative data. The causal assumptions in a reconstructed ToC were
explored to test explicit and implicit assumptions.
Quantitative data was used to assess marginalisation and deprivation of children and adolescents in Mongolia
at national and sub-national level, including children and adolescent health, education and socio-economic
status, and where possible the sex differentials in those outcomes and challenges.
Two case studies were undertaken in order to complement the qualitative and quantitative data collection and
analysis: 1) UNICEF’s GTA model and mapping of deprivation as a tool for selection of GFAs; and 2) UNICEF’s
efforts to build capacity of LGAs to target the most disadvantaged children through their budgetary processes.
Together the case studies provide important information on the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and
sustainability of the GTA. Case Study 1 investigates alternative approaches to selection of GFAs, while Case
Study 2 reviews the sustainability of UNICEF’s approach to building the capacity of LGAs to increase budget
allocation and priority given to children locally.
The Case Study on the GTA model and mapping of deprivation of children and adolescents in Mongolia used
an established Mongolian poverty measurement approach; a MODA based on child-appropriate dimensions
of poverty from the nationally representative Household Socio-Economic Survey (HSES)62 carried out in 2016
was used to create a multidimensional poverty estimate for each aimag based on a sample of 58,512 surveyed

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
individuals. These data represent the overlap in deprivation across one or more dimensions for each child,
ranging from a minimum of zero deprivation dimensions (not at all deprived) to a maximum of seven (deprived
across all dimensions). This was calculated for new-borns, children and adolescents separately. This information
was used to assess whether UNICEF’s GTA captured successfully aimags and districts with the greatest need,
and therefore the best potential to have impact on SDG child indicators. Other approaches to applying the GTA
within two other UNICEF COs are discussed.
Methods for the Case Study on local pro-child planning and budgeting encompassed compiling and analysing
quantitative secondary data through statistical and indicator data, and other relevant reports. Descriptive
statistics were employed to quantify and assess trends in outcomes and financing between GFAs and the
comparison non-GFA aimag. Quantitative secondary data reviewed included existing national surveys (Census,
Social Indicator Sample Survey (SISS), MODA, HSES, National Nutrition Survey (NNS) etc.), sub-national
administrative and financial data, and outcome indicators from the CP 2012-2016 and CP 2017-2021 Results
Frameworks. The Results Framework was also used to assess trends in targeting, programming, investment
and progress towards CP outcomes.
Data were disaggregated by relevant criteria (wherever possible) for both quantitative and qualitative analysis.
All data collected for the evaluation through KIIs and FGDs were disaggregated by age, gender, or deprivation
measures to ensure all thematic issues and information was assessed with the most disadvantaged children
and their families being the priority target group.
Lessons learned and emerging good practice identified by the evaluation were documented. Best practice
models identified by UNICEF at the end of CP 2012-2016 were explored in particular for their sustainability
and contribution towards national scale-up. Contribution analysis was used to assess causal links; triangulation
was applied in order to guarantee the reliability and robustness of findings. This consisted of cross-referencing
different sources of data from the various data collection methods to validate individual responses. A key aspect
of the evaluation was to document lessons learned from success stories. Identifying such positive stories was
to allow show-casing of what has worked in specific GFAs and how those experiences could be replicated and
built upon in future CPs.
Guiding Principles
The evaluation followed United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG Norms and Standards for Evaluation in the
UN system and abided by UNEG Ethical Guidelines and Code of Conduct being independence, impartiality,
credibility, conflicts of interest, accountability. Anonymity and confidentiality of individual informants will be
protected as required by the ethical procedures of Mongolia and UNEG63.
For the purpose of this evaluation, ethical guidelines and principles were discussed and agreed upon between
the team of evaluators, national and international consultants, and with reference to UNEG Guidelines on
evaluation practices, and UNEG guidelines for integrating Human Rights and gender equality in evaluations64.
Independence was observed between the evaluation team and UNICEF Mongolia staff, in particular the
UNICEF Evaluation Office. Not directly involved in conducting the evaluation, UNICEF teams were present in
a consultation function, and as stakeholders of the evaluation. Integrity during the evaluation process was
ensured by building an organizational culture based on cooperation between team members, respect of
cultural and gender diversity, openness and honestly in communication, and continual opportunity for each
member to voice any concerns they might have on the evaluation process, the organization of the work, the
requirements and guidelines used.
Conflicts of interest within the team, and with UNICEF were dealt with honestly through dialogue.
Accountability was guaranteed among team members, participants, and stakeholders during the entirety of
the evaluation process. Local evaluators conducting the data collection with duty-bearers and rights holders
were trained on their ethical obligations and good practice for handling personal data, and for conducting

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
an evaluation aligned with UNEG standards and norms. During the data collection phase, specific tools and
data handling and storage processes were developed to ensure the ethnicity guidelines. Participants were
made aware of their data-related rights, and that their responses and associated personal data would
be comprehensively anonymised. Their name was taken down for records and to make the personal data
available to the respondent for consultation, modification, deletion. As such, the processes developed were in
alignment with the Personal Data Protection and Privacy Principles adopted by the UN High-Level Committee
on Management65.
Ethical safeguards for participants were in place to safeguard respect for dignity and diversity, right to self-
determination, fair representation, and compliance with codes for vulnerable groups, confidentiality, and
avoidance of harm. Specific ethical safeguards for research involving children were adhered to including, and
espcailly the priniciple of “do no harm”66. Precautions were detailed in the informed concent process (see
Supplemental Sub-Annex C for Informed consent forms and tools), and through training conducted by the
lead evaluator. As the team conducted FGDs with children, special measures were also taken to convene the
FGD with children at the same time (in the same room at a distance so specific conversations could not be
overheard, or, in the next room) as the FGD with their parents to ensure consent and comfort of both parties.
The evaluation was transparent, inclusive, participatory, and integrated both gender and human rights
perspectives.
Transparency was assured through clear communication with stakeholders at all stages of the evaluation with
respect to its purpose, the criteria applied, and the intended use of the findings. Stakeholders were explained
that the evaluation results would be made public at the end of the process. The evaluation had a participatory
approach and integrated the views of beneficiaries. The evaluation followed the guidance on the integration
of gender equality and human rights principles in the evaluation focus and process as established in the
UNEG Handbook, Integrating Human Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluation - Towards UNEG Guidance.
Special attention was paid to ensure that a gender, equity and human rights-based approach was embedded
into the data collection and analysis. The evaluation process showed sensitivity to gender, beliefs, culture
and customs of all stakeholders. Both rights holders and duty bearers were included as informants with
acknowledgement of their responsibilities and entitlements stated in the interview probes. Gender, equity and
human rights were included in the evaluation questions under implementation of the CRC. To further elucidate
gender, equity and human rights issues, a specific probe was added to all questions where it may be relevant
to ensure that the issues are covered both as specific issues (through the CRC question) and as a cross-cutting
issues that should underlie all UNICEF activities.
4.4 Evaluation Questions
This section presents the evaluation questions (by selected Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria
of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability as defined in the ToRs), assumptions tested, indicators and
data collection methods. The assumptions (and probes) narrowed evaluation questions further by specifying
what evaluators should focus upon and what they should check specifically when attempting to answer the
question. Data collection concentrated on gathering evidence linked to those assumptions (and counter-
assumptions) articulated by the indicators. The Evaluation questions are aligned with the reconstructed ToC
and include the questions relevant to testing its validity.
The evaluation methodology aimed to ensure that credible answers can be provided to the evaluation questions
based on verifiable evidence. Together the questions provide answers on whether UNICEF’s GTA and associated
strategies were relevant, whether approaches and programmes had been effectively and sustainably designed
and implemented to reach the targeted disadvantaged children and their families; whether specific targeting
assumptions such as the building of LGA capacity and use of multisectoral approaches within the CFC strategies
had been effective to achieving expected outputs and outcomes, and whether resources had been efficiently

4.5 Sampling and Analysis
Sample
Participants for the qualitative data collection were selected from key stakeholders who were in Khuvsgul
aimag and Nalaikh district during the CP from 2012-2016; and Zavkhan, Govi-Altai, Bayankhongor aimags, and
Bayanzurkh district in UB city during the 2017-2021 CP. UNICEF and GoM actors in UB relevant to both CPs
were also interviewed. Six categories of stakeholders were identified as priority groups from which responses
to the evaluation questions were sought, mainly through KIIs. FGDs were carried out with social workers and
teachers in the capacity of duty bearers, and with children and their parents in the capacity of rights holders.
A total of 173 people (67 key informants, 14 FGDs engaging 106 people) participated in data collection between
June and September 2020 in all current GFAs (Bayankhongor, Govi-Altai, Zavkhan aimag, Bayanzurkh district)
and previous GFAs (Khuvsgul aimag and Nalaikh district) including non-GFA aimag (Uvurkhangai) as we well as

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
The initial plan for the data collection in GFA aimags was to conduct a total of 24 KIIs (16 KIIs in aimag centres
and 8 KIIs in soums) in three GFA aimags and 1 non-GFA aimag and their respective four soums. With good
collaboration and commitment from the aimags, the field team ended up conducting more KIIs than planned.
As such, the team was able to collect more data than was anticipated in the aimag centres and soums involving
officials from Local GOs, and CRH and relevant subnational departments (Departments of Education, Health,
and FCYD) in the field. In addition, 14 FGDs engaged 106 social workers, teachers, children and their parents in
groups between 5-8 persons.
Data analysis
Qualitative data collected according to the evaluation questions were summarised on evaluation data matrices
by respondent category/source and type (i.e. document review, KII, FGD) and analysed through a three-level
analysis process to ensure triangulation and robustness of findings.
First level analysis of the data was by stakeholder type (i.e. UNICEF staff, LGAs, social workers), was collated
and summarised by sub-evaluation question and geographic region. The second level analysis summarised
responses to evaluation sub-questions across all respondents from the various instruments. For example, the
summary response to evaluation question 1 from the level one analysis for each data source (e.g. KIIs UNICEF
staff; KIIs aimags; FGDs teachers; document review, etc.) was analysed together to create a collective summary
across data sources as an answer to each evaluation sub-question. At the third level analysis, results from the
second level analysis of the sub-questions were pulled together to answer the primary evaluation questions
with special focus on the multi-sectoral approach to addressing child deprivation through the CFC model;
and the CP programming approach more generally aimed at reaching the most vulnerable. Triangulation was
applied to maximize the reliability and robustness of findings, e.g. by cross-referencing different data sources
and data collection methods.
For the case study model analysis, we employed a Bayesian geospatial modelling approach using the R-INLA
package within R software. This is particularly useful in situations where survey data were collected and
representative at coarser spatial resolutions than the predicted estimates. We included geospatial covariates
such as population, elevation, precipitation and temperature, as well as socio-economic indicators such as
wealth, accessibility to the nearest urban centre, recent health status, education, etc. to robustly predict child
deprivation amongst infants 0 – 23 months and 24 – 59 months. Maps depicting these estimates at the aimag
level were produced across the country, in addition to associated model uncertainty in the form of 95% credible
interval maps67.
A contribution analysis was used to identify changes that occurred through targeting within GFAs (and a
non–GFA for comparison) and UNICEF’s contribution to those changes over the relevant time period. Changes
reported from the GFAs were contrasted with findings from the non-GFA to assess change that can be attributed
to UNICEF and spill over effects. The evaluators made sure to distinguish between attribution and contribution
according to the UNEG Standards for Evaluation68.
The results of the investigation allowed the team to test the reconstructed ToC and the assumptions therein.
By triangulating all data from all sources, a comprehensive picture emerged on the validity of the reconstructed
ToC, and GTA approaches, and UNICEF’s contribution to the changes observed in their GFAs.
Additional results from the Case Studies (beyond the information that was collected through evaluation
question responses, from document review, KIIs, and FGDs) also contextualised and informed the third level
analysis. Any additional quantitative data from programme and government sources were included in this level
of the analysis as well. This analysis and interpretation were done in an analysis workshop with the full team
online over a series of days. Results from the analyses informed the validation of the ToC and the consideration
and recommendations for the new CP, including alternative approaches to geographic targeting.

4.6 Limitations and mitigation measures
GTA as an evaluative subject: Evaluating UNICEF’s GTA proved challenging as parameters of what is included
in the strategic approach, and at what level they can be evaluated, are difficult to define. Despite detailed
ToRs, there was a lack of consensus on the scope and focus of the evaluation during the inception period
with some staff considering the aim to be programme intervention level focused rather than a strategic level
evaluation of UNICEF’s targeting approach. As philosophical and programmatic strategy, it did not lend itself to
measurement through standard programme evaluation components such as a review of the monitoring and
evaluation framework, cost, and partnerships, making attribution of results to the GTA (versus other UNICEF
strategies of interventions packages) potentially subjective. In addition, the CPs did not have an overarching ToC
to situate the GTA within the programme components. Finally, UNICEF’s Global Evaluation Reports Oversight
System’s (GEROS) evaluation guidelines and quality criteria are not wholly applicable to traditional programme
evaluations.
Mitigation: The evaluation team constructed a ToC against which the evaluation was designed. Review of
indicators for their contribution to targeting helped to locate the GTA within programme activities. Triangulation
of findings, helped focus results on the higher-level analysis of the relevance and effectiveness of the GTA.
Consultation with the M&E officer and the regional office M&E team clarified misconceptions and helped guide
the evaluation towards a higher-level analysis and result, including on how to responds to GEROS requirements
in the context of the evaluation’s scope.
GTA focus of the evaluation was difficult to comprehend for respondents: An evaluation on geographical
targeting proved difficult to understand for many of the people we were interviewing. In addition, few aimag
and soum respondents had the historical memory to respond to how targeting was being done in some of the
thematic programmes. This was in part due to high turn-over of local government actors in the GFAs.
Mitigation: The local team gave significant attention (and time during the interviews) to keeping the interviews
focused on the specific aims of the evaluation, as most respondents assumed it to be a UNICEF programme
evaluation. The high number of KIIs also compensated for any specific interviewees misunderstanding as
saturation was reached on each evaluation question. In addition, UNICEF staff that have been involved in
the last two CPs facilitated other team members’ understanding of the GTA process that occurred previously.
Moreover, the evaluation team interviewed former UNICEF staff including the former Representative during
the previous CP to better understand the thinking behind the GTA conducted at the time.
COVID -19 and it effect on the evaluation: This evaluation was planned and conducted during the
unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions in movement impacted data collection in significant, and in
some cases, unanticipated ways. Perhaps the most significant effects have been the restriction on international
travel, which has resulted in the international team providing leadership and guidance only at distance. This
has protracted the planning, training and data collection process, and limited in depth collective discussion by
the team for the analysis and interpretation of the results. Face to face teamwork expedites communication,
which is in any case, partially in translation, and facilitates dialogue, debate and triangulation of findings and
opinions.
Mitigation: These issues were mitigated by weekly if not biweekly extended conference calls, email
communication and online analysis workshops. Training was also provided at a distance on an on-going basis
by the evaluation lead.
Appropriateness of the comparison non-GFA: Uvurkhangai was selected as the control non-GFA aimag
based on similar criteria as the GTA: It shared comparable indicators, and socio-economic profile as the GFAs
and was located adjacent to the GFAs making data collection more efficient. However, it is one of the six
aimags in which AFCYD has started rolling-out the CFC since September 2019 with Government funding. In
addition, Uvurkhangai aimag was proposed as a control aimag before the case study (see Annex 3: Case Study
1) was conducted on funding patterns that revealed the share of LDF projects benefiting children (directly and
indirectly) in Uvurkhangai over the past few years is equal to, or greater than that in 2 of the 4 GFA aimags.
Mitigation: Despite potential bias, closer analysis of Uvurkhangai implementation of the CFC and other child-
34 | Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming

focused strategies offers valuable insights on the replicability; scale up and sustainability of UNICEF supported
approaches including the CFC approach through external (non-UNICEF), and local resources.
Timing and planning: Initial planning for field data collection was scheduled for March 2020. Due to travel
restrictions related to various COVID-19 regulations, and advice from the Cabinet Secretariat, the local team
was able to resume field data collection only in June. In addition, the delayed start of data collection needed to
be further postponed until after the Parliamentary elections, principally so as not to confuse study participants
with election propaganda (as advised by the government).
Mitigation: Despite the fact that all schools were closed and running lessons via TVs, we were able to conduct
FGDs with school children with the help of school teachers and social workers. In Tosontsengel soum of Zavkhan
aimag, children were already out in rural areas tending the livestock and no longer in the soum. As a result,
no FGD with children was collected in that soum. As FGDs were possible in the other soums, the shortfall in
Tosontsengel was not considered particularly limiting as saturation of responses had been achieved.
The team also faced additional data collection scheduling challenges in UB, further delaying data collection
by a month in July-August. Between the parliamentary election cycle and the holiday period, few additional
interviews were conducted. Most local administrators were part of the election campaigns and thus, still busy
with planning and transition meetings. Others had already started their summer break (starting from the
National Holiday Naadam for July 11-15 and onwards).
Mitigation: As a result, KIIs in UB were conducted until mid-September to ensure all key stakeholders were
met.
Within the evaluation, further complications occurred during the analysis and write up of the findings due to
the team member’s unavailability for a variety of COVID-19 related reasons including ill health and childcare
requirements. The protracted data collection, and delayed analysis period ending up exhausting the number
of days available on consultant contracts further compressing the time available to work together as a team
and conduct the analysis and write-up. Again, due to travel restrictions, a team meeting on the analysis was
not possible.
Mitigation: The local and international team leaders absorbed the additional tasks and proceeded with the
analysis with the remaining team members as they were available.

5 Findings
5.1To what extent is UNICEF’s GTA reflected in law, policy, regulation, strategies and
plans? (EQ1)
Relevance
Summary:
UNICEF’s GTA strategy to select GFAs was independent, but largely an internal exercise using criteria
that balanced evidence-based needs with efficiency concerns. UNICEF approach to targeting of
disadvantaged children within the GFAs aligns with government sector priorities and aim to work inter-
sectorally. The GTA strategy integrated a human rights and equity-based approach to strategically reach
the most vulnerable children in the GFAs where UNICEF was working was also relevant and aligned to
government intervention strategies.
However, there was a notable lack of coherence around the meaning of who is “vulnerable” (or
deprived) both in data-terms and more broadly, between UNICEF and the GoM as well as between
different stakeholders. Other challenges of the targeting approach was that the data used for targeting
was insufficiently granular or representative at the targeting level needed, and that many geographic
areas (and sub-populations) falling outside of the selected GFAs identified as having endemic or human
rights issues that require specific attention were targeted for interventions during the CPs.
The GTA strategy to reach all children in the GFAs through holistic, intersectoral intervention packages is
an appropriate and relevant strategy with promise of replicability and scale-up, particularly when led by
local government authorities and stakeholders.
5.1.1 Alignment of UNICEF GTA to government child survival and thriving priorities
UNICEF’s GTA outlining where to intervene does not necessarily align with the GoM approach; the thematic
targeting approach outlining how to work remains relevant for the Government and aligns with the national
strategies and plans generally. Specifically, alignment was evident in thematic programming as done through
implementing local partners, usually sub-national government counterparts such as LGAs, teachers, social
workers and other front-line workers. For example, implementation of the CFC approach in all the GFAs of both
CPs, and in an additional aimags under the sponsorship of AFCYD, demonstrates applicability and the relevance
of the GTA approach to the government. Thematic targeting alignment was evident in UNICEF’s support for
CWDs within Government schools: UNICEF established 12 Child Development Centres (CDCs) in mainstream
schools and non-formal education centres in the GFAs in which 229 CWDs enrolled as of 2019 with additional
4 CDCs enrolling 81 CWDs in 202069. Such intervention strategies exemplified to national and sub-national
stakeholders that UNICEF’s approach to geographical targeting (using survey data such as the SISS and HSES
data and N-MODA70 analyses) to identify and target vulnerable children through their programmes was an
approach founded in equitability (e.g. identifying geographic regions that are in the most need)71.
UNICEF’s priority of selecting GFAs as a potential platform to showcase model intervention strategies tested
during CP 2012-2016 (see section 5.6.1) was considered relevant by UNICEF staff and national level policymakers.
The approach was considered to allow for both efficient targeting of limited resources, as well as tailoring
resources to, either showcase model interventions packages for scale up and replication in other aimags, or for
69 UNICEF (2019) Mid-Term Review of the Country Programme 2017-2021
70 Two versions of the MODA analyses exist, N-MODA and M-MODA, representing different aspects of deprivation. The N-MODA is a single deprivation
analysis measuring deprivation in each thematic deprivation dimension (e.g., overweight, shared toilet, overcrowding, etc.), while the M-MODA is a
multiple deprivation analysis representing the number of dimensions across which a child is deprived.

the creation of targeted interventions to suit an aimag’s specific needs. In Zavkhan aimag, representatives from
the GO and the line ministries appreciated UNICEF’s alignment and support for the local government’s efforts
to invest in an integrated kindergarten model that includes multi-sectoral packages of interventions including
WASH, nutrition and ECD. Furthermore, the MES sees UNICEF-supported CDCs as a good model and is planning
to replicate this model in 21 provinces with World Bank (WB) support in the next two years.
National policymakers and practitioners (e.g. teachers, social workers) noted, in contrast, that the GoM’s
approach is founded on an equality-based approach (e.g. ensuring all geographic regions are treated the
same). The majority of government policies and programmes have no priority geographic areas identified.
Notable exceptions include case specific geographic or population targeting such as cash subsidies for poor
families through the food stamps or the CMP and regional action plans for risk management interventions to
support families facing dzud or other environmental disasters, among others. GoM determination of who will
receive subsidies however is assessed differently than UNICEF (see section 5.1.3 below).
Aside from these exceptions, government support was otherwise stated to be universally applicable to all
aimags and regions72. As such, UNICEF and GoM necessarily approach targeting differently both in terms of
approach and philosophically based on respective institutional priorities and requirements. The selection of
GFAs through UNICEF’s application of the GTA was understood as an internal, institutional issue. This may
explain why GoM representatives did not participate during UNICEF’s GFA selection process for CP 2017-2021,
although preferences and requests for assistance were received from Governor’s offices and some Ministries.
It was not clear however whether limited external participation was not due to organisational issues rather
than as a purposeful internal process.
5.1.2 Thematic targeting and alignment to government priorities
UNICEF’s GTA that works through integrated strategies and approaches both upstream through policy
advocacy, and downstream in aimags, soums and districts is relevant and aligned with government
strategies aiming to reach the most vulnerable children.
Relevance of upstream policy advocacy and evidence generation
There was almost a consensus of appreciation by policy-maker key informants, especially of MES, MoH and MLSP
on UNICEF’s alignment to government policies and priorities in their collaboration on developing intersectoral
strategies. For example, the multi-stakeholder permanent working group led by the Deputy Minister for Labour
and Social Protection, and GoM solicitation of UNICEF’s support to jointly review sector strategies for children
and provide feedback before approval demonstrate concurrence of approach.
UNICEF also influenced the GoM policy agenda through evidence generation and advocacy.
During CP 2012-2016, UNICEF successfully advocated with the MoH and the National Authority for Children
(current AFCYD) to develop key legislation to benefit vulnerable and disadvantaged children. UNICEF successfully
raised awareness of critical issues through the Fifth NNS to inform the development of the law (2016) on Food
for Infants and Young Children to include a breastmilk substitution. In partnership with other development
partners such as UNFPA, they advocated extensively over years for the approval of the Child Protection and
Child Rights law (2016).
UNICEF also partnered with the GoM to build the evidence base for future collaboration. Examples include
convening an Expert Consultation on Sanitation in Cold Climates (with the MoH, the Public Health Centre
and SDC); commissioning a study on barriers to education for CWDs; and developing a Developmental Assets
Profile on Adolescent in Mongolia to raise awareness of adolescents’ intersectional need. Likewise, UNICEF
built the evidence base and partnership around combatting urban air pollution, which resulted in a national
research agenda, a policy roadmap, and a national communications and advocacy strategy.
In the GFAs, UNICEF translated the national dialogue and policy agenda for local action. The GFA Bayankhongor
72 National Programme on Maternal, Child and Reproductive Health 2020-2024; National Program on Reduction of Air and Environmental
Pollution 2017-2025; National Program on supporting rights of people with disabilities, their participation and development (2017); State Policy on
Health 2017-2026; State Policy on Education 2014-2024; The National Nutrition Programme (2015)

aimag, developed a “Smog-Free Bayankhongor Action Plan” – a testament to subnational commitment
and alignment to common priorities. Other thematically targeted interventions during the current CP
include: assessment of indoor air quality (in Bayanzurkh district); financial support for the national multiple
micronutrient and supplementation programme for dzud affected households; and implementation of the
National Programme on Child Development and Protection for 2017-2020, including mapping and reaching out
to children in 4 khoroos of Bayanzurkh district who were not attending school.
Relevance to (downstream) sub-national sector priorities
Local government sectoral respondents from the GFAs shared UNICEF’s view that issues affecting vulnerable
children are multi-sectoral, necessitating inter-sectoral collaboration. For example, in all the GFAs, LGA
respondents appreciated the CFC approach for stimulating awareness of child rights and the whole child
approach. This translated into intersectoral cooperation through functional multi-disciplinary teams (MDTs) at
aimag and soum level, and community-based IYCF counselling service cabinets in the GFAs.73
In Nalaikh district, targeting approaches in thematic interventions were also observed. These included
introduction of community-driven and energy-efficient technologies in water and sanitation, addressing
capacity gaps in local planning and delivery of quality services for children, and cross-sectoral mechanisms
responding to abuse and neglect of children by engaging the health, education, social welfare and justice
sectors.
In CP 2017-2021, UNICEF greatly increased support for targeted interventions, even within integrated
programmes such as WASH and nutrition, to offset critical deprivation of subgroups such as ger communities
in the Bayanzurkh district, or children exposed to dzud in Zavkhan. Within the GFAs, UNICEF responded to
the needs of marginalised children by working to develop an inclusive child-friendly school environment for
CWDs74 and ethnic minorities75. They also worked to ensure essential health services for marginalized children
and women in isolated areas by advocating for equitable social investments through pro-poor social and
investment policies. In Zavkhan aimag, representatives from the GO and sector practitioners appreciated
UNICEF’s support for local government’s efforts to invest in an integrated kindergarten model that includes
multi-sectoral packages of interventions including WASH, nutrition and ECD.
A reflection of the thematic programmes that are currently implementing the GTA approach in the current CP
is summarised in Annex 2C.
Opportunities and challenges
During the previous CP, UNICEF was narrowly focused on two GFAs where they sought to demonstrate the
value and effectiveness of integrated programming. The heightened focus in only two GFAs created a strong
collaboration between the LGAs (specifically the Governors of Khuvsgul aimag and LGA in Nalaikh district) and
UNICEF. Implementation of the CFC initiative at aimag, soum and district level brought together diverse actors
implicated in the care and protection of disadvantaged children for common purpose. Through creation and
support for multi-sectoral committees and mechanisms under the umbrella of the CFC helped to establish a
collective will to integrate child rights holistically across sectors. By design, this targeted the disadvantaged
children through the various intervention strategies. In the subsequent CP, the cohesion between UNICEF and
LGA programming, which the narrow GTA focus afforded in the previous CP, was more difficult to maintain as
the programme interventions necessarily expanded in both geographical focus and content areas.
The GTA provides the opportunity to reach all children. As noted earlier, universal approaches to some
intervention strategies, particularly related to health and education, are designed to reach all children (rights
holder) equally – a view shared by the GoM and partners alike. For such intervention, targeting is implicated
when sub-groups are specifically left out as was the case of internal non-registered migrants living in the
outskirts of the ger districts in UB. For those communities, UNICEF did an assessment of needs and discovered

the lack of access to basic services such as kindergartens and schools. Through documentation of the problem
and joint missions with government actors to assess the situation, UNICEF convinced district authorities and
the national counterparts to build kindergartens, and develop legislation to facilitate access to services for the
targeted areas – a policy deviation from the government’s universal approach76.
Most sector respondents at national and sub-national level (e.g. education, social protection, health) were
positive about the collaborative working relationship they have with UNICEF, and valued the intersectoral
emphasis of the intervention strategies. Some LGA respondents at aimag level however, shared that in some
locations both the sector line ministry and the UNICEF thematic programmes work together but independent
from the other sectors associated with the integrated package - even when being implemented in the same
soum for example. This siloed approach to implementation in some sectors was considered difficult to overcome
given sectoral ways of working were not always aligned. For example, WASH infrastructure development in a
school in Bayanzurkh district originally did not build capacities of technicians to maintain the facilities, leaving
oversight to teachers and principals. As a lesson learned from the first installations, UNICEF involved school
plumbers at an early stage of planning and trained them on operation and maintenance both during and after
construction.
A summary of UNICEF’s thematic targeting of outputs and outcomes in CP 2012-2016 and CP 2017-2021 is
available in Annex 2B and 2C.
5.1.3 Defining vulnerability and disadvantage
To successfully target, clarity of terminology is critical. No clear definition of vulnerable (or disadvantaged)77
children emerged among aimag and soum respondents among both rights holders and duty bearers. While
recognising translation issues, interviewees and the evaluation team discussed in Mongolian differing views
on which children (and families) have the greatest needs. The most important determinants included socio-
demographic factors (e.g. occupation, poverty dimensions), orphan, disability or household status, disability,
and living status (e.g. under the care of relatives, living in dormitories, etc.) among others. For example, soum
parents and teachers suggested that vulnerable children are those that are unaccompanied by parents or
caregivers, or who live in the soum centre in gers rather than in school dormitories. FGDs with teachers, social
workers and parents frequently identified the following vulnerable groups: CWDs, orphans, and families with
the lowest living standards, children with malnutrition, and children experiencing domestic violence due to
drinking problems.
In contrast, national policy-makers generally presented a more concise definition of who the vulnerable children
are and how they are targeted, based on age and disability. Although in the legal and policy realm there is
no clear definition of vulnerability, some government laws and national programmes on child development
provide a definition of a child at risk:
“A person who cannot live in an adequate environment that enables their right to health,
life, and safety; or a child without caregivers or legal bodies to represent or a child in
disasters and emergencies”
– KII, Policymaker
The latest government policy document emphasised that: “Child Development, Rights and Protections policies
shall be strengthened, and social policies shall enable equal opportunities for all children including CWDs,
children from migrant, vulnerable, at-risk families”78.
The definition of who is vulnerable (or disadvantaged) often rests on examples in policy documents, or by
the agency or partner doing the targeting. This leaves an opening for considerable subjective interpretation,
and potential bias. Many respondents noted differences in the needs and risks of specific children based on
76 Country Office Annual Report (COAR) 2017, 2018
77 ‘Disadvantaged’ children, UNICEF’s apparently preferred term, is used interchangeably with vulnerability in many reports and documents; although
there appears to be a concerted effort to streamline towards the term disadvantaged – a less stigmatising term focused on the circumstances rather
than the child. In Mongolia however, the terms are used synonymously.

Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming | 39
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
their exposure to geographic risk, such as urbanisation and climate shocks. For example, children in arid settings
often face harsher climate conditions and are therefore more in need of indoor plumbing/toilet facilities than
children in warmer climates within the country are79.
Further, children in urban areas reportedly face increased health risks due to air pollution as compared to rural
children, while rural children are at increased risk of accident and injury due to labour exploitation from herding
or child jockeying. Currently, who is vulnerable, and therefore potentially targeted, often differs according to
the agency or sector doing the analysis. For example, the GoM analysis for children and families in need of
social protection is specified in the Law on Social Welfare within the MLSP agency mandate, (either through
GOLSWS or AFCYD depending on the action required); yet national and regional analysis on how to address the
effects of climate disasters on herder families may be done based on dzud risk mapping by the National Agency
for Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring.
The definitional confusion extends to UNICEF and GoM respondents that also shared different
understanding of which children and families should be targeted. This may arise from the different use of
data. UNICEF and other partners generally use sources such as the MODA analysis and SISS data to define
child deprivation, whereas the GoM uses various data sources and analysis techniques such as PMT as well
as sectoral administrative databases (see below). Recently, stakeholders have noted an increasing interest
from the government to update and consolidate data sources, representing a potential opportunity to work
collaboratively with the GoM to better define vulnerability among children and collect more accurate data.
Another issue identified was that the government’s definition of vulnerability was constantly changing, further
suggesting a need for reflection or a paradigm shift in thinking about how deprivation should be measured, and
its significance for children across Mongolia.
5.1.4 Alternative approaches to targeting: trade-offs, gender and human rights
The GTA was generally seen to integrate a human-rights and equity-based approach, by aiming to
strategically reach the most vulnerable populations in the GFAs. Gender, in contrast, was embedded within
thematic programming as a topical issue, and not a specific criterion for the geographical targeting. For
example, a gender-based assessment was mentioned, which elucidated differences in issues faced by boys and
girls. These results suggested boys were at greater risk of labour exploitation and resulting accidents due to
herding or child jockeying80, while girls were at higher risk of suicide or other mental health conditions. Based
on this assessment, UNICEF created a gender-based tool to allow each geographic area to identify its own
gender-related challenges and issues. However, many soum-level duty bearers argued that there was no need
to integrate a gender-based approach, as their areas did not suffer from gender-based discrimination. Further
exploration of respondents understanding of gender related barriers to services for example, were not well
understood indicating a need to expand training for LGA partners in the GFAs on gender determinants of child
and adolescent health and wellbeing.
As noted above, respondents stated that UNICEF GFAs are selected based on deprivation indices as measured
through data sources such as the SISS, HSES and MODA analysis, but that the GoM uses PMT and other means
to identify vulnerable children and their families. Challenges have been raised around all methods but there
were considerable concerns about the government’s use of PMT and administrative data to decide on which
families receive support.
Many respondents considered that the GoM’s PMT approach, which identifies those who will receive benefits
from the food stamp distribution programme and the CMP (previously), was successful in identifying and
ultimately helping to lift families out of poverty by increasing food security, reducing reliance on social benefits,
and increasing employment81. Despite these positive impacts, many interviewees noted that the PMT often
missed the most vulnerable children and their families by not considering other dimensions of deprivation,
and the difficulty in calculating economic deprivation without actualised data. Further, mistakes in targeting

by line ministries locally are common due to inclusion and exclusion errors and human bias (analysing the
administrative data). The GoM officials and IFI partners increasingly recognise such problems: an updating
of the PMT approach is currently underway. UNICEF staff generally agreed that data sources encompassing
multiple deprivation indices, such as those undertaken through MODA analyses, were more appropriate for
targeting thematic interventions such as social protection and ECD to reach the most vulnerable. Nevertheless,
challenges around up-to-date and reliable data sources persist.
Key respondents observed that data sources used for targeting geographic areas are representative at the
regional level and are not suited for use at the aimag or soum level, where more localized data sources should
be used, such as administrative data (although of inconsistent quality). Further, because UNICEF’s targeting
approach is philosophically different to that of the GoM, some respondents felt that the government may
not have appreciated UNICEF’s approach to the selection of GFAs. Some interviewees suggested that political
priorities may have played a role in the government’s position.
5.2 To what extent has UNICEF’s GTA aligned to the unique challenges faced by children
during the last two CPs? (EQ2)
Relevance
Summary:
UNICEF was seen to be adequately targeting vulnerable children, and more specifically, CWDs through
its programming. However, some participants mentioned that the UNICEF-targeted aimags were
not necessarily those where the problems are most significant, especially related to problems facing
adolescents, such as STIs and mental health issues.
Areas identified where additional targeting may be needed include those with significant air pollution
problems and the growing unregistered communities outside of ger districts in UB due to high rural-to-
urban migration. The predominantly Muslim, Bayan-Ulgii aimag was also not selected despite having
very poor indicators for child health and wellbeing.
There were calls for universal interventions to tackle certain issues that are not specific to geographic
areas such as STIs. A key challenge for such thematic programming is the difficulty in scaling up sustainably
and in closing the funding gap when operating outside of UNICEF’s GFAs.
5.2.1 Identifying and tackling barriers to reaching vulnerable children
National level government partners indicated that they supported UNICEF’s selection of aimags for the
previous programme, and further, considered the selection criteria valid as applied by UNICEF in the current
GTA process. For example, national stakeholders confirmed that for CP 2012-2016, Khuvsgul was selected due
to its number of ethnic minorities, multiple deprivations, and location (e.g operational efficiency of focusing
in one aimag)82. Nalaikh district was considered specifically vulnerable in terms of the high number of working
children at the small coal mining sites, as well as the presence of a marginalised minority groups (e.g. Kazakh
groups) and migrant children. However, development partners and some UNICEF staff held that household
economic indicators were prioritised for the selection of areas and localities in need. For CP 2017-2021, despite
wider consultation, and a more inclusive process, which criteria was given greater weight for the final selection
of GFAs remained unclear for some stakeholders (though there was little dissatisfaction with the selection). For
UNICEF and their GoM and international partners, the relevance of the GFAs selected was rationalised. This
was perhaps in part due to GoM stakeholders considering the application of the GTA as an internal to UNICEF
(as noted in Section 5.1.1)
At aimag and soum level however, many respondents were unaware why their location was selected.
Nonetheless, there was agreement that UNICEF was adequately targeting vulnerable children, and more

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
specifically, CWDs in their area. Successful targeting within the WASH program was most noted as appropriate
given the needs. In 2016, during the design of CP 2017-2021, access to improved WASH facilities was around
27.3% - 39.1% in urban areas, but only 6.8% in rural areas83 making the issue a priority for both national and
LGAs in the GFAs.
Moreover, there was ambivalence among some local government and practitioner respondents from the GFAs
regarding the prominence of the disability program. All participants agreed that focusing on CWDs was crucial,
as these children are at higher risk of adverse outcomes than other children (without disability) that may be
able to attend mobile and ger kindergartens, and benefit from other services. However, all GFA respondents
(duty bearers and rights holder) were concerned that the increasing focus on CWDs may create a backlash
among poor communities and families that are suffering multiple deprivations.
5.2.2 Targeting hotspots of deprivation for children
The evaluation team explored with duty bearers and rights holders whether the GFA selection for CP 2017-
2021 continued to represent the locations with the greatest needs, and thus holding better promise for
reducing inequity and deprivation among children strategically. While it was clear that not all challenges can be
addressed with UNICEF support, respondents were asked to reflect on what they considered the most pressing
issues facing children, with the goal of informing and heightening the relevancy of future GTA application by
UNICEF for identifying where and how to intervene strategically with greatest impact.
UNICEF and implementing partners (IPs) recognised that currently, UNICEF’s GFAs only partially cover
significant hotspots related to adolescent health and air pollution in particular. UNICEF has reportedly
adapted to the challenges of partial coverage by adding the Umnugovi aimag in the current CP as recommended
by the UNICEF MTR84. Key informants from UNICEF reported that issues relating to substance abuse are on the
rise in Umnugovi aimag due to the increase in cross border traffic of coal and persons (truck drivers).
Another aimag with current UNICEF programmes that falls outside of the GFAs is Bayan-Ulgii aimag, a
predominantly Muslim aimag with poor child health and welfare indicators. UNICEF respondents clarified that
it was not selected as a GFA because it was deemed as not representative of Mongolian children’s situation.
Similarly, Dornod, an Eastern aimag with the highest prevalence of adolescent STIs was also deemed to be an
outlier but one which could benefit from UNICEF supported national STI prevention interventions.
Stakeholders raised various issues that need additional attention (beyond what UNICEF was focusing on in their
aimag or soum) and may require alternative targeting to ensure they are adequately addressed.
Policymaker and UNICEF key informants commented that a critical population in need of specific interventions
are the growing number of unregistered communities outside of ger districts in UB due to high rural-to-urban
migration. UB’s peri-urban, ger areas have a very concerning mix of issues, and poverty there is estimated
as among the highest in the country (30%-40% poor households in peri-urban areas compared with 26% in
rural areas). These communities face challenges including lack of urban infrastructure and shortages of quality
health and education services. Moreover, children from UB experience 7-8 times more respiratory disease
than children living in other urban and rural areas with lower levels of air pollution85. The situation in these
communities was summarised as follows:
“Children in my constituency spend their winter on ice and their summer on dust and play
on litter.. children walk for five kilometres to reach school from home due to a lack of bus
and transportation.. there is this restriction to riding horses because no livestock is allowed
to be in UB anymore.. ”
- KII Policymaker

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
Respondents Bayankhongor (LGAs, practitioners, and rights holders) and UNICEF staff raised the related theme
of air pollution, both indoor and outdoor. One rights holder noted:
“UNICEF must do more to inform and educate people and children on the means and
benefits of better indoor air quality”
– FGD Teachers, Bayankhongor
UNICEF however is working to improve the conditions for these populations in UB, though apparently, many
are unaware of their recent efforts. These issues have been recognised by UNICEF: UNICEF and partners have
worked with AFCYD and others to streamline registration processes to facilitate access to health and education
services for unregistered internal migrant families. UNICEF also worked with Mobicom and WV to build a
kindergarten to service these communities where there are currently none and investigated and upgraded the
conditions of 24-hour kindergartens in UB districts86.
Gender also emerged as an important issue that seems to be given less attention. Gender differences in
educational achievement, starting at the lower secondary school level, is documented according to national
statistics87 as a reversed gender gap. - There maybe evidence that an education system that ‘favours’ girls,
without a holistic analysis of the gender norms driving poor education outcomes for boys. This issue was not
seen as critical however among national and sub-national respondents.
Opportunities and challenges
UNICEF recognises many of the needs raised by the LGAs, teachers and social workers, and works actively to be
responsive to issues as they become apparent. While not all critical issues facing deprived children and their
families can be tackled, UNICEF recognises the issues raised by respondents, and in most cases is investing in
both upstream policy and subnational interventions to address them. In UB, for example UNICEF collaborates
with the local government to reduce air pollution by installing inexpensive heating and cooking options. The
increased focus on indoor and outdoor air pollution within UNICEF is a welcome concentration within the
current CP as it resonates with both duty bearers and rights holders.
Geographical and even thematic targeting was not always considered appropriate by respondents within
UNICEF and among national and local stakeholders. Respondent questioned whether targeting was a relevant
approach across UNICEF programming when making universal access to services (through upstream policy
changes) may be a more effective strategy to reaching deprived children in certain contexts. For example,
by addressing residency registration universally through changes in laws or policies, all unregistered families
would have increased access to public services where they are staying.
Conversely, a few respondents within UNICEF and development partners stressed that there are sub-populations
of children and adolescents that do require explicit attention and targeting to meet their diverse needs. Citing
the GoM’s human rights commitments, UNICEF advocated for the government to increase its commitment
to support ethnic minorities (such as Kazakh and Tsaatan peoples)88, especially in relation to respecting local
languages and making textbooks and survey questionnaires (e.g. SISS 2018) available to them89. While these
efforts by UNICEF were recognised, the development partners felt that UNICEF could be more purposeful and
proactive within the CP to bring more explicit solutions to meeting the needs of ethnic minorities.
Finally, a clear challenge to thematic targeting is the funding gap. For example, one UNICEF report mentioned
that “only a small portion of the (air pollution) programme has been funded and there are major challenges with
finding and scaling up cleaner, affordable and sustainable solutions for heating in the Ger districts….it is clear
that more investments are needed to reduce children’s exposure to air pollution, and provide affordableand

good quality health care to affected children”90. It is estimated that in UB in 2016, air pollution related illness
in children (0-18) cost the GoM USD 4.8 million in public health services, and this figure is expected to reach
USD 9.8 million by 202591.
Limited resources for combatting the effects of air pollution however are not only an issue within UNICEF.
It is recognised that urgent measures are needed by the GoM to make funding available, particularly during
the winter season through emergency declarations (to free up governor’s reserve funds), and longer term,
to strengthening health sector budgeting by harmonising fund disbursements methodologies across sector
funds92. The current CP includes air pollution interventions with limited resources, and interventions to
streamline local budgeting for children. For UNICEF to invest further, the GoM will need to take urgent steps to
demonstrate willingness and accountability for the issue. To sustain new interventions however, UNICEF must
work with the GoM to create the mechanisms and necessary resources to tackle national problems.
5.3 To what extent has UNICEF GTA contributed to CP results, learning and sustainability,
and reduced inequalities for children? (EQ3)
EFFECTIVENESS
Summary:
UNICEF’s activities are based on best practices identified from the previous CP and are designed to
showcase how policies, guidelines, and administrative mechanisms can meet the needs of vulnerable
children and their families.
UNICEF successfully advocated for legal and policy changes to protect the most vulnerable children
by creating the evidence base for new legislation through feasibility surveys and studies (e.g. a costing
study) for the implementation of laws and regulations related to child protection, combatting domestic
violence, and financial incentives for services for CWDs. UNICEF provided technical expertise in
developing new policy guidance and evidence-based information materials for interventions targeting
children most at risk.
Several pilot projects were identified as showing promise in influencing policy in aimags and at national
level such as CFC, which has been taken up by six other non-GFA aimags with full funding of AFCYD.
However, not all promising pilot projects, particularly related to air pollution mitigation, were scaled up
due to budget constraints of the government.
UNICEF raised awareness of child rights by embedding them within their CFC, and child budgeting
advocacy approaches. Recognition of child rights was most prominent at sub-national level where GFA
governor’s created space for the participation of children in priority setting and budget allocation around
their own issues.
Capacity building has been provided for a wide range of policymakers and sector specialists including
training and awareness raising on child-friendly budgeting for GFA Governor Office divisions’
representatives. The involvement of high-level officials in training was reported to have made a noticeable
difference in support for increased child-focused budgeting, but there were mixed reports as to whether
the heightened awareness and stated interest by local authorities to increase budget allocations for
children ultimately materialised in practice in any significant degree. Perceptions of budget increases in
spending on children however in the GFAs was widely credited to UNICEF’s efforts nonetheless.

5.3.1 Application of the GTA within National Policy Advocacy
A UNICEF GTA approach to national policy advocacy, alongside those of government agencies including
the MLSP, MES, MoF, MoH and AFCYD, have yielded tangible results across UNICEF’s thematic intervention
areas. UNICEF GTA brings the child rights lens and intersectoral approach to policy and intervention package
development and implementation. For example, during CP 2012-2016, UNICEF strategically contributed to
building the evidence base through their support for an implementation cost analysis to help secure approval
for the Law on Combating Domestic Violence demonstrating UNCEF’s added value to the advocacy effort.
Likewise, UNICEF’s multi-sectoral and holistic approach was evident in their focus on the enabling environment
around breastfeeding in the Law on Fortified Food for the Infant and Young Child (2016). The law banned
all types of aggressive advertising and promotion of breast milk substitutes to the general public, caregivers
and healthcare professionals, and banned industrially produced complementary foods for children under six
months93.
UNICEF’s support for intersectoral action was also included in the new Child Protection and Education Law,
which saw the GoM reaffirm its commitment to measuring and tracking child poverty, child-friendly social
protection, the first 1,000 days of life and ECD. Further, during this period, Parliament also amended the
Education Law of 2014 with provisions for inclusive education including new financial incentives and financing
to schools and teachers dealing with CWDs.
UNICEF’s contributes to national advocacy campaigns by commissioning evidence synthesis and convening
workshops to share new knowledge as a means to focus new legislation and policy action on disadvantaged
children. During the period, UNICEF supported the Fifth NNS, and a Developmental Assets Profile Survey
on Adolescents in partnership with National Authority for Children (NAC). UNICEF also provided technical
assistance in development of a draft National Plan of Action for Promoting Adolescent Mental Health that
incorporates multi-disciplinary and sectoral intervention strategies.
The UNICEF Mongolia-led Consultation on Sanitation in Cold Climate, which brought together the Government
and private sector, resulted in the approval of a National Programme on Reduction of Air and Environmental
Pollution (2017-2021). This included soil pollution caused by poor sanitation conditions in peri-urban areas94.
UNICEF also promoted child targeted policy action at sub-national level within their GFAs through their CFC
initiative. In Khuvsgul, the CFC strategy was full adopted at aimag and soum level making the CFC model a best
practice for Mongolia (see section 5.4.1 and 5.6.1 for further details).
Further examples of UNICEF’s contribution to legislative, policy, planning, and implementation are shown in
Table 2 below.

In CP 2017-2021, UNICEF made further contributions of bring the GTA perspective to legal, policy and regulatory
frameworks for the benefit of children. Key legislative and policy successes during the period include UNICEF
contributions to add a focus on the most disadvantaged children including CWDs in the Education Sector
Master Plan. This resulted, for example with the inclusion of health education as a stand-alone topic (based on
recognition of the need for all children, particularly the most disadvantaged to have more knowledge and skills
around critical health issues such as how to protect themselves from risk of accidents, or eat healthily)95. The
GTA was also successful in managing interventions for children with multiple deprivations: UNICEF supported
the development of a national protocol96 on the management of SAM with a large budget allocation for
micronutrient supplementation programme for dzud-affected herder households, as well as social protection
cash transfer measures for these children to better protect them from dzud.
UNICEF effectively translated their GTA strategies into sustainable multidisciplinary government platforms
in favour of children. As mentioned previously, UNICEF supported the establishment of a permanent multi-
stakeholder working group, led by the Deputy Minister for MLSP focused on child-friendly budgeting and
fund allocation for children. UNICEF also provided technical and financial support for MLSP to establish the
National Programme on Child Protection and Development for 2017-2020 (for total of 22 procedures and 2
standards), including the Procedure for providing legal assistance to children affected by domestic violence
and the Procedure for temporary protection of abused children97 - all key steps for the implementation of the
landmark legislation on child protection mentioned above98.

support for needs assessments on indoor air quality in kindergartens99 and family health centres, Education

Management Information Systems (EMIS) in schools, and mapping of children not attending school as part
of the new child protection law measures. Further UNICEF contributed creating access to disadvantaged ger
children through a demonstration project that resulted in the creation of a new standard for family health
centres (approved by the National Standard Office), which mandated that they include an immunization unit
as a compulsory structural element to provide better access for peri-urban and unregistered children100. These
improvements were appreciated by district LGAs and development partners as fundamental to improving child
rights for all children in the more deprived areas in the outskirts of UB.

4.3.2 Convention on the Rights of the Child
UNICEF has enshrined CRC principles in its GTA rationale and intervention strategies across thematic areas
of intervention, dialogue, and partnership. UNICEF, through its advocacy and programme interventions,
raised awareness of the principles of the Rights of the Child and helped to establish CRC principles in national
law, such as in the law on child protection and guidelines for services for CWDs mentioned previously. Another
example of the rights enshrined in law, policy and regulation is the MES’s 2019 review of implementation of
new curriculum for primary and secondary education. Within the review process, UNICEF played a central
role, which reportedly led to the CRC being strongly reflected in the new curriculum101. For example, education
ministry respondents noted CRC has become the foundational concept of the new curriculum.
Despite respondents’ appreciation of the CRC foundation of UNICEF’s targeting approach, key interviewees
from UNICEF and other development partners had mixed opinion on whether national authorities and partners
fully recognise the principles of the Rights of the Child. Most respondents from policy makers and LGAs and
practitioners spoke to how crucial the principles of the CRC are, but noted that many are either selectively
applied or aspirational at best. In addition, some respondents noted the application of principles also varied
by administrative level, with national level policies clearly reflecting principles, but less so at the aimag level.
The right to non-discrimination faced by ethnic minorities in particular was mentioned multiple times by
UNICEF staff, and international development partners, as well as in the recommendations of the CRC itself, as
an area that needed greater attention within UNICEF’s CP. As noted previously, UNICEF was very responsive
to specific discriminatory issues measured against ethnic minorities such as the inflexibility by NSO to provide
census survey documents in local languages.
“…translation of survey materials into local languages were not supported by government
initially, and were only implemented in the end with UNICEF insistence and support…”
- KII, UNICEF
“…efforts to translate materials into local languages for ethnic minorities have been
prioritized by UNICEF...”
- KII, Policymakers
The current CP however has only a minor focus on these groups. Furthermore, regional and gender disparities
in the education system negatively impact girls and boys, especially for children living in rural areas, nomadic
children, and children belonging to Indigenous communities 102. More proactive and purposeful engagement
with the specific needs and discriminatory barriers faced by rural and ethnic minority children were considered
important to be given more attention in the next CP.
Conflating the role of UNICEF with that of the government, some respondents suggested that the principle

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
of the best interest of the child in all actions was not consistently implemented103, noting in particular the
challenges faced by many herder children, such as precarious living situations, and a lack of water sanitation
facilities.
District level respondents generally could not list specific CRC principles but nonetheless felt local policies
upheld or aligned with the CRC. Specific interventions to uphold CRC principles mentioned were health priorities
(e.g. water sanitation, access to a healthy environment, etc.); a safe environment (e.g. ensuring an adequate
environment to study/learn); participation (e.g. via a specific day to listen to children, “Researcher Children,”
and the “Mini parliament” and a nationwide youth police programme for children to gain knowledge about
the law. In the GFA districts, sector practitioners (e.g. teachers and social workers) said they were familiar with
the CRC principles and that they were kept in mind when planning activities although no specific examples
were offered on how that influenced their programme interventions.
Teachers, social workers and parents reported that community and children’s understanding about CRC had
increased through UNICEF efforts, however there is reportedly still much to do on the ground to realise CRC
principles. It was observed that level of children’s knowledge about the CRC was directly associated with
UNICEF supported CRC-related posters on the walls at schools. For example, children of Zavkhan were very
knowledgeable about the CRC as their schools had many posters related to CRCs whereas it was not the case
in other GFAs.
Recognition of CRC in the non-GFA Uvurkhangai aimag included in this evaluation was largely equivalent to
the GFA aimags and districts, because training was provided on the CFC approach by AFCYD that included CRC
principles (see section 4.4 for a more comparative information on non-GFA engagement and outcomes.
UNICEF ‘s advocacy for child rights through the GTA is credited for the strides the GoM has made towards
increasing its realisation of child rights through its laws, policy and practices, however more is needed beyond
what UNICEF can directly support. For example, the 2017 Recommendations of the UN Committee on the
Rights of the Child104 to the GoM highlighted the need to ensure effective implementation of Child Rights laws
by allocating the necessary human, technical and financial resources. The Committee also recommended that
necessary measures be undertaken to address the issues of adequate budget allocation, promotion of child
rights in the business sector, non-discrimination, family environment, environment and health, child jockeys
and child labour105. CRC recommendations and UNICEF’s responses106 are shared in Annex 2F.
5.3.3 Capacity building
UNICEF supported the implementation of the legal, policy and programmatic achievements through its
efforts to build local capacity to implement child rights provisions to enact change for disadvantaged
children. Application of the GTA necessitates building national and local level partners and stakeholder
awareness of CRC principles, and capacities to implement multi-sectoral interventions to meet the needs of
the child as a whole.
UNICEF supported capacity building of its IPs at national and sub-national level through training, strategic advice,
joint evidence generation activities such as monitoring, evaluation and research, consultations and dialogue,
and advocacy with key national stakeholders107. UNICEF provided training to all national and sub-national
partners on the GTA strategy, intervention packages and the supporting standards and guidelines. Evidence
of the effectiveness of UNICEF’s capacity building (and advocacy) was the integration and mainstreaming of
ECD strategies into health, nutrition, WASH, and child protection within the National Programme on Child
Development and Protection with its accompanying standards and guidelines (see section 4.3.1).
UNICEF GTA focused training was reported by local policymakers as having increased their skills to better target

interventions to reach vulnerable children and their families. Respondents from government ministries and
Governors’ offices in all GFA aimags stated that there was strong evidence that policymakers at ministerial and
aimag levels have a good knowledge of UNICEF’s the CFC intervention strategy, intentions and goals, and the
importance of child-friendly budgeting allocations to support CFC implementation locally.
GFA respondents credited the training with helping them to both understand and implement the CFC approach.
- “…. Many of our local businessmen attended child-friendly business training conducted
by UNICEF, and also our local governors attended child-friendly planning and budgeting
trainings.. now everyone strives to make everything child-friendly… as if though they have
this child-friendly lens to see everything.... each community.. each organization tries to
make a safe and friendly environment for children.”
- KII, Bayankhongor
UNICEF also provided technical assistance to the health sector through a large package of trainings in both GFA
and non-GFA aimags during both the 2012-2016 and 2017-2021 CPs, such as in child psychology, methodological
training on socialization and development of CWDs in the community and infant health nutrition education to
target the vulnerable children. A result of this comprehensive GTA capacity building strategy, the National
Centre for Public Health conducted in 2017 the country’s most comprehensive nutritional assessment108.
“The UNICEF activities influenced our mind substantially. Before, I didn’t even know what
I was doing. We even didn’t understand meaning of child with disabilities or what does it
mean child protection. The UNICEF projects are considered by us are very effective”.
- KII, Govi-Altai
Training was provided to pertinent organizations on UN standards for responding to violence against children
and dealing with minor witnesses and victims .. Collectively, UNICEF’ GTA focused training in the context of the
CFC and support for intersectoral collaboration created over 600 MDTs nationwide, responsible for providing
primary care to at-risk children and child victims of domestic violence. Private sector engagement in UNICEF
child protection activities is also increasing through awareness raising and training109.
Capacity building as a route to improved government targeting of interventions towards
vulnerable children and families
Special training on child-friendly budgeting and planning, and pertinent existing legal framework were provided
to the majority of Governor Office divisions’ representatives in GFAs, including a broad array of local actors and
representatives from all sectors including both duty bearers and rights holder (e.g. families and children)110.
The zero-based budgeting methodology was piloted in 19 soums of four GFAs and six non-GFAs111. In 2018, the
Budget law was amended112 and ‘fixed recurrent costs’ (utilization cost) of aimag, soum hospitals, kindergartens,
schools shifted to the local governments, as owners, giving them incentives as well as responsibilities. According
to Ministry respondents, the intersection of capacities built and changes in the budget law resulted in local
government’s child-friendly budgeting and processing being more disciplined and appropriate to advance GTA
aims of institutionalisation of the CRC and CFC intervention packages.
Although UNICEF used capacity building to disseminate strategic approaches and interventions to plan,
programme and budget to improve the situation for disadvantaged children in the various thematic areas, it was
not clear from respondent remarks, nor from the results achieved to what degree can UNICEF wholly attribute
the programme successes to the comprehensive (and costly) training of such a wide array of stakeholders
observed in both CPs. Results of the Case Study on local planning and budgeting show, for example, that

while the capacity building efforts on child-friendly budgeting were comprehensive, more strategic targeting of
training for those in a position to influence child-friendly budgeting could have been more effective, and cost
efficient. Training for pro-child LDF budgeting did not appear to target key factors such as the bagh/khoroo
Governors, the LDF committees (charged with prioritising proposals) or the local CRHs, nor provide them any
practical guidance tools to inform their decision-making (see Case Study on Local Planning, Budgeting and
Financing for Vulnerable Children in Annex 3).
Nevertheless, including LGA’s high-level officials in training sessions were reported to have made a noticeable
difference in their public communication, support for increased budgeting from the LDF, Governor Reserves
Funds and capital investments from the state budget on ECD, primary, secondary schools and dormitory
facilities113.
In relation to these outcomes, UNICEF contributed to providing technical assistance to local governments in
fostering means for children to express their opinions on specific issues related to them, including in local
development planning, budgeting and monitoring of local governments’ performance on establishing CFCs.
This resulted in an increase in the LDF of 14% to 33% over the 2017 levels114.
Other noticeable changes have become rooted in GFAs were pro-child mind-set and attitude among
communities, organizations and businesses as they reportedly have claimed that people have started to looking
at things whether safety and friendliness in neighbourhoods are in place, like making sure no manholes on
streets and more lights among ger districts etc.
Further evidence of capacities built is described in section 5.6 related to Sustainability.
5.3.4 Local planning, budgeting and financing for vulnerable children
UNICEF’s GTA strategy sought to influence social sector budgeting and LDF allocation for children through,
capacity building and technical support at national and sub-national levels. In broad terms, there is evidence
that targeting resources for children is increasing, with reported increases in pro-child spending from
central and local budgets. MLSP has increased spending on child protection at central level and through SPTs
to aimags (see Figure 7).
Figure 8. Expenditure for child protection, by central and local budget, by thous.MNT
This appears to be due in large part to UNICEF advocacy for a large increase in the ‘outreach’ component of the
transfers, which rose 23 times, from MNT 356 million in 2016 to MNT 8 billion in 2020.

114 UNICEF Annual Report 2018

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
Respondents shared a high appreciation for UNICEF’s efforts and credited UNICEF for increased financing for
children however, a closer look at UNICEF strategies indicates some opportunities may have been missed115.
Social sector budgeting
A review of the UNICEF Strategy Note 2017-21 and its outcome ToC suggests that there may be an inadequate
appreciation of the limited role and powers of local governments in the budgeting of public expenditure for
children. Currently, the financing of many child-critical services has been decentralized to local budgets, but not
all. For example, household and individual cash transfers such as the CMP (key to activities under Output 3.1
in the Results Framework). All capital spending on facilities such as schools and regulatory authority for many
child-related services remain on the central State budget and under central government authority. Moreover,
even those social sector spending functions, which are decentralised to local governments are done so via
‘delegated’ arrangements, through tightly earmarked budget norms, which greatly reduces local level flexibility
in targeting budgets for vulnerable children.
By contrast, the actual plans and activities adopted by UNICEF, and views expressed by staff, reflected a much
more realistic approach to addressing these sorts of constraints at central as well as local level. UNICEF has
engaged with social sector budgeting processes through a combination of upstream and downstream strategies:
● Upstream advisory and advocacy activities with sector ministries concerning policy, guidelines
and recurrent budget norms: According to respondents, an initial work plan was prepared for
upstream advisory and advocacy activities with quite ambitious targets for revising national norms,
but this was then scaled back116. Nonetheless, some successes were registered, including increased
child protection transfers noted above117, a move away from the use of PMT-methodology toward
universal allocation of the CMP transfers, adoption of consolidated national WASH guidelines, and
revision to the kindergarten education transfer budget norms allowing counting of non-resident
children.
● Local training both in awareness and application of central planning and budget procedures
and norms, as well as more generally on child-friendly budgeting: Local respondents generally
expressed satisfaction with this, although documentation attributing improvements in pro-child
budgeting processes or outcomes by government was inconclusive.
There was, however, no reported engagement by UNICEF staff with stakeholders responsible for the sector
performance contract mechanism118 in these sectors (by which local authorities commit to service delivery
targets in exchange for their special transfer allocations), nor with sector capital budgeting processes (by which,
e.g. kindergarten and school building decisions, key to child access to schooling or to major WASH systems, are
made).
Elected CRHs play a key statutory role in the review and approval of Governors’ budget proposals, and in the
monitoring of spending on service delivery by the executive branch119. While central budget norms allow little
scope for local changes to the original social sector budgets, the CRHs must approve annual budget revisions
and oversee the management of social facilities and budget execution by the executive120. It is unclear to what
degree UNICEF engaged with CRHs beyond training some members in child-friendly budgeting, and possibly
conducting advocacy.
Local Development Funds
The one major area where local authorities have some role to play in allocating financial resources to child
issues is through the LDF, which allows local small-medium investments in community proposals across sectors
(which may include WASH, kindergartens, playgrounds, etc.). However here too there are still some constraints
115 See Supplemental Annex: Case Study on Local Planning, Budgeting and Financing for Vulnerable Children
116 UNICEF Social Policy Work plan 2018-20, KII UNICEF
117 MLSP budget data
118 However, equity of ECE investments has been raised in other reviews e.g. World Bank 2017

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
on local flexibility, which can frustrate the desired focus on investment spending on children’s priorities.
While the criteria for selecting project proposals for LDF funding are laid down in the IBL and in the 2018 LDF
regulation, it is not always clear whether “soft” investments (e.g. capacity building or training activities) qualify
for funding or not, since these are often recorded as recurrent rather than investment budget spending, and
hence their eligibility is thought to be unclear. Secondly, it is not always clear to local authorities how they
are supposed to reconcile the ‘citizen vote’ criterion with the other criteria also referred to in the IBL and LDF
Regulation, such as adherence to local policy. By default, it is therefore often the citizen vote factor alone which
determines prioritization - and this may not necessarily favour pro-child spending proposals.
UNICEF’s strategy was primarily focused at the local level on advocacy and training of a range of local officials
around allocating LDF budgets for pro-child priorities, and securing commitments from aimag governors to
allocate > 10% LDF budgets for these specifically121. These efforts were coupled with strong implicit LDF-
reallocation incentives in UNICEF’s co-funding of annual CFC work plans122. Respondents generally reported
positive outcomes from this support and that this had led to greater pro-child spending from the LDF.
There is little evidence of more targeted engagement with the key steps and decision-makers in the annual LDF
project prioritisation and approval cycle: e.g. bagh/khoroo Governors (who organize the initial prioritization),
the soum/aimag governors’ LDF committees (where project proposals are formally screened and prioritized
for submission to the CRH), and then the CRHs themselves, which finalise LDF budgets. There is no reported
advocacy with MoF about national LDF regulations and guidelines governing project prioritization criteria and
LDF spending rules.
Some LDF budget data sources suggest that considerable shares of LDF investments do routinely, directly or
indirectly, benefit children. It remains unclear, however, whether UNICEF’s engagement directly contributed to
these improved levels and better targeted LDF spending for children.
In principle, LGAs are able to adopt CFC strategies and principles with heightened commitment, multi-sectoral
planning, coordination and partnership, and a whole child approach to the funding they have available.
However, implicit in the CFC strategy is the call for substantial local co-financing, which many respondents
noted did not fully recognise the highly centralised budget system noted above, and that aimags and soums
generally have very few budget resources to allocate flexibly, other than the LDF and, to a much lesser extent,
own-revenues and savings in the Governor’s reserve fund123. CFC work plans and budgets also include many
activities which are recurrent spending items not eligible for LDF funding. These would therefore need to be
funded from either SPTs (if budget norms allow for that), or from modest governors’ reserve funds where they
exist 124, but no complete data were available for the extent of actual co-funding by LGAs of recurrent CFC
recurrent expenses from such sources.
The LDF, as the only significant investment budget resource under local discretion was key to the local co-
funding of WASH and other capital investments in the joint multi-annual aimag CFC work plans and budgets, co-
signed by UNICEF and aimag authorities. These work plans however appear to be signed with aimag governors
only, but not by CRH chairs that have the final decision-making authority over allocation of the LDF125. It is
unclear what emphasis UNICEF gave to working with soum authorities on LDF budgeting even though until
2017, 70% of LDF allocations were to soums (while this share has been reduced, it is still significant and may
well be increased again).
LGA respondents from the GFAs did not address this point directly although there was a strong concurrence
that they felt they are able to do pro-child budgeting and, as noted above have indeed done so in some cases.
UNICEF’s GTA supports a CFC approach to meeting the intersectional needs of children sustained by local funding
eventually. As already underlined under Section 1.3, the main potential source of discretionary local co-funding
for such activities is the LDF, since other funding sources such as the SPTs are already tightly earmarked through

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
ministry budget norms (local own-revenues are generally meagre, and their use subject to MoF regulation and
approvals, except in the very few “budget surplus” aimags and soums). However, preliminary review suggests
the levels of co-funding implicit in the CFC implementation model are higher than could be sustained from
present local LDF budgets alone, sometimes requiring a doubling of LDF allocations, and/or a very substantial
reallocation of LDF funds away from other local priorities, which may not be realistic126.
However, some cases were recorded of both private sector and NGO co-funding of activities in CFC work plans:
e.g. Mobicom co-funding of a child help hot line in Govi-Altai, and WV co-funding school WASH facilities in
Khuvsgul127. There are also reports of local staff and community members putting in time and resources to co-
fund some projects – e.g. school staff funding school toilets.
Lastly, there appears to have been little coordination with other projects also building local LDF planning
capacities: e.g. the Sustainable Livelihood Project-III, the CRH Project, and the Urban Governance Project.
National budget policy alignment to GTA priorities
UNICEF’s GTA advocacy activities on national level policy were reported by respondents to have been effective
in terms of planning and budgeting in some cases e.g. increases to child protection transfers, revision of budget
norms dictating kindergarten funding allowing coverage of non-resident children, and WASH guidelines.
The Government showed increased commitment to strengthening the child protection system in Mongolia
in 2017, following UNICEF Mongolia’s continued strategic advocacy and systematic technical support128. This
commitment is evidenced in the major steps it took, including approving the National Programme on Child
Development and Protection as well as a series of standards and guidelines for child protection services,
allocating USD 2 million from the state budget for child protection services, and capacity building for
professionals across sectors at various levels.
Other important national budget policy changes were also made affecting children, but it is not clear whether
UNICEF played a direct any advocacy or advisory role. An example of this is the change in in Budget Law in 2018
(reflected in revision to the IBL) whereby all ‘fixed recurrent costs’ (utilization cost) of school, kindergarten and
hospital facilities (heating, light, water, maintenance, etc.) were covered by SPTs, but on local revenue budgets
– possibly posing funding and equity challenges to local authorities.
UNICEF did engage with ministries in relation to more practical issues of policy implementation and central
guidance clearly emerging from field operations. For example, there is reported widespread local lack of clarity
and even misunderstanding about LDF eligibility rules and local budget revision powers, which in cases UNICEF
staff themselves helped address in ‘hands-on’ manner with ministries concerned. UNICEF also played a critical
role in informing local aimag and soum managers and in some cases, CRH members and parents locally on the
new guidelines around LDF investments. It is unclear whether UNICEF also advocated for clearer guidance from
central government itself to local officials on such key issues.
5.3.5 Data
Building and using evidence to better meet the needs of disadvantaged children
UNICEF contributed to building the evidence base to facilitate implementation of the GTA towards disadvantaged
children and their families. UNICEF Mongolia continued to provide technical assistance to the Government for
the Fifth NNS in 2017, and the SISS in 2018. Key features of the Fifth NNS included regional data on relevant
nutrition indicators that quantified the prevalence of nutrition conditions that were of greatest concern to the
population, particularly those of young children and pregnant women. As for the SISS, provincial and district
level disaggregation of data estimates was made available for the GFAs of the current and previous CPs, plus
Bayan-Ulgii and Umnugovi aimags which was not possible in previous surveys.

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
Other examples of significant data exercises to support targeting of disadvantaged children included:
- a stakeholder mapping and methodology to generate evidence for higher-level advocacy on urban
immunization were completed by a joint team consisting of academia, Government, NGOs and the
National Centre for Communicable Diseases (with support from the East Asian Pacific Regional Office
of UNICEF (EAPRO);
- A UNICEF Mongolia’s study, ‘Mining-related in-migration and the impacts on children in Mongolia’
that created a solid foundation for stakeholder discussions and policy dialogue with the mining sector
on children’s rights129;
- a legal review of business practices related to children and family development with the aim to provide
evidence for opportunities and gaps in developing child- and family-friendly business in Mongolia130.
- A country case study on UNICEF Mongolia’s Assessment on Gender-Responsive Adolescent Health (on
behalf of EAPRO) that contributed to programme design in adolescent mental health and adolescent
life skills programme in Mongolia).
- Rapid social impact assessment on social and protection services for children and families during
school closure due to prevention from COVID-19
- Mining-related in-migration and the impact on children in Mongolia131
National level stakeholders and partners in aimag centres were aware of UNICEF’s contribution to research and
evidence generation, particularly the SISS, and NNS. Line Ministries appreciated the SISS and used it widely for
planning and advocacy for children’s health, education and child protection issues. The SISS was conducted in
2013 and in 2018: the results were analysed (e.g. MODA) to inform UNICEF’s GTA for the previous and current
GFAs. While the MICS provided data at regional level, the MODA analysis was able to model aimag level results
facilitating GFAs to plan, budget and compare the trends on critical issues between 2013 and 2018. At soum
level, officials and specialists were not aware of the SISS nor the MODA and were not regularly using survey
data in their planning and budgeting.
Some GFAs were motivated to collect and use data for better programming for children. With the support
of UNICEF, Bayanzurkh district set up a district health sector database of all children at risk. Information is
aggregated across 12 indicators for local health officials to better target programmes and activities. Updating
of the database is performed in collaboration with the local health and social welfare departments, as well as
the MDTs. It contains information on children disaggregated by stunting, weight loss, etc. UNICEF trained local
family hospital staff to track the development of young children in all health indicators and provided them with
scales for the anthropometric measurement of all children. Following the training, local health workers now
prepare monthly reports on children’s health status and have the possibility to follow up as needed.
Use of data to improve programming
There is evidence that UNICEF’s GTA strategies produced monitoring data that was used efficiently to adjust and
improve their activities to better target vulnerable children and their families. For example, ECD enrolment has
always been notoriously high at over 90% in the GFAs, however, it was observed by UNICEF colleagues during
a monitoring mission that many children were at home, especially within herder families. It was uncovered
that the local education department was including children that attended only one month per year into the
kindergarten enrolment rate - a situation that was corrected, with those children subsequently targeted for
inclusion.
Indeed, respondents noted that transparency and accessibility of the PMT database was challenging in some
places, and even more so if the local Governor and local social welfare office representatives are from different
parties. In particular, it was a challenge in one district for the GO and CRH to get data on vulnerable children
from the local Labour and Social Welfare Services department that holds the database of families who receive
food stamps, because their management is vertical and under MLSP. Lack of access to local databases of

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
vulnerable families limits the UNICEF and partners’ capacity to extend and target services to meet immediate
needs, particularly during the pandemic.
UNICEF also supported Departments of FCYD and Health to use local administrative data to ensure the needs
of the most at-risk children were being addressed. During household visits by the MDTs it was clear that CWDs
were spending an inordinate amount of time at health clinics for their diagnosis to be discussed and approved
by the doctor (risking their non-attendance or follow up). To mitigate this risk the MDTs initiated a service with
the slogan: “To serve [CWDs] by coming at your door, not by having you wait at the door of the state services”.
MDTs then began visiting the families and herders furthest away to conduct risk assessments and provide
integrated services like health and psychological counselling. Such initiatives are evidence of UNICEF’s training
and support for MDTs to focus on attending to the whole child – a strategy that has been adopted by the GFA
aimag and soum administration and departments.
Opportunities and challenges
Respondents noted that although most data are disaggregated by key socio-economic characteristics, sectoral
data between ministries, departments and agencies differed, sometimes significantly. This was particularly the
case for the numbers of CWDs and vulnerable children. Another challenge in identifying vulnerable children
and families was concern around lack of confidentiality; due to small population settlements where everyone
quickly finds out who is vulnerable, with the associated stigmatisation. Analysis and targeting disadvantaged
children in the GFAs remain a challenge for the success of the GTA.
5.4 To what extent has UNICEF’s CFC approach to implementing the GTA helped to create
an integrated, holistic, multi-sectoral safety net in the GFAs? (EQ4)
EFFECTIVENESS
Summary:
UNICEF successfully piloted the CFC in the previous CP (2012-2016), and effectively scaled up the
approach in the 4 aimags and 1 district of the current CP (2017-2021). In addition, the CFC has been
taken up by an additional 6 non-GFA aimags demonstrating that the pilot to scale approach.
Implementation of the CFC approach was found to be broadly positive among targeted aimags and
soums, with particular ‘success stories’ with the Bayanzurkh district and Zavkhan aimag. Among key
stakeholders, both local and central, and from policymaker and beneficiary perspectives, the CFC
approach was welcomed for its inclusiveness and effectiveness in delivering on key child-related health
and socio-economic outcomes, specifically for CWDs. Children’s participation was successfully integrated
at the community level.
At both central and local levels, improved political will and added sustainability in funding for child
protection services and case managers were reported, as a result of intersectoral collaboration of the
CFC approach. However, the continued successful implementation of the CFC approach appears to
depend upon the enthusiasm and commitment of specific individuals.
5.4.1 Functionality of the CFC approach
The GTA is successfully implemented, in large part, through the CFC strategy in the GFAs with further
potential to demonstrate replicability and scale up in non-GFA locations. During the previous CP (2012-
2016), UNICEF demonstrated the value of the CFC approach in Khuvsgul. CFC was subsequently taken up in
the new GFAs under the next CP (2017-2021) successfully. All respondents appreciated the CFC approach
and reported it functional in the UNICEF GFAs and beyond132. The concept of CFC is well known to those
132 Country Office Annual Report 2018
56 | Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
interviewed, all of which could list mechanisms and activities done under CFC. CFC has also been adopted by
six other aimags, a demonstration of its potential for scale-up and sustainability (see section 4.6)133.
Sub-national governments in the GFAs have approved a CFC sub-programme (2017-2021) that is currently
being implemented134. The sub-programme has priority goals, objectives and activities directed towards the
holistic development of the child through intersectoral approaches. Progress of implementation of the CFC
approach is reported annually in the Implementation Progress Report from the GFA aimags. For example, in the
Bayanzurkh district, the sub-programme includes the following 3 key goals/priorities such as (1) providing equal
opportunities for all children; (2) improving health and development conditions of children; and (3) improving
collaboration of agencies to work towards children. Specific activities included under the sub-programme
were to provide learning conditions CWDs, establish ger kindergartens for enrolling children out of pre-school
education children in ger areas, and improving conditions for all kindergartens through renewing heating and
air quality of old buildings of kindergartens in the district135.
CFC provides opportunities for intersectoral collaboration. To implement the CFC, aimag and district
government authorities established CFC Coordination Committees comprised of representatives of all related
line departments and agencies such as education, health, child protection, and police to promote intersectoral
collaboration towards child development136. According to interview participants, the Coordination Committees
were effective: they met regularly to discuss the progress on implementation of CFC sub-programme activities
with representatives of key line departments/agencies presenting on progress, challenges and next steps. This
helped to create a mechanism for collaboration, and information and knowledge sharing between agencies
working for children. For example, previously agencies in the GFAs rarely met to discuss children’s issues. Due
to their engagement in the Coordination Committees, key sector respondents from the aimags reported that
they are now well informed about each other’s work. They appreciated the meetings because they provided
an opportunity to learn from each other, and for the education, health and child protection agencies (at aimag
level) to organize activities jointly. All aimag and soum LGA respondents were generally positive that the
Coordination Committees had a positive impact at the community level.
Stakeholder appreciation and engagement in CFC
The representatives of the national government agencies also noted that the CFC is established at policy level.
Policymakers highlighted that the national government’s priority related to CFC is promoting child-friendly
budgeting and an enabling environment for all areas of child development. Accomplishments of UNICEF’s
advocacy related to CFC and child-friendly budgeting are seen in increased state budget allocations for
children’s issues and needs (as mentioned previously in section 5.3.4). For example, the state budget has
increased spending on central and local child protection services from MNT 356 million (2016) to MNT 8 billion
(2020). Another example is that as a result of CFC implementation, the mutual agreement of cooperation
between the MES and the aimag governors presents more activities directed towards implementation of CFC
in their localities.
LGA respondents reported that the CFC approach has also had a positive impact at the community level. Several
specific examples of the impact of CFC were provided, ranging from an increase in the number of qualified staffs
working on child health at the aimag level, decreased child mortality rates, increased health infrastructure, and
greater understanding/awareness of child issues, particularly CWDs. In addition, new kindergartens for CWDs
at the soum level, new infrastructure and learning rooms in schools for CWDs, new WASH facilities in schools
and kindergartens, and extensive capacity building training are examples of CFC implementation mentioned
by respondents.
UNICEF engaged local stakeholders effectively. In Zavkhan, respondents reported that the Governor had begun
a scheme to donate to savings accounts of all CWDs, build new child-focused facilities such as playgrounds,
institute a mechanism to “listen to children’s voices” around their concerns and priorities, and improve learning

conditions in kindergartens. National respondents commented that their work on air pollution with the local
governments was facilitated by increased budget allocation for these issues. Line staff/departments, aimag
and soum governors and CRH members all explicitly stated that they were engaged in CFC activities initiated by
UNICEF in their respective aimags.
“[The CFC approach] improved child-focused local governance through the use of the CFC
strategy as the main planning and monitoring tool for child rights at the local level, setting
accountability targets and responsibilities”
– KII, UNICEF
5.4.2 Intersectoral collaboration through the CFC approach
Within the UNICEF GFAs, the CFC is the programmatic strategy for implementation of the GTA. Activities are
expected to support the goals identified in the GTA through a CFC sub-programme of the aimag or district.
Through the CFC, intersectoral collaboration is established to meet the diverse needs of vulnerable children and
their families. For example, UNICEF promotes intersectoral collaboration operationally within kindergartens
through the Integrated Approach on Early Childhood Development (IAECD). The IAECD means that young
children should be supported in all areas of development, including health, education, nutrition, WASH and
protection to offset fragmentation of intervention efforts- a strategy embraced in Zavkhan (as noted previously
in section 5.1.2).
Another example of UNICEF’s efforts to support intersectoral collaboration is the establishment and strengthening
of MDTs to meet the diverse needs of vulnerable children. UNICEF supports capacity building training of
MDTs in all GFAs to strengthen their effectiveness, functionality and efficiency of collaboration and response.
Respondents from aimags reported that in recent years, child protection case management performed by the
MDTs has improved significantly, and as a result, their work is increasingly recognised and encouraged by local
authorities. For example, local authorities recognise the difficulty collective case management poses, as MDT
members must be ready to respond with urgency when a case is reported. In recognition of the difficulty of the
work of MDTs, case management fees are now officially allocated to the MDTs. UNICEF successfully advocated
to reflect child-friendly performance indicators in civil servants’ work performance, and also child-friendly
activities and plans were integrated in annual provincial socio-economic development main directives.
CFC principles evident in the work of LGAs
CFC principles are embedded in policies and documents of GFAs. For example, policy directives such as the
Governors’ Action Plan (2016-2020) and Aimag Economic and Social Development Plan include objectives to
support the implementation of CFC Sub-Programme137. Respondents also mentioned that as a result of the
CFC approach, more resolutions have been approved by aimag CRH on child related issues.
CFC principles necessitate that soums and aimags have Children’s Councils to ensure the opinions of children are
reflected in local debates and activities. To this end, all GFAs adopted the “Day to Listen to Children’s Voices”138.
On this day, the Children Council members meet with local administrators or school principals to present and
submit their requests. Many examples were cited by rights-holders (parents and children) respondents on
how children’s requests were responded to. For example, In Bayankhongor aimag, the Governor took action to
promptly address a request for less dogs on the street and more lights.
“…. Our Governor once said that if we keep hearing the children’s voices, then I get to
know all the problems I need to solve in our aimag.. so we were very encouraged and felt
heard…
- FGD Children, Zavkhan
Further, under the CFC, obligatory Parental Committees have been established to support aimag and soum level
activities aimed at the development of all children, including vulnerable children. The Parental Committees

raise funding and organize various competitions and parent-engagement activities to support the CFC.
Central to the CFC approach is the provision of support to all children, including the most vulnerable. A majority
of aimag and soum level respondents noted that working through intersectoral approaches fostered by the
CFC was a good approach to reach all vulnerable children. In one example, LGAs in Bayanzurkh district stated
that their CFC activities cover all vulnerable children at the district level, including those who from the more
disadvantaged ger areas.
Comparison between GFA and Non-GFA related to implementation of CFC
CFC achievements in implementing the 9 building blocks of the CFC in GFA and the Non-GFA aimag are
summarised in Table 4 below. A comprehensive overview of CFC implementation in GFA and the Non-GFA is
provided in Annex 2E.
Comparing the results of GFA aimags against a non-GFA aimag did not yield significant differences at aimag
level, except in terms of dissemination at soum level in the non-GFA. As mentioned previously, AFCYD supported
6 non-GFA aimags to implement the CFC approach, including the evaluation control aimag, Uvurkhangai. As a
result, no significant difference in knowledge or appreciation of the CFC initiative was found among local GO
representatives’, and other LGA members interviewed. This was only the case in the aimag centre, however.
A stark difference of knowledge and attitudes related to the CFC between GFA and non-GFA was observed at
soum level. In the GFA soums, local GO staff, communities and MDTs were knowledgeable about child-friendly
aimag and soum initiatives and had been involved in some way. However, in the non-GFA soum, the local GO
representatives were not aware of the CFC initiative despite being chosen by AFCYD to rollout “Child Friendly
Aimag” program. Child related activities in non-GFA soums, if implemented, were being done so superficially,
without consistency or sustainability. In the Uvurkhangai soum visited, there were almost no public activities
to increase children’s participation in community events and discussions as no facilitated platforms had been
created for dialogue on issues such as LDF allocations. At a local event observed, adults were passive and not
engaged in the public discussion, and the issue of child engagement was not raised.
5.4.3 Financing of CFC activities
CFC activities are mainly financed by UNICEF, but with LGA co-funding mainly from the LDF, lesser co-funding
from local revenues and the Local Governor’s Reserve Fund, and with occasional co-funding from NGOs like
WV, the private sector and local community members. In addition, local entities or Children Council members
raise small funds for gifts and warm clothing for vulnerable children. Many respondents noted that UNICEF
worked jointly with stakeholders and with the LDF budget process (see section 3.4 on sector budgeting and
LDF) to secure support for the CFC. UNICEF advocated for aimags and soums to allocate resources for CFC
activities, which following awareness-raising, was eventually achieved in many of the GFAs (see section 5 on
efficiency). In Bayanzurkh district for example, the budget for CFC activities is now allocated annually.
UNICEF has increased efforts to engage the private sector around implementation of the CFC. Examples of
private sector partnerships include those with Mobicom on 108 Child hotline and establishment of a centre
for CWDs in Govi-Altai with support of Wagner Asia LLC139. Moreover, a joint collaboration between Arig
Bank, Wagner Asia, the Bayanzurkh district of UB and UNICEF Mongolia helped more than 830 children
access kindergartens with good water and sanitation facilities140. Several respondents commented that social
corporate responsibility is increasing as a result of UNICEF efforts, as are partnerships in the NGO sector. One
example included a recent proposal to the Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia on mental health issues.
Opportunities and challenges
While the CFC approach is now appreciated, the introduction of the CFC in Khuvsgul at the start of the previous
CP (2012-2016) presented challenges. Local administrators had to be trained and made aware of the value of
the approach. Over time, Governors became convinced of the CFC approach and in particular, the Governor

in Khuvsgul became an ardent supporter both financially and through advocacy. Many credit his engagement
with the scale-up of the CFC to non-GFA aimags (see section 5.6).
The CFC brings challenges at aimag/soum level due to staff turnover and job satisfaction. The success of
the CFC depends on those at the aimag and district level: motivated people with a positive work attitude to
succeed and initiate new activities. Conversely, those that are not engaged in their job, are also not engaged in
making the CFC operational, as observed by a policymaker: “if people are not engaged fully in their job, success
is limited”.

5.5 To what extent has UNICEF’s GTA been timely and efficient? (EQ5)
EFFICIENCY
Summary:
UNICEF’s targeting and test interventions in the GFAs has proven more efficient than alternative (or past)
approaches to reaching the most vulnerable. The efficiency of working in a few locations to demonstrate
models of intersectoral programming as was done in Khuvsgul and Nalaikh districts in the previous CP,
was balanced in the next CP (2017-2021) against the need to demonstrate reach for equity and political
reasons in the decision to work in more GFAs. This expansion based on alternative priorities however
maintained an efficiency component in the selection of adjacent aimags for logistical and financial
concerns.
UNICEF ‘s support to aimags to implement the CFC is predicated on local funding for activities, and
eventually increased local budget allocations to sustain CFC engagement. Aimag governors were slow
to accept that UNICEF was not underwriting the cost of the implementation of the CFC, however over
time, aimag partners accepted this balance of contribution and even became advocates of the approach
beyond UNICEF GFAs demonstrating the catalytic power (and efficiency) of transfer of ownership to
local authorities for implementing integrated programmes for children.
UNICEF’s intersectoral intervention strategies did not always yield intersectoral collaboration. Siloed
ways of working within sectors – both in the government line ministries, and within UNICEF’s programme
components did not always facilitate broader collaboration on joint programme interventions.
UNICEF successfully partnered with NGOs and the private sector to support UNICEF-initiated intervention
strategies. UNICEF worked with partners to avoid duplication of efforts, though in some cases only
after some duplications had already taken place. More collaboration between UN agencies on UNDAF
outcomes through joint projects could increase UN organisational efficiency.
UNICEF plays a significant role in supporting the collection of national data related to children.
UNICEF has established a robust monitoring and evaluation mechanism that uses national survey and
subnational administrative data to measure UNICEF results. The 2012-2016 CP results framework
includes higher-level performance indicators that make it difficult to assess the effectiveness of targeting
of interventions towards the most disadvantaged children. The results framework for CP 2017-2021
included more granular performance indicators to measure the results of outputs, many of which were
targeted towards disadvantaged children and their families. An analysis of the results framework for the
current CP is included in Annex 2D.
5.5.1 Increased efficiency through GTA focused partnership
UNICEF’s GTA strategy to selecting sub-national areas (GFAs) to target and test its different activities has proven
more efficient than alternative (or past) approaches (non–targeting, other) to reaching the most vulnerable
(see section 3.1 on GTAs). In the previous CP (2012-2016), concentration in one GFA facilitated demonstration
of multisectoral, holistic programming for children. UNICEF GTA approach created synergies with sub-national
public and private sector partners and other implementing organisations and donors increasing the efficiency
of their programmatic efforts by increasing engagement, diversifying the technical responsibility, sharing
financial risk, and effectually creating greater local ownership and sustainability.
In CP 2012-2016, UNICEF had the opportunity to showcase intersectoral programming between WASH and
the education and health sectors. In the next CP (2017-2021) however, UNICEF expanded its geographic reach,
indicating that the efficiency gains of operating in one GFA were insufficient rationale to remain narrowly
focused. This view was supported by national policymakers who felt UNICEF should work in more aimags to
demonstrate their model intervention strategies more broadly as context and terrain require varied approaches
and adaptation of models to be relevant for scale-up. GTA selection of GFAs for their past two CPs facilitated

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
UNICEF to dedicate resources and focus strategic interventions with partners to reach children at particular
risk in the GFAs.
GTA Implementation Partnership
UNICEF has created a large partnership network with local organizations including LGAs and CRH to implement
its GTA strategies.
Collaboration with Governors and between sectors at local level was noted as a synergistic approach that
added value to implementation of UNICEF’s GTA strategy, but was time intensive. In Khuvsgul, for example,
initial entry into the aimag was delayed due to lack of resource availability at the outset. Respondents felt this
slowed initial collaboration, particularly with national government partners. In Bayankhongor aimag, UNICEF
co-financing and collaboration demonstrated how an aimag can advance implementation of the CFC approach.
The efficiency gains achieved where a result of increased collaboration to achieve common objectives. This was
possible, respondents reported, because the capacities of LGAs were built, which eventually paid off in terms
of local ownership and initiative to advance the agenda for children. For example, respondents noted that as
collaboration and trust grew within the aimag, local stakeholders under the leadership of the aimag governor
came to realise how few WASH facilities existed in schools and hospitals, and how they could influence their
own budget allocation. As a result of better understanding and planning, the provincial authorities were able
to increase spending by generating savings and moving funds to alternative budgets.
UNICEF developed private sector partnership, which improved resource availability and implementation
efficiency due to shared risk and investment. It also increased the likelihood of sustainability and scale up
of successful project interventions. For example, selection of Umnugovi as an additional GFA in the current
CP (2017-2021) facilitated the concentration of efforts to expand work on air pollution with the support of
the provincial LGA and the private sector (Oyu Tolgoi LLC). In the Bayanzurkh, Mobicom partnered for the
installation of WASH facilities in the ger areas where there is a large population of unregistered herder migrants
without access to public services.
Challenges and opportunities of partnerships
UNICEF partners effectively with other UN agencies when they are working on a topic that intersects
organisational mandates. For example, in health and social protection sectors, UNICEF partnered with UNFPA
in support of the Domestic Violence law, STI prevention, and adolescent life skills education (LSE) among other
issues. International partners include other UN organisations, such as UNFPA, and the IFIs (e.g. ADB, WB, as
well as international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) such as WV, among others. In Govi-Altai and
Zavkhan aimags, UNICEF is partnering with the Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and WV
to produce WASH facilities in kindergartens and schools. International partners affirmed the effectiveness of
these relationship as also demonstrated by the tenure of the partnerships (many have continued since CP
2012-2016), co-financing and joint initiatives (see section 4.6 on sustainability).
Respondents gave a positive assessment of efficiency (e.g. avoiding duplication, sharing materials and
coordination) reporting that partnering with UN organisations, government and others was becoming more
efficient and less duplicative. On LSE, for example, UNICEF works in schools and UNFPA in universities. It was
a concerted effort to support and implement the new curriculum nationwide through training of 19 national
master trainers and 90 sub-national trainers tasked with disseminating the curriculum throughout the
country141. Another respondent gave an example that local and coordinated funds are distributed to schools
efficiently, despite the multiple sources of support, for inclusive education for CWDs, focusing on logistics and
transportation.
Within the UN system however, some respondents felt that better inter-organisational collaboration and
synergy was needed within the UNDAF. Respondents noted that under UNICEF’s leadership as coordinator
of the UNDAF Outcome 2 (Quality and equitable and social services), interagency cooperation and efficiency
have improved. Nevertheless, there are currently 10 UN organisations working in this area, and they together
141 Country Office Annual Report 2018
Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming | 63
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
implement 25 projects through a multiplicity of approaches that are sometimes not fully aligned, or based on
ad hoc government requests, or agency-specific analysis. Each organisation is guided by its own strategies and
outcome measures, collectively missing the opportunity to achieve UN development assistance objectives in
Mongolia as One142.
“…from a national perspective… systems thinking is lacking”
- KII, International Organisations
There were also some challenges reported at aimag level where the LGA staff member in charge of social
issues policy is responsible for coordination. At subnational level, the departments of FCYD and Health are
directly managed by national ministry counterparts. Local Governors stated that there has been, on occasion,
a mismatch or lack of coordination between the local GO priorities, and AFYCD priorities at the national level.
This has complicated the execution of intervention strategies in the aimags and created confusion. Advocacy
by UNICEF and other partners on their individual priority issues added to the coordination gap at times. This
was addressed by having one representative from each government and relevant agency in the coordination
discussion to facilitate coordination.
In Zavkhan aimag, LGA respondents reported siloed partnerships, which did not facilitate broader collaboration
and intersectoral work. Annual work plans were signed between the aimag Governor and UNICEF but then
implemented by UNICEF sectoral colleagues who work with the relevant departments at subnational level.
During implementation, local line ministry partners of the intersectoral intervention package noted that as they
are not involved in all aspects of implementation they have been, at times, left out of strategic communication
on progress, though they understood that efficiency of implementation was improved by working directly with
the sectors.
Nevertheless, respondents generally appreciated UNICEF and partner efforts to avoid duplication of activities
through coordination and better representation of local partners when cooperating with the soums. Similarly,
it was important that citizen representatives and activists were brought into the dialogue with government
officials to ensure understanding and cooperation.
5.5.2 UNICEF’s efficiency in use human and financial resources
UNICEF maximised on their positive relationship with Governors to improve internal efficiency of GTA
implementation, though perhaps at the expense of local partners. UNICEF’s previous outposts (in Khuvsgul, for
example) were closed with the rationale that engaging with Governors locally by allocating staff in the aimags
could replace UNICEF staff in the field. Indeed, UNICEF had hired someone to work within the aimag structures
instead of having outposts. Efficiency was expected to result from the consequent lower fixed costs – while
quality was ensured by having a system that could still monitor results. For example, in Govi-Altai, the former
head of social policy department now runs the UNICEF, KOICA and WV joint WASH project locally.
Despite efficiency gains however, some respondents observed that UNICEF is now only moderately active
within their aimag. They shared that the staff member in charge of collaborating with UNICEF was essentially
taking on an increased workload by doing so. They implied that if an employee is funded specifically through
UNICEF and can devote all their time/resources to that role, then that is a better scenario than the current
situation. While the transfer of leadership to local actors can bring efficiency gains, it must be recognised that
non-UNICEF staff are less likely to be as effective as staff that are solely dedicated to advancing UNICEF aims
in the area.

5.5.3 Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring and evaluations systems143
UNICEF Mongolia’s has a robust monitoring and evaluation strategy to monitor outputs and demonstrate
UNICEF’s contribution to outcomes. Baselines, targets and means of verification related to each output’s key
performance indicators (KPIs) are annually updated at the end of each year. Data to inform both outcome- and
some specific output-related achievements and measures are derived from administrative data sources, such
as the Education Management Information System, and child statistics database managed by AFCYD.
For the education sector data, UNICEF and government partners noted the need to adapt the system to include
information from both public and private services that can be disaggregated to consider equity dimensions
(e.g. identifying out-of-school children and their characteristics such as sex, age, ethnicity, location; and/or
disparities in terms of learning outcomes). Health sector data similarly does not provide comprehensively
disaggregated service data needed to facilitate targeting and service improvements.
The child statistics database was established with financial and technical assistance from UNICEF. It collects
and compiles data from a variety of sources to provide information and analysis of the health, nutrition, well-
being and socio-economic status of children at various ages. The database is a critical resource for targeting
is well maintained and expanded to include adolescents. UNICEF plans to institutionalize aspects of the
Developmental Assets Profile (DAP) into the data collection/management system to improve the availability of
data on adolescents.
UNICEF and partners noted that while there has been significant improvement in the data collection system for
health statistics, better disaggregation of data is needed for targeting- particularly related to equity and age. In
addition, there is a need to include additional indicators related to the current priorities of the government in
maternal, newborn and child health, IYCF; and/or the availability of WASH services in health centres.
The important survey-related data sources for which UNICEF provide technical and financial support includes:
Population and Housing Census; SISS; Children’s DAP; Maternal, Neonatal and Infant Surveillance System; and
the NNS.
UNICEF works not only to improve the relevance of indicators and the functionality of administrative systems,
but also to ensure that data and information are translated into analysis for policymakers. It was recognised by
national policymakers and international partners however, that these databases need not only to be updated in
terms of indicators but also to be improved in quality. The Nutrition Surveillance System was particularly noted
as being in need of improvement.
UNICEF has developed a host of tools to assess data quality and institutionalise learning to better target
disadvantaged children. A Quality Assessment Tool is planned to be developed with MECS in the next CP to
facilitate monitoring of implementation of norms, standards and requirements around education, including
WASH in schools. Analysis on the equity dimensions of education and learning experiences in Mongolia will
also continue in the new CP. UNICEF plans to also complete an update of the MODA conducted in 2014 to
include education-related analysis.
Important administrative data sources that can support the monitoring of both outcome and some specific
output-related achievements for the child survival outcome are listed below. UNICEF works not only to improve
the relevance of indicators and functionality of these systems, but also to ensure that data and information
are translated into analysis for policymakers. UNICEF will provide an update to the MODA (conducted in 2014)
to integrate updated data and analyse the extent to which progress has been made in reducing deprivations
and inequities in the country. The new analysis however is not expected to model deprivation at the aimag
or soum level, stakeholders reported – an important limitation that could be overcome as shown by the Case
Study: ‘Mapping geospatial distribution of deprivation and UNICEF’s GTA’ in this evaluation (see section 6.1 for
a summary of the case study, and the full case study in Annex 3).

UNICEF CP Results Framework
In CP 2012-2016, outputs (and corresponding outcomes) and KPIs were generally at a rather high level with
little specificity of beneficiaries whether rights holders or duty bearers. Two outputs were notable exceptions:
output 308 which focuses on increasing utilisation of social services by disadvantaged families (under outcome
2); and output 410 that highlights universal access to education particularly for sub-groups of disadvantaged
children such as ethnic minorities, migrant children and CWDs (under outcome 4).
As shown in CP 2012-2016 thematic targeting of outcomes, outputs and key indicator results specific to
GTA (see Annex 2A), outputs calling for a specific targeted intervention and corresponding indicators are not
necessarily similarly targeted. As the CP was narrowly focused and programming was integrated, perhaps
targeting measures were not deemed necessary given the whole child approach that was being advocated.
UNICEF universal integrated approach to its programming (e.g. CFC strategy) was designed to cast a net wide
enough that all children, including the disadvantaged would be reached according to UNICEF respondents.
Without specific indicators however, to measure who is reach of the most disadvantaged, it is difficult to assess
the effectiveness of the strategy.
CP 2017-2021 results framework is more granular, providing significantly more outputs and KPIs explicitly
focused on outcomes for the most disadvantaged children. Like the former results framework however, many
KPIs remain national in orientation without measuring (or accounting for) whether disadvantaged children and
their families are specifically targeted through UNICEF actions – even within universal approaches to services.
A summary analysis of the CP 2017-2021 thematic targeting of outcomes, outputs and key indicator results
specific to GTA as presented in the Results and Resources Framework in Annex 2B. In outcome A summary 1,
there are three outputs and 17 KPIs of which only 5 have some targeting aspect. Disadvantaged children from
key populations, herder families exposed to dzud, and implicitly children and women from poor households in
need of support to access services are included as in need of a targeted approach. Outcome 2 focuses on access
to education and includes 4 outputs and 12 KPIs, 7 of which are targeted. In this outcome, inclusive education
for CWDs and creating greater access for children from ger districts, herder families and remote soums is
prioritised for targeting. Child protection and CFC implementation are the focus of Outcome 3. There are four
outputs and 8 KPIs of which three have a specific emphasis on targeting. As the CFC approach advocates for
integrated programming for all children, with a specific focus on providing intersectoral support for the most
disadvantaged, it can be considered that nearly all of the KPIs implicitly have a targeting potential.
Given UNICEF’s GTA and explicit focus on disadvantaged children, greater measurement specificity is needed
to ensure that GTA implementation strategies such as the CFC and working with LGAs to increase local budget
allocation and planning for children, as evaluated in this report, are explicitly monitored and evaluated for their
contribution to meeting the needs of the most disadvantaged children in Mongolia.

5.6 To what extent are the results of UNICEF’s GTA sustainability? (EQ6)
SUSTAINABILITY
Summary:
While the GTA hoped to foster higher-level government engagement for integrated intervention
packages, the sustainability of the integrated programming for children and families seems to be more
effective at a local level than at national level.
The CFC approach is widely considered the most likely to be scaled up and sustained by the GoM, as
interest from aimags, private sector and NGO partners has already been demonstrated. Sub-programme
components however may have more difficulty in being sustained with WASH being a likely exception.
The Children’s Hotline for reporting on domestic violence is another example of a sustainable government
intervention, following the fact that the hotline is now owned by the national government, as opposed
to donors like UNICEF or WV.
However, through the production of tangible and nationally owned deliverables, institutional memory of
the previous CP (2012-2016) is strong and remains a key indicator of programme sustainability.
With the current CP, capacity building for higher-budget sectoral actions is likely to be sustainable, as
the funds already engaged encourage further stakeholder commitment, even post UNICEF withdrawal.
Probable sustainability is equivalent for infrastructure projects where the realisations are explicitly
visible to the community.
5.6.1 Sustainability of UNICEF targeting approaches
Sustainability of UNICEF’s GTA focused intervention packages in the aimags and districts after funding for the
four-year action plan with the Governors expires, is considered to be mixed by respondents. UNICEF’s targeting
approach in selecting GFAs was considered to facilitate sustainability due to the GFAs higher-level engagement,
particularly related to the implementation of the CFC sub-programme’s annual socio-economic plan. It was
reported that as a lasting legacy, the GoM plans to replicate this approach in the remaining aimags with the
support of AFCYD that has branches in 21 aimags and 9 districts of UB city. Plans for replication are currently
under discussion within Government pertinent ministries and agencies and the remaining aimags.
Sustainability of some UNICEF supported activities from the previous CP of 2012-2016 in Khuvsgul aimag and
Nalaikh district is evident as shown in Table 4. Local authorities have maintained CFC activities at the aimag and
soum level with increased financing from their LDF, enhanced state budgets, and other donors. In the case of
Nalaikh, for example, smart water wells, new schools, and kindergartens are the result. Institutional memory in
Khuvsgul aimag and Nalaikh district is strong, despite possible rotation of officials within the Governor offices
after each local election cycle. This constitutes one of the key external factors that may affect sustainability
of best practice supported by UNICEF through its programmes. Respondents at the national and aimag level
highlighted that the Khuvsgul Governor during the CP became a strong advocate for the CFC on behalf of
UNICEF and AFCYD.
WASH and nutrition programmes that include CFC sub-programmes have a higher probability to be continued
after UNICEF’s withdrawal from GFA aimags due to increased budgets from the aimags and the central
government, as well as NGO and private sector contributions, supported by a conducive legal framework144.
This is demonstrated by the increased budget for the Governors’ four-year action plan and socio-economic
guidelines of Khuvsgul aimag and Nalaikh district (see example above). In Zavkhan, Government partnership
with UNICEF’s child protection programme also stimulated buy-in and sustainability through aimag and soum
level funding.

“A child protection [social] programme in response to the dzud shock was implemented
in partnership with the UNICEF. The program provided MNT 40,000 each to more than
2,800 children in the four soums with the highest dzud affection during last year’s dzud.
The aimag governor proposed to implement it in 23 soums. 6828 children aged 0-5 in
23 soums received MNT 60,000 each. It was very effective. In addition, in cooperation
with water and sanitation facilities, hot water and toilets in several soums have been
provided to improve the children’s environment. In addition, public sports fields have
been established in 15 soums with state budget investment and LDF investment.”
– KII, Zavkhan
Furthermore, AFCYD is taking actions to scale up CFC to another six aimags with the state budget’s allocations,
along with technical assistance from UNICEF. As mentioned above, the human capacity built in the previous
GFA (Khuvsgul) has been used for delivering lessons learned to these new aimags. UNICEF has supported such
dissemination with the capacity building, provision of equipment145 and training provided in the additional
aimags in collaboration with other GFA governors who share their own experiences. As in the GFAs, the process
started with the training of local administrators on how to promote CRC, how to design CFC activities and
what would the role of local government should be, for example. All aimags received the Handbook “Lessons
learned from CFC in Khuvsgul aimag” at the aimag Governors’ meeting to raise awareness of the CFC and
started initiatives, which seems to be working as was reported.
Asked whether child’s rights activities were sustainable, LGA respondents in the GFAs highlighted certain
activities that they felt were likely to be sustained. For example, follow-up actions for children dialling into the
108 Children’s Hotline (reporting violence) was highlighted as being likely sustainable as a result of the fact that
the hotline is now owned by the national government, as opposed to donors like UNICEF or WV. In addition,
children’s rights to expressing their voices through initiatives like ‘A day to listen to children’ were seen as likely
to be sustained as they have reportedly been taken up positively and implemented widely by both duty bearers
and right holders in the GFAs at central and soum levels.
LGA respondents in all GFAs commented that UNICEF’s GTA interventions were designed for sustainability and
replicability locally given their model/pilot nature. For example, the WASH project in Khuvsgul was taken over
by soums where UNICEF did not work and is now done in a more efficient and resourceful way by local actors
better positioned to negotiate cheaper services locally. As a second example, local funds were distributed to
schools to support inclusive education for CWDs; logistics and transportation. This was maintained by Khuvsgul
and has been replicated in the current GFAs. MES sees UNICEF-supported CDCs for CWDs as a good model and
is planning to replicate this model in 21 provinces with WB support in the next two years146. Another example
of cost-sharing activities included funding obtained from a Govi-Altai hospital to complement UNICEF activities.
Further in Nalaikh, there was evidence of good institutional memory after completion of the CP in 2012-
2016, with achievements and tangible results visible today, such as new schools, kindergartens and all khoroos
provided with modern clean water reservoirs147.
Advancing best practice for replication and scale up
Best practices from CP 2012-2016 were carried forward in the current CP on several thematic areas including
the CFC approach and interventions, nutrition (IYCF), Community Health Centres, Innovative WASH facilities,
Community Water safety plans, mobile kindergartens (ECD), MDTs for Social Protection, CDCs for Inclusive
education for CWDs, LSE for adolescents, mental health programs for adolescents and Child-centred Air
Pollution Action Plans. A particular example highlighted was, that of inclusive education models in centres
for CWDs, an approach that involved extensive capacity building for school staff, students and community
members148. It was noted that, following a pilot of the approach in Khuvsgul, UNICEF was able to advocate

UNICEF’s thematic programmes assessed national policy constraints affecting services for vulnerable families.
For example, in the previous CP, UNICEF observed that, in Khuvsgul, there was originally no allocation of LDF
funds for children, no intersectoral collaboration or operational MDTs for child protection, and no climate-
resilient facility for WASH. In 2014, with joint efforts of Khuvsgul GO and UNICEF’s implementation of CFCI,
at least 10% of LDF started to be spent for children advocacy and intervention149. This practice continued to
the current CP in all GFAs, and also for building the capacity of MDTs, and by establishing climate-resilient and
child-friendly toilets and WASH facilities. See Table 5 for UNICEF’s Good Practices from CP 2012-2016 and CP
2017-2021 to date that were successfully piloted and now serve as models for scaling up in both GFA and non-
GFA aimags.

In close collaboration with MLSP, UNICEF has designed a pilot
programme worth USD 490,000 to provide cash assistance
for all children living in remote rural areas prone to extreme
weather shocks in 4 soums of Zavkhan province. As part
of the pilot, all children aged 0-5 living in selected soums
received cash worth of MNT 40,000 (approximately USD
Shock Responsive Social 15) through the existing national system for delivery of the
13 2019
Protection Government’s Child Money Programme. The second phase
of the pilot covered all 23 rural soums except Uliastai, the
provincial centre. The pilot reached 6747 children aged
0-5 and all these children received MNT 20,000 for three
months, February-April, 2020. This pilot will be implemented
for 2 more years aiming for full integration and adoption by
the government thereafter154.
Advocating for scale-up
UNICEF has sought to influence national policies through the demonstration of successful pilot approaches, a
strategy understood and accepted by national policymakers respondents. Specific initiatives cited as examples
of pilot to scale include UNICEF’s efforts to scale up mobile kindergartens in herder communities, and activities
supporting school attendance of 6-year-olds (that were often not yet attending school)155 156. The latter was
seen as a way of supporting the socio-psychological well-being of children and their families, and helping to
prevent issues such as divorce and cramped housing.
There was appreciation among implementing national and subnational partners of UNICEF’s technical expertise
in developing new policy guidance, and evidence-based information materials and guidelines by both national
and sub-national policy makers and implementers for the replication and scale-up of policy achievements.
Specific examples of UNICEF’s providing such support is the development of the guidelines on “Services for
children in risk of abuse and domestic violence who are in the Shelter” (2018) and their role in supporting the
development of the Education Master Plan157.
Several pilot projects were also identified as showing promise in influencing policy in other aimags and at
national level including the CFC approach, ger dormitories for 6-year-olds, and mobile ger kindergartens for
herder families’ children, and resilient and child-friendly WASH facilities at schools and kindergartens. For
example, CFC was taken up by six other non-GFA aimags with full funding of AFCYD after reportedly being seen
as a good way to deliver child-as-a-whole integrated services to children. Conversely, another pilot, the REDS
strategy in the health sector, which was successfully modelled in Khuvsgul, was not maintained despite its
potential due to lack of local budget158.

Factors influencing achievement or non-achievement of scaling up Good Practices
UNICEF adopted a narrow GTA focus for CP 2012-2016 to be able to demonstrate that integrated programming
can yield impact for children, including the most disadvantaged. During the period, they developed successful
best practice models that were introduced in the next CP as intervention strategies with the potential for
scaling up in the new GFAs. To determine which best practice models would be scaled-up and where, UNICEF
staff considered inter-related critical success factors namely, partnerships, resources, capacity, and the enabling
environment.
Partnership: UNICEF had created the best practice intervention models with national and sub-national
partners in government, the private sector and INGOs (see section 5.5.1). International partners and UNICEF
staff agreed on the critical role these relationships, and the leadership provided by the national partners for
successful scaling up of programs:
“..a lesson learned is the commitment and leadership of the local governments are
essential in the successful replication of the good practices in the new GFAs” 159
- KII, UNICEF
Resources both from UNICEF and the Government - are also critically important as limits in funding have in fact
hampered broader scale-up of effective intervention strategies, such as building kindergarten in ger districts to
reach disadvantaged children, and expanding air pollution strategies.
Capacity of the implementing team and leadership support is also critical for sustaining interventions
packages. However, having the necessary financial resources can, as demonstrated in the current CP, facilitate
comprehensive training and mentoring of LGA and other sector partners to implement effectively in their
localities.
Perhaps the most important factor to consider for scale up is the enabling environment, including involvement
of the Parliament160. For Mongolia, this extends beyond the socioeconomic, political and even cultural contexts
to the physical and geographical context. UNICEF and other respondents reported a key learning for scale
up: the transferability of some intervention models from one location to another, in a geographically diverse
Mongolia is more challenging than expected.
“We are testing WASH adapted to the climate in Mongolia. Before I came to Mongolia, if
you were to tell me that building a toilet in Mongolia is different from in Africa, I would
say how? Now I can see it is different. Hygiene facilities are not accessible to everyone. We
need to have WASH that can be accessible, affordable. That’s what we are testing, and
so we can speak to Government saying that kind of WASH can work, because it has to be
supplied throughout the time.

5.7 COVID-19
Summary:
The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed and heightened the risks faced by vulnerable children. Children
already at risk for domestic abuse, and neglect became even more vulnerable, while children without
access to digitalised learning opportunities via TV were unable to learn and study.
During the pandemic, UNICEF switched to emergency mode to support the GoM to address the new
and urgent needs of children, particularly related to mental health. UNICEF and partners supported
rapid assessments, and home visits by teachers. Learning from UNICEF’s assessments indicated children,
depending on where they live, suffered disadvantage differentially. As a result, more attention has been
focused on the divide between urban, peri-urban, and rural areas by sector specialist in their response
to children’s needs.
5.7.1 The effect of the pandemic
COVID-19 has posed particular urgency to target the most disadvantaged families. COVID-19 exposed that
many children in already vulnerable situations were placed at even greater risk. For example, many respondents
noted that domestic violence161 and abandonment and neglect of children have increased during COVID-19
because parents were misusing and drinking more with social welfare benefits (Child money, Food stamp),
but there were no specific comments from respondents regarding what UNICEF can do to eliminate these
problems. Further, many vulnerable children did not have access to digital learning via TVs and were therefore
unable to complete their learning activities. In addition, children and adolescents faced greater psychological
problems like loneliness, anxiety of not being able to catch up lessons, and even an increased risk of becoming
overweight.
UNICEF, with local stakeholders and teachers, worked to mitigate the problems by supporting the 108 Children’s
Hotline and provided support for teachers to visit homes of children who did not have access to TV learning.
Social workers and teachers reported the challenges they were facing in supporting the most vulnerable
children, particularly those suffering abuse, neglect and poor nutrition. UNICEF participated in the national
level taskforce to address the public health crisis for children seeing their role in gathering evidence to target
the most disadvantaged children and developing strategies with government and international partners to
reach them with critical support.
4.7.2 Making data available during COVID-19
Data collection activities were continued at the start of the pandemic, by shifting data collection activities away
from home visits to public locations.
UNICEF was active in making data available to respond to the needs of vulnerable children and their families
during COVID-19. For example, multiple respondents noted that Rapid Risk Assessment of the Situation of
Children in 24-Hour Kindergartens in UB was carried out in February, and covered 1,720 children aged 2–5 in
14 public and private 24-hour kindergartens of UB city to see food and nutrition, safety, protection, health and
education status of children.
Also, UNICEF conducted two assessments of the mental health impacts on children during COVID-19 and the
effectiveness of TV lessons for children. Preliminary findings indicated the children had developed anxiety due
to not being able to follow up with TV lessons, loneliness, distress and also, it was found that many vulnerable
children were had no TV and electricity to watch TV lessons during COVID-19.
As a result of the pandemic, UNICEF reportedly switched into ‘emergency’ programmatic mode, though the
specific implications of what this meant were unclear. An important concern emerging out of the pandemic
161 https://mongolia.unfpa.org/mn/news
72 | Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
was the increased vulnerability and geographically divergent, risks. For example, children living in peri-urban
areas within UB were observed to be in a precarious situation as a result of the pandemic, which was brought
to the attention of the GoM. As a result, more attention has been paid to the divide between urban, peri-
urban, and rural areas. These results will likely extend beyond the pandemic, with the emergent realization
that air pollution, for example, is a problem faced by many urban areas, whereas labour exploitation is more
common among rural children from herding families.
UNICEF’s response during COVID-19 was highly appreciated by the government because of its efficiency. For
example, UNICEF found a duplication of efforts in some thematic areas, (UNICEF is cluster head in Education in
emergencies), whereby partners were all producing the same informational content; after discussions, partners
then worked together to produce a common package of materials. International development partners and
policymakers reported that the initial duplication of efforts was overcome through UNICEF’s leadership and
willingness to collaborate with urgency, which was very appreciated. Further, UNICEF staff and policymakers
reported that during the COVID pandemic, UNICEF successfully advocated for an increase in the universal cash
transfer all children under 18 increasing it from MNT 20,000 to 30,000, to MNT 100,000 by the end of 2020,
however this point could not be corroborated by documentary evidence as yet.
At the soum level in the GFAs, collaboration was highly appreciated and efficient by respondents’ statements.
They noted that UNICEF asks local stakeholders about their needs before proposing solutions to requests
coming from the aimag. They note that this resulted in interventions being based on actual need, which was
felt to be an efficient way of working and collaborating.

6 Case studies
Two case studies were done to inform the evaluation: one to investigate UNICEF’s role in working with and
influencing LDFs and social sector budgeting; and a second to explore UNICEF’s Geographical Targeting
Approach. A summary of the case studies is described below. The full case studies are presented in Annex 3.
5.1 Case Study 1: GTA model analysis and mapping of deprivation of children and adolescents in Mongolia
This case study explores the extent to which the GTA focuses on UNICEF Mongolia’s thematic interventions
appropriately to address the unique characteristics and problems faced by children in the selected GFAs
during the last two CPs. Geospatial and multivariate analysis were used to understand deprivation patterns in
Mongolia, to assess the appropriateness of the UNICEF GTA methods for tackling child and adolescent poverty,
and to recommend future analytic approaches to geo-targeting.
UNICEF GTA
The two central functions of geo-targeting for UNICEF are, firstly, the selection of aimags, districts for focused
engagement, intervention and action for vulnerable children. The second is the micro-targeting of vulnerable
children and households or marginalised groups within the chosen focus areas.
In terms of selection of aimags and districts, for the 2012-2016 CP (referred as 1st CP), UNICEF’s GFAs were
chosen to be the Nalaikh district and Khuvsgul aimag. Three different aimags and a different district were
chosen for the CP 2017-2021 (referred as 2nd CP). Finally, Umnugovi aimag was added for specific interventions
starting from 2020. Although there were criteria used to determine the target areas, many considerations,
competing data sources, and political processes were accounted for in the decision. As a result, UNICEF has not
necessarily been working in the areas where the most deprived children are, and there may be hotspots left
behind. Employing updated geospatial techniques, we explored how the decision-making process could have
been informed by creating poverty maps based on 2016 data.

taken in China162 and Tajikistan163.
Analysis and findings
A statistical analysis using Bayesian geospatial modelling techniques was conducted to estimate and map
poverty-related variables in the context of the evaluation of UNICEF’s GTA in Mongolia. It produced a poverty
map for 2016 to assess the situation that UNICEF was confronted with at the start of the second CP, and
compared this with the GTA that they took. The resulting map is used as a basis for reflection on alternative
approaches to targeting and key trade-offs and assessment of the relative merits of alternative approaches to
targeting as informed by available data and updated data analysis techniques.
Using an established Mongolian poverty measurement approach, a MODA based on child-appropriate
dimensions of poverty from the HSES carried out in 2016 was used to create a multidimensional poverty
estimate based on HSES sample data. These data164 represent the overlap in deprivation across one or more
dimensions, ranging from a minimum of 0 deprivation dimensions (not at all deprived) to a maximum of 7
(deprived across all dimensions). The results, available at aimag level, show that three of the five most deprived
aimags for children aged 24- 59 months were selected at the start of the 2nd CP (see Figure 9). An analysis of
child and infant mortality trends over the same time period showed that the recently added target aimag of
Umnugovi also experienced recent increases in mortality, even though, at the time of the 2nd CP, the area was
not among the very poorest.
For micro-targeting, administrative data is often used to identify disadvantaged children and families within
targeted aimags and districts – an approach that is highly variable between sectors and significant potential
for bias. Use of PMT is another approach that has been used to target food stamp recipients for example.
Experience from neighbouring countries shows that such targeting might neglect needy populations and a
universal approach to poverty alleviation emerges as a viable solution.

Recommendations
The two central functions of the GTA for UNICEF - selecting GFAs and introducing strategically intersectoral
approaches to, when necessary, micro-target disadvantaged or vulnerable children, should be re-conceptualised
and a strategy built for each, supported by agreed reliable databases and a nuanced analysis with a structured
discussion of trade-offs. For selection of aimags or districts, GFAs should be selected based on impact to be
achieved starting with the highest deprivation areas or where mortality is highest. For micro-targeting within
GFAs, UNICEF’s universal approach should be continued to provide engagement across all interventions
intersectorally. To ensure all children receive the basic services they need, especially the most deprived, an
equity approach to delivery of a standardised package of interventions/programmes is needed – irrespective
of the ability to pay. This universal rationale should be moderated by the exception of interventions that need
different approaches based on climate and geography e.g. WASH or for children at risk (e.g. social protection,
malnutrition). Itinerant populations also need special attention given the multiple deprivation they experience.
After the universal roll-out, an expansion plan can be carried out for additional populations in phases according
to local area conditions.
6.2 Case Study 2: Review of UNICEF CP strategy and impact on local pro-child planning
and budgeting
This case study explores UNICEF’s strategy of working with, and building the capacity of, local level authorities,
coupled with national level advocacy to increase budget allocations for children at all levels. There are two
basic means by which LGAs can increase local financing for children: The LDF, and Social Sector Budgeting. Both
are discussed in this case study.
Local Development Fund. UNICEF’s strategy was to engage in local advocacy with aimags for a 10% threshold
for pro-child budget allocations. This approach was generally successful at least for the period of UNICEF
engagement. It was generally appreciated for the occasional training and awareness raising for a range of local
officials. It did not appear to target support to the local officials at the key LDF planning steps (soum/bagh
governors, LDF committees, and CRHs), provide practical guidance to help them reconcile pro-child priorities
with the official prioritisation criteria, or provide clarity as to which projects are (and are not) ‘pro-child’; nor
did it appear to engage systematically with all soum authorities across the aimags, responsible for planning a
significant share of ‘aimag’ LDF budgets.
Evidence for the impact of this support on LDF budget allocations in favour of children is inconclusive. A crude
filtering of LDF projects showed a clear sign of a rising trend of such allocations in Khuvsgul, but the evidence
was not available as to whether this was sustained. Pro-child allocations varied greatly across more recent
GFAs, but were all (often well) above 10%; however (with limited data) no upward trends were obvious, and a
‘control’ aimag actually displayed higher pro-child allocations than two GFAs. Evidence also suggests that aimag
data conceal very wide variance in pro-child allocations at soum level.
It emerged that there are major constraints to greater pro-child allocations from the LDF in the regulatory
framework. Local officials are reluctant to violate the over-riding ‘citizen vote-based’ official priority criterion
(which may not always match pro-child priorities), and also to approve ‘soft’ capacity-building projects which
may benefit children, often preferring harder infrastructure. ‘Upstream’ advocacy with MoF for more regulatory
clarity would be important to address these constraints.
Since, as explained in Section 1.3., the LDF is by far the main potential local budgetary resource available
to finance the joint multi-annual UNICEF-aimag work plan activities, this regulatory framework also poses a
challenge to local co-funding and future sustainability of these work plans. Currently, activities must emerge as
citizen priorities from the planning process. So far, many of them have been for ‘soft projects’, which may not
always be seen as a benefit for and by the wider community. There is also the issue that they would absorb
very high levels of local LDF budgets.
Social Sector Budgeting. UNICEF’s strategy was to provide local training and awareness raising and advocacy
to address several central ministry financing and budgeting policy and regulatory issues. These issues are
considered major constraints on local government’s ability to change pending patterns in favour of vulnerable
76 | Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
children, in what is still a very centralized system (despite apparent assumptions in the Strategy Note). Successes
were registered in several policy areas, e.g. large increases to funding of the ‘outreach’ component of the child
protection special transfers, revision to budget norms allowing counting of non-resident kindergarten pupils,
and to soum hospital budget norms allowing greater equity, and adoption of inter-ministry WASH guidelines.
However, there appeared to be no engagement with the annual ‘performance contract’ mechanism by which
service delivery performance is monitored (a potentially useful entry point for improvements) nor with the
sector capital budgeting process, key for equity and access to children’s facilities.
Local-level training and piloting support activities were widely appreciated - but concerns were also expressed
about piloting initiatives as ambitious as performance-based budgeting. No evidence was available to
substantiate improvements to pro-child budgeting outcomes from this support but, given the central budget
norm constraints, there was perhaps little scope for significant changes, other than to simply improve the
efficiency of the budgeting process itself. This, however, also raises questions about the retail role for UNICEF in
basic PFM training around which it may be worth exploring more sustainable strategies through government’s
own mechanisms for local capacity support.
In both areas, there is scope for greater partnering, both with donors working on upstream policy advocacy in
these sectors and around the LDF, and with those working on local capacity support, e.g. to local CRHs which
play a key statutory role in basic service delivery and monitoring.
7 Revisiting the Theory of Change
A reconstructed TOC focusing on UNICEF’s GTA was developed for this evaluation based on UNICEF’s CP ToC per
outcome. The reconstructed ToC consolidates the four outcomes change pathways related to targeting broadly.
Testing of the change pathways focused on the explicit and implicit assumptions UNICEF programming must
overcome to achieve outputs and eventually outcomes. Overcoming or mitigating challenges presented by the
assumptions depended heavily on UNICEF’s strategic approaches, notably, multisectoral CFC interventions,
building capacities and effectiveness of local level authorities to deliver for children, respect, protection and
fulfilment of child rights, efficiency of UNICEF partnerships, and the reality of moving from pilot projects to
scale in Mongolia.
Moving from inputs to outputs, UNICEF hypothesised that they could work with local level authorities if they
were receptive to collaborating and open to an equity-focused approach to service delivery. They noted the
need for counterparts to have a minimum level of capacity, willingness and political space to adapt local plans
and budget to reflect new evidence and priorities in the thematic priority areas (education, health, and social
protection). Furthermore, UNICEF recognised the need of having sufficient evidence from UNICEF monitoring
and evaluation for planning, programming, and budgeting to target the most vulnerable children and their
families. Interventions were assumed to be facilitated by internal positive collaboration and synergy between
UNICEF programme interventions in support of intersectoral actions in the GFAs.
Implicit assumptions within the ToC pathways from inputs to outputs however highlighted the role, status and
power of local level authorities to influence plans, budgets, and targeting for the benefit of specific populations
namely the most deprived families, or even children generally. UNICEF assumed that through training/capacity
building, advocacy and awareness raising, local level authorities (and even national level policymakers) could
“move the needle” towards more holistic programming and investment for children, particularly at sub-national
levels. As observed in the findings (see section 5.3.4) however, local level authorities are still given little scope
to make their own budget decisions, which are tightly constrained by national regulations. Where they have
been granted legal or regulatory such authority (e.g. to make local budget changes within specified thresholds)
they have been slow to use these powers , , to redirect local funds towards children’s issues, underscoring the
need for governmental dissemination of how the financing rules should be interpreted. In addition, while child-
centred budgeting training was appreciated and provided broadly, targeting the training and support to the
critical actors with the legal power to make decisions was not always straightforward. For example, Governor’s
LDF working committee or CRH members that ultimately decide allocations of LDFs rarely participated in the
child budgeting trainings or were given practical tools to guide decision-making in favour of children’s’ needs
(see Case Study 2).
Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming | 77
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
Further, the implicit assumption that local level decision-making would be informed by improved data for
targeting and formulation of budget proposals for services was not realised. Adequate data remains in sectoral
siloes and rarely gets used by local decision-makers for such purposes, though there are a few notable
examples (see section 5.3.4). Generally, the implicit assumption in the causal pathway – that the introduction
of the CFC approach to stimulate intersectoral interventions and collaboration could translate into increased
budget allocations – was ambitious at best. Evidence shows that while significant progress has been made
to embed the CFC approach at subnational levels in the GFAs and beyond, translating CFC plans into cross-
sectoral budget support and LDF allocations is not straightforward. It will require further support from UNICEF
and the government to be fully realised and self-sustaining. Moreover, there was an implicit assumption that
raising awareness and political commitment around CRC principles would result in measurable action on
behalf of the most vulnerable children by local-level officials. Evidence from this evaluation could not correlate
heightened use of CRC terminology, and even understanding of child rights into enhanced focus on the most
deprived children. There was evidence however that attention and appreciation of child rights did increase
children’s voice and participation in some soum and aimags discussion about children’s needs generally, and
their priorities for LDF allocations on behalf of children in their communities (see section 5.3.2 on the CRC).
Moving from outputs to outcomes and the goal, further explicit and implicit assumptions mitigated the causal
pathways.
It should be noted that despite the breadth of UNICEF’s intervention areas, all have an intrinsic focus on narrowing
inequality gaps (through both targeted and inclusive, universal approaches) in child deprivation by reaching
and serving the needs of the most disadvantaged children. The explicit assumption, that there is the necessary
national capacity, resources and political commitment to deliver evidence-based interventions for children,
remains valid. Likewise, the assumption that all stakeholders, including development partners, are receptive
to scaling up evidence-based practice beyond UNICEF’s GFAs holds true. UNICEF’s ability and added value to
secure adequate financial resources to bring pilot projects to scale and achieve the goals of the CP however
are less evident, as most progress thus far has been made due to UNICEF’s direct investment incentives. It is
unclear whether some of UNICEF’s interventions will ever be locally or even nationally sustained, irrespective
of the pilot’s success. Some downstream areas associated with WASH or construction of kindergartens may
never be fully absorbed given the turnover of local authorities and changes in political priority.
The inability to secure a longer-term commitment from elected leaders at national and aimag level is part of
the development challenge. UNICEF strategies must clearly identify systematic constraints that dictate LGAs to
deliver services adequately and equitably. Evidence-based advocacy from successful pilot interventions may or
may not be sufficient to overcome such systemic barriers. The evidence shows however that advocacy efforts
were most effective in advancing UNICEF’s strategic approaches when led by aimag governors themselves. The
scale-up of the CFC approach to six other non-GFA aimags, for example, was achieved through the advocacy of
the Khuvsgul governor (see section 5.4). Likewise, the expansion of targeted interventions to meet the service
needs of unregistered children in Bayanzurkh district was championed by the district authorities (see section
5.3.5 and 5.4.1).

8 Conclusions
General observations
In this evaluation, UNICEF’s local GTA in Mongolia related to CP 2012-2016 and the current CP 2017-2021 was
investigated, as to how focus areas were selected, and within the GFAs, how UNICEF’s GTA strategy facilitated
thematic programmes to reach the most disadvantaged children. While geographical targeting is not new in
Mongolia, a common understanding of the concept is lacking.
UNICEF introduced a GTA in 2012 (CP 2012-2016) when they decided to consolidate their efforts in one aimag
(Khuvsgul) and one UB district (Nalaikh); an approach which was revised in 2016 to expand the targeting to
three (and eventually four) different aimags and one different UB district (Bayanzurkh). The change in focus
came following improvements in Khuvsgul aimag (CP 2012-2016) in infant and child mortality, making a good
start to achieving progress in the SDG era. As seen in Figure 1, death rates in Khuvsgul improved significantly
from 2012 to 2017 but remain high (and have increased for child mortality in recent years). In the second CP
(CP 2017-2021), four new aimags were targeted including two new aimags (Bayankhongor and Govi-Altai) with
stable but high child mortality rates since 2017, and two, Zavkhan and Umnugovi, that both saw increased
mortality over the same period. However, in comparison, several other non-selected aimags also saw increased
mortality over the same period (see Figure 1 in section 1.1).
In terms of whether appropriate targeting areas were chosen for focussed effort, it’s clear that some of the
most deprived areas in 2016 are among the targeted locations (see Figure 10), and that large populations
are covered; UNICEF has not lacked ambition165. Whether more needy regions could have been chosen is
questionable, given the trade-offs UNICEF considered, including potential impact, efficiencies, and government
priorities. The initial selection of three new aimags and one alternative district to scale up UNICEF pilot
interventions from the previous CP (2012-2016) through intersectoral programming worked well, especially in
terms of avoiding fragmentation of resources and capacity inherent when programmes are overstretched. A
fourth aimag, Umnugovi was added more recently to GFAs - which, in 2016 was also home to a high proportion
of deprived children.

The UNICEF strategy to transfer good practice models from pilot in Khuvsgul in the previous CP, to the new GFAs
in the current CP was a successful approach – even if not all programme models were directly transferable.
Challenges in the WASH sector in Mongolia are a notable exception where tailored approaches to climatic
conditions are required. In this sparsely populated country, consolidation of resources and efforts of UNICEF
thematic programmes is widely considered as necessary. Indeed, during the last two CPs, UNICEF and its IPs
have run integrated interventions successfully demonstrating the value of holistic programming for the whole
child.
The execution of the GTA strategy of integrated multi-sectoral programming within UNICEF and at local aimag,
district and soum levels was challenging given traditional silos between sectors. Intersectoral programming
advanced due to UNICEF’s commitment to scale up the CFC approach through local government counterparts.
UNICEF contributed to enhancing local government capacity over the period to better plan and manage
integrated and equitable service provisions for children in a holistic manner; yet more is needed to ensure
local budgeting and sector support for children is sustained. While good practice examples from Khuvsgul
demonstrated to the new GFAs (and beyond) the value of local government support for the CFC approach,
with commensurate resources associated with it at all levels, additional efforts are needed to ensure these
approaches benefit the most vulnerable children and their families.
UNICEF’s success in introducing the GTA strategy of intersectoral planning and interventions through the CFC
did not appear to be based on a systematic or data-driven set of priorities or evidence-based intervention
models. Most thematic intervention packages were integrated into the selected GFAs in various combinations.
From the evaluation respondents, it was difficult to know how locations were selected, for example, which
soum schools were targeted as a potential pilot for the adolescent mental health programmes, or for a WASH
container, etc. Thematic targeting was either ‘universal’ in nature (Expanded Programme of Immunization
(EPI), education etc), demonstration projects (WASH, ger kindergarten construction; mental health programme
support for adolescents, air pollution projects) or highly targeted based on critical need (COVID-19 response,
child protection hotlines and identification, malnutrition, CWDs, etc.).
In the end, the GTA strategy of bringing together diverse sectors or thematic programmes was largely based on
interest from local partners, locally determined needs, feasibility, availability of resources, and the possibility
for the few funded examples to demonstrate a promising practice to be scaled up by the government. Like
the broader targeting, how intervention packages were targeted to reach the most disadvantaged children
balanced local perceptions of need (maybe based on local administrative data or in some cases, a situation
analysis) with other more practical concerns. While analysis and priority setting were conducted, it appears that
there was no systematic or rigorous, needs-based targeting done for the majority of the thematic programmes.
Theory of Change
UNICEF’s outcomes and goal, as stated in their ToC, aim to deliver for the most disadvantaged children in
Mongolia. A reconstructed ToC focussing on UNICEF’s GTA allowed the testing of the four outcomes change
pathways related to targeting. Insights arise from the examination of explicit and implicit assumptions that
UNICEF programming must overcome to achieve desired outputs and eventually outcomes. Overcoming
or mitigating challenges presented by the assumptions depends heavily on UNICEF’s strategic approaches,
notably multisectoral CFC interventions, capacity building, child rights, efficiency of UNICEF partnerships, and
the reality of moving from pilot projects to scale.
The existing ToC by outcome area do not sufficiently explain the casual pathway for targeting vulnerable
children, though specific interventions clearly focus on these children, such as child protection, ECD, and
nutrition. Further, not all programmes lend themselves to targeting but require rather a universal approach
to access to health and education services. For this evaluation, targeting approaches (and assumptions) were
drawn from the outcome area ToCs. It should be noted however that although a priority, targeting was not fully
integrated into the outcome ToCs, leaving many of the casual links on how an intervention is actually focused
on vulnerable children as assumptions of the process. An overarching ToC that brings the GTA strategy into
focus is needed.

Relevance
Relevance of GTA towards GoM priorities and CP results
UNICEF’s GTA has contributed to achieving the results of the CPs and the approach aligns with national
government priorities. There is an overall agreement between the government and UNICEF to support
intersectoral collaboration as advocated by the GTA, underlining the relevance of shared priorities. However,
there remains a lack of consensus between UNICEF, the GoM and different stakeholders concerning the exact
concept and approach to measuring who is disadvantaged or vulnerable.
In addition, there is a somewhat philosophical conflict in approach to targeting broadly deriving from the fact
that while the GoM seeks to treat each aimag equally, UNICEF places more emphasis on equitability. UNICEF’s
geographical targeting to focus its resources on a select few priority location (GFAs) exemplifies this equity
perspective. UNICEF’s targeting exercise balanced equitability, with efficiency and political concerns around
equality of support between aimags and districts. It is notable however that the GoM was not directly involved
in the GFA selection process in the last CP 2017-2021 seeing the exercise as an internal UNICEF matter.
UNICEF’s targeting approach in 2016 to select GFAs was to be grounded in an analysis of the data on deprivation
generally (children at risk of at least two forms of deprivation), thematic “hotspot” considerations and
efficiency. However, a rigorous data analysis exercise to identify the highest deprivation areas was not done for
the selection of GFAs in the CP 2017-21. The data used for targeting was not representative at the targeting
level (aimag, soum) and many geographic areas falling outside of the selected GFAs were identified as having
endemic issues. As a result, the GTA was not correlated with poverty levels nor fully aligned to thematic priority
areas. Instead, the selection of GFAs was only generally informed by deprivation and outcome data (often at
higher levels of aggregation).
Through consultation and dialogue, UNICEF managers selected GFAs based on the available information, and
balanced that against operational efficiency concerns, and as mentioned previously, political consideration
(and pressure from some aimag governors). As a result, UNICEF may therefore not have been working in the
areas where their targeted support could help the country make the most impact their national and global
targets.
The GTA strategy is most convincing if situated within UNICEF’s overall mission and strategic aims to effectively
deliver on CP results. The evaluation identified a challenge in understanding the purpose of the GTA strategy
and consistency of its application. The GTA had multiple aims that were not necessarily compatible. Application
of the GTA was to focus intervention strategies on locations with high deprivation, or on locations where
UNICEF could efficiently and effectively pilot particular innovations, or both. For CP 2012-2016 in Khuvsgul, an
aimag with high levels of poverty and deprivation, both strategies were possible, though limited in it being only
one aimag. In CP 2017-2021, the rationale for expansion of the focus to ultimately four aimags and one district
was less clear as levels of deprivation, and thematic needs vary considerably between them.
The different rationales for selecting areas for piloting particular innovations may not necessarily relate to levels
of deprivation – it may be that area selection criteria should instead reflect willingness of local authorities to
commit to change, or to “representativeness” of a particular local context (e.g. ‘budget surplus’ vs ‘budget
deficit’ aimags and soums having different degrees of local budget flexibility). The inclusion of such alternative
criteria, for example, may lead to different area choices. UNICEF Mongolia did not establish a hierarchy of
priority for the criteria used in the their GTA nor did they set a higher value on key programming principles, such
as reducing under-five mortality in absolute numbers (see Case Study on UNICEF’s GTA model and mapping of
deprivation).
The evaluation Case Study 1 shows how improved analysis of existing data to model geo-localised deprivation
can provide UNICEF with a more robust analysis of where deprivation is most acute in the country, down
to the aimag level. Building on a solid deprivation analysis, UNICEF could, in th e next iteration of the GTA,
establish weighted criteria to select GFAs that are clear, and evidence-based. Qualitative efficiency criteria will
necessarily continue to apply but relative to the broader ambitions of UNICEF for the CP. This will rationalise
the process and ensure that the selection is aligned with UNICEF’s priorities for balancing breadth and depth
Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming | 81

of engagement in their selection of the next GFAs.
Beyond selection of GFAs, the GTA strategy offered the opportunity to reach all children through holistic
intersectoral and multidisciplinary approaches. This holistic approach assumes that by casting the net wide,
programmes will also reach those in greatest need. UNICEF largely relies on local sector partners to identify
and target interventions to the most disadvantaged children. Given the lack of consensus of definition and
approach, it can be that UNICEF’s GTA strategy as applied locally may miss some children.
Gender and human rights
The GTA was generally seen to integrate a human-rights, gender and equity-based approach. Overarching Child
Rights principles have been embedded in UNICEF’s interventions in the GTA areas, such as the institutionalisation
of Children’s Councils as part of the CFC approach. While there was general appreciation of the child rights
agenda, some rights were more challenging: more efforts are needed to support children’s voice in decisions
affecting their life, and in ensuring all groups have the right to non-discrimination (e.g. related to ethnic
minorities). Generally, UNICEF enhanced attention to the needs of the most vulnerable children, particularly
CWDs. Some concern was expressed about UNICEF responding to (rather than proactively programming within
the CP) needs of ethnic minorities and the children of unregistered migrants. Although UNICEF has worked
on punctual interventions to address emerging issues for both, a broader, purposeful intervention strategy
related to non-discrimination that is population rather than GFA focused was considered needed from a Human
Rights perspective. While gender equality has been pursued both in the form of targeted and mainstreamed
interventions, and in collaboration with other agencies, government and key stakeholders, addressing specific
gender barriers to GTA intervention strategies such as access to education was not observed.
Effectiveness
UNICEF’s GTA in the two most recent CPs has been effective in achieving CP results. The UNICEF GTA, through
its child-rights lens, and its intersectoral approach to policy design and intervention package implementation
has directly contributed to UNICEF’s success with its advocacy agenda during both CPs. UNICEF has worked
upstream through evidence generation and policy advocacy to influence national laws, policies, planning and
strategies arrangements affecting child-relevant health, education and social service delivery and support,
with an emphasis on reaching the most vulnerable children. For example, the GTA enabled a specific focus on
CWDs during the development and drafting of the Education Master Plan.
UNICEF has worked downstream through its GFAs to promote the Rights of the Child through integrated
intervention strategies inherent in the GTA. Specifically, UNICEF CFC approach has helped to create an
integrated, holistic, multi-sectoral intervention “safety net” at sub-national levels to meet the needs of the
most disadvantaged children. The functionality of the CFC approach is enhanced by the noticeable motivation
and commitment of local administrators to the programme. Review of implementation of the 9 CFC building
blocks revealed that within the GFAs, and even in the control aimag that is also implementing the CFC approach,
comprehensive application of the strategy is high. All of the aimags and in most soums of the GFAs, the CFC is well
understood as evidenced by the establishment of CFC specific intervention strategies like a CFC Coordination
Committee, a Children’s Council, and MDTs among other. The Non-GFA is also implementing the building block
but with less success at soum level – likely due to receiving less external facilitation by UNICEF. In addition, the
CFC has effectively engaged rights holders by creating greater awareness among local administrators towards
supporting children, and raising parents’ consciousness and engagement concerning child rights. While CRC
principles are integrated within the GTA rationale, and children’s knowledge of the CRC can be directly tied to
UNICEF intervention packages, CRC principles are not yet systematically known, understood, and converted
into guidelines by all stakeholders within all GFAs.
Much of what has been achieved UNICEF has also contributed to building and enhancing local governments’
capacity to effectively plan and manage integrated and equitable service provision for children. In the
GFAs, UNICEF’s CP outputs have successfully built the capacity of LGAs, local line ministry departments and
partners to do child-friendly budgeting, and resource allocations for children. Budget transfers for children
and adolescents from national to local have increased 23-fold between 2016 and 2020. However, budgeting
82 | Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
flexibility according to local contexts is still lacking as household and individual cash transfer programmes are
still managed entirely nationally.
Disaggregated data (on age, sex, ethnicity, disability, economic status, and more) is available and used by
UNICEF and partners to target the most vulnerable children and their families. The UNICEF supported SISS is
a well-known source of data on children’s issues throughout the country, although within GFAs. Nonetheless,
data on vulnerable children and their families is not collected systematically or scientifically, and research bias
is common. This results in a variety of administrative databases, some of which are ad hoc and of poor quality.
Efficiency
UNICEF has implemented the GTA strategy efficiently in the GFAs through partnerships (e.g. government,
UN agency, NGO and private sector) that have supported implementation, and in some cases, financing of
programme interventions. The evaluation has highlighted lessons learned and potentially more efficient
modalities of targeting (through the case study) to accelerate results for the children in Mongolia and to close
the equity gaps for the most disadvantaged children. It is unclear whether the UNICEF’s current strategic
approaches to selecting sub-national areas (GFAs) to test its different interventions and combinations thereof
have proven more efficient than alternative or past approaches to reaching the most vulnerable. No data was
available to assess resource efficiency gains from the different targeting approaches between the CPs reviewed
under this evaluation; however, key stakeholders appreciated the broader reach of UNICEF in the current CP as
compared to the previous one. Within UNICEF, although there is an established definition of efficiency, more
fundamental issues have been raised concerning how to define the efficiency of remote provincial investments,
benefits, and the need for flexibility as intensified investment in just one location can be risky if problems arise.
UNICEF operates in four thematic outcome areas, each with a number of outputs. In the previous CP, outputs
were at a high level without significant detail related to targeting, though implementation of intervention in the
GFAs were largely integrated and focused on the most disadvantaged. In CP 2017-2021, the results framework
was more granular but not always fully aligned to the output. Assessment of the results frameworks for the
current CP found relevant targeting within the outputs and KPIs, though much more could be done to focus
KPIs so that they measure whether interventions actually reach the most disadvantaged children. Even within
universal approaches and policy level action, UNICEF could do more to measure success on how it delivers
specifically for disadvantaged children. Use of composite indicators could help to implicate different UNICEF
programming components to work more closely together for common, integrated programme achievements.
Despite general commonality in approaches, an overarching thread (or strategy) between programmes to
synergistically unite efforts and create a multiplier effect is not evident. At the highest levels, UNICEF staff
are aware of what the other programmes are doing generally but are not very versed in the details, possibly
indicating a siloed working environment mirroring what is happening within government sectors and agencies
as well. While each programme team is highly skilled and apparently effective in their domains, higher-level
coordination and consolidation between outcomes and outputs within UNICEF was not found. While many
UNICEF staff have a good in-depth understanding of local issues, the larger strategy for the sector is siloed
between higher-level experts. Likewise, within UNICEF, sector priorities and activities, can supersede the larger
aim of working collectively for the whole child. In a UN context, UNICEF could use their position as the lead
agency on children in Mongolia to help create an overarching intersectoral pro-child vision and macro level
framework to guide UN efforts within UNDAF and the future of the “one UN” as well as with government,
international and local partners working for children in Mongolia.
Despite these issues, UNICEF’s resources were able to achieve the thematic objectives linked to them for the
most vulnerable children in an efficiency-maximizing manner. UNICEF has been efficient, for example, in the use
of human and financial resources. UNICEF’s approach is currently not to create posts for UNICEF funded staff
at aimags, preferring rather to work through local actors to build ownership and sustainability. The approach
however has its limitations.

Sustainability
UNICEF’s targeting approach in selecting GFAs has facilitated a sustainability due to higher-level engagement
within GFAs and the policy of aiming for scale-up and replication of pilot interventions. As a lasting legacy, the
Government plans to replicate the CFC approach nationwide
Sustainability of some UNICEF-supported activities from the previous CP of 2012-2016 in Khuvsgul aimag and
Nalaikh district is evident. Institutional memory in these GFAs is strong, and best practices have been successfully
scaled-up and expanded to the GFAs of the current CP. For example, AFCYD is scaling- up CFC in another six
aimags with the allocations from the state budget along with technical assistance. The human capacity built
into the previous GFA of Khuvsgul has been used for delivering lessons learned to these new aimags. UNICEF
has supported the dissemination of the CFC model with capacity building, as well as the provision of equipment
and training. Certain activities are likely to be sustained, such as the children’s hotline reporting violence now
owned by the national government, with investment from the private sector (Mobicom) and the support of
INGOs, such as WV.
In terms of budget sustainability, there are some issues under discussion. To the extent that the CFC work-
plans implies a significant level of annual funding (as discussed in the case of Zavkhan in the Case Study on
Local Planning & Budgeting), this may pose a concern if it is to be co-funded significantly by local authorities
under current financing and budgetary procedures. Most CFC plan activities appear to require recurrent
budget spending, for which authorities enjoy very little local flexibility. CFC investment projects, such as WASH
facilities, are more feasible insofar as they can be funded from the LDF.
Factors identified to foster success and sustainability of intervention outcomes include, partnerships with the
private sector and NGOs, ensuring adequate funding and budgeting instruments, building LGA capacity, and
fostering enabling legislative and policy environments.
COVID-19
During COVID-19, UNICEF has been active in supporting vulnerable children. For example, UNICEF financed
a Rapid Risk Assessment of the Situation of Children in 24-hour kindergartens in UB, two assessments of the
mental health impacts on children during COVID-19, and the effectiveness of TV lessons for children. As a
result of the pandemic, UNICEF switched into a slightly undefined ‘emergency’ programmatic mode. UNICEF’s
targeting approach expanded, in response to GoM request and needs to respond to increased vulnerability
and geographically divergent risks in hotspots that require rapid information gathering, assessment and action.
How the pandemic will actually affect the most disadvantaged population has yet to be seen but indication
from recent studies conducted by UNICEF and others suggest increased needs in terms of social protection for
the most disadvantaged families.

8.1 Good Practice
Box 4. Implementing the GTA through the CFC
Summary:
Implementation of the GTA through the CFC demonstrates good practice through the delivery of an
‘integrated social service package’ to meet the intersectional needs of disadvantaged children holistically
and sustainability.
● The nine building blocks of the CFC strategy provide a purposeful comprehensive integrated
framework for intervention including participation, budgeting, advocacy platforms, and legal
frameworks and mechanisms for child rights.
● The CFC strategy puts the child at the centre of a holistic, multi-sectoral intervention strategy
and rationale. By engaging duty-bearers from various sectors (teachers, social workers, law
enforcement, local government, local NGOs), the intersectional needs of child rights-holders can
also be met.
● The CFC intervention strategies include concrete and practical deliverables, often related to
infrastructure (e.g. innovative and climate resilient WASH facilities, improvement of street-lights
infrastructure) of value to local stakeholders.
● Implementation of the CFC is guided by an M&E framework operated by local IPs, raising the level
of local ownership of day-to-day management of interventions.
● Partnerships with the donors, NGOs and the private sector helps to build local capacity while
relieving pressure on dedicated public funding, and providing opportunities for broader
collaboration.
● Children voices are meaningfully engaged to inform the design, improvement and roll-out of the
CFC at the local level. Through institutionalised children councils and direct consultation organised
by Governors, a full perspective of children’s needs is aggregated and acted upon.
The success of the CFC during CP 2012-2016, and the scale-up demonstrated across the 4 GFAs of CP
2017-2021 (plus 6 AFCYD supported aimags) demonstrate the value, appreciation and replicability of
the approach for scale-up.
● The CFC enjoys very broad consensus among stakeholders of a common defining framework for
intersectoral collaboration, and local actions.
● The framework is sufficiently diverse to allow for adaption by stakeholders and beneficiaries to
local needs and context; the CFC can embrace local priorities for advancing child rights increasing
ownership and sustainability.
● Holistic, multi-sectoral engagement and advocacy raises awareness of child rights, and has a ripple
effect across a community. As such, responsibility for child rights and child issues shifted from a
single duty-bearer: the social worker, to a shared sense of responsibility and a joint commitment
by all actors.
● Involvement of government partners such as AFCYD in the advocacy efforts; their approval,
enthusiasm, and engagement is a crucial driver of further capacity building of governors and
LGAs necessary for improved child-responsive budgeting, and replication beyond UNICEF GFAs –
a demonstration of the sustainability and scale up of the approach.
● The particular efforts of highly motivated individuals such as the Governor of Khuvsgul expand
the CFC’s reach and success, by acting as entrepreneurs of change and advocates of the CFC
(convincing another 6 aimag governor’s offices to implement the approach).

9. Lessons Learned
1. The GFA selection process should be done purposefully in collaboration with government stakeholders
to increase engagement and commitment. The application of the GTA for the selection exercise should
be grounded in a robust use of data and a transparent, consultative process with national and subnational
government authorities for deeper commitment and strategic thinking on how to roll out intervention packages
for those in greatest need. Innovation in engagement is needed. Selection criteria could include proposals
from aimags and districts to demonstrate interest and commitment for implementation. A clear guideline
for preparing a proposal and consultation with aimag and district representatives could further inform the
process. While the demonstration of interest would not be the only criteria, it would allow for a documented,
transparent process based on a ranking. National counterparts would value the opportunity to participate and
make a case for inclusion in the process.
2. Embedding CFC initiative nine building blocks into local development plans and strategies are important
for increased sustainability and accountability in implementation. UNICEF’s GTA experience during CP 2012-
2016 in two GFAs demonstrated the value of integrated programming by creating a significant number of
best practice models for adaptation, replication and scale up. While not all models were continued, many
are currently being implemented in the current GFAs. Local authorities developed their own child-friendly
aimag programmes with results and monitoring frameworks which was instrumental for all stakeholders to
be accountable in good implementation of the CFC in their own areas. While an important contribution to
accountability, more efforts are needed to institutionalise such mechanisms. Engaging with rights holders more
directly could increase accountability by duty bearers.
3. Strengthen the national policy framework for decentralized budgeting for children through upstream
policy engagement. UNICEF has worked largely downstream at the sub-national level to build capacities and
understanding of how LGA representatives can mobilize resources for children’s issues. While the approach in
the target aimags has shown some success, the case study on budgeting and planning noted that the strategies
used by UNICEF often assume greater autonomy and flexibility to make budgetary decisions than is enjoyed
by local actors in what remains a highly centralized framework. The case study suggests UNICEF work more
extensively upstream with national level initiatives and partners to clarify and improve the national policy
framework for sub-national financing and budget processes, allowing greater LGA discretion but with clearer
guidelines. This will ensure better targeted spending on, and access for, public services for children at the
subnational level.
4. Engaging community participation and sensitizing local authorities on pro-child issues increases
commitment and LDF funding allocation for children. UNICEF has been working through CFC technical
strategies to improve local planning and budgeting for children, and working directly with children to give voice
through their parents to submit and vote for LDF. Heightened concern and awareness of children’s rights has
contributed to increased LDF allocation for children’s issues. While LDF is not the only decentralised government
financing mechanism available for supporting key interventions for children, when available through the LDF,
experience shows it can be a source of funding for children’s interest.
5. Fostering both strategic and operational partnerships with private sector actors helps increase the likely
sustainability of key intervention packages for vulnerable children and adolescents. Examples of private
sector partnerships include those with Mobicom on 108 Child hotline, the establishment of a centre for CWDs
in Govi-Altai with support of Wagner Asia LLC, a collaboration with Arig Bank, Wagner Asia on developing
innovative WASH in kindergartens helped more than 830 children access kindergartens with good water and
sanitation facilities. As well as developing social corporate responsibility in Mongolia, these partnerships
result in increased engagement, diversified technical responsibility, shared financial risk, and effectually create
greater local ownership and sustainability
6. Overlapping of membership in Children’s Council and CFC Coordination Committee, while complimentary
can erode effectiveness of both. Legal and administrative rules make the distinction. The Children’s Council,
led by Governor, is established in accordance with Child Rights Law and is to be a permanent platform for
children’s issues. The Coordination Committee, led by Head of the Governor’s Office, is named to implement
86 | Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
the CFC initiative and exists on behalf of the CFC programme for the duration of the project cycle. Given
the similarity of purpose, and human resources constraints, member participation locally often overlaps,
making one or the other superfluous as the same persons are in both. UNICEF should undertake a stakeholder
mapping, and an effectiveness study in collaboration with local authorities, practitioners, and children in GFAs
to recommend how best to streamline the coordination process and platforms for greater efficiency and
effectiveness.
7. The best practices and models of integrated services for children should be clearly presented at the end of
this CP by local partners. The experience in Khuvsgul showed the power of a local governor as an advocate for
implementation of the CFC in other non-GFA aimags. GFAs, with UNICEF support, can document best practices
and lessons learned of their experiences. Achievements and challenges could be shared between partners,
GFAs and other interested aimag governors as a communication and advocacy message to facilitate replication
and scale-up. Documentation of good practices by a predecessor GFA and sharing them with successor GFAs
proved to be very effective and useful way of operationalizing the CFC further after CP 2012-2016. This process
of knowledge transfer was very much appreciated by current GFA stakeholders as it motivated them to scale-
up the CFC in their aimags, districts and soums.
8. Targeting of vulnerable or disadvantaged children, as a concept and framework for intervention, remains
poorly understood, or captures a wide variety of definitions according to the stakeholder concerned. Within
the national government, there is a lack of coherence when it comes to designing policies targeting vulnerable
children. The ministries of education and health for example, tend to target children in a universal manner
without specifically targeting those with specific deprivation (with notable exceptions of CWDs). The care for
vulnerable children is largely considered to be the responsibility of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare
and its’ agencies and departments. To apply the GTA effectively, UNICEF needs to work closely with LGA and
sector specialist to unify the approaches locally so that sector lists of the most vulnerable or disadvantaged are
mutually informing to ensure no child is missed.
9. Integrated programming does not necessarily break down siloed ways of working within government
sectors or UNICEF. UNICEF has been instrumental introducing integrated, multi-sectoral approaches to
programming for the whole child. Intervention strategies engage various sectors to address a collective of
problems facing children in schools, communities and the household. Intersectoral programming however still
requires sector specific interventions, which are often, still done solely with the corresponding government
sector colleagues. The interventions thus become sequential or concurrent but not joint – many times because
it is not practical. UNICEF could develop a series of composite indicators that would require sector contributions
to the same KPI – catalysing collaboration for a common output or outcome.

10 Recommendations
The recommendations presented in Table 9 below have been iteratively derived from analysis of the findings,
deeper investigation and insights from the case studies triangulated against qualitative and quantitative
secondary data, and the document review. The recommendation reflects the triangulated opinion of duty
bearers including UNICEF staff (past and present), international partners, national and subnational GFA and
non-GFA GOs, LGAs, line ministry representatives as well as social workers, teachers and other service providers.
Rights holders interviewed included caretakers and children. Each case study explored in-depth, UNICEF’s GTA
approach and how it affected programme results. A contribution analysis was done on the preliminary findings
to ascertain UNICEF’s unique contribution to the results observed. As the evaluation focused on UNICEF’s GTA,
and predominately on two specific intervention strategies (CFC and Local planning and budgeting for children),
a more comprehensive programme analysis was outside the scope of the evaluation. Information on additional
intervention strategies and specificities was brought in through qualitative interviews with stakeholders and
UNICEF staff. Synthesis of the above yielded a broad picture of the achievements of the GTA approach as well
as the challenges. Based on this analysis, recommendations on how to improve geographic targeting to define
where to work, and how best to thematically target intervention packages to reach the most disadvantaged
were elaborated.
Validation of recommendations was undertaken with government partners and UNICEF stakeholders to co-
create actionable final recommendations to improve UNICEF‘s GTA in the next CP.
Recommendations are divided into two categories, Strategic recommendations (focusing on relevance
and sustainability) and operational recommendations (focused on effectiveness and efficiency). The
recommendations are particularly aimed to inform the application of the GTA in the design of the next CP. As
such, recommendation relevance to the development of the next CP is made explicit for ease of consideration
and use in CP planning and elaboration. In addition, each recommendation includes a targeted actor (specific
stakeholders and partners); a proposed timing and references to the findings upon which it has been derived.

To strengthen the GTA, UNICEF should:
• establish a higher-level principle of what UNICEF Mongolia wants to
achieve through targeting in the GFAs to be selected (e.g. reducing
mortality, provided a common intervention package for all children,
etc.). These priniciples should be reflected in an overarching Theory
of Change that encompasses the outcome specific theories of
change (see SR 2).
• Consider selecting Eastern region or provinces that do not receive
subsidies from Government, such as South Gobi as a comparative site

is defined as a basis for micro-targeting of programmes, including
for UNICEF programmes. The agreed upon rationale should be
accompanied by clear guidance, approaches and methods for
determining which children qualify for special attention through
micro-targeting of services or special programmes.
• include LGA engagement, interest and commitment in the selection
process to facilitate bring pilots to scale for the most disadvantaged
children as a criterion for selection.
UNICEF may also consider purposefully targeting some intervention at
sub-population groups rather than geographical areas to reach the most
disadvantaged (See SR5).
UNICEF also may explore option and feasibility of implementing which parts of
the CP programmes in all provinces of CPs nationwide with the Government.
(Findings: 5.1.1; 5.1.2; 5.3.4; Case Study 1: Mapping geospatial distribution of
deprivation and UNICEF’s GTA; Validation meeting).
Relevance to the next CP: Clarification of purpose of the GTA employed by
UNICEF to define GFAs should respond to the UNICEF’s goal and outcomes. The
GTA should be explicit in the programme rationale, priorities and partnerships
to increase effectiveness of the CP and its aims. The refined purpose of the
GTA should also be reflected in the results and resources framework. The
evidence used for the GTA analysis should be robust, and reflect aimag (or
lower) levels deprivation data. The GTA methodology, criteria, and how they
are weighted should be made clear through guidance documents.

SR2 Develop an overarching ToC with composite indicators for UNICEF’s GTA. High UNICEF Mongolia Short term
Description: Given UNICEF’s focus on reaching the most disadvantaged
children, there is need to develop one comprehensive ToC across programme
components to guide targeted programming for greater effectiveness,
sustainability and impact. This overarching ToC should incorporate the
outcome specific theories of change and bring them together for common
purpose. Such a common ToC focused on targeting the most disadvantaged
children through integrated and multisectoral programming in the GFAs
would reduce siloed programming both within UNICEF and enhance clarity
for government and other implementing partners.
For the next CP, UNICEF is encouraged to make explicit the interlinkages
and synergies between the change pathways (across outcome areas) in
a comprehensive ToC to deliver for all children, especially those most
disadvantaged. Inclusion of composite or GTA specific indicators that
require contribution from multiple programme components areas and bring
focus to sub-populations of vulnerable children could increase programme
effectiveness, integration and complementarity (Finding: 5.1.1; Annex 2A-2D).
Relevance to the next CP: UNICEF’s current CP aims to “demonstrate affordable,
integrated and effective solutions to tackle inequalities at the local level, and
national policy and budget advocacy to ensure replication and sustainability at
a larger scale.” A unified ToC and use of indicators to stimulate cross-sectoral/
component interventions strategies will support this ambition in the next CP.
Programme priorities can detail the overarching ambition of the unified ToC,
which would then need to be reflected in programme component strategies
and approaches, monitoring and evaluation, and the results and resources
framework.
SR3 Ensure sustainability of UNICEF’s integrated intervention strategies in the GFAs Medium- UNICEF Mongolia Short-
before scale-up High medium
term
Description: In CP2012-2016, UNICEF consolidated programming in GFAs to
pilot test integrated service packages, many under the umbrella of the CFC
initiative. At the end of the CP, “good practice” models were then replicated
in the GFAs of CP 2017-2021. While many good practices, including the
CFC initiative are documented by UNICEF, and supported by Government
partners (e.g. AFYCD, Khuvsgul LGA, Bayankhongor LGA, among others), often
passionately, there is no criteria established to define when an intervention
strategy arrives at being classified as a best or good practice. The Results
Framework does not go far enough in specifying how such a classification
can be assessed. Further, it is unclear when a “good practice” is embedded
enough to be sustained locally without UNICEF’s support. Currently, the CFCI,
for example, is not sufficiently implemented, as yet, at the local levels (soum,
bagh) of the GFAs to be fully sustained.
To ensure UNICEF’s good practices can be replicated and brought to scale
country-wide, UNICEF should consider:
• applying criterion for assessing when a pilot becomes a “good or
best practice”. The criteria should include the degree to which key
elements of the strategy or package have been embedded in local
systems and mechanisms and are being local managed; based on the
criteria, a tiered implementation approach (from bagh to soum to
aimag centre) to fully operationalise and embed critical components
of the strategy to increase ownership and sustainability; validation
of practice models through external evaluation of programmes to
assess the degree to which the criterion has been met in establishing
best or good practices for the country and more broadly. (Findings:
5.1.1; 5.1.2; Validation meeting)

Relevance to the next CP: UNICEF’s programme priorities for the next CP should
assess the need to continue working in some of the current (or even past)
GFAs another 2+ years until the CFCI strategy (for example) and ownership is
secured by local authorities, partners and communities in all soums. Selection
of the next CP’s GFAs should include a criterion that balances the desire for
new innovation, and the need to demonstrate replication and expansion of
existing integrated packages with, ensuring sustainability and ownership of
past and current investments. Such criteria should be embedded within the
monitoring and evaluation plan and results framework.
SR4 From a Human Rights perspective, give heightened priority to children in the Medium to UNICEF Mongolia, Short to
most vulnerable situations in Mongolia. High in partnership with medium
rights holders’ term
Description: UNICEF GTA considered multiple deprivations as one of the representatives;
criterion for the selection of GFAs. The severity of the deprivation, however, and departments
has not been sufficiently measured, nor are the populations with greatest of line ministries
need adequately targeted in the GFAs, and more generally within Mongolia. in GFAs, Cabinet
Specific sub-populations have been identified by UNICEF and partners as Secretar
having greater needs including (but not limited to) children exposed to climatic
shocks (dzuds), children of iterant unregistered populations, children with
disabilities, and children of ethnic minorities. While UNICEF has responded
(and even shifted priorities) to address specific problems they become aware
of, priority in programming for some of these groups has not been systematic
(notable exceptions include CWDs and children at risk of climatic shocks).
To ensure UNICEF’s programmes reach the most disadvantaged children, also
from sub-populations, UNICEF should purposefully:
• introduce regular and more frequent analysis of the root causes
of inequality (including how discrimination and gender disparities
manifest for specific groups of children), and investigate how
deprivation affects urban versus rural populations, and the longer-
term consequences for children that suffer multiple deprivation,
particularly in light of COVID-19 and other shocks;
• identify and build consensus with partners (including rights holders
from these communities) on intervention strategies to remove
service barriers and purposefully improve conditions for these
marginalised sub-groups;
• prioritise the strategies in the next CP across component areas in
vertical and horizontal level to ensure an integrated approach by
cultivating stronger partnership with Cabinet Secretariat. Create
complex indicators to capture intersectoral outputs and outcomes
for the targeted sub-populations.
The prioritized intervention strategies should be specific to the sub-population
and include a policy and service action that speak directly to CRC principles
(universal access to health care, nondiscrimination based on residence,
ethnicity, etc.). This recommendation aligns with the recommendations from
the CRC (See Annex 2F),
(Findings 2.3, 5.1.3, 5.2.2, 5.5.1; Case study 1: Mapping geospatial distribution
of deprivation and UNICEF’s GTA; Case study 2: Local pro-child planning and
budgeting).
Relevance to the next CP: CRC recommendations are noted as programme
rationale for the current CP. While some actions have been included in the
current programme priorities, more could be done in the next CP to narrow the
inequality gaps between sub-groups of children. UNICEF, as the leading voice
for child rights in Mongolia, can use this position to increase accountability
for non-discrimination and equality in programme priorities and policy, and
through specific indicators in the results framework.

OR1 Strengthen coordination mechanisms of the CFC at all levels for effectivenss High UNICEF Mongolia, Short-
and sustainability. AFCYD, Governor’s Medium
Offices of the GFAs, term
Description: UNICEF has successfully introduced the CFC in all of the GFAs LGAs
they have worked in over the last 8 years, plus a further 6 aimags with AFCYD
support. The approach is catalyzed by its rights-based, pro-child advocacy,
which has created enthusiasm and enduring relevance of the strategy at all
levels, but particularly in the aimags. Coordination mechanisms are critical for
sustaining the approach. Currently a comprehensive system for coordination
at the national level is lacking. At aimag and soum level, the Children’s Council
(headed by aimag governors) and the Coordination Committee (headed
by heads of governor’s office) often overlap in mandate and membership.
Despite engagement in all the GFAs with different duty-bearers and rights
holders, accountability mechanism is not yet in place to institutionalise the
approach. Given the importance of the coordinating structures, UNICEF can
further institutionalise and strengthen implementation of the CFC by:
• simplifying CFC coordination at aimag and soum level to provide
flexibility of format in accordance to local needs (e.g. where
members of Children’s Councils will be the same as those in the
Coordination Committee);
• create a professional accountability mechanism between aimags
and soums with a feedback loop to ensure comprehensive
implementation of the approach;
• build a social accountability mechanism (e.g. benchmarking,
scorecards, public face to face meetings) to call duty bearers
(e.g. governor, LGAs) to account for hearing children’s voices and
responding to them through concrete actions (e.g. institutionalised
platforms for dialogue, budget allocations)
• align CFC indicators to expected results around the building blocks
so all partners engage on all aspects of the initiative.
(Finding 5.4)
Relevance to the next CP: Strengthening the CFC is fundamental to the full
implementation of the GTA strategy as a model on integrated, multi-sectoral
intervention. The added intervention focus should be reflected in the
programme rationale, as well as in the component specific summaries, as well
as the results framework.

mechanisms that could be used locally for children. UNICEF should build on
the success it has already achieved with sector ministries (e.g. child protection
transfers, kindergarten budget norms) to advocate with sector partners for
increased sub-national budgetary discretion with the Ministry of Finance.
UNICEF can increase its upstream advocacy by:
• exploring scope for greater decentralization of child-related
spending and budgeting responsibilities to LGAs (building on
Government Resolution #350 of 2016, and 2019 revision to the
Budget Law) for greater local flexibility in implementing budget
norms and guidelines;
• to that end, comprehensively documenting the various ‘systemic’
constraints limiting the flexibility of local officials to better tailor
local plans and budgets (between and within sectors);

(Finding: 4.3.4; Validation meeting).
Relevance to the next CP: Strengthening programme priorities and
partnerships in all relevant programme components to strategically generate
evidence and use it to expand collaboration on sector planning and budgeting
in the next CP will increase programme effectiveness. Embedding relevant
indicators in UNICEF Results and Resources Framework that align with what
is being asked of sector ministries can help to capture progress made through
advocacy efforts.

local governor’s office authorities and specialists, and line ministries in the
GFAs to collect and use national survey and administrative data to improve the
effectiveness of planning, programming and budgeting. Lack of transparency
and access to some sectoral data at local levels limits its use by UNICEF and
other partners for improved and aligned targeting of disadvantaged children.
The SISS and Situational Analysis reports – which include the most relevant
data at regional level and those aimags only in the GFAs- and thematic
targeting and analysis should be more systematically used at sub-national
level to complement, contrast and validate local administrative data. UNICEF
should advise and encourage GFAs to improve their administrative data
collection and analysis to inform specific programmes, particularly related to
health, ECD and social policies and protection systems (Finding: 5.1, 5.2).
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in collaboration with national
and sector specialists, UNICEF should concert financial and technical resources
with the IFIs and other development partners to produce more robust data
(with larger sample sizes) to better assess the impact of COVID-19 on children
(Finding: 7.1).
Relevance to the next CP: Better collection and use of data, particularly during
the COVID-19 pandemic, can inform the programme rationale and programme
priorities and partnerships for targeted policy and programme interventions.
Programme effectiveness and efficiency can also improve through more
informed and aligned programming between the sectors, UNICEF and other
implementing partners in aimags and soums.

• support aimag capacities to implement SPT performance contracts
with soums (see OR 3. above), to encourage more attention to the
needs of vulnerable children; and
• support aimags governors to ensure alignment of action plans with
available financing for children.
Innovation in approach to building capacity of national and aimag
policymakers and private sector partners are needed to optimise, replicate
and sustain UNICEF’s upstream intervention strategies across sectors.
Consideration should be given to mentoring, twinning and on-line courses
and webinars. As the United Nations in Mongolia moves closer in their
reforms towards a “one UN” approach, the need for more joint programming
and complementarity between Agency capacity building approaches with
government and implementing partners are seen as key to future efficiency
gains (Finding: 4.3.4, 5.1; Validation meeting).
Relevance to the next CP: Changes in UNICEF’s approach to capacity building
should be explained in the component programme priorities and measured
through monitoring and evaluation. Indicators reflecting the more specific
capacity building approaches should be detailed in the results and resources
framework.

of the whole child approach. term
Description:
The GTA strategy advocates for the implementation of cross-sectoral,
integrated intervention strategies implicating multiple UNICEF programme
components such as ECD, social policy and WASH. The strategy requests
integrated action at the sub-national level, usually with sector specialists that
work only in their sector area, limiting collaboration opportunities within
UNICEF and between government sectors. As a result, traditional siloed
programming is difficult to avoid. UNICEF can act as a bridge between siloed
programmes and sector and agency strategies to increase efficiency through
integrated programming, as possible. However, there does not seem to be
an overarching coordination within UNICEF of the linkages inherent in an
integrated programme intervention strategy at higher management level.
To increase collaboration and reduce siloed programming, in the next CP,
UNICEF should:
• improve coordination of programme interventions at subnational
level to ensure whole child programming reaches all disadvantaged
children in the GFAs and ;

• create composite indicators that require different programmes to
answer to common outcomes and outputs integrating expectations
of success and fostering teamwork; and
• establish budgetary mechanisms within UNICEF for integrated
and flexible funding to avoid dividing up integrated intervention

component collaboration).
(Finding: 5.1, Case study 2: Local pro-child planning and budgeting; Validation

Relevance to the next CP: CP programme effectiveness in GFAs will increase
if guided by one person with an overview of all component areas. Explicit
programme management will increase operational efficiency and cost
effectiveness. Monitoring and evaluation should incorporate this overview
into the results and resource framework through both composite technical
and managerial indicators.

Obs: Overall, this Outcome is on track despite financial constraints which have limited progress in some technical areas, such as pre-
vention of STI/HIV, EmOC, household level/community sanitation. It is suggested to review the areas of engagement and indicators,
particularly of outputs 1 and 2, to focus on key actions achievable by the end of the Country Programme. In addition, it is proposed
to create a new Output dedicated to Air pollution, to reflect the programme engagement on this issue (MTR UNICEF 2019).

Case Study 1: Mapping geospatial distribution of deprivation and UNICEF’s GTA
This case study explores the extent to which the GTA in each of UNICEF Mongolia’s thematic areas addresses the
unique characteristics and problems faced by children in the selected GFAs during the last two CPs. Geospatial
and multivariate analysis of survey data was carried out to map deprivation patterns and hotspots in Mongolia,
to assess the appropriateness of the UNICEF GTA methods for tackling child and adolescent poverty, and to
recommend future analytic approaches to geo-targeting.
1. UNICEF GTA
The two central functions of geo-targeting for UNICEF are, firstly, the selection of aimags, districts for focussed
engagement, intervention and action for vulnerable children. The second is the micro-targeting of vulnerable
children and households or marginalised groups within the chosen focus areas.
In terms of selection of aimags and districts, for the 2012-2016 CP, UNICEF’s GFAs were chosen to be the
Nalaikh district and Khuvsgul province. Three different aimags and a different province were chosen for the CP
2017-2021 (see Figure 11). Finally, Umnugovi province was added for specific interventions starting from 2020.
Although there were official criteria used to determine the target areas, many considerations, competing data
sources, and political processes were accounted for in the decision. As a result, UNICEF has not necessarily
been working in the areas where the most deprived children are, and there may be hotspots left behind.
Employing updated geospatial techniques, we explored how the decision-making process could have been
informed by creating poverty maps based on 2016 data.
Figure 16. Overview of the targeted aimags and districts in successive country programmes
In terms of micro-targeting within selected GTAs, we compared and reviewed the various approaches that have
been taken and the data they are based on, comparing approaches with previously evaluated methods for GTA
taken in China and Tajikistan.

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
2. Analysis and findings
A statistical analysis using Bayesian geospatial modelling techniques167 was conducted to estimate and map
poverty-related variables in the context of the evaluation of UNICEF’s GTA in Mongolia. It produced a poverty
map for 2016 to assess the deprivation situation that UNICEF was confronted with at the start of the second
CP and compared this with the geo-targeting approach that they took. The resulting map is used as a basis for
reflection on alternative approaches to targeting and key trade-offs and assessment of the relative merits of
alternative approaches to targeting as informed by available data and updated data analysis techniques.
Of note is that deprivation is high in the selected GFAs, particularly in Zavkhan, however Western aimags with
their ethnic minority populations remain those in greatest need for the most part. High deprivation is also
found elsewhere, with levels not here shown for the UB districts with the largest populations. Further analysis
of district data could complement this analysis.
Using an established Mongolian poverty measurement approach, a Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis
(MODA) based on child-appropriate dimensions of poverty from the nationally representative (HSES) carried
out in 2016 was used to create a multidimensional poverty estimate for each aimag based on a sample of
58,512 surveyed individuals (see Table 1). These data represent the overlap in deprivation across one or
more dimensions for each child, ranging from a minimum of zero deprivation dimensions (not at all deprived)
to a maximum of seven (deprived across all dimensions). This was calculated for new-borns, children and
adolescents separately (see Figure 12).
Figure 17. Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis (MODA) framework showing dimensions of poverty for new-borns,
children and adolescents
167 We employed a Bayesian geospatial modelling approach using the R-INLA package within R software. This is particularly useful in situations where
survey data were collected and representative at coarser spatial resolutions than the predicted estimates. We included geospatial covariates such as
population, elevation, precipitation and temperature, as well as socio-economic indicators such as wealth, accessibility to the nearest urban centre,
recent health status, education, etc. to robustly predict child deprivation amongst infants 0 – 23 months and 24 – 59 months. Maps depicting these
estimates at the aimag level were produced across the country, in addition to associated model uncertainty in the form of 95% credible interval
maps.

124 | Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
The MODA approach is well established in Mongolia, based on indicators, dimensions, and deprivation
thresholds, which are selected using the Convention on the Rights of the Child as a main framework (United
Nations, 1989). Further decisions on age groups, dimensions, indicators, and thresholds were originally guided
by discourse with UNICEF sector specialists and national and international partners including the Mongolian
National Statistics Office (NSO). The final selection of dimensions, indicators and thresholds for Mongolia
reflects international standards of well-being, and data availability across questionnaires.
Modelled Aimag Level Deprivation
Modelled results, available at aimag level, show that three of the five most deprived aimags for children aged
24- 59 months were selected at the start of the 2nd CP (see maps in Figure 13). An analysis of child and infant
mortality trends over the same time period showed that the recently added target aimag of Umnugovi also
experienced recent increases in mortality, even though, at the time of the 2nd CP, the area was not among the
very poorest.
In terms of targeting the greatest numbers to show overall effect in child mortality for example, the selected
aimags are not representative. Except for Khuvsgul in the previous CP, and Bayanzurkh district in the current
CP, the GFAs have relatively small populations. Within the top 6 most deprived aimags, the current GFA focuses
on 2-3 depending on the age of the child. The maps also show that Khuvsgul remains an aimag with significant
problems for children.

3. Alternative targeting methodologies and trade-offs
UNICEF methodologies in region
China UNICEF‘s GTA approach (2015-2017)169
The UNICEF Health, Nutrition, and WASH Section employed a targeting approach related to the scale up of
their Mother and Child Survival Strategy (MCSS) in China. The targeted approach focused on rolling-out the
MCSS across China’s counties equitably; it was soon followed by the ECD strategy (including social policy, child
protection, and education components) and later by the adolescent health strategy. Upstream programming
activities related to poverty reduction programmes, economic aspects of social policy programming; and
other non-programmatic activities like policy dialogue, advocacy, and data collection and studies within child
protection were also not included in the targeting approach; for health, nutrition and WASH they were included.
The targeting approach was introduced to consolidate programming for greater impact. Until 2013, health
programmes (e.g. EPI, nutrition, WASH, HIV, MCH, child injury) were being implemented in different provinces
and counties. The approach was considered not strategic, too siloed and fragmented as programmes were not
working synergistically and intersectorally. For example, the immunisation programme was in some counties
and material survival in others, eliminating any multiplier effect from multisector programming. The same was
true for the education programme. Each programme had their own ministerial and counterpart relationships
and ways of working. While it was not possible to change the counterpart dynamics UNICEF China believed it
should be possible to improve the impact of its programming using a GTA approach.
The health programme team understood that to reduce mortality they needed to work holistically on all issues
in same place and include all health interventions in the broadest sense. It was also clear that while they were
focused on provinces with high under 5 mortality rates, some of those provinces did not make up the bulk of
the child mortality in absolute numbers across the country. To make a sizable impact on the number of child
deaths (and subsequently on the under 5 mortality rates), it was most logical to focus on a limited number
of provinces that contributed the highest proportion of child death as shown in Figure 15 below170. In China
however it was not politically feasible for the Maternal and Child Survival Strategy to favour some provinces
and counties over others.
Figure 21. GTA approach to scaling up China's Mater-
nal and Child
UNICEF’s aim was to ensure equity in coverage
across the country for the MCSS in line with
government requests. As comprehensive
programming was not feasible due to capacity
and cost constraints, they devised a criteria-
based approach to targeting that would
sequentially cover all counties in China.
From 2011-2015 UNICEF prepared the MCSS
and the targeting approach they would take.
In 2013 it was decided that UNICEF would
shift emphasis to other GFAs; this began the
process of sequencing in additional provinces
for the 2016-2020 period, while maintaining a

mortality. The blue bars are provinces where UNICEF had previously worked in the health domain. The selection of additional

presence and support in the provinces where they had previously worked. As indicated in Figure 15 above, by
2015-2016, plans for expansion (beyond their pre-existing GFAs) had been consolidated for sequential scale
up to all counties in China. The targeted roll-out of the MCSS, was soon followed by the ECD strategy and then
adolescent health, each building on the experience of the MCSS.
Specifically, the China health programmes targeting approach took the following steps:
1. Staff listed all programmes in all counties to get overview of where UNICEF was currently working.
2a. Conducted an analysis exercise by province on the current situation for children based on measurable
criteria:
• Provincial share of number of under five deaths nationally
• Economic development (wealth of province)
• Proportion of counties in province that had not achieved SDG3
Provincial willingness to participate (political commitment) was added as a softer criterion that would help
make GTA decisions in similar situations.
UNICEF categorised the provinces based on their resources: provinces without financial resources; provinces
with sufficient resources, and provinces in-between. UNICEF determined it would expand MCSS in all provinces
and counties, but UNICEF resources would be used for only for the poorest; and for those in-between, UNICEF
could provide only a partial contribution.
2b. In each province, starting with the provinces that had a strong commitment to participate in the MCCS,
these analyses were then complemented by a similar analysis done at county level to identify within each
province the areas of primary focus.
3. In consultation with staff, added an efficiency criterion (not in selection of counties but in the sequencing
strategy). Centres of Excellence for training in the MCCS were created, which would attract participants from
different geographic locations to be trained more efficiently in adjacent clusters. Application of the efficiency
criteria to the other hard criteria allowed the team to select clusters of provinces and counties that were
adjacent (i.e. grouping best clusters to respond to criteria – not science an art).
Summary: UNICEF’s approach in China was guided by an equity and public health impact focus. They assumed
that the provinces and counties with highest number of deaths were by proxy, areas with highest deprivation.
Based on these assumptions, a criteria-based analysis guided by UNICEF’s aim to have greater impact on child
mortality as a moral and public health imperative (death averted) plus efficiency concerns determined how
they would scale their health programme strategies. They remained in the provinces and counties where
they had previously worked (blue bars in graph), and then established a step-wise process to cover the whole
country with their interventions sequentially over time. (See circled provinces in Figure 15 as those with
greatest number of child deaths.)
UNICEF Tajikistan Priority Districts approach171
UNICEF Tajikistan decided “in an attempt to use the most effective and efficient approaches to CP
implementation” for “more tangible and rapid progress toward programme goals”, UNICEF decided to focus
its work and resources during the programme cycle 2010-2015 on a selected number of districts, which they
refer to as “Priority Districts” (PDs).
Given Tajikistan’s decentralised approach, UNICEF selected 12 out of 68 districts in the country to be the
focus of its support. The selection was done in two phases (2010 and 2011) and, according to a evaluation of
the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and impact of the approach, the targetting was based on the level of
deprivation in relation to child rights and some practical considerations regarding the feasibility of a UNICEF
partnership with the respective districts. Except Dushanbe, all regions of the country included PDs. The
evaluation reports that the “programmatic documents and other available data sources do not provide a clear

statement of the intended aggregate number of children and women, as final beneficiaries of the geographical
targeting of the programme in the 12 PDs”.
As in Mongolia, the GTA in Tajikistan sought to:
• increase access of children and women in disadvantaged districts to diversified and quality basic
services based on decentralised service delivery;
• enhance local capacities, in particular of local governments and its key partners, for children’s rights
mainstreaming in local data collection, analysis, planning and budgeting;
• feed national level policy advocacy, dialogue and reforms through evidence, feedback and innovative
practices tested at local level.
Alternative approaches to targeting
Proxy means testing as promoted by International Finance Institutions
In Mongolia, IFIs have promoted and supported the Government of Mongolia to use proxy means testing to
identify the poorest households to provide them with welfare benefits such as Child Money programme and
food stamps.
The PMT approach is based on national household surveys, relying on self-reported household assets and
other indicators—or proxies—to estimate household wealth. These include easy to measure indicators such
as demographic characteristics (such as age of household members and size of household), human capital
characteristics (such as education of household head and enrolment of children in school), physical housing
characteristics (such as type of roof or floor), durable goods (such as refrigerators, televisions or cars) and
productive assets (such as land or animals). Based on this information, regression analysis is done to quantify
household wealth as a proxy for welfare. As et of proxies are given a weight which is then used to calculate
a score for each household. A cut-off point is established and households that fall below the threshold are
eligible for social protection programmes. The methodology and its proponents argue that “while individual
proxies may be weakly correlated with welfare, multiple proxies show stronger correlations”.
An evaluation of PMT in four countries found that the regression analysis is built on many errors, especially
when the PMT targets a very low levels of the population (low coverage). They found that “exclusion and
inclusion errors vary between 44% and 55% when 20% of the population is covered and between 57% and
71% when 10% is covered”. They explain that part of the reason for the poor correlation between proxy
measures and household consumption is that the data used comes from only one point in time and thus does
not represent the reality for most households. In addition, sampling errors, assumptions, and the quality of
the survey (and verification by enumerators of assets) all contribute further to inaccurate result. Other proxies
such as education level and person responding to the survey further complicate the results. Finally, and very
relevant for a country like Mongolia, PMT does not factor in recent crisis or shocks such as Zud (or even
minor ones within a family) that can make a family fall rapidly into poverty without suffering a related change
household characteristics and assets used as proxies making them ineligible for social protection benefits.
The study found that the PMT is “inherently inaccurate, especially at low levels of coverage, and it relatively
arbitrarily selects beneficiaries. It therefore functions more like a simple rationing mechanism that selects
some poor and non-poor but excludes large numbers of eligible poor from receiving benefits and support”.172
In Mongolia, the PMT is also criticised for similar inaccuracies. It should be noted however that the Child Money
programme has none-the-less been credited with lifting many out of poverty and contributing to the relative
wealth of Mongolia in recent years. This dichotomy poses questions for how the GoM, and its international
institutional donors should resolve such fundamental questions as how to find and reach the most at risk. What
is clear is that the based on results of the evaluation, the Proxy Means Test measurement (and administrative
data upon which some of the data is based), is sometimes not collected systematically, or objectively, and
has missed some of the poorest families within targeted aimags and districts. Experience from neighbouring

countries shows that such targeting might neglect needy populations and a Universalist approach to poverty
alleviation emerges as a viable solution.
Zero dose kids have multiple deprivation
UNICEF’s Equity Reference Group for Immunisation is exploring the use of Zero Dose children as a proxy for
identifying those that are most deprived in a community. This proxy offers an alternative targeting approach to
ensuring programmes are focused on those with greatest need.
Zero dose children live in the most
marginalized communities. Two thirds live
below the poverty line. They are likely to live
in communities with no regular health
services. As routine immunization is a first
step towards comprehensive primary
healthcare, zero dose children risk poor
health outcomes. For example, zero dose
children live in communities most likely to
generate outbreaks and are least equipped to
respond. Zero dose children are most likely to
suffer multiple deprivations,
EPI data is often the most accurate in countries given high rates of immunization and oversight of the programme
by ministries of health with the support of UNICEF and GAVI. By identifying zero dose children, by default, the
most deprived families are also identified and can be targeted for intervention. Zero dose children become a
proxy for the most deprived. The GTA can use zero dose children in their GFAs, for example, to support local
partners to better target the families and children in greatest need. Trade-offs and opportunities
UNICEF Mongolia’s GTA was similar to how targeting was done by UNICEF in China and Tajikistan with some
notable differences. While both considered the multiple deprivation levels of children in their selection of GFAs,
China took a strategic decision for an equity-based approach which informed their targeting and sequencing of
new focus areas over time. In Mongolia, targeting differed by actor. The GoM and the IFIs use PMT to identify
families that are most deprived to distribute welfare subsidies. UNICEF and others balance data-driven choice
of GFA using deprivation measures (at macro level, coupled with survey data by thematic area) against more
practical concerns around feasibility and other factors such as political commitment and the possibility to
demonstrate effectiveness of intervention strategies. Tajikistan has also balanced interests in their selection of
GFAs. UNICEF is currently discussing alternative approaches such as using zero-dose immunisation as a proxy
for multiple deprivation. This approach however will likely not be effective given the very high immunisation
rates in the country.
As shown in the model presented in the case study, overcoming data limitations is possible through high
resolution modelling of deprivation/poverty at aimag, and if data is available, at soum level. Decision however
are needed as to what indicator drive such models, and once complete, the principles by which GFA selection
will be made.
4. Observations and recommendations
• The two central functions of geo-targeting for UNICEF - selecting GFAs and thematic or micro-
targeting, should be re-conceptualised and a strategy built for each, supported by agreed reliable
databases and a nuanced analysis with structured discussion of trade-offs.
• Selection of aimags should be supported by analysis of nationally accepted definitions of deprivation,
such as MODA, using geospatial models of the highest resolution possible - at least at aimag level as
has been demonstrated in this case study - but with available data it may also be possible to estimate
a soum level poverty map. Mongolia has substantial and high-quality national databases including
130 | Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
census, surveys and HMIS. More work could be done to inform UNICEF on spatial deprivation for
future CPs, and such work could be shared and validated by other agencies too. Selection of districts
needs further work based on estimation of deprivation levels within UB.
• For selection of aimags or districts, GFAs should be selected based on impact to be achieved starting
with the highest deprivation areas or where mortality is highest. For micro-targeting within GFAs,
a universalist approach should be considered to provide engagement across all interventions. To
ensure all children receive the basic services they need, especially the most deprived, an equity
approach to delivery of a standardised package of interventions/programmes is needed – irrespective
of the ability to pay. This universalist rationale has the exception of interventions that need different
approaches based on climate and geography e.g. WASH. Itinerant populations need special attention.
After universal roll out, an expansion plan can be carried out for additional populations in phases
according to local area conditions.
• For those interventions that still require micro-targeting, the range of data options that have been
used, such as PMT and administrative data, should be the subject of a scoping study to assess quality
of data for poverty measurement at local level. Creating appropriate poverty dimension measures can
be based on MODA concepts, or an elaboration which is relevant for urban/ rural areas specificities.
Existing administrative data should be analysed to produce very local maps of poverty hotspots which
could be validated/ ground-truthed in one or two areas, then used as a tool across the country.

Case study 2: Review of UNICEF country programme strategy and impact on lo-
cal pro-child planning and budgeting
1. Overview
UNICEF engagement with both the LDF and social sector budgeting processes was explored. The LDF allows
much more local flexibility for budget allocations in favour of vulnerable children, and there is evidence (but
mixed) of positive impact on LDF allocations for children, but it was not possible to explore this rigorously.
The LDF regulatory framework also poses constraints to local pro-child spending, and its use to (co-)fund CFC
workplans. Local social sector budgeting is much more constrained by central policy and norms, such that even
improved local capacities could not alone greatly impact budget allocations for children. However, successes
were registered in changes to the policy framework in several areas. Opportunities were identified to enhance
impact on pro-child spending through more concerted advocacy for regulatory changes, more attention to
capital budgeting, exploring ways to use the performance contract framework for better pro-child service
delivery, for greater engagement with elected khurals, and for leveraging partnerships with other agencies and
projects.
2. Scope of case study
As This Case Study explores UNICEF CP activities to impact local government planning and budgeting patterns
and to direct more and better targeted spending in favour of children, and especially the more vulnerable. In
doing, the case study:

3. Introduction
UNICEF strategy as set out in the 2017-10 CP Strategy note suggests that the IBL 2011 brought in a substantial
degree of decentralisation of responsibilities and decisions to LGAs, and that the focus should be primarily on
building awareness and capacities of LGA officials around pro-child planning, budgeting and service delivery
issues. While the latter is certainly needed, the Strategy note did not seem to recognize that in practice there
is still very little decentralisation of responsibilities or budget decision power to local authorities.
Very limited decentralisation in practice
- Recurrent budgets for pro-child service delivery (salaries, supplies, etc.) are almost entirely funded
from special purpose transfers from which spending is highly constrained by central budget norms
issued by respective ministries and governed by performance contracts. Even budgets for the small
part of local pro-child spending financed from local revenues (‘base budgets’) is still reviewed and
adjusted by MoF.
- Capital budget spending decisions (e.g. for kindergartens, schools, etc. and around which geographic
equity concerns have been expressed174) are almost entirely on the state budget and decided by
sector ministries.
- Only the LDF allows genuine local decision-making flexibility at the local level for minor capital
investments (see also further below).
In fairness, subsequent UNICEF workplans and activities did recognise175 the need for engagement with central
ministries, especially around sector ministry guidelines and budget norms. But – as will be seen - where there
are such constraints on budgeting flexibility this suggests that local officials may not always have been able to
put to good use the enhanced awareness and capacities imparted to them. Similarly, unless these constraints
are addressed and greater local budgeting flexibility introduced, especially on the recurrent budget, the CFC
workplan strategy may prove to be too ambitious.
The strategy also appears at times to consider “local government authorities (LGAs)” as unitary bodies, with
the governors as leading authorities over local plans and budgets. However, local authorities in Mongolia
comprise two legally separate entities176: the Governor and the executive arm (itself divided between the
departments under the governor’s direct control, and the local sector offices who are primarily accountable
to the central ministries, esp. in regard to budgeting), and the elected khural which – in principle - is supposed
to review and approve (or question)177 governor’s budget proposals, then monitor spending and supervise the
management of facilities such as kindergartens.178 It is not clear how far the implications of this dual setup
were recognised in CP activities.
4. Local Development Fund Budgeting
The LDF is the most significant budget resource – and almost the only capital investment resource - over which
aimags and soums enjoy any local discretion and over which central government does not make adjustments
to locally-approved priorities. While there is little scope for citizen participation in social sector budgets,
participation in LDF planning is mandatory. For these reasons, UNICEF CP activities – especially around CFC
spending (see section C. below) – have necessarily placed great reliance on LDF budgets.
174 E.g. see ‘Pre-Primary Education in Mongolia’, World Bank, 2017
175 UNICEF staff respondents also certainly recognized the importance of central regulatory framework constraints on local flexibility.
176 LATUG 2006
177 Khurals certainly face capacity problems, party-political dysfunctionalities and other institutional constraints, but they do play a key
statutory role, and they do make changes to budget proposals. E.g. according to a KII from Nalaikh “… the khural approves about
80% of the LDF budget proposals” – suggesting that it may replace or change about 20%. Similar comments were made by some
other KIIs.

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
4.1. Context: the LDF mechanism
How it is financed. The LDF is a transfer mechanism to finance local investment spending, through 2 channels:
a) the General Local Development Fund (GLDF), allocated by formula, and also more recently b) specific
mineral-extraction-related revenues shared-back with areas of revenue origin (a fraction of all local areas). The
overall funding of the national LDF transfer mechanism, the allocation of these funds between local authorities
(at the aimag/capital city and soum/district levels), and the eligibility criteria for project funding, is stipulated
in the IBL – with several key changes to LDF provisions (under IBL Arts. 59 and 60) being introduced since 2011,
and notably: (a) frequent changes to the percentages of national revenues to be allotted to both components
of the LDF; (b) in 2017 (after the national budget crisis), a switch from the initial “at least 60%” share of GLDF
allocations to be allocated to the soum/district level, to an “at least 30%” share – this was also coupled with a
“netting out” of certain base spending from the gross aimag allocation, further reducing LDF funds available
for local investment at both levels by some 10%-20%.
At the same time, the decline in national mining revenues from 2014 (key national LDF funding source) led to
a sharp decline in LDF funding, which only began to recover from 2019.
Figure 24. LDF trends in overall aimag and soum allocations
This decline, and the other changes noted, have all posed major challenges to local authorities) and – for a
while at least – reportedly undermined local participation in the planning process. Figure 26. Child protection
SPTs of 4 GTAs, by thous.MNTFigure 27. LDF MNT per capita allocations across 330 soums, 2018
Figure 25. LDF MNT per capita allocations across 330 soums,
2018
At the same time, there is evidence of extreme disparity
in per capita allocation of LDF funds between soums.
This is in part due to the sharing of certain revenues by
origin, obviously favouring mining areas, but also due
to problems in formula-based allocation of the GLDF
by aimags to soums. This in turn greatly affects the
geographic equity of pro-child spending capacities
between localities.
How LDF projects are planned and approved. The annual planning cycle is spelt out in broad terms in the IBL
and more explicitly in the 2018 LDF Regulation.179
179 MoF LDF Regulation - Order No. 228, 2018
134 | Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
4 main steps in the annual LDF project planning process
1. By end 1st Quarter: Soum / district governors canvas project proposals from households
2. 2nd Quarter: These proposals are debated and prioritized by vote at meetings led by the bagh / khoroo
governor, and submitted to the soum / district governor
3. 2nd / 3rd Quarter: The incoming proposals are, in turn, screened and prioritised by an LDF taskforce
(comprising a few local officials plus often the bagh/khoroo governors) established by the soum
/ district governor, from where they are submitted either to the soum khural for final review and
approval (from the soum LDF budget) - or up to the aimag / MUB governor, if to be funded from the
latter LDF budget, in which case they are reviewed and prioritised by the aimag / MUB governors’ LDF
committee.
4. November/December: Separately, at their annual budget approval meetings, the aimag and the soum
khurals review, and may amend, and then approve those projects to be funded on their respective LDF
budgets.
Two key features are worth noting. Firstly, all proposals to be funded must emanate from citizen proposals –
the local executive is not allowed to submit its own proposals (although the process of course does allow for
some manipulation). Secondly, there is no limit to proposals which can be submitted from Steps 1 and 2. In
practice, the number and cost of proposals submitted to soum and aimag authorities annually for funding may
be 10-50 x more than can be funded from the LDF – so the prioritisation process (whereby 90%-98% of propos-
als are discarded) is critical. In this regard, the IBL and the LDF Regulation stipulate that priorities must reflect
both citizen’s votes and local policy priorities. In practice these two criteria can be hard to reconcile and are
interpreted differently in different localities – but very often the citizen vote criterion is the overriding factor
behind priorities selected (e.g. this is illustrated from Nalaikh LDF planning reports ranking project proposals
sent for approval to the khural by # citizen votes only).
4.2. UNICEF strategy: relevance and coherence
No explicit prior analysis of the LDF and problems inherent in the planning and financing mechanism was made
available other than a general view that priorities are made and approved without due regard for the needs of
children. It should be said, however, that evidence suggests that pro-children’s projects have been routinely
financed by the LDF since the start of the mechanism by all aimags and soums. Table 8 shows results of a
screening by MoF180 of LDF projects deemed to be pro-child, suggesting a not insignificant overall share (from
4%-12%) of LDF allocated for children, with numbers of pro-child projects fairly steady over the period,181 but
a declining trend in share of pro-child budget allocations.182
Table 8. Pro-child LDF allocation by all aimags
180 MoF budget report on LDF allocations for children 2016-19. It was not possible to obtain the filter criteria used by MoF nor to check
how systematically this was applied, but projects listed relate to kindergartens, school improvements, dormitory improvements,
parks and playgrounds, etc. Projects indirectly affecting children, such as water supplies, lighting, etc., were not included in the lists.
181 This suggests a trend to smaller pro-child projects. It should be noted that 2017 was an exceptional year when LDF budgets were
dramatically reduced after the national budget crisis, perhaps explaining the sharp drop in numbers, although interestingly not of
the value, of pro-child projects that year.
182 Which may in part be due to the fact that from 2018 aimags have had to allocate a part of their LDF allocations to certain local
‘base expenditures’ so have had less ’fiscal space’ for spending at their own discretion.
Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming | 135
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
The question then is how far UNICEF strategy has improved both the levels and the targeting of LDF allocations
for children. In practice, it appears that UNICEF’s main strategic focus has been:
- in some areas, reportedly, through engagement with Steps 1 and 2 whereby brochures and
sensitisation material were distributed to households to encourage a greater focus on pro-child
proposals at the start of the cycle (KII UNICEF, Nalaikh and Bayanzurkh);
- through general advocacy and training of a range of local officials around the importance of children’s’
priorities (hence indirectly for Step 3), and notably by pressing for a minimum level of 10% of the LDF
budget be assigned to child-related projects, and to priorities emerging from CFC planning; this was
also reportedly backed up by advocacy to governors from Cabinet Secretariat (KII UNICEF);
- and indirectly through the incentives inherent in the “co-funded” CFC workplans – whereby UNICEF
has injected “matching funds” equivalent to a substantial fraction of the aimag LDF budgets – see
section on CFCs below.
Conversely, there appears not to have been any more targeted support to the key actors in the LDF planning
cycle, namely: bagh/khoroo governors responsible for direct interaction with citizens and for convening the
bagh/khoroo meetings where priorities are initially voted (Step 2); the soum/district governors’ LDF committees
charged with screening and prioritising all proposals (and for discarding 90-98% of them) according to the
official criteria (Step 3); and elected khurals who review, possibly amend, and approve proposals at the end year
budget meeting. It is also not clear how far LDF planning support was provided across all soums (themselves
in charge of a substantial share of the LDF), rather than mainly (or only) to aimag officials. There was also no
reported engagement with MoF in regard to better clarifying the LDF regulatory framework (e.g. to encourage
a broader view of ‘LDF investments’ beyond hard infrastructure), nor around the current geographic equity
issues in LDF allocations, especially at soum level.
4.3. UNICEF strategy: effectiveness, impact and sustainability
Respondents generally indicated appreciation of support and greater awareness of children’s issues when
planning for the LDF. Several GFA aimags have also adopted resolutions committing to allocating > 10% for
children which are in some cases reportedly still in effect even after the end of UNICEF support, as in Nalaikh.
There were also reports of allocation of other budget resources (esp. reserve funds) to pro-child LDF projects.
However, the tangible measures of the effectiveness of UNICEF strategy are whether:
a) at Step 1 there are increased numbers of pro-child projects being proposed by citizens; and/or
b) at Steps 2 increased numbers of pro-child projects are being given higher priority by baghs/khoroos
as submission to the soum/district governor and/or
c) at Step 3 there are increased numbers (values) of pro-child projects being given higher priority for
submission to the khural; and/or
d) at Step 4, whether the khurals approve greater numbers (values) of pro-child projects for LDF funding.
The data was simply not available to properly assess a), b) or c). However, it is possible to make some assessment
of d), based on final project approvals on the LDF budget by the khurals. LDF-funded projects in the GFAs and
in Uvurkhangai (as ‘control’) were screened by 2 filters:
- Filter A – projects directly benefitting children, related to schools, kindergartens, general education,
dormitories, sports facilities, hot water supplies,
- Filter B – projects indirectly benefitting children: parks and playgrounds, latrines, streetlighting, water
supplies, electricity, health facilities.
Applying these filters to approved LDF projects in Nalaikh, we see a steady trend increase in shares of LDF
allocations for both filters until 2016. But data was not available to track trends after 2016, when UNICEF
ended it support, to see if this trend was sustained.
Turning to aimags, the Charts in Figure 19 below show the relative sizes of LDF budget allocations to projects
which are likely to directly benefit children (Filter A) and to those which will directly and also indirectly benefit
children (Filters A + B) in the 4 GFA aimags and in Uvurkhangai (control) aimag, over the period 2016-19 (some
136 | Evaluation of UNICEF Mongolia’s Geographic Targeting Approaches in Programming
EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
years’ data sets were missing for Khuvsgul and Govi-Altai).
Figure 31. Share of projects benefitting children in LDF budgets for GFAs and control aimag
In all years, projects directly benefiting children exceeded 10% of the LDF budget in all GFA aimags, with the
lowest point being in 2017 for both Bayankhongor and Khuvsgul, at 14% each, and the highest point in Govi-
Altai in 2016, at 85%. Obviously, adding in projects (Filter B) indirectly benefitting children significantly raised
these levels in all cases: to over 20% in Bayankhongor and Khuvsgul in 2017, and to 100% for Govi-Altai in
2016.183 However two points should be highlighted: (a) there are no obvious trend increases over the period in
the GFA aimags (though complete annual data may tell a different story);184 (b) critically, the control aimag itself
registers higher levels of pro-child projects (both direct and overall) than the GFA aimags, with the exception
183 A CFC report from Khuvsgul suggested 48% of the 2016 budget allocation as allocated to children - this compares to a 29% estimate
from this filtering of projects directly + indirectly benefitting children. This may well be due to the methodological limitations of the
Filter method, and/or perhaps a different interpretation of what constitutes a ‘pro-child’ project.
184 The same CFC report from Khuvsgul reports that pro-child LDF allocations were only 8.8% of the LDF budget in 2012, rising to 48.1%
in 2016 – which does indeed suggest a rapid increase over that period. Data were not available to substantiate this longer-term
trend.

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
of Govi-Altai for 2016 and 2017.
It is also important to examine pro-child budget allocation patterns from individual soum LDF allocations
within the aimags. Table 3 shows the variance in the percentage of projects directly benefitting children (Filter
A) across the 20 soums of Bayankhongor aimag. Over the 4-year period overall we see a mean allocation of
21%, and a median allocation of 15%, but with a wide range from 3% to 84% between minimum and maximum
allocations for projects directly benefitting children. These variance patterns are fairly steady from year to year.
Adding in projects indirectly benefitting children (Filter B) raises the mean and median levels, but the wide
range between minimum and maximum levels remains. These variance patterns across soums appear similar
for other aimags examined, including for Uvurkhangai (control). There is no reason to expect uniform pro-
child budget allocations across soums, but such wide variance is striking and relates to the earlier questions
about the extent of UNICEF engagement with soum and bagh authorities, rather than just at aimag level,
around LDF planning.
Table 10. Bayankhongor: variance of pro-child LDF spending at Soum
Bayankhongor: % Soum LDF allocations directly for children
2016-2020 2016 2017 2018 2019
MEAN 21% 14% 15% 19% 25%
MEDIAN 15% 5% 7% 9% 19%
MAX 84% 85% 77% 93% 82%
MIN 3% 0% 0% 0% 0%
On the surface, the evidence above – and especially comparison of GFAs with the control aimag - suggests that
UNICEF engagement may not have greatly impacted LDF allocation patterns in favour of pro-child spending.
But the limitations of this crude assessment are also recognized:
- there is of course no evidence on counterfactual budgeting scenarios in the GFAs, where pro-child
LDF allocations may perhaps have been even lower without UNICEF support.
- lack of data on numbers of LDF proposals through the various planning steps prevented clear analysis
of the extent to which UNICEF support may have increased numbers of pro-child projects and/or
increased expressed priorities by citizens, bagh/khoroo meetings or the LDF committees – but which
may then have been discarded at later steps in the process.
- inability to access complete local budget data meant it was not possible to systematically document
the extent to which other local budget resources (governors’ reserve funds, etc.185) were mobilized
to supplement the LDF in funding of pro-child projects – although this must necessarily have been
modest;
- the assessment is based on a crude filtering of project titles by name, which may have somehow
missed important LDF spending activities for children (although this flaw could apply equally to the
control aimag and so cancel out).
- most importantly, this assessment does not capture the extent to which pro-child LDF projects are
now of better quality or better targeted to vulnerable children, thanks to UNICEF support, than they
otherwise would be. This could only be explored through more in-depth field research.
185 There were certainly frequent reports of such local co-funding, but no data was available to systematically quantify this against LDF
funding. General evidence, however, suggests that any such co-funding would be very modest as compared to the relatively large
LDF allocations, and may only be forthcoming in ‘budget surplus’ aimags and soums, which enjoy greater discretion.

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
4.4. Local Development Fund: conclusions and recommendations for the future
As UNICEF has perhaps not always engaged directly with what are the real constraints to more effective pro-
child planning and budgeting from the LDF. Given the regulations governing LDF planning process there is a
limit to the effectiveness of general advocacy or even the issuing of resolutions stipulating 10% thresholds –
which can always be neglected or revoked with a newly elected local administration. Local officials are above
all concerned to comply with the LDF regulatory framework in a context where there is pervasive fear of central
government sanction. So, looking forward:
More targeted, practical support. While general training and advocacy has been important and appreciated,
there is also need for more targeted support to key stakeholders in the 4 step planning and prioritisation process
(bagh/khoroo governors and LDF committees), and for tools to facilitate the difficult task of prioritization (esp.
by the governors’ LDF committees) to ensure that pro-child priorities are given due weight alongside other
priorities, and can be reconciled with the other prioritization criteria mandated by law. At the same time,
greater clarity as to what does and does not) constitute pro-child investment spending would help to address
a widespread – and quite understandable - tendency by local officials (see many KIIs) to claim that all local
development spending is necessarily pro-child. Lastly, support to the khurals, who make the final amendment
/ approval of LDF budgets, would also be important – see also further below.
More systematic engagement with Soums. The LDF aimag (and UB) allocations are divided between the aimag
(and MUB) and their soums (districts) on a percentage basis. Until 2017 soums received at least 60% of the
allocations – this has now been formally reduced to at least 30%, though is often more than that.186 While soum
authorities may be influenced by aimag authorities in regard to LDF priority-setting, soum level LDF decisions
are taken separately (esp., but not only, where different parties control governorship and khural at the two
levels). Yet it appears that CFC workplans (see C. below), which stipulate local co-funding arrangements, are
only signed off between UNICEF and the aimag governor (and not the aimag khural). UNICEF should therefore
also consider engaging soum authorities in CFC workplan agreements to better ensure the chance of local co-
funding from the LDF.
Promoting clarity around eligible spending from the LDF. It emerged repeatedly that there is a widespread
view amongst local officials that ‘soft investments’ (in training and capacity building) are not eligible for LDF
funding, and hence a bias toward infrastructure investments, to avoid risk of sanctions from the National
Audit Office (NAO). Read closely, the LDF eligibility criteria (Art 60.3 of the IBL) do in fact seem open to such
investments, and indeed these are undertaken in some areas without problem,187 but the revised MoF LDF
Regulation specifies that LDF spending is not allowed for “current expenses, unless specified in article 60.11
of the law on the state budget”188 – which may be interpreted as a veto on many of the ‘softer investments’
proposed. It is important that UNICEF engage MoF around these issues, to urge that clearer guidance be
provided to local authorities on what is and is not eligible for LDF funding; similar engagement with the NAO
would also be important.
Advocacy for greater geographic LDF allocation equity. As noted, current soum LDF allocations pose serious
geographic equity concerns for LDF spending in general, and for pro-child LDF spending in particular. There is
scope for UNICEF to engage with MOF and other central government stakeholders around this issue to press
both for caution in further expansion of the mineral revenue-sharing component of the LDF (one major source
of disparity, although a politically sensitive topic), and also a review of the manner by which aimags make the
‘onward’ formula-based allocations of the soum share of GLDF allocations.
Seeking partnerships. In all of these areas there is scope for more active outreach by UNICEF to other partners
to take advantage of different institutional comparative advantages, e.g.: the Citizen Representative Khural
Project, managed by the Cabinet Secretariat, and supported by UNDP and SDC; the Sustainable Livelihood
Project (Phase 3), managed by MoF, and supported by the World Bank and SDC; the Urban Governance Project,
managed by MUB, and supported by SDC and The Asia Foundation.
186 Art. 59 of the IBL which specifies sharing arrangements was revised in 2017.
187 Indeed, almost all soums allocate MNT 5 million for Naadam activities every July – a very ‘soft investment’!

5. Social sector budgeting
5.1. UNICEF strategy: relevance and coherence
Despite the comments further above around the Strategy Note, the actual plans and activities adopted by
UNICEF, and views expressed by staff, did indeed reflect a much more realistic approach to addressing the
constraints at central as well as local level. UNICEF has engaged with social sector budgeting processes through
a combination of upstream and downstream strategies:
- Upstream advisory and advocacy activities with sector ministries concerning policy, guidelines and
recurrent budget norms. To that end, UNICEF has undertaken:
several analytic exercises to identify issues in local sector planning, budgeting and spending, for
o
example:189 a Health sector review (2015), which stressed the need for more equity, and for move from
input to performance budgeting; a WASH review (2016), which details fragmentation of institutional
responsibilities (esp. in UB), the mismatch in the capital and recurrent budget processes and allocations
and the negative impact on system repair and maintenance, the potential for using the LDF, and the
need too for more performance-based budgeting approaches. According to respondents, an initial
2018-20 work plan was prepared for upstream advisory and advocacy activities with quite ambitious
targets for revising national norms, but this was then scaled back.190
advocacy around the large Child Money Programme, a widely heralded mechanism, on central
o
government budget in operation since 2005, which some reviews have argued needs better targeting
to poorer children191. UNICEF issued an initial policy brief192 which argued for better cost-indexation
and the need to explore “forms of targeting which could sustain best the universal social protection
floor”; this was followed by a 2020 brief,193 further arguing for a change to targeting mechanism and
an end to what is seen as a cumbersome and ineffective Proxy Means Test methodology.
It is not clear how far concerns raised in other reviews of the social sectors fed into UNICEF advocacy – e.g. in
ECE, under-spending on school supplies essential to education quality, excessive out-of-pocket contributions
being asked by schools of parents in some areas to co-fund school meal and other costs, and geographic
inequities in kindergarten investments.194
- Periodic local awareness-raising and training across the GFAs, both in the application of national
planning and budget procedures and norms, as well as more generally on child friendly budgeting,
across all GFAs.
- Local piloting of innovations such as zero-based budgeting (ZBB) in 3 aimags and 19 soums.195
There was no reported engagement by UNICEF staff with stakeholders responsible for the sector performance
contract mechanism in these sectors nor with sector capital budgeting processes (by which, e.g., kindergarten
and school building decisions, key to child access to schooling or to major WASH systems, are made). 196
Lastly, while central budget norms allow little scope for local changes to the original social sector budgets, the
Khurals must approve annual budget revisions and also oversee management of social facilities and budget
execution by the executive.197 It is unclear to what degree UNICEF engaged with Khurals beyond training some
members in child friendly budgeting and possibly advocacy.
189 There was also a 2015 review of child protection funding arrangements, but this appeared to simply map out current processes rather than identify
areas for improvement.

5.2. UNICEF strategy: effectiveness, impact and sustainability
As some successes were registered from national advocacy, notably in increases to child protection spending.
Thus, MLSP has increased spending on child protection at central level and through a large increase in the
‘outreach’ component of the aimag SPTs for child protection, which rose 23 times nationally, from MNT 356
million in 2016 to MNT 8 billion in 2020, thanks to UNICEF advocacy with MLSP, based on a costing exercise
undertaken. Figure 20 shows the trend increase of this SPT component (for ‘group activities’ in blue) against
the rest of the SPT transfers, in the 4 GFA aimags. This trend increase also benefitted all other aimags.
Figure 32. Child protection SPTs of 4 GTAs, by thous.
MNT
There has also been central government
adoption of consolidated national WASH
guidelines, though it is unclear how far these
were then translated into changes to central
government investment planning criteria to
ensure adequate capital financing for WASH.
If it was intended that such investments be
funded from the LDF, it was not possible to
establish whether or how such guidance was transmitted to local officials charged with prioritization of LDF
projects.
More recently, thanks to UNICEF advocacy there has been an important revision to the kindergarten education
transfer budget norms allowing counting of non-resident children (a major issue in urban areas, but also in
certain aimag and soum ‘border areas’ where children cross to use more nearby, convenient facilities, not
necessarily in their own area of residence),198 although no data were available to substantiate this. There
was also reported success in changing the health sector budget norms for Soum hospitals to allow for greater
equity.199
It was also not possible to establish how effective the advocacy around changes to CMP targeting has been.
Local respondents generally expressed satisfaction with training received, although documentation attributing
improvements in pro-child budgeting processes or outcomes by government was inconclusive.200 Given the
general rigidity of budget norms (aside from the one or two areas that UNICEF was able to help change) it
would be hard to see how such training could result in any significant changes to budget allocation outcomes
regarding children. However, within the given budget constraints, they have hopefully contributed to more
efficient and better documented budget proposals being submitted upwards by local authorities, with greater
chance of approval. It would also hopefully have alerted local officials to their (limited) powers to change
approved budgets – an issue around which there is still much uncertainty and confusion.201 These basic
efficiency gains within the existing system would constitute important impact, although little evidence was
available to corroborate this. However, arguably, such ‘basic ‘training in PFM procedures’ may not be an area
where UNICEF has a special comparative advantage and might be better handled through routine support by
MoF and the sector ministries, perhaps with initial UNICEF Trainer of Trainer support and quality assurance, to
improve the quality of this support.
It is unclear if UNICEF provided support to local officials to help them assume the new budget responsibilities
for education-related ‘fixed costs’ assigned to them in 2018 – a change which may pose equity challenges (e.g.
between budget ‘surplus’ and ‘deficit’ areas) given the significantly varying levels of local revenues from which

200 KIIs from Bayankhongor, Govi-Altai, Zavkhan and Bayanzurkh generally expressing satisfaction, but no evidence was made available
suggesting changes to social sector budgeting outcomes as a result.
201 Budget rules allow school and kindergarten principals to make changes up to MNT 5 million, and soum / aimag governors up to MNT 10 million,
within the same budget category. However local KIIs reported this as an area of much uncertainty – this is also documented in ‘Understanding and
Monitoring Service Delivery in a Decentralizing Environment in Mongolia: The Case of Education and Health’, World Bank, 2015.

to fund such costs.
Regarding local piloting of zero-based budgeting (ZBB) local respondents202 generally expressed satisfaction
with this support, but others203 expressed doubts about introducing something so ambitious and possibly
unsustainable as ZBB or similar performance-based budgeting methods at this stage. No evidence was available
to make any further assessment.
5.3. Context: Social sector budgeting
As Under IBL 2011 (Arts. 39.1 and 61.1), budgeting responsibility for key social services has been ‘delegated’ to
aimags (and, partly also, from aimags to soums). Under this arrangement, central government each year
allocates SPTs to aimags for these services, from which local authorities spend on the delegated services. The
two education SPTs (for ECE and general education) are the main transfer, accounting for over 90% all SPTs.
Figure 21 shows the steadily rising trend for education for 4 GFA aimags. The other two main SPTs are for
primary health, and for child protection. SPTs are by far the main – indeed often the only - funding source for
these delegated services.204
All local recurrent spending from SPTs is very tightly regulated by ministry budget norms (e.g. for education,
specifying allowable spending levels ‘per student’ on different categories of expense, with coefficient variations
by geographic/urban-rural context, etc.); all local budget proposals for SPT spending are submitted to the
sector ministry where they are adjusted for consistency with these budget norms.205

204 In 2018, one category of education spending (utility and maintenance costs of kindergarten and school facilities – referred to as
‘fixed costs’) was switched to be a local ‘base budget’ responsibility, and hence to be financed from local own-revenues and deficit
transfers, and no longer from education SPTs. In principle this type of spending enjoys greater local discretion, but even these
budget proposals are submitted to MoF which will adjust them according to MoF considerations – e.g. of spending precedent.

As noted, SPTs cannot be used to finance capital investment spending in these sectors – this is almost entirely
on the state budget, to which local authorities may submit proposals but where decisions are made by central
ministries.207 The problems arising from lack of local decision-making power over social sector budgets, and
impact on service delivery equity and effectiveness, have been raised in several recent reviews.208
Each year, sector ministries stipulate a contract for the services to be delivered from these SPTs, signed off
with aimag governors; in turn, aimags usually (but not always) have similar contracts with soums. These are
reported209 to be key tools to monitor the level and quality of service delivery performance.
5.4. Social sector budgeting: conclusions and recommendations for the future
As highlighted, formal strategy did not appear to fully recognize that in practice there is still very little
decentralisation of responsibilities or budget decision powers. It also appears that while there were several
initial analytic exercises to explore policy framework issues and constraints, to inform programming, these
were conducted separately, outcome by outcome, such that an overall strategy for advocacy to reform local
government planning and budgeting across the social sectors does not emerge clearly. It is also not clear how
far UNICEF took on board the analyses of other donor agencies (noting that there may of course have been
legitimate disagreements) or aimed to work with them on these agendas in concerted advocacy. Looking
forward, there are some areas UNICEF may wish to explore:
Ensuring a clear baseline analysis of social sector financing and budgeting policy issues to be addressed across
sectors as basis for strategy, with an identification of those issues which may be addressed by general advocacy,
and those which may require initial local piloting of reforms as a basis for later advocacy.
Making strategic distinction between types of ‘local support activities’:
a) those which require introducing some form of local innovation or ‘pilot’ (as above). For these it would
be important to ensure advance central government buy-in to such pilot activities and their rationale
will also be key if lessons are to be taken up later on, to select GFAs where there is prior commitment
to implement them and also which provide representative context: e.g. in further pursuing revision
of sector norms (e.g. in general education or health) to allow inclusion of non-resident children it
may be useful to pilot mechanisms in those soums which are ‘border areas’ having to service non-
resident children. It will also be important to avoid embarking on pilots in activities – such as ZBB or
performance-based budgeting variants - which international experience have shown to be very hard
to manage and sustain without external support.
b) more routine general training and awareness raising. While there is clearly a role for UNICEF in
206 As issued in Government Resolutions 242 of 2016, and 450 of 2019.
207 Local aimag KIIs expressed some frustration with this arrangement, the lack of dialogue with central government around approved
priorities (esp. since locally submitted priorities can be changed) and the frequent interference of national MPs in the process.
208 E.g. see ‘Understanding and Monitoring Service Delivery in a Decentralizing Environment in Mongolia: The Case of Education and
Health’, World Bank, 2015.
209 KII, Policy makers

EVALUATION REPORT June 2021
local capacity building, it should engage in this with an eye to supporting an institutional mechanism
which will ensure its continuity. E.g. in the case of basic training in budget preparation processes
consistent with central budget norms, thought could be given to building up existing capacity outreach
mechanisms (via preparation of tailored modules, ToT, etc.) with MoF or sector ministry staff in the
aimags, National Academy of Governance staff (a major channel for training of local officials in public
administration) and specialised NGOs. This could allow UNICEF to withdraw from a ‘retail’ role in
areas not perhaps of its comparative advantage and focus more on upstream policy issues.
Explore scope for using the performance contract mechanism. This government mechanism could potentially
offer an entry point that UNICEF might exploit to encourage more pro-child service delivery by aimags and
soums. Engagement could be through:
a) dialogue with the sector ministries around the performance criteria in the agreements, and their
possible revision / development to ensure they take due account of service delivery performance for
children generally, and vulnerable groups in particular;
b) exploring ways to more effectively monitor actual performance against these agreements, to ensure
it is more than just a bureaucratic box-checking exercise. For example, UNICEF might pilot more
consultative local procedures to ensure a wider range of feedback in the monitoring. There may
indeed be scope to pilot incentives within such arrangements, e.g. by small budget increases to top-
performing aimags or soums.
Such engagement would need to be both around the ministry-aimag performance agreements, but also
(perhaps especially) with the aimag-soum agreements, an area which seems to be widely neglected.
Engage with local elected khurals. As noted, khurals play a key statutory role in review and approval of
governors’ budget proposals, and also – just as important but often ignored - in monitoring of actual spending
on service delivery by the executive branch.210 While central budget norms allow little scope for local changes
to the original social sector budgets, the khurals must approve annual budget revisions, monitor budget
execution and also oversee management of social facilities and assets (such as kindergartens, clinics, youth
clubs, parks).211 UNICEF could explore the scope for broader outreach and support (e.g. budget literacy or
service delivery monitoring) to the khurals. This could be direct, or through partnerships, e.g. with the UNDP/
SDC Citizen Representative Khural Project, managed by the Cabinet Secretariat.
6. Child-friendly Community Workplans and Budgets
As Having outlined issues around the LDF and social sector financing and budgeting, it is useful to explore now
financing issues around the CFC workplans and budgets. Some partial workplan budget data was obtained,
with the most complete set for Zavkhan, from 2017-21. Two of the workplans and budgets were for 2 years,
and one just for one year. Activities in these workplans seem to be primarily related to training, consultation
workshops, capacity building, development of plans, etc.
It is not clear what local co-funding sources were envisaged for these workplans. While the levels of local
budget spending look substantial, as highlighted above local budget resource flexibility is highly constrained
and so the LDF is really the only sizeable budget resource which could be used (aside from very minor resources
where there is a governor’s reserve fund, or where local NGOs may be willing to co-fund).
Expenses in the CFC workplans are mainly non routine expenditures on ‘soft investments’ of the sort which
should be in principle fundable from the LDF – although the present unclarity in the LDF Regulation can make
this problematic (see further above). Conversely, it is very hard to see how they might be funded from
the special purpose grants for which budget norms allow spending only on standard routine operating costs.
However, funding from the LDF poses two challenges: firstly, according to the LDF regulatory framework, such
activities would need to originate in citizens’ proposals, and emerge as top priorities from the annual planning
process; secondly, they would of course need to be affordable.

The Table below shows the total costs of activities in each workplan, and the funding sources: (a) committed
funding (which is assumed to be only from UNICEF, since no details of local funding commitments were shown)
and (b) the funding gap, which it was hoped would be covered from local financing sources.
No complete details were available as to how far this expected local co-funding was forthcoming for Zavkhan.
However, as a measure of likely affordability and sustainability, the expected co-funding requirements
were compared to the gross212 LDF allocations (total, and then the aimag and soum shares) for those years.
Distinguishing the aimag share of the gross LDF allocations is important because it appears that workplans
were only agreed with aimag authorities, not with soum authorities who are responsible for their own shares
of the LDF allocations. Thus, we see that, even if such workplan activities emerged as priorities through the
LDF planning process, there are financing challenges:
a) Expected co-funding levels were equivalent to from 6%-13% of total LDF allocations, but to 11%-
21% of the gross aimag share of those allocations. In other words, co-funding of workplans from
LDF resources would require allocation of a significant share of local LDF resources, and – since LDF
funding levels are fixed - sizeable switching from other local priorities, which may pose problems. Of
course, while UNICEF is providing such substantial funding to the workplan, aimags may see strong
incentives to set aside part of their LDF allocations to co-fund the workplan, if this is seen as key to
attracting the much greater volume of external funds to the aimag.
b) Overall workplan costs were equivalent to from 17% to 52% of gross aimag LDF allocations, but to
from 30% to 84% of the gross aimag share of those allocations. Therefore, continuation of workplan
activities at the present levels and costs after UNICEF exit would obviously require a much greater
allocation – requiring indeed almost the entirety of the aimag LDF allocation to be deployed to pro-
child spending. This looks infeasible.
Going forward UNICEF should consider:
- Reviewing the types of CFC activities to be funded to ensure that they are likely to be of broad
community benefit and thus more likely to be voted as priorities.
- Exploring the ‘sizing’ of annual CFC plans and budgets around realistic assessments of likely future
local budget resource availability.
- Engaging soums more systematically given their control over a substantial share of the LDF allocations.
212 Gross allocation because a part of the total is pre-empted by deduction of certain base expenditures, reducing the net LDF resources
for local discretionary spending.

UNICEF Staff
Purpose: The most important points of this interview with UNICEF staff is to find out whether UNICEF support is
reaching the most vulnerable in the areas where they work. The results of this evaluation will help UNICEF plan
internally and with the government, how to improve their support over the coming years
Logistics:
• Duration between 60-90 min
• 1 main interviewer, 1 note taker
• Have informed consent signed and get personal information (name, organization, gender, age) for
participant list
Introduction:
• Introduce yourself, present the evaluation and also present the main purpose of the interview, that is,
why it is important to have an interview with the informant.
• Explain confidentiality aspects as well as how the responses of the interviewee will be treated and
processed on the basis of what it is stipulated in the UNEG evaluation standards.
Introduction (in full):
UNICEF provides support at the national, provincial and community level through their implementing partners
including local government authorities to strengthen services and support for the most vulnerable children
and their families. To ensure the support reaches the most vulnerable, they TARGET their support to specific
Aimags and districts. Within programmes, such as education and health, they also try to target the most
disadvantaged children and families. Together, these two approaches make up UNICEF’s Geographical
Targeting Approach.
UNICEF also uses this approach to select where in Mongolia they work. During the period 2012-2016 they
worked in Khuvsgul Aimag and Nalaikh District. In the current period of 2016-2021, UNICEF works primarily in
Govi-Altai, Zavkhan, Bayankhongor Aimags, and Bayanzurkh Districts.
This interview is part of an evaluation of precisely UNICEF’s geographic targeting approaches that aim to
ensure their support is reaching the most vulnerable in Mongolian society. The results of this evaluation will
help UNICEF plan internally and with the government, how to improve their support over the coming years.
Everything we discuss today will remain private. Your name will not be associated with your responses and all
data will be anonymous. We will not share what you say with anyone, so please be honest and tell us what you
really think about these issues. Your responses will help UNICEF to improve their programming and support,
and ensure their future work continues to be strategically targeted.
Please feel free to answer only those questions you are comfortable with. With your permission, we would like
to tape the interview to allow the interviewer to go back and check their notes to be sure they did not miss
anything. Once the notes are verified, the tapes will be destroyed.

INTERVIEW PROTOCOL / GUIDE
Policymakers
Purpose: The most important points of this interview with policymakers is to find out whether UNICEF support is
helping national actors to reach the most vulnerable in the areas where they work. The results of this evaluation
will help UNICEF plan internally, and with the government, how to improve their support over the coming years
Logistics:
• Duration between 60-90 min
• 1 main interviewer, 1 note taker
• Have informed consent signed and get personal information (name, organization, gender, age) for

why it is important to have an interview with the informant.
• Explain confidentiality aspects as well as how the responses of the interviewee will be treated and
processed on the basis of what it is stipulated in the UNEG evaluation standards.
Introduction (in full):
UNICEF provides support at the national, provincial and community level through their implementing partners
including local government authorities to strengthen services and support for the most vulnerable children
and their families. To ensure their support reaches the most vulnerable, they TARGET their support to
specific Aimags and districts. Within programmes, such as education and health, they also try to target the
most disadvantaged children and families. Together, these two approaches make up UNICEF’s Geographical
Targeting Approach. They also use this approach to select where in Mongolia they work. During the period
2012-2016 they worked in Khuvsgul Aimag and Nalaikh District. In the current period of 2016-2021, they
have selected to work primarily in Govi-Altai, Zavkhan, Bayankhongor Aimags, and Bayanzurkh Districts. This
interview is part of an evaluation of precisely UNICEF’s geographic targeting approaches that aim to ensure
their support is reaching the most vulnerable in Mongolian society. The results of this evaluation will help
UNICEF plan with the government, how to improve their support over the coming years.
