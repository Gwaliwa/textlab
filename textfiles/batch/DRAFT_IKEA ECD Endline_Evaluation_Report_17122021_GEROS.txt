EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context
Early childhood (till 6 years of age)1 is a critical period that affects the holistic development of an individual
and determines their ability to reach their optimum health, social, and economic potential.
Comprehensive development and well-being of children in the 0-6 years age group is strongly
interconnected with long-term outcomes of completing school education and learning levels, better
livelihood opportunities, and mental health.
In India, according to Census 2011 data, there are 164.48 million children in the age group 0-6 years. While
significant progress has been made with regard to maternal and child health over the past decade - infant
mortality rates (IMR) are down to 28.3 per 1000 live births in 20192; the under-five mortality rates (U5MR)
have decreased to 37 deaths per 1,000 live births in 20193; maternal mortality rates have fallen to 145 per
100,000 live births, much more remains to be done. In addition to country wide variations, even within
states, some groups are more vulnerable than others; infant mortality rates for rural children are up to
1.5 times higher than their urban counterparts.
In response to the twin challenge of providing pre-school non-formal education and breaking the vicious
cycle of malnutrition, morbidity, reduced learning capacity and mortality, the Government of India (GOI)
rolled out the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme in 1975, for children in the 0-6 years
age group, pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls.
Introduction to the project
“Spaces for kids to be kids” is a project supported by the IKEA Foundation to improve the early
development of children in two states of India – Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, initiated in August 2017, in
a partnership with the Department of Women and Child Development. The project adopts a ‘system-
based approach’4 and utilizes the platforms available within the ICDS system to reach caregivers.
The project’s strategic thrust was on building the capacity of the frontline workers primarily the Anganwadi
workers (AWWs) and the Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) to effectively support
parents/caregivers in improving care of children and to support early learning at the household level. The
strategic components of the project included the development of training materials and communication
packages on parental care; building the capacity of the frontline functionaries (AWWs and ASHAs), which
includes training and on the job support to enhance their knowledge, attitude and perceptions on
parenting care; and use of such learning through various platforms for quality counselling and interaction
with the parents/caregivers.
The IKEA Foundation funded project aimed that both boy and girl child have equal access to services for
early childhood care and education, ensuring all girls and boys survive, thrive and develop to their fullest

the delivery of quality services including counselling of parents through existing platforms of ICDS; leveraging the ongoing government programmes
such as Poshan Abhiyaan, Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK), Home Based Young Child Care (HBYC) and strengthening early childhood
education under the umbrella of the ICDS programme

potential. The project interventions also emphasized the involvement of fathers and other caregivers in
the family (besides mothers) in child-care and learning.
Evaluation Purpose, Objectives of the evaluation, geographic coverage and scope
The purpose of the endline evaluation was to assess and draw lessons from the ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’
project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan (2017 – 2020) assessing its relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and
sustainability according to OECD/DAC criteria. The evaluation aimed to assess the project in terms of
promoting early learning in homes, achievement of the intended objectives, gender and equity
perspectives as well as utilization of available resources and timely implementation. The evaluation was
conducted in four districts5 of Maharashtra and two districts6 of Rajasthan. The evaluation scope was to
review existing literature on parenting and ECD, conduct quantitative survey with FLWs (AWWs & ASHAs),
conduct Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) & In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) with key stakeholders, FLWs and
caregivers, and document key lessons learnt. The evaluation took place from Feb 2020 – March 2021. The
primary intended audience include Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and UNICEF, and the
secondary audience include Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), caregivers (mothers/fathers/
family members), and donor agencies, other UN agencies, CSOs/NGOs.
Brief Methodology
The endline evaluation employed ‘mixed-methods approach’. Both the ‘qualitative’ and ‘quantitative’
methods and tools were applied for data collection. The quantitative line of evidence constituted – FLW
survey, and qualitative line of evidence constituted – KIIs with stakeholders, IDIs with FLWs, IDIs with
parents/caregivers and case-studies.
Given the nature of the current project, a pre-post evaluation design (comparing baseline and endline
outcomes) was utilized as there was no possibility of selecting a suitable control group for this evaluation
(for a quasi-experimental design). Due to COVID-19 circumstances, the evaluation team collected all the
required primary data remotely (via phone survey). The change in strategy to collect the data remotely
called for adapting the methodology in terms of – trimming down the FLW quantitative survey, replacing
FGDs with IDIs for caregiver interviews, dropping direct observations and including questions/themes in
qualitative guides which were dropped from FLW quantitative survey questionnaire. For the quantitative
FLW survey, in total 1234 FLWs (AWWs & ASHAs) were interviewed (642 in Maharashtra and 592 in
Rajasthan). For the qualitative assessment, 54 Key-Informant Interviews (KIIs) with stakeholders, 58 IDIs
with FLWs (34 AWWs and 24 ASHAs), and 42 IDIs with parents (21 mothers and 21 fathers) were conducted.
The evaluation was supervised by the Evaluation Reference Group (ERG).
Key findings
Relevance: Discussions revealed that while a majority of the parents are able to fulfil needs related to
nutrition, health and hygiene, gaps exist in the knowledge and practices regarding other important aspects
of early learning and responsive parenting. To bridge this gap, frontline workers are acting as an important
communication channel to disseminate vital information to the communities. Being residents of the same
villages enables them to interact freely with families, providing requisite information.
Evaluation findings reveal that regular interactions and discussions between the caregivers and FLWs have
contributed to a rise in the caregivers’ knowledge about early learning, stimulation, and childcare with a
gradual shift towards the adoption of right parenting practices. Findings also reveal increased

participation of other caregivers in the household like the grandparents, uncle/ aunts, and elder siblings
in the meetings and events organized by frontline functionaries.
The evidence suggests that the training provided to FLWs has contributed in improving their knowledge
and practices on responsive parenting and ECD, and counselling skills. Discussions with caregivers and
FLWs provide evidence on improvements in FLW-caregiver interactions with a rise in duration and depth
of discussions in terms of content and engagement during the meetings and home visits. Increased
collaboration between the ASHA and AWW (especially in Maharashtra) further improved the quality of use
of the meeting platforms.
The intervention targets regions with high marginalized and/or tribal/rural population, making the gender
and equity guidelines developed relevant to these areas. The communication material subtly highlights
the gender and equity concerns. Evidence suggests that the trainings have contributed in building the
confidence and skills of the frontline workers to interact with the caregivers (both male and female) about
the importance of gender equality (rearing girl and boy child and involvement of fathers).
One of the main objectives of the project is to enhance the role of fathers in their child’s upbringing. The
quantitative findings show an increased percentage (although still low) of FLWs organizing fathers’
meetings from baseline to endline in both the intervention states. Even so, frontline workers continue to
face challenges while counselling fathers of children and only minimal progress has been made in this
regard.
Further, the FLWs made efforts to reach out to all members of the community (paying regular home visits,
assisting in implementing the learnings and encouraging to attend meeting at the centre), especially the
vulnerable groups and those located in remote areas. In some regions in Rajasthan, FLWs travelled in
groups of 2-3 through the mountainous region to reach out to families in remote regions. The use of local
materials for play activities taught to caregivers ensured their applicability to families from all backgrounds
and economic strata.
The project’s relevance is also evident in its alignment and complementarity with other government
programmes and schemes in the two states. The early learning activities for children have been drawn
from already existing state ECE curriculums (such as AAKAR in Maharashtra). The project’s activities
complement the efforts of the ICDS programme by bringing in components relating to learning and
stimulation even among the 0-3 age group, which had been previously ignored.
Effectiveness: In the quantitative survey, more than fourth-fifth of AWWs (83.2%) and more than half of
ASHAs (55.3%) in Maharashtra and about half of AWWs (46%) and a quarter of ASHAs (23%) in Rajasthan
reported that they received training on positive parenting and ECD.
Qualitative interactions with FLWs revealed their satisfaction with the quality of training on responsive
parenting and care covering aspects such as content, structure and medium of delivery. Similarly, in the
quantitative survey, FLWs commonly reported liking the provision of new information, information
supplementing their job performance and helping in refreshing skills &knowledge on parenting and ECD.
The FLWs were able to gauge the needs of the family and deliver context-specific messages; they have
built positive relationships with the caregivers and become known figures in their communities. Although
there was a slight improvement in the interactions of the FLWs with the fathers, they continued to face
challenges in promoting fathers’ involvement in childcare and development.
The FLWs mostly attributed the improvements in KAP to the training sessions they attended, the expertise
and support of the master trainers/supervisors, and the communication materials provided. They also
expressed the desire for more training in new areas such as innovative games and techniques of playing
with child to promote cognitive development and health and hygiene.

About three-fourth of AWWs and more than half of ASHAs in Maharashtra, and about half of AWWs and
slightly more than a quarter of ASHAs in Rajasthan reported that they received the communication
material as well as training to use the material to counsel parents on responsive parenting and ECD. About
50% of ASHA and AWW in Rajasthan and 65-70% of the FLWs in Maharashtra rated the communication
material as being ‘very useful’ in counselling the caregivers on responsive parenting and ECD. The FLWs
perceived that the communication material made their job easier acting as a visual aid to explain difficult
messages in an easy-to-understand manner to the caregivers. The review of the communication material
also found the messages being sensitive towards gender and equity concerns, reflecting its inclusive
nature. It was also observed that inclusion of children with disabilities in the communication materials
does not come across explicitly, though it has been addressed in trainings.
Both the quantitative and qualitative findings suggest that home visits and parents’ meetings were the
most effective platforms to reach the caregivers besides palak melawas, vaccination day, nutrition day,
Annaprashan divas7 and Godhbharai8. Frontline workers sometimes used panchayats and village school
teachers’ help to deliver gender-related messages. To encourage fathers’ participation and build rapport
with them, frontline workers suggested organizing customized meetings and counselling sessions for men.
For the more vulnerable sections, frontline workers felt that repeated counselling with patience and
kindness yielded positive results. Use of digital platforms such as WhatsApp were also noted as a
convenient strategy to remain connected with families located in the more remote regions (although
network issues persist).
FLWs also reported some challenges in effectively transferring the learnings to parents/caregivers –
orthodox mindsets of the villagers, lower participation in interior areas (especially in Rajasthan), busy
schedule and other commitments of the caregivers, lower education levels of the community and long
distances for FLWs to travel in hilly/ mountainous areas.
The project also faced some challenges in its implementation including convincing government officials,
interruptions in the training sessions due to data request from government officials, training fatigue
among FLWs, lack of time for ECD activities during vaccination drives or routine immunization activities
and supervisor vacancies in remote regions to name a few. Timely corrective action was taken to overcome
these challenges – extra attention was given to FLWs who needed additional support during the training
sessions, skipping ECD training in months when other sessions were being conducted to prevent training
fatigue, filling the vacancies of supervisors by block coordinators or ASHA facilitators among others.
Efficiency: The efficiency of the project is reflected in its sensible use of the existing government
systems/platforms to implement the project’s activities. In both states, the project leveraged and made
use of the ICDS government platforms for both capacity building of the frontline workers and counselling
of the caregivers. The Anganwadi centre and the network of AWW and ASHA workers took centre stage in
the project’s implementation. The sector meetings were used for training the FLWs in Rajasthan and in
Maharashtra a separate training day in a month was allotted for the training. Home visits, mothers’/
parents’ meetings and community-based events (Annaprashana diwas, Godbharai etc.) were used for
counselling the parents. In Rajasthan, the use of sector meeting as a training platform for the frontline
functionaries contributed to the operation of the project even under budget constraints. However, utilizing
sector meetings for trainings had some constraints – often more time being consumed for administrative
tasks during sector meetings with less time remaining for training. The project contributed to expanding
the frequency and extent of use of the available platforms in terms of regularity of meetings, participation
of caregivers, content of the meeting, practical demonstrations etc. The ICDS supervisor visits also
witnessed improvements in the level of engagement of the supervisors with both the FLWs and the

caregivers in terms of supervisor paying regular visits to AWCs, prioritizing the visits during days when
community meetings are conducted by AWWs and joining FLWs to home visits to support them during
counselling to caregivers at home.
Sustainability: There is consensus among the stakeholders regarding the scalability of the project to
other districts within the intervention states and other states in the country, with all components of the
project (including the incremental learning approach) scaled up together to produce favourable outcomes
in childcare and development.
There is a consensus among the UNICEF staff members on prior involvement of the government ministries
and bureaucrats from the beginning aiding in effective implementation of the project. The project should
be included in the annual work plan of the government and responsive parenting should be a part of the
policy agenda so that it becomes mainstream in terms of government initiatives.
The project’s sustainability and scalability is reflective in its system-based approach focusing on utilizing
the existing government infrastructure and human resource in place. Capacities of the AWWs and ASHAs
were built by leveraging the existing frontline human resource of ICDS and health departments. The
project’s sustainability, however, is dependent on numerous factors namely the government’s uptake of/
commitment to the project, continuation of the supportive and appreciative enquiry environment9 for the
FLWs created by UNICEF with the support of CSO partners, and regular refresher training for both the
FLWs and parents and the support of the district and block-level government officials.
One of the major challenges was to get the attention of the officials at the administrative levels and the
policy levels towards the important role played by ECD in childcare. Some other challenges reported were
– variability in the educational qualifications of the frontline workers across districts and states, and ASHA
workers not getting compensation for the travel and expenses incurred in the training process.
Finally, it is important to highlight that the intensity of support ( provided by the CSO partners) that is
provided to the pilot project such as adept trainers, comprehensive training content, frequent training
cycles, mentoring and monitoring support to FLWs will be difficult to replicate if it is scaled up to other
districts and states, potentially hampering the outcomes that have been seen in the pilot phase. Thus,
there is a need to make the project less resource-intensive either by reducing the number of training cycles
or by using digital platforms like videos or by conducting online training sessions. In addition to this, having
a block coordinator and a district official to take the project forward will ensure its smooth implementation
and scalability.
Conclusions
The evaluation team has drawn conclusions from the key findings according to the research questions
that guided the evaluation.
Relevance: The project has demonstrated its relevance in building the capacities of frontline functionaries
(AWWs and ASHAs) on responsive parenting to achieve the goals of ECD to ultimately reach the caregivers
in the community. The FLWs were equipped with the what, why and how of responsive parenting
messaging through regular trainings, continuous monitoring and handholding. The project’s relevance
further gains strength given that responsive parenting is relatively a new area in the Indian context.
The project addressed the most pressing needs of parents regarding child development and care and
enhanced their understanding of different ECD aspects. FLWs were also gender-sensitive in organizing
9During the project, UNICEF via support from CSO partners strived to foster an environment of supportive and appreciative enquiry. FLWs were
encouraged to freely express their needs in terms of support for training, handholding support required or any other specific support needed which
ultimately contributes to improving their knowledge and counselling skills.

suitably timed meetings specifically for fathers and utilized innovative engagement methods e.g. the
blackboard painting task outside their homes for children. Although still on the lower side, the emerging
role of father as a parent who interacts, and plays is an encouraging improvement. In fact, some fathers
have emerged champions for responsive and pro-active parenting for their children, inspiring others.
Effectiveness: The evidence suggests that the project, as a pilot, has been largely effective in – a) building
the skills and capacities of the FLWs on responsive parenting and care, b) utilizing the available institutional
platforms to reach out to caregivers. Evidence suggests that the trainings not only built FLW’s
communication skills and confidence, but also equipped them with necessary skills for improved
information dissemination. However, lower proportion of ASHAs (55.3%) in Maharashtra and AWWs (46%)
and ASHAs (23%) in Rajasthan reported to have received the training on positive parenting and ECD,
suggesting further efforts.
FLWs were able to use the communication materials/tools in communicating with parents at the various
platforms effectively. The FLWs perceived that the communication tools made their jobs easier, acted as
effective visual aids to explain difficult messages and eased the language barrier.
Gender and equity-based concepts are integrated in the communication package material with clarity and
seamlessness. It breaks the gendered roles and responsibilities, toys, communication and activity
engagement uses gender-neutral language (English) e.g. their/them/they/child/children.
At the child level, frontline workers have observed the advent of some positive changes, albeit small, in
child health, hygiene, education and discipline due to increased knowledge levels of parents and frontline
workers.
However, the intervention was partly effective in reaching out to fathers due to reasons such as lack of
availability, migrant nature of jobs, orthodox mindsets, lack of awareness, and illiteracy. Findings reveal
that majority of men considered childcare and parenting outside their domain and were unware of their
responsibilities as fathers. It is critical to engage fathers as well as other family members in the responsive
parenting sessions to ensure a more supportive system for the mother and child at home.
Home visits and parent Anganwadi meetings were found to be the most effective platforms to reach
caregivers for counselling. Other platforms such as mother’s/father’s meetings, palak melawas, school,
hospital and temple premises, and community centres were also utilized. The enhanced utilization of
existing platforms by frontline workers to orient caregivers are in line with the reconstructed theory of
change.
Efficiency: The evaluation provides evidence on the efficiency of the parenting project in terms of utilizing
the available government resources – human resource, infrastructure and institutional platforms such as
mothers’/ parents meeting, home-visits, community-based events.
Although the utilization of sector meetings for trainings in Rajasthan was an efficient way of using available
government platform, often the issue of lack of time for training of FLWs cropped up due to administrative
duties to be rendered. In Maharashtra, instead of sector meetings, separate training sessions were
conducted for master trainers and FLWs, with a minimal cost to the system and was found to be more
effective as FLWs were able to concentrate and learn better.
Sustainability: There is consensus among stakeholders (district and state government officials , UNICEF
staff members, and CSO partners) that the intervention is scalable to other blocks/ districts in the two
states given the project’s utilization of existing government human resource, infrastructure and platforms,
and the positive reception of training by the FLWs. Efforts are being made at the block, district and state
levels to integrate ECD into their existing working framework, ensuring its sustainability.

Further, for more sustained results, some potential issues need to be addressed – enhanced coordination
between ICDS and health department, more frequent and regular refresher trainings for FLWs, providing
travel allowance for ASHAs, and re-adjusting the training schedule to cover the critically required contents
within less time. Another potential challenge which was addressed well in Maharashtra and should be
used as a case study is the teaming up of Anganwadi worker and ASHA (for trainings and joint visits).
Another critical observation is the lack of continuation of the intensity of support provided to the pilot
project in its scale up, that can have consequences on the intended outcomes necessitating making the
project less resource-intensive.
In sum, the evaluation findings indicate that the supportive resources and structures need to be adjusted
for scale-up and the intervention needs to be further institutionalized in the planning processes. The
project efficiently and effectively makes use of the existing government resources and supplements and
compliments the government ECD initiatives. The project should be streamlined in both the policy agenda
and the annual work plan of the government, ensuring that the project’s domain becomes mainstream in
government initiatives. Tackling of coordination issues with Ministries and Departments will also support
project scale-up.
Lessons learnt
The evaluation has highlighted several learnings that will inform the scaling up of the model in other
blocks/ districts in the two intervention states and designing similar interventions.
a) Leveraging of existing resources from government schemes/ programmes/ initiatives and
empowering frontline functionaries continues to be the mainstay of the project replicability and
scalability: Leveraging of existing government human and infrastructure resources effectively and
efficiently and through strong project components is already resulting in plans afoot to scale to other
districts. There is readiness and need in the system to adopt and adapt the project on a wider scale.
The inclusive approach of involving officials from different levels has supported in implementation of
the project.
b) UNICEF’s continued advocacy, availability of technical support and commitment on the part of the
Government stakeholders have resulted in increased acceptance of the project by the Government
of Maharashtra (GoM) and Government of Rajasthan (GoR) and must continue: The project’s strong
acceptance at the government level is reflective in Maharashtra’s decision to expand project activities
to other districts in the State as well as Rajasthan’s plans for distribution of communication packages
across the state in the upcoming year/s. UNICEF has played a critical role in the transition of the
parenting project into a state-level policy, engaging regularly with ICDS and health departments for
policy advocacy. It has also provided high-level technical assistance to the states in the form of training
of master trainers, frontline functionaries, developing communication packages, training content etc.
Further, a good learning is that committed government stakeholders will augment the impact further.
c) Collaboration between ICDS and Health departments in Maharashtra has amplified the results: The
collaboration between the government departments (ICDS and health) has improved the synergies
and the joint trainings under the project led to an amalgamation of the activities and improved their
capacities.
d) The FLW’s and Supervisors knowledge, attitude and perceptions (KAP) are likely to be sustained if
capacity building around responsive parenting and better work conditions are ingrained in the
system: Some positive results of the intervention such as the positive change in the knowledge,
attitude, and perceptions (KAP) of FLWs around childcare and parenting, ability to use the available
platforms better or supervisor’s capacity built as trainer thereby creating a cadre of skilled human
Page|21
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
resource from within the system are sustainable only if the capacity building of the frontline workers
is ingrained in the system, and a platform for constant support and engagement is maintained.
However, FLW’s are poorly compensated, overworked, not given travel expenses or allowances and
are drawn into all ground activities continually hence making their job extremely demanding on skill
and will with missing job satisfaction and security. Thus, work conditions need to improve and be
systemic if the intervention has to create impact at scale.
e) Efforts to engage parents – both mothers and fathers and other caregivers is of utmost importance
to create a familial support and ownership for ECD: Efforts to educate and improve engagement of
fathers and other caregivers including elders in the family to change social norms around parenting
and childcare is a good strategy to build a supportive system for the mother and child at home and
for the child to receive continued responsive care.
f) Including fathers in the childcare remains a challenge: Despite best efforts of the project, involving
fathers in childcare remains a challenge, requiring concerned efforts from government, UNICEF and
development partners.
Recommendations
Recommendations for UNICEF
a) Continue technical assistance to the Governments on responsive parenting and ECD as they scale up
and replicate in other districts [immediate and on-going]
UNICEF should continue its engagement with the Government of Maharashtra (GoM) and Government
of Rajasthan (GoR), providing technical assistance in the following areas:
• Liaising with the state level officials from ICDS and health departments to support in strengthening
monitoring and review systems
• Updating/ re-structuring the training modules on responsive parenting and care
• Training of trainers (master trainers)
• Process documentation
• Preparing policy briefs on importance of parenting and child development
• Any other activity identified in consultation with GoM and GoR
b) Sustained efforts to encourage the involvement of fathers and family members beyond the mother
in responsive parenting [immediate]
Sustained efforts are required at the community level to increase the participation of fathers and
families in responsive parenting. Separate sessions for fathers are warranted given the tendency of
mothers to speak freely in sessions without male members, and/or the sessions for fathers can be
presented as something especially for men, to avoid any perceived stigma of being involved in
"female" activities.
Innovative strategies like harnessing digital media, recognising and building father champions/leaders
(mother or grandparents as well) who become advocacy champions as well, and gender sensitive
programming taking account of challenges of time and space would be helpful. Continuous support
to parent leaders as well as possibility of compensation or recognition of their work will help increase
their commitment and sustain efforts.
c) Keep the main components of the project model with some adjustments [immediate]
Page|22
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
For a project that was implemented for a relatively short period of time, the results achieved in the
domains of capacity building of frontline workers and caregivers, increased utilization of ECD services
and alignment of project activities with existing government infrastructure are promising. The
components around training, planning, content, methods need to be retained as they are.
Adjustments can be done in another iteration on content for modifications in activities for inclusion
and equity, including explicit practice-oriented sessions in training modules, and translations in
different local and regional languages.
d) Equity and inclusion of children with different needs in communication material needs to be
continued but more explicitly [immediate]
There needs to be explicit training sessions on equity and inclusion. Also, one more iteration of the
content to move to gender neutral language, adding an explicit session on equity and inclusion, and
adding modifications for children with different needs is required.
Recommendations for Government
a) Integration of responsive parenting intervention into the annual work plan [immediate]
The addition of the project in the annual workplan will help build coordination with various
departments and enable streamlining the priorities of the local government bodies. The senior
officials will have to act as catalysts to encourage and expand the training conducted by an external
partner and to bear the costs of the same. This will also help support clear resource allocation at the
government level for integrated ECD. Utilizing sector meetings as a training venue needs some re-
thinking to strategically place the training session during the meeting to ensure sufficient time for the
training. Review formats will need to include responsive parenting as well, so it is clearly
institutionalized, allowing the Governments to systematically review and address issues.
b) AWWs and ASHAs collaboration and working together [immediate]
The collaboration between the AWWs and ASHAs needs to be leveraged and become a core
component of the project implementation given that ASHA’s messaging on health and nutrition
benefits tremendously by being empowered with responsive parenting strategies.
c) Frontline functionaries (AWWs and ASHAs) education, job description and work status improvement
[immediate]
Skill, Will and Time Amortization are three essentials to look at. Skill - Capacity building of the frontline
workers should be ingrained in the system; Will - a platform for constant support and engagement
needs to be maintained, clarity in FLW’s job description with focus on 0-3 and 3-6 age groups and on
services beyond the centres as well as inclusion of data monitoring, parenting services and advocacy
components; Time - trainings need to follow the successful Incremental Learning Approach.
Greater recognition of FLW’s work in cash and/or kind, relooking at the variability in the FLW’s
educational qualifications across districts and states and provision of additional refresher trainings to
FLWs with lower levels of education will be immensely helpful.
d) Ongoing trainings for parents [immediate and on-going]
New parent trainings as well as refreshers on technical aspects of ECD along with guidance and
counseling should be continued, ensuring long term sustainability.
Page|23
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
e) Convergence with line departments [medium to long-term]
To ensure convergence of departments, clear set of institutional conditions for implementation should
be in place and a clear distribution of tasks between partner departments/organizations should be
laid down. Staff involved from other departments could then clearly understand the roles and
responsibilities of planning, monitoring and reporting and where they converge as well. Other
necessary conditions include available human and financial resources and skills and capacities
(technical and administrative) which could be leveraged.
f) Harnessing digital technology for responsive parenting [immediate and on-going]
Innovative technology usage can improve service delivery, enhance supervision and monitoring, and
leverage the use of data in decision making. The use of activity content in the form of a calendar during
the pandemic period worked well and needs to be studied and expanded as an additional support.
g) Interweaving with POSHAN Abhiyan completely to bring AWWs and ASHAs working together as a
team [immediate]
Given the tremendous benefit of responsive parenting in breast feeding and complimentary feeding,
and the synergistic work done by the AWWs and ASHAs as a team, it is critical that responsive
parenting be an integrated ECD approach bringing in WCD, health and ICDS together and
complementing efforts.

1.1. Background and context
1.1.1. Global context
Early childhood (till 6 years of age) is a critical period that affects the holistic development of an individual
and determines their ability to reach their optimum health, social, and economic potential. This period
shapes the adult life as the cognitive and social skills of a child begin to develop and mature during this
time period. Comprehensive development and well-being of children, which consists of physical and
mental health, cognitive functioning, and social and emotional development, is strongly interconnected
with long-term outcomes of completing school education and learning levels, better livelihood
opportunities, and mental health.
Evidence from literature suggests that children from low-income families are more likely to exhibit
developmental delays, behavioural problems, and other disabilities than children from wealthier families.
Children from vulnerable and disadvantages families are most likely to miss the development milestones
in their early childhood due to their extreme exposure to cumulative effects of risk factors, including lack
of access to basic water and sanitation facilities, quality health services, nutritional inputs and quality day
care and preschool programmes. As a result of these risks, these children are less likely to be enrolled in
schools at the right age, which further affects their development. This also results in more likelihood of
them attaining lower achievement levels for their age and to have poorer cognitive ability10. As per recent

Publications, The World Bank, number 9385.

global estimates11, 50 million children aged under 5 (about 43%) in low- and middle-income countries are
at risk of not reaching their developmental potential, which can have long-term effects on their cognitive
development12. The IECEI13 study by CECED, ASER and UNICEF reported low levels of school readiness but
estimated significant positive impact of preschool programmes on school readiness level among children.
Research studies showcase that children from lower-income families face several achievement gaps by
the time they reach kindergarten stage. About 175 million children (50%) across the world are not enrolled
in pre-primary education during the crucial years14. The situation is further aggravated in low-income
countries, where only one in every five children has access to pre-primary education. This implies that by
the time they start the schooling, they can be two to three years of learning behind advantaged peers. In
the Indian context too, data highlights major deficiencies in children’s school readiness even when they
have attended anganwadi centres of the ICDS or private preschools.15 This gap persists and most often
widens as the schooling years pass. These gaps can have adverse effects on the overall development of
the individual affecting their health, educational outcomes, and financial situation in later life.
However, in case effective interventions are taken in the early years, the probability of offsetting the
negative trends are enhanced, thereby providing more opportunities to younger children and better
outcomes in terms of access to education, quality of learning, physical growth and health, and overall
productivity. Given the ripple effects ECD interventions have over the life span of beneficiaries, these are
among the most cost-effective investments a country can make in the human development and capital
formation of its people16.
Putting ECD at the core of global policy landscape
The discourse around Early Childhood Development (ECD) was initiated by the United Nations Convention
on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), General Comment 7 17. The UNCRC defines ECD as physical, cognitive,
linguistic, and socioemotional development of young children until they transition to primary school
(typically around age 6). The right to a child’s development has been accepted and embraced by the
international community, putting early child development as a key focus area in policymaking globally.
The different international protocols and conventions adopted by global players in the development space
has been outlined in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Key global ECD interventions
ECD and SDGs
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which act as a roadmap for creating a better future, present
an opportunity to build on the progress achieved in the field of ECD by providing optimum conditions for
children to survive and thrive. The SDGs recognize the link between ECD and equity, productivity, wealth
creation, sustainable growth and therefore a brighter and successful future for children. Embedded in the
SDGs are targets on malnutrition, child mortality, early learning and violence – targets that outline an
agenda for ECD.
Provisioning and strengthening of ECD is key to achieving at least seven of the SDGs on poverty, hunger,
health (including child mortality), education, gender, water and sanitation, and inequality. Target 4.2 of the
SDGs explicitly focuses on ECD, i.e., “by 2030 ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality ECD, care
and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education”.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and
Adolescents’ Health have embraced young children’s development, seeing it as central to the
transformation that the world seeks to achieve by 2030.18 19

1.1.2. Indian context
In India, according to Census 2011 data, there are 164.48 million children in the age group 0-6 years. While
significant progress has been made with regard to maternal and child health over the past decade - infant
mortality rates (IMR) are down to 33 per 1000 live births in 201720; the under-five mortality rates (U5MR)
have decreased to 37 deaths per 1,000 live births in 201921; maternal mortality rates have fallen to 145
per 100,000 live births; child poverty rates stand at 14%,22 much more remains to be done as the progress
is spread unevenly across the country. Both the level and the rate of improvement of child health in India
remain widely unequal. Infant mortality rates in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh are more than four
times than those of Kerala, while the gap between the most and least vaccinated states is more than 40
percentage points.23 Even within states, some groups are more vulnerable than others; infant mortality
rates for rural children are up to 1.5 times higher than their urban counterparts.
According to Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey24 (CNNS) 2016-18, over half of all children started
to breastfeed in the first hour after birth (57%) and almost three-fifths of children in India were exclusively
breastfed (58%) in the six months of life. Over half (53%) of the infants aged 6 to 8 months received timely
initiation of complementary feeding.
To stand by its commitment towards early childhood care and development, the Government of India
(GOI) rolled out the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme in 1975, the world’s largest
community-based program. The major beneficiaries identified under the scheme are children in the age
group of 0-6 years, pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls. Besides ICDS, Government
of India also focuses on remediating disadvantaged groups and reducing the inequalities of early
childhood.
Further strengthening the policy landscape, the Central Government approved the National Early
Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Policy in 2013 along with the National ECCE Curriculum Framework
and Quality Standards for ECCE programme. The policy caters to all children under 6 years of age and
commits to universal access to quality early childhood education and integrated development experience.
It lays down some priority areas which include early stimulation experiences for children below 3 years;
developmentally appropriate, play-based preschool education for the age group 3 to 6 years; and a
structured school readiness component for 5- to 6-year-olds. The National Curriculum Framework (2013)
defined age-specific curricular objectives for each of the subgroups within the under-six age range and
laid out the basic principles of providing age-appropriate, play-based, integrated, experiential, contextual
and inclusive teaching-learning experiences. The UNICEF project being evaluated (Space for Kids to be Kids)
supports the Government’s implementation of the National ECCE Policy adopted in 2013; the policy notes
the importance of parental involvement in the care and development of children, which the project
interventions aim to support.
1.1.1.1. Key schemes contributing to ECD in India
India has developed important schemes, policies and frameworks that respond to the situation of early
childhood development in India, for example, the National Early Childhood Care and Education Policy
(2013); The National Early Childhood Care and Education Curriculum(2014); the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan
Framework (2018) and POSHAN Abhiyaan which focuses on first 1000 days, which brings pre-primary

under the same umbrella as other levels of schooling. Most recently, National Education Policy 2020
underlines the importance of early childhood education and provides guidelines for making pre-primary
education compulsory for ages 3-6.
Some of the important schemes and their key objectives have been presented below and are mapped
further to the nurturing care framework:

1.1.1.2. ECD interventions aligned to Nurturing Care Framework25
Nurturing care refers to conditions created by public policies, programmes, and services. These conditions
enable communities and caregivers to ensure children’s good health and nutrition and protect them from
threats. The Nurturing Care Framework provides a roadmap for action. It builds on state-of-the-art
evidence about how early childhood development unfolds and how it can be improved by policies and
interventions. The table below summarizes ECD interventions aligned to the Nurturing care framework-

1.2. Introduction of IKEA ECD Project
1.2.1. Space for Kids to be Kids Project
The project “Spaces for kids to be kids” is a project supported by IKEA Foundation to improve early
development of children in two states of India – Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The project was initiated in
August 2017, in a partnership with the Department of Women and Child Development in the states of
Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The pilot phase of the project spanned till first quarter of 2020 with plans to
scale up in all the blocks in the intervention districts at the time of evaluation. However, the scope of the
evaluation is only the pilot phase of the project. Hence, this evaluation serves two purposes as an endline
evaluation of the pilot phase and formative evaluation to integrate the learnings into the scale up process
for subsequent phase/s. The project in India adopts a ‘system-based approach’ and utilizes the platforms
available within the ICDS system to reach caregivers. System based approach focuses on utilizing existing
government structures - for capacity building of frontline workers (AWW and ASHA); as well as the delivery
of quality services including counselling of parents through existing platforms of ICDS; leveraging the
ongoing government programmes such as Poshan Abhiyaan, Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK),
Home Based Young Child Care (HBYC) and strengthening early childhood education under the umbrella
of the ICDS programme.
As foregrounded in the nurturing care framework too, early experiences, including responsive and positive
interactions with adults, parents and caregivers, are critical for children’s development, growth, and health.
Parents play a critical role in facilitating early experiences through the provision of nurturing care, defined
as care which ensures health, nutrition, responsive caregiving, safety and security, social-emotional well-
Page|32
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
being, and early learning. A wide body of research on infant and childhood development shows that
nurturing, responsive and stimulating interactions between young children and their parents and
caregivers positively and permanently strengthens the ability to learn with the possibility of changing brain
function for life.
In the context of the current project, parenting can be understood as the interactions, behaviours, emotions, knowledge
beliefs, attitudes, and practices associated with the provision of nurturing care which is defined as care which ensures
health, nutrition, responsive caregiving, safety and security, social emotional well-being and early learning26. The term
parenting is not limited to biological parents but extends to any guardian or caregiver providing consistent care to the
child. Within the larger programme of strengthening the delivery of ECCE programme through the anganwadi centre - one
of the key aspects of the project was to strengthen the parental involvement in childcare.
The project’s strategic thrust was on building the capacity of the frontline workers primarily the AWWs and
the ASHAs to effectively support parents/caregivers in improving care of children and in providing
opportunities to support early learning at household level. The strategic components of the project
included development of training materials, communication packages on parental care; building capacity
of the frontline functionaries (AWWs and ASHAs), which includes training and on the job support to
enhance their knowledge, attitude and perceptions on parenting care; and use of such learning through
various platforms for quality counselling and interaction with the parents/caregivers.
The IKEA Foundation funded project aimed that both boy and girl child have equal access to services for
early childhood care and education which will contribute towards ensuring all girls and boys survive, thrive
and develop to their fullest potential. The project interventions were designed to emphasize that child-
care is not only the responsibility of mothers but also needs the involvement of fathers.
Selection of districts and blocks: Select districts27 in each state were identified for implementation of
the project activities. Districts were selected targeting marginalized populations of children (children from
tribal groups, children living in urban slums, and children living in rural areas. In each of the selected
districts, specific blocks were identified for implementation of the project activities. In each state, blocks
within the district were selected based on certain parameters. In Maharashtra, districts have been selected
targeting marginalized populations of children (children from tribal groups, children living in urban slums,
and children living in rural areas. Further, blocks were selected in consultation with government on the
basis of the least number of staff vacancies in ICDS. In Rajasthan, the blocks selected were those with
ongoing programme on nutrition/education. It is to be noted that initially the project activities were
proposed to only target Anganwadi workers however, with the launch of POSHAN Abhiyaan and HBYC it
became important that ASHAs were also included in the project (in the first half of 2018).
Integrated ECD: The integrated ECD project was designed based on UNICEF’s - pilot to policy to results-
at-scale. In the planned training cascade, the project built the capacity of ICDS and health system
functionaries, including frontline workers28 to raise awareness and build the capacity of parents and
caregivers in providing nurturing care, positive parenting and early stimulation to enable them in
positively influencing the development trajectory of children in their care. It was expected that the AWW’s
and ASHA’s through interaction with parents, caregivers, and communities, using the available platforms,
26 Nurturing Care Framework - a framework for helping children survive and thrive to transform health and human potential was
created in response to strong evidence and growing recognition that the early years are critical for human development.

such as home visits, ECCE Days, VHSNDs, Mothers’ meeting and Community Group Meetings, promote
early stimulation and positive parenting. ICDS system has been at the center of the whole intervention
given its key role in promoting child wellbeing in the country on behalf of the government. For the current
project, ICDS supported in terms of making the human resources (AWW supervisors, AWWs) available for
the capacity building purposes on nurturing care and responsive parenting, providing high-level inputs
and guidance.
The project involved working in select districts in the state, partnering with the government to integrate
ECD (stimulation and learning) into the existing programme interventions under Nutrition, Education and
Health to promote improved coordination and convergence for holistic ECD. The project aimed to improve
service provision and utilization and improve the coverage and quality of counselling and communication
support to parents/caregivers to provide nurturing care and early learning opportunities to their children
This project is an innovation in India since promoting parental involvement for quality ECD, both in terms
of improving their awareness with regards to care and development of their children and increasing
demand for quality services, had not been implemented in India.
The project built on the ongoing government programmes for maternal health, nutrition and ECE through
ICDS and NHM. For sustainability and to ensure scale up, interventions were designed within the overall
governments’ capacity development strategy linked to ongoing programmes e.g. POSHAN Abhiyaan,
Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK), Home Based Young Child Care (HBYC) and strengthening early
childhood education under the umbrella of the ICDS programme.
Utilization of existing government structures: In both states, the implementation of activities has been
through existing government structures: for capacity building of frontline workers (AWW and ASHA); as
well as the delivery of quality services including counselling of parents through existing platforms of ICDS.
The ongoing capacity building programme for ICDS officials/ functionaries was done through the
Incremental Learning Approach (ILA) and especially for FLWs (Anganwadi Workers or AWWs and ASHAs)
using pre-existing platforms of monthly meetings with supervisors. In line with national policy objectives
under nutrition, education, and health, the program aims to especially focus on promoting responsive
parenting to influence long-term development outcomes for children across the country.
For further details on the project and the implementation modality in both the intervention states, please
refer to Annexure 03.
Role of UNICEF
UNICEF continues to play a robust role in improving, supporting, and strengthening the quality of services
for children, for example, quality of care and education. It provided technical support for the development
of the National ECCE Policy, the National Curriculum Framework and Quality Standards on ECCE, and state
feasibility studies. Furthermore, it provided support to develop early learning and development standards
for children aged 3-6 years. UNICEF also supported a five-year longitudinal study on early childhood
education tracking students from preschool to the early primary grades, completed in 2016. Some of the
key findings of the ECE longitudinal study have informed the development of the current project and the
need to target frontline workers and parents with information and knowledge on ECD.
For the current project, UNICEF India was the lead technical and resource stakeholder with primary role
in project design, providing technical and financial support to partners for the implementation of the
project in two states of Rajasthan and Maharashtra, largely in rural areas. The role further involved
advocacy with state government partners (Maharashtra and Rajasthan) and building the capacity of
government officials and frontline workers to raise the awareness of parents on the importance of ECD
and their key role in this regard in two states under the Integrated Child Development Services programme.

End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
Specifically, also through promoting parental involvement for quality ECD, both in terms of improving their
awareness with regard to care and development of their children and increasing demand for quality
services. The relative importance of the current object of evaluation to UNICEF is very high given ECD is
still a new and emerging space within Indian context and the learnings from the current evaluation would
be of significant importance for UNICEF’s ECD initiatives in India.
Role of CSO
Civil Society Organisations (CSO)29 partners were selected to provide technical and monitoring support to
the project. They contributed towards development of training materials, communication toolkit for
parents of children (0-6 years), monitoring tools, training, supervision and mentoring of frontline workers.
Role of Government
The government was an important stakeholder and played a role right from the start in different phases
of the project. Essentially, ICDS as the main government entity responsible for the nutrition and primary
education services to the children in the country, supported in terms of making the human resources
(AWW supervisors, AWWs) available for the capacity building purposes on nurturing care and responsive
parenting, providing high-level inputs and guidance, supporting in the use of available platforms and
integrating training cascade in planned meets. MoHFW as the main government entity responsible for
delivering health-related services to pregnant women/ mothers/ children in the country, supported in
terms of making the human resources (ASHAs) available for the capacity building purposes on nurturing
care and responsive parenting, providing high level inputs and guidance. There were also some blocks In
Rajasthan particularly, where the project was implemented exclusively with government support since
CSO Partner support in implementation was not available in those blocks.
Policies/schemes that involve FLWs as implementers
ICDS (Integrated Child Development Services) works under the guidelines and directives of the MWCD
(Ministry of Women and Child Development) and has the largest outreach in the form of its Anganwadi
Centres (AWC’s), seen as centres for integrated and holistic development of the child. The key functionary
at the centre is the AWW (Anganwadi Worker) and the Anganwadi Helper (AWH) and provide a
comprehensive set of services meeting the health, nutrition and early learning and development needs of
children. The AWW also provides support to the frontline functionaries of NRHM (National Rural Health
Mission), the ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) and ANM (Auxiliary Nurse and Midwife), in delivering
health and nutrition services at the community level.
AWW is largely responsible for centre based activity and outreach services. She has a packed portfolio and
is the key implementor for many schemes at the community level. Her key responsibilities include –
• Early Childhood Education: providing play and activity-based learning for 3-6 year old children
including school readiness
• Supplementary Nutrition Programme (SNP): Overall responsibility for SNP for 3-6 years, THR
(Take home ration) for under-threes and Pregnant and lactating mothers (P&L). Supporting
POSHAN Abhiyaan.
• Growth monitoring and promotion and use of MCPC (Mother-Child Protection Card)
• Care of children who are underweight

• Home Visits: for home-based counseling and guidance especially for under-threes including
Infant and young child feeding (IYCF), Early Stimulation and development, Counseling of pregnant
and lactating mothers and supporting HBNC (Home Based New-born Care) and HBYC (Home-Based
Care for Young Child)
• Organizing Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND) with the support of ASHA and AWH.
• Organizing ECCE Day to monitor developmental milestones of children (0-6 years) using the MCP
card and ECCE Card
• Referrals for medical attention in children and P&L women.
• Participation in Village Health Sanitation Committee (VHSNC)
• Creating linkages and collaborate with other sectors especially health, panchayat, education,
drinking water, sanitation, etc. for improving health and nutrition status of the community.
• Coordination, facilitation, advocacy, community mobilization and record maintenance too.
ASHA’s as mandated under NHRM, are community level care providers. Their work includes a mix of tasks:
facilitating access to health care services, building awareness about health care entitlements especially
amongst the poor and marginalized, promoting healthy behaviours and mobilizing for collective action for
better health outcomes and meeting curative care needs as appropriate to the organization of service
delivery in that area and compatible with her training and skills. They specifically work with pregnant
women along with AWW to promote institutional delivery, counsel pregnant women on health, nutrition
and schemes like JSY. For newborn, she provides HBNC and HBYC and informs about schemes like Janani
Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) and ensures they get the benefits and care if the newborn is sick. She
also helps families to access Facility Based Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (F-
IMNCI) and Facility-Based New-born and Child Care. For children, she arranges VHSND, and plays an
important role in management of childhood illnesses and care of undernourished children. Also, anemia
control in adolescent girls and convening meetings of VHSNC.

1.3. Project Theory of Change (ToC)
A generic ToC was available in the ToR. Based on the available ToC and preliminary discussions with
UNICEF country and state teams, the Evaluation Team constructed a broad ToC. This retrospectively
constructed ToC is very descriptive and thus far from exhaustive programme theory. Pathways were not
mapped i.e. from activities to outputs or from outputs to outcomes as it required wider consultations and
inputs from programme teams which was out of the scope of the current evaluation. Resultantly, the
assumptions associated with the specific pathways are not listed. The Evaluation Team has provided broad
assumptions for instance at activity, output, outcome level.
Below we provide the broad ToCs constructed for both the intervention states –

Page|38

Rajasthan
Figure 3: Model ToC for intervention in Rajasthan
The outputs, immediate and intermediate outcomes, and impact narratives are similar for both the
interventions in Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The program logic slightly differs at the inputs and activities
level in both the states. In Maharashtra, training packages were built on existing ICDS and health
functionaries modules such as IYCF, early stimulation, parental education whereas in Rajasthan MCP cards
were mostly used. Institutional platforms such as Palakmelawas were used in Maharashtra to reach out
to the parents besides other generally used community platforms and in Rajasthan sector meetings were
utilized for training of FLWs and community-based events such as Godhbharai and Annaprashan were
also used. Samvedansheel palakatv was developed as a communication material in Maharashtra and
SabRang cards were developed in Rajasthan.
It is to be noted that the current evaluation stops exploring the results of the project at ‘immediate outcome’
level (assessing ‘intermediate outcomes’ and ‘impact’ are out of the scope of the current evaluation)

2. EVALUATION PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE
2.1. Evaluation Rationale
The evaluation of the ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project was necessary for several reasons. First, it was
important to ascertain whether the positive parenting intervention actually worked as intended, and to
determine its strengths as well as areas for improvement. Second, there is not much evidence on positive
parenting currently available in India, and this evaluation was intended to generate important evidence
for early child development in India, where this is still a relatively new area. Third, this evaluation has the
opportunity to influence policy decisions, in both Maharashtra and Rajasthan, as well as nationally, using
the evaluation findings to support scale-up. Specifically, the findings were intended to generate learnings
for the government on the sustainability and scalability of such a systems approach in which interventions
for early childhood development were designed within the overall governments’ capacity development
strategy linked to various ongoing programmes. Aside from the donor requirement, the timing of the
evaluation was apt as there is a strong appetite from the concerned state governments to learn from the
evaluation findings before strategizing on scaling up in other districts.
2.2. Evaluation Objectives
The main objectives of this evaluation are to:
1. Assess the relevance of the project, specifically the role of parental support and involvement to
support early childhood development including the support of early learning in the home.
2. Assess the effectiveness of the programme in the select districts in Maharashtra and Rajasthan,
specifically in terms of whether it has achieved its intended immediate and intermediate
outcomes or not
3. Assess the programme effectiveness from gender and equity perspective; specifically to what
extent the programme was able to achieve its gender and equity focus e.g. reach out to
vulnerable communities as well as fathers.
4. Assess the efficiency of the programme in terms of utilisation of available resources and timely
implementation, and understand where processes can be improved for better programme
delivery
5. Capture immediate results of the interventions if any that support pathways to programme
impact
6. Determine the readiness for the programme to be scaled up to other districts
7. Assess the sustainability of the programme in terms of ownership of the government
8. Capture good practices and lessons learned
2.3. Evaluation Scope - Geographic focus and time period
The evaluation was conducted in four districts31 of Maharashtra and two districts32 of Rajasthan, where
the ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project has been implemented, between August 2017 - June 2020. In order
to assess the changes in knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of FLWs on ECD, those FLWs were
chosen for data collection where the parenting intervention has been at least of one-year duration after
the training.

2.5. Key deviations from ToR
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic circumstances, there have been some deviations from original ToR. The
key deviations from original ToR have been mentioned below:
• As on-field data collection was not possible due to COVID-19 circumstances, evaluation team
collected the primary data through remote data collection (via phone surveys)
• Instead of FGDs with the parents/caregivers, IDIs were conducted
• Direct Process Observation was dropped because, due to the COVID-19, observing in-person
interactions of FLWs with parents/caregivers was not possible
• Some specific KEQs which were earlier planned to be answered with the help of quantitative FLW
survey (as one of the lines of evidence) were answered with the help of IDIs with FLWs (as some
questions from FLW survey questionnaire were dropped).
• In order to account for potential non-response rate during remote data collection during FLW
quantitative survey, a buffer of 100% was added to original sampled list (Odd and Even sampling
strategy)

3. EVALUATION DESIGN, METHODS, QUALITY ASSURANCE,
ETHICS AND IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 Evaluation Design
As outlined in the ToR, for this assignment, the evaluation team used mixed-methods – quantitative and
qualitative approaches. The quantitative line of evidence constituted – FLW survey, and qualitative line of
evidence constituted – KIIs with stakeholders, IDIs with FLWs, IDIs with parents/caregivers and case-
studies.
Solely depending on the quantitative line of evidence (FLW survey) could not generate a perspective of
other key stakeholders (govt officials, project teams, CSO partners, master trainers, parents) as the
quantitative study was focused on FLWs. Therefore, to capture the perceptions of the final target
beneficiaries (caregivers/parents) a component of IDI was included; KIIs were included to source the
insights from key stakeholders; IDIs with FLWs provided qualitative insights and case studies helped in
highlighting best practices. Therefore, mixed-method approach was best suited for the current evaluation
to assess the contribution of the project better.
The quantitative component (FLW survey) produced evidence on the changes in knowledge, attitudes and
practices (KAP) of FLWs regarding ECD and childcare. The qualitative components (KIIs and IDIs) generated
valuable information on relevance, appropriateness, acceptability of the interventions, aspects of
implementation fidelity and bottlenecks from key stakeholders.
Evaluation Design
Given the nature of the current project, a pre-post evaluation design was utilized as there was no
possibility of selecting a suitable control group for this evaluation (for a quasi-experimental design). The
baseline was conducted in last quarter of 2017 and the project started rolling out from early 2018. The
current endline evaluation was conducted from Mar/Apr 2020 – Mar 2021 with the data collection
spanning from Dec 2020 – Jan 2021. Further, as quantitative component (FLW survey) was limited in
establishing contribution (as it was not an RCT/quasi-experimental design), the insights and learnings
generated through qualitative lines of evidence (KIIs and IDIs) helped in validating the quantitative findings
and supported in establishing preliminary evidence for intervention effectiveness.
3.2 Evaluation Methods
The evaluation aimed to understand the following in the context of early childhood development (ECD) in
the intervention districts of Rajasthan and Maharashtra with the specific objectives as understood from
the Terms of Reference (ToR):
1. Conduct an extensive review of existing literature to understand whether the training content
developed for FLWs and parents/caregivers on positive parenting was relevant and was of good
quality (including gender and equity dimensions); understand linkages between positive parenting
and ECD, and to generate good understanding of the role of parenting (especially the best
practices) in regions other than intervention states
2. Conduct quantitative surveys with FLWs (AWWs & ASHAs) to measure the KAP (Knowledge,
Attitudes and Practices) with respect to ECD and positive parenting to understand to what extent
the project contributed to improved learnings of FLWs
Page|45
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
3. Conduct key informant interviews amongst the different stakeholders in the project such as
relevant government departments (ICDS, health), members of CSOs, UNICEF staff members,
master trainers to understand the implementation of the positive parenting intervention and to
assess what has worked and not in terms of achieving intended outputs and immediate outcomes
4. Conduct In-depth interviews with – (a) FLWs (AWWs & ASHAs) to understand how the training aided
in changing their attitudes and beliefs, helped them to address challenges, usefulness of the
training provided and to capture suggestions on improvements, and (b) parents/caregivers to
understand their perceptions regarding the needs being addressed, improvement in the quality
of counselling provided by FLWs to them, and key barriers and challenges faced by them to provide
care to children.
5. Document key innovations/achievements and challenges of the project through specific case
studies
3.3 Evaluation Criteria and Questions
The evaluation methodology is based on the OECD/DAC evaluation criteria33 to answer key evaluation
questions. As outlined in the ToR, evaluation team focused on four OECD/DAC evaluation criteria
(relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability) except ‘impact’ criteria as the impact evaluation is expected
to take place at a later stage once the intervention has been running for sufficient time to be able to affect
behavior and practices of parents/caregivers regarding positive parenting.

3.4 Evaluation Methods
3.3.1. Quantitative Research
Quantitative surveys were conducted with FLWs (AWWs & ASHAs) to measure the KAP (Knowledge,
Attitudes and Practices) with respect to ECD and positive parenting; understand to what extent the project
contributed to improved learnings of FLWs and to identify the gaps in the process. The quantitative survey
questionnaire was based on the baseline questionnaire to ensure the comparability of results. It is to be
noted that due to the COVID-19 pandemic circumstances, all the indicators from baseline FLW survey
could not be included due to remote data collection. Evaluation team in consultation with UNICEF program
team identified key sections to be included to adapt to remote data collection methodology. The missing
indicators were qualitatively assessed with the help of IDIs with the FLWs.
3.3.2. Sampling Plan and sample covered
For purposes of this assessment, a two-stage cluster random sampling was used i.e., clustering at district
and block level powered to provide state-level estimates. The evaluation team ensured to select FLWs
from all the intervention blocks within a district. The team used systematic random sampling to select
Anganwadi Centers (AWCs) from a block ensuring the representativeness of geographic typology
(rural/urban/tribal). Once the sample of AWCs was arrived, the evaluation team sourced the list of AWWs
within those selected AWCs from the UNICEF/ CDPO office. The sample was selected to be reflective of the
underlying population of FLWs (proportionate to the FLW population in each intervention district and
within each district, proportionate to FLW population in each intervention block). It is to be noted that the
endline evaluation did not follow up the same FLWs (cohort) selected during baseline and as such during
endline evaluation, the FLW sampling was re-done.
Eligibility criteria: FLWs from areas (blocks) where parenting intervention covering children 0-6 years has
been implemented for at least one year.
A detailed sampling plan for the endline evaluation has been presented in Annexure 06.

The evaluation team obtained the contact numbers of all the AWCs from the intervention area. Firstly, the
AWWs of the selected AWCs were contacted to obtain the appointments. In case AWW from any of the
selected primary AWCs was not available, the team replaced the same from secondary/buffer AWCs in
each block.
3.3.3. Qualitative Research
Sampling for qualitative assessment: The evaluation team used purposive sampling for the qualitative
data collection to maximize the range of experiences. A detailed process of selection of respondents for
qualitative interviews is presented under Annexure 10. The Qualitative assessment included two lines of
evidences – Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and In-Depth Interviews (IDIs). Evaluation team included ‘case
studies’ (wherever possible), as this depended on availability of the case study participants due to remote
data collection strategy. The details of each qualitative line of evidence is provided in subsequent sections.
The aim of the KIIs and IDIs was to determine the relevance/ appropriateness/ acceptability of the
interventions, implementation fidelity and any bottlenecks as perceived by the key stakeholders.
3.3.3.1. Key Informant Interviews
The qualitative assessment focused on the six intervention districts34. To gain a comprehensive
understanding of the current multi-sectoral approach of the intervention and its immediate outcomes,
key informant interviews (KII) were undertaken with relevant government departments (ICDS, health,
education), members of CSOs, UNICEF staff members, master trainers.
Key informant interviews were held in order to gather insights on the reach and effectiveness of the
overall project with a focus on what has worked and not in terms of achieving intended outputs and
immediate outcomes. Evaluation team consulted UNICEF State teams (Maharashtra and Rajasthan) and
CSO partners to come up with a list of KII participants.

Matrix.
3.3.3.2. In-Depth Interviews (IDIs)
In addition to the KIIs, evaluation team conducted IDIs in the six intervention districts with – a) FLWs
(AWWs and ASHAs) to qualitatively explore utilization of available institutional platforms/ communication
tools/ materials, challenges and barriers in reaching out to community, changes in cultural beliefs and
attitudes, capacity building needs, and b) parents/caregivers of the children to explore their perception
regarding the quality of services delivered. It is to be noted that since the project envisaged to engage
fathers in parent meetings conducted by FLWs, we conducted about 25% of the IDIs exclusively with
fathers of children.

3.3.4. COVID-19 Implications
Initially, the evaluation team planned to collect all the primary data in person on the field. But, due to
unexpected circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person on the field data collection was
not possible. Therefore, the evaluation team in consultation with UNICEF Country and State offices
decided to collect all the primary data remotely (via phone survey).
Page|49
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
Following the decision to collect all the primary data remotely, the evaluation team adapted the study
tools and evaluation design (in consultation with UNICEF ICO and state offices) to account for possible
risks involved in the remote data collection strategy. The following necessary revisions/ adjustments were
made during the inception phase to adapt the evaluation to remote data collection strategy –
• The FLW quantitative tool which was quite lengthier was trimmed down to optimal level with an
objective to complete the interview via phone survey within 30-35 minutes
• Additional line of evidence – IDIs with FLWs was added to qualitative answer the questions
dropped during the FLW quantitative tool trimming process
• Further, the FGDs planned with parents/caregivers (0-3 and 3-6 child) was replaced with IDIs
• The evaluation team in consultation with UNICEF ICO and state offices created a matrix mapping
quantitative and qualitative lines of evidence with KEQs/SEQs to strategically spread the
information across the respondents which helped in tailoring the study tools to each respondent
strategically
For further details on COVID-19 adaptations, pilot testing of tools and lessons learnt, please refer to
Annexure 11.
3.5 Analysis Approaches
Quantitative data analysis
All tabulations of the FLW quantitative survey were based on a variety of stratifications, i.e. disaggregation
by State, type of respondent (AWW and ASHA), and type of area (rural/urban/tribal) for all key areas of the
investigation – Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices of FLWs. Output tables (by sub-groups) were generated
for the purpose of reporting findings in the report. Initial analysis will be done in STATA to generate
proportions, frequency tables and cross-tabulations.
Contribution analysis
It is to be noted that the endline evaluation did not follow up the same FLWs (cohort) selected during
baseline evaluation and for endline evaluation, sampling was re-done. Findings from end-line for
Maharashtra was comparable with baseline as the geographic scope from baseline and end-line hasn’t
changed and the sampling strategy used during baseline and endline are similar. Further, as the current
evaluation was not an RCT, in addition to the quantitative FLW survey, the evaluation team used qualitative
lines of evidence (KIIs and IDIs) to identify contribution in Maharashtra. Further, the demographic
characteristics (religion, social category and education) of FLWs across baseline and endline were quite
similar in both the states (refer to Figure 25, 26 and 27 in Annexure 17).
A pre-post comparison analysis of quantitative data from FLW survey for Rajasthan was challenging
because:
• During the baseline only about 200 FLWs (150 AWWs and 50 ASHAs) were interviewed in two
intervention districts of Rajasthan
• These 200 respondents were spread across 24 blocks of two intervention districts (14 blocks in
Udaipur and 10 blocks in Dungarpur) during baseline
• For the current evaluation, since the evaluation team considered only blocks where the
intervention has been at-least for a year, the team was able to select respondents from 8 blocks
only from the two intervention districts (5 in Dungarpur and 3 in Udaipur) – therefore, the results
of evaluation comparing the two different geographic scopes during baseline and end-line must
be interpreted cautiously
Page|50
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
We explored the evidence from qualitative lines of evidence as well and tried to assemble, assess and
strengthen the contribution narrative. It has to be noted that ‘contribution analysis’ does not seek to
conclusively prove whether, or how far, the intervention has contributed to a change or set of changes.
Instead, it seeks to reduce uncertainty. Therefore, the aim was to produce a plausible, evidence-based
narrative that a reasonable person would be likely to agree with.
Also please note that the results from the quantitative findings cannot conclude attribution or
contribution completely to the project and must be interpreted cautiously
Qualitative data analysis
To analyse the qualitative data (KII /IDIs), the evaluation team used a blended approach of thematic and
content analysis to identify key themes and trends occurring in the responses. The qualitative data from
the KIIs and IDIs was analysed in RQDA software through transcripts developed from the recordings
during KII and IDI sessions. Subsequently, data was summarized, coded and categorized into themes (data
reduction) to understand points of agreement and contention among different stakeholder groups.
Continuous iterative revision of texts was carried out to identify and code the main patterns and categories
in the data. Eventually, the data was organized, interpreted and synthesized into conclusions (data display).
A detailed analysis approach to report findings is presented in Annexure 13.
3.6 Quality Assurance – Field Work and Data Collection Procedures
Field Protocols
The list below highlights the key considerations and/ or measures taken to ensure quality of all data
collection processes (FLW survey, KIIs, IDIs) and during data consolidation, analysis and reporting phases.
A more detailed information on the primary data collection, quality assurance mechanism is presented in
Annexure 10.
• Pre-testing of tools: All tools were pre-tested and modified appropriately, before full-scale
application.
• Extensive training: All the data collection team members deployed for data collection underwent
an extensive training led by the ECD expert and evaluation team members.
• Deployment: It was ensured that only those members who received complete training were
deployed for primary data collection
• Audio recordings: Audio recordings of all the data collection processes (FLW survey, KIIs, IDIs)
were secured with prior permission from the respondents/ participants. Later, all the qualitative
data (KIIs and IDIs) was transcribed, cleaned, coded, categorized, and processed for analysis
purposes.
• Appointments: Appointments for interviews were secured from all respondents/ participants in
advance
• Confidentiality and anonymity: Confidentiality and Anonymity of the data was ensured by – a)
respondent’s identity was separated from the datasets, b) identifiable information was erased
immediately after completion of data cleaning, and c) only designated and authorized team
members had access to datasets during data processing and analysis
• All cultural, social and gender norms of the areas/ communities interviewed were respected
completely.

• Adjusting for non-response rate (by increasing the
sample size to account for non-response)
• Participants for KIIs, IDIs were selected upon
consultations with client, implementation partners, and
local level govt officials
• Sensitive treatment of refusals or ‘don’t know’
• Using standard and calibrated model question sequence
Researchers and Low risk
translators • Researchers and translators were carefully selected and
appropriate to the context, including consideration of any
gender or religious sensitivities. The level of researchers
selected for the data collection was higher than the
standard household surveys
• All research staff received rigorous training in
interviewing techniques and had appropriate
communication skills with respect to vulnerable and at-
risk populations
Support from Medium risk • Support from state level and district level officials was

Time and Low risk • Surveys were undertaken considering the sensitivity to
seasonality timing (time of the interview, duration, school hours,
holidays, festivals, months were FLWs are engaged in
special programs, etc) as well as the seasonality of work
of parents/caregivers (times of harvest, peak
manufacturing seasons, etc).

Management of Low risk • All data collected were kept in a secure manner and
data keeping with the requirements for anonymity, delinked
from participants of the research.
• Particular consideration was given to the risks associated
with the digital collection of data, including privacy and
security
Low recall of FLWs Medium risk • Locally used terms (as proposed by UNICEF) were used to
help FLWs identify/recall the trainings received as a part
of the project to minimize the risk of recall
• FLWs were probed multiple times and were provided
adequate time to recollect the trainings received with the
aid of locally used terms
• It was ensured that enumerators are well trained
Sampling for Medium risk • In order to minimize the risk of selection bias in selecting
qualitative FLWs and parents for IDIs, appropriate methodology was
deployed to minimize the risk of bias in selection of

3.8 Ethics and UNEG guidelines
The current evaluation is grounded in the ethical research frameworks on protecting human subjects. The
evaluation team adhered to ‘UNICEF procedure for ethical standards in research, evaluation, data
collection and analysis’ on independence, impartiality, credibility, conflicts of interest and accountability.
Informed Consent: Informed consent of the participant in the fullest meaning, including genuine choice,
and is central to the surveys. The right to say applies to both adults and children, and the interviewers
were trained to explain the participants that they are free to refuse to participate or to answer certain
questions. During the remote data collection, verbal consent was obtained by the enumerator over the
phone for both recording and conduct of interview. In case the participant denied consent for recording
but provided consent for the interview, then the team proceeded without recording the interview. In cases
where the participant did not consent to participate in the interview, such participants were not included
in the evaluation.
Do No Harm: The principle of non-maleficence is sacrosanct to avoid harm to the human subjects of the
research, both through acts of commission or omission. Extensive training of the field enumerators with
clear instructions for engagement and exit strategies in case of even perceived harm during the process
of data collection was inbuilt into the methodology. Further, inorder to reduce the time required to
complete the administration of study tools within 30 mins, the evaluation team trimmed down some select
sections and adapted the study tools to remote data collection strategy. This was done in consultation
with the UNICEF team and the revised tools were rigorously pilot-tested twice for flow, clarity and the time
taken by the tools to strengthen the flow of the tools and also to ensure that the tools/ guides won’t take
more than 30 mins.
Respect and Justice: The principle of respect implies valuing humans including children and their lived
realities. It requires recognition that their decisions exist within broader personal, relational, social,
cultural, legal and environmental contexts.
Page|53
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
Privacy and Confidentiality: Privacy and confidentiality are critical considerations in the ethical collection of
data on individuals. Risks associated with privacy and confidentiality was considered throughout the
research process. The informed consent process was physically separated from transcriptions and surveys.
With regards to the collection, transmission, storage, analysis, and destruction of data, clear and strict
security protocols were developed, minimizing those who have access, ensuring physical or electronic
safeguards, and encryption keys, methods of destruction of the data, including the security of the cloud
storage. All the respondents were clearly informed that the information they provide will only be used for
the evaluation purpose and no individual data will be shared externally in any form and is completely
confidential. It was stressed that the analysis will be done at an aggregate level only.
All information gained from the interviews was treated in a confidential way. To protect the confidentiality,
the records contained no names or personal identifiers. Throughout, care was taken not to raise
expectations on the potential benefits that participants would gain from the project.
Further, during the quantitative FLW survey, evaluation team explicitly mentioned that participants will
not face any disciplinary consequences as a result of participating in the study. Evaluation team
emphasized the formative nature of the exercise and clearly conveyed that the learning will be used to
improve the trainings provided to FLWs. The evaluation team undertook an ethics training/course
provided by UNICEF course on ethics in evaluations.
On the sensitive topics related to parenting, in order to reduce the risk for discomfort, the evaluation team
clearly indicated this for the prospective participants, so that those who may not want to discuss personal
matters can choose not to participate. In addition, team emphasized that those who decided to participate
can choose to withdraw from the study at any time without any explanation, refrain from answering a
specific question, or refrain from engaging in any activity that makes them uncomfortable.
COVID: UNICEF has stopped all in-person data collection during COVID-19 and the evaluation team
adhered to this by collecting all the primary data remotely (via phone surveys).
3.7.1. Evaluation standards
The evaluation design and implementation has compiled to the ethical standards and quality assurance
standards and guidelines as per UNICEF35 and UNEG36 guidelines.
Compliance to UNEG/ UNICEF Ethical Norms, and UNEG Guidelines
The evaluation team ensured strict compliance with ‘UNEG Norms and Standards (2017)’ during all stages
of evaluation (inception, design, tools development and testing, data collection & analysis, and
reporting/dissemination). The key considerations included:
• Independence, impartiality, and credibility of evaluation judgements
• Accountability and utility of evaluation
• Respect and protection of the Human Rights and Gender Quality

End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
All evaluation team members undertook the UNICEF course on Ethics – ‘Introduction to Ethics in Evidence
Generation’. The evaluators were well acquainted with and applied all reporting standards (content,
structure, presentation, completeness, quality of evidence etc.) as prescribed in 2017 UNICEF adapted
UNEG Evaluation Reports standards (2015), UNICEF Global Evaluation Report Oversight System (GEROS)
Handbook37.
Integration of gender and equity in the evaluation
The evaluation used a gender/equity responsive methodology. For the FLW quantitative survey, since the
sampling population was completely female (AWWs and ASHAs), there was no need for any gender related
consideration in the methodology. However, on the equity side, evaluation team included FLWs from all
the different geographical regions – rural/tribal/urban in the FLW quantitative survey. For the IDIs with
parents/caregivers, equal number of fathers and mothers were included in the IDIs to source perspectives
of both. Also, care was taken to select respondents for caregiver interviews to be presentative of different
social categories and from rural/ tribal/ urban areas.
Also, only female interviews were deployed for the interviews with FLWs and caregivers. During the
analysis, disaggregation by rural/ tribal/urban areas has been take care of and for the IDIs with caregivers,
qualitative analysis was done separately for both fathers and mothers and the results presented
accordingly in the findings section.
Although evaluation did not focus on exploring the children with disability, however, some questions were
included in the FLW survey on child disabilities (seeing, hearing).
3.9 Evaluation Implementation
The ‘Participatory’ approach remains the hallmark of the evaluation. This implies that all key stakeholders
such as implementing partners (CSOs), frontline workers (AWWs and ASHAs), communities and UNICEF
country office staff and state office staff (Maharashtra and Rajasthan) were consulted during different
phases of the evaluation.
The evaluation followed a linear approach comprising of four phases. Each phase included activities
contributing to evaluation deliverables. The visual below shows key phases of the evaluation, timeline and
associated deliverables. The evaluation was undertaken from Feb 2020 to Mar 2021.

3.11 Limitations of the evaluation
• Since the current evaluation was based on a before-after study design, results from the
quantitative findings cannot conclude attribution or contribution completely to the project and
must be interpreted cautiously
• The sampling strategy of selecting about 50% of FLWs who are in the project for around 2 years
and selecting about 50% of the FLWs who are in the project at-least for a year was not possible
due to programmatic constraints/modalities thereby limiting the scope of reasonably linking
(attribution or contribution) of findings to the project
• A pre-post comparison analysis of quantitative data from FLW survey for Rajasthan was
challenging because:
o During the baseline only about 200 FLWs (150 AWWs and 50 ASHAs) have been
interviewed in two intervention districts of Rajasthan
o These 200 respondents were spread across 24 blocks of two intervention districts (14
blocks in Udaipur and 10 blocks in Dungarpur) during baseline
o For the current evaluation, since the evaluation team considered only blocks where the
intervention has been at-least for a year, the team was able to select respondents from 8
blocks from the two intervention districts (5 in Dungarpur and 3 in Udaipur) – therefore,
the results of evaluation comparing the two different geographic scope during baseline
and end-line must be interpreted cautiously
• Absence of project theory of change (ToC)/logic model or project performance measurement
framework before the initiation of project limits assessment of achievement/progress of results
concretely. However, the available generic ToC was reconstructed during inception phase in a
retrospective manner. Wherever possible, an attempt has been made to align the outputs and
immediate outcomes with the KEQs/ SEQs.
• Assessing the sustainability of the intervention from the cost-benefit perspective is out the scope
of the current evaluation
• Since due to COVID-19 circumstances, some of the sections from FLW quantitative survey has
been dropped, the KEQs related to these dropped sections were answered qualitatively only

4. KEY EVALUATION FINDINGS
4.1. Relevance
EQ1: To what extent is the parenting programme delivered by FLWs in the community (‘the
intervention’) relevant to the caregivers in selected districts of Maharashtra and Rajasthan?
SEQ 1.1: What needs of parents/caregivers are being addressed and how well?
The parenting project is addressing the most pressing needs of parents with regard to child development
and care. The intervention strives to build the capacity of frontline workers to enable them to deliver
quality early childhood development (ECD) services to parents and other caregivers.
Discussions reveal that parental needs regarding the care and development of children center around
providing proper nutrition, maintaining health and hygiene, taking care of children and engaging in play
activities. While a majority of the parents are able to fulfil needs related to nutrition, health and hygiene,
gaps exist in the knowledge and practices regarding other important aspects of early learning and
responsive parenting.
To bridge this gap, frontline workers are acting as an important communication channel to disseminate
vital information to the communities. Being residents of the same villages enables them to interact freely
with families, providing requisite information.

Most of the caregivers (especially mothers) note that meetings with frontline workers have helped
increase their understanding regarding different aspects of ECD such as parent-child interaction, play and
stimulation, child discipline, immunization, nutrition and feeding practices, health and hygiene, education,
and has increased the level of engagement with their children. One of the most important aspects of the
intervention has been its focus on the social and emotional needs of the child, and frontline workers have
been educating more and more caregivers regarding its importance for holistic development.
As can be observed in the figure above, there have been improvements in terms of FLWs encouraging
caregivers to combine play and communication activities with occasion of feeding, bathing, dressing etc.
and counselling parents to play and communicate with the child while doing household
chores.
During the interviews, many parents (especially mothers) reported being satisfied with the counselling
provided by the FLWs and were happy to see the changes in their child’s growth and development after
adopting ECD practices. However, this was more of a qualitative reflection from the caregivers and could
not be substantiated with any other quantitative data as the current evaluation only included qualitative
interviews with caregivers.
Earlier we were not so worried about cleanliness but after knowing its importance we are now more
aware. (Father of 0-3 years old, Dungarpur)
The counselling (provided by AWW) on childcare and development was quite helpful. We learnt about
various needs of the children and the ways to handle their problems and how to better communicate
with them. (Mother of 3-6 years old, Pimpri, Pune)
I am completely satisfied with them (AWW/ASHA). Because of them I was able to know how we should
take care of the child, how to feed them. They told us what we should feed our child so that they
would grow and when we feed that to our child, we see the result. (Mother of 0-3 years old, Girwa,
Udaipur)
I received counselling regarding taking care of children, to give emphasis on their games and sports,
to take care about their food, to give them vaccines on time, like for polio, to play with them, to take
care of them, not to leave them alone and to feed them with our hand. (Mother of 0-3 years old,
Girwa, Udaipur)
Children are emotionally attached with their parents. Mother is the first teacher of a child. She can
teach those things which a teacher cannot teach. Family is the first school of a child. A child enters
the school at the age of 5 but a mother can teach a child from a very early age. (District government
official, Aurangabad)
For a long time, we have been providing messages to the parents, and creating awareness, but we
weren't getting the exact output in a way we wanted. Because the parents were not aware about how
to apply their knowledge in practice for their kids, and that is exactly what we are doing in ECD.
(District government official, Aurangabad)
SEQ 1.2: Are other relevant caregivers in the household also being addressed?
The responsibility for the care and development of children does not lie solely with the parents. Other
members of the family such as the grandparents, in-laws, and elder siblings, even neighbors, are involved
in the upbringing of children. Given their active engagement, it becomes vital to educate and counsel these
caregivers about the importance of ECD practices since their opinions on parenting practices influence
the childcare methods adopted in the family.
Page|61
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
The intervention provided numerous platforms and opportunities for engagement with and participation
of other caregivers; with an increase in the interactions between the FLWs and other caregivers, during
home-visits and other meetings. The two major platforms utilized for the same are home visits and
anganwadi meetings. A majority of the parents note that frontline workers interact with all members of
the family during their visits and share information regarding various aspects of child development and
care. Caregivers, other than parents, are also invited to the meetings and events organized at the
Anganwadi. They are often invited to the Anganwadi and are taught proper childcare practices to enhance
the wellbeing of the child.
The qualitative interviews reveal that many caregivers, besides parents, started attending meetings and
events organized by FLWs. For example, in urban areas, grandparents attend meetings on behalf of the
parents who have gone out for work. Since the content for the training and counselling sessions are made
for the family in general, it is easy to engage all kinds of caregivers in order to change social norms around
parenting and childcare. The frontline workers are trained to identify the needs of the family members
and provide appropriate counselling support. For example, the ‘Palak Melawa’, a community-based event
in Maharashtra, is being utilized to spread awareness regarding ECD among the community members.
We also invite the grandparents to the anganwadi. If it’s not possible for both to come, either the
grandfather or the grandmother comes. Along with them, the aunties of the children also visit the
Anganwadis. Therefore, whenever they come, we explain these things again and again. (Lady
Supervisor, Udaipur)
SEQ1.3: To what extent does the intervention factor in gender aspects?
The intervention strives to factor in different gender aspects such as bias against the girl child, son
preference, unequal care, and even the division of responsibilities of childcare between the mother and
the father.
The communication materials38 distributed as part of the intervention have subtle messages highlighting
the importance of gender equality and the frontline workers are trained to disseminate those messages
to sensitise the communities. For example, while developing the training content, the illustrations in the
parenting guides and activity banks were kept gender-neutral, with no specific activities assigned to boys
or girls.
In the baseline study, it was found that fathers did not play a major role in the lives of the children. They
did not take an active interest in their lives and only interacted with the children occasionally. It was also
revealed that childcare activities were considered to be outside the father’s domain. To address this,
messages were included in the communication material to educate fathers regarding their parenting
responsibilities. Frontline workers are provided with training in order to build their capacities to interact
with fathers and provide appropriate counselling support.
Moreover, frontline workers have organized meetings and events, especially for fathers (baba palak
sabha39, father’s meeting etc.), in order to encourage participation and increase their engagement in
childcare. For example, to encourage the participation of fathers, a blackboard was created for the child
in the house. Frontline workers called all the fathers and distributed blackboard paint, explaining its uses.
This was a great platform that highlighted the role of the fathers.

Initially, one of the parents in Aurangabad block whom I would like to quote, one of the fathers shared
with us that, when he used to enter his house his kids used to only look at him and rather hide from
him. Because when he came from outside, he used to shout at them, or he told them not to talk or
play. But after (programme), he said he is now spending 30-45 minutes daily with his kids to play
after he freshens up in the evenings. This example has encouraged other parents as well. (District
government official, Aurangabad)
Earlier they (parents) wouldn't immunize the girl child. But if there is a boy child, they would take care
of him nicely and would take him to the hospital. But now it's not like that. They take their girl child
for immunization. If the girl child catches fever, then also they take her to the hospital. Earlier if the
girl would catch fever, they would keep her at home and treat her at home. And they wouldn't take
her to hospital. But it's not like that now. (ASHA Supervisor, Yavatmal)
No, nowadays it is (difference in care provided to girl and boy child) not that much, previously there
used to be, now whether a girl studies or boy studies it is equal in both cases. Nowadays whatever
children we have, one or two, all are generally educated and developed. (Lady Supervisor, Dungarpur)
SEQ 1.4: Are the gender aspects responsive to the context and UNICEF’s gender programming ambitions?
The intervention follows UNICEF's gender programming ambitions. As per UNICEF staff members, the
gender guidelines are ingrained in all projects undertaken by UNICEF. These standards are adhered to
from the beginning, when partnerships are established and plans are made to address gender in the
project and through the partnerships. The UNICEF implementation team does not approve a project
unless it adheres to the gender aspects.
For the parenting project, the project team made a conscious effort to engage all family members such as
the fathers and the grandparents, to create channels for open communication and participation. Gender
aspects are inculcated in the training and communication materials developed as part of the intervention.
Moreover, the content developed has gone through a purposive screening to check if any form of gender
bias is present in the material.
The areas where the intervention is being implemented experience high incidence of gender
discrimination, making the gender guidelines extremely relevant for these regions. For example, women
in Rajasthan do not even count the girl child when asked how many children they have. Thus, it is
imperative to keep these biases in mind on the field, while interacting with mothers from these areas.
Similarly, discussions have been conducted with the frontline workers to understand issues or
preconceived biases they might have, while on the field. For example, when conducting home visits with
both parents present in the room, it was revealed that the frontline workers would maintain eye contact
with the mother and mostly ignore the father. To address such concerns, training has been provided to
frontline workers so that they are able to interact more effectively with fathers and other members of the
family. Improvement on this front are evident in the quantitative data which shows an increase in the
confidence level of FLWs when interacting with male caregivers about various aspects of childcare and
development in comparison to the baseline.
Although it is easy to control for biases in the written material and content, it is difficult to adhere to these
standards while taking training or delivering it to the frontline workers. The UNICEF team strives to script
these aspects to the extent possible into the training material, but the implementation and use of the
material by the supervisors is out of the purview of the team.
SEQ 1.5: To what extent does the intervention factor in equity aspects?
The intervention is being implemented in some of the most backward areas of the districts and tribal
blocks where the majority of the families are illiterate and below the poverty line (BPL). For example, for
Page|63
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
equal representation, both the urban and tribal populations in Maharashtra have been considered, since
the challenges in the two communities are different.
Although no special module has been designed, equity aspects are subtly ingrained into project activities.
For example, frontline workers are encouraged to engage with the socially and economically
disadvantaged sections, harder to reach populations, and children with special needs. Many frontline
workers reveal that they are utilizing home visits to increase their interactions with families from
vulnerable sections to encourage them to avail services from the Anganwadi. In addition, most of the
frontline workers reveal that they are now able to provide support to parents of children with special
needs.
To ensure access for even the most vulnerable families, FLWs are encouraged to interact in the local
language and use the communication materials to aid understanding during training sessions. Frontline
workers also teach parents to use locally available materials to make toys and play material for the
children, making this accessible for even the poorest families. The activities for the children included in
the communication material were also easily modifiable as per the space available in the house without
any assumptions on set space availability.
During the pandemic, in the state of Maharashtra, communication shifted to digital platforms such as
WhatsApp and Facebook. However, families who did not have access to mobile phones were visited by
frontline workers who shared messages around ECD using pictures and communication materials. The
training sessions have empowered the frontline workers to independently take steps to focus more on
the underprivileged families in their communities.
SEQ 1.6: Are the equity aspects responsive to the context and UNICEF’s equity programming ambitions?
The intervention is responsive to UNICEF's equity programming ambitions and strives to factor in
differences, not only at the regional level, but also at the household level. For example, the intervention
has developed activities taking into account different household characteristics such as the kind of
material easily available in the house, space constraints, etc.
The project focused on children (girl and boy below 6 years) in general and did not have a specific focus
on children with special needs. But, the training sessions with supervisors usually included conversations
around these children and how different activities can be modified in order to increase their access to ECD
services. While not exclusively included in the training material, the intervention tries to influence the
thinking of the supervisors and frontline workers to focus on inclusivity and pay special attention to
vulnerable groups.
Interviews with UNICEF staff members from Maharashtra reveal that training regarding children with
disabilities are technical and full of terminologies and concepts that are difficult to grasp. To overcome
this, the intervention follows a different approach designed to make the frontline workers think and
understand activities from the child’s point of view. For example, if a FLW observes that a child with a
disability is unable to hold a small thing, he/she can replace it with something big, that is easy to hold. The
idea is to improve the access of ECD activities for these children, even if FLWs are unable to identify the
disability that the child is suffering from.
EQ2: To what extent is the training that FLWs receive to deliver the intervention relevant
and adequate for the target population (parents/caregivers of child)?
SEQ 2.1: Did the training address ways to change cultural beliefs and attitudes around parenting?
The interviews with frontline workers reveal common cultural beliefs and attitudes regarding parenting
and early childhood development prevailing in their respective villages. Many frontline workers agree that
blind beliefs and practices without proper counselling can, in fact, be detrimental to child’s wellbeing.

Common practices such as not feeding breastmilk to newborn babies, bathing sick babies, not immunizing
young children, and reliance on traditional remedies, are still prevalent (mostly in Rajasthan) despite their
negative impact on child health and development.
During qualitative interviews, frontline workers in general reported how training and repeated counselling
sessions on responsive parenting and care have helped them make progress within their communities
and shift towards modern, scientific practices. In their meetings, frontline workers counsel parents and
other caregivers about old traditions and superstitions that might have a negative impact on child
development and health. For example, frontline workers encourage mothers to breastfeed babies for the
first six months, citing numerous benefits for child health and development. Earlier, many families would
deliver babies at home, without proper medical attention at hand. However, many frontline workers
report a change in such behaviours with more and more parents opting to go to hospitals for institutional
deliveries. They also report a gradual positive change, although a long way to go still (especially in
Rajasthan), in mindsets and attitudes of parents and other caregivers devoting more time towards
children and their development. This corroborates with the evidence from research in 11 low and middle-
income countries which shows that encouraging caregivers to play and interact with their children 0-3
years can increase the time and resources parents invest in their children’s development40.
These findings are corroborated by parents who acknowledge the usefulness of the counselling provided
to them, sharing various positive experiences on following the advice given by the frontline workers on
child development and care. For example, many parents have noted the health benefits of providing
proper nutrition to their children. Anganwadi enrolment rates have also increased as parents realise the
importance of early childhood education in the lives of their children41. The review of the communication
material evidenced that Information elicited in the communication packages focused on changing cultural
beliefs and attitudes towards parenting with a key focus on what, why and how of responsive parenting.
Parents also reveal that interactions with frontline workers are useful in busting old myths and cultural
beliefs prevailing in their villages related to child development and care and help them to change their
mindsets.
Earlier, when children came in between the works of mothers, they scolded at first but now they
engage their children in their work so that they can learn. Now beating and scolding has been very
less. So, this attitude is changing gradually. (Lady Supervisor, Aurangabad)
Old age people say that if you will not let a child drink water then the child would suffer from a disease
called (“Sukhkal”). The old aged people gave ‘ajwain’ and ‘gudpani’ to the child who has just taken
birth because they don't want the baby to get ill. In this generation people don't do this but if the old
age people in the home say to do it, then they definitely do it. This is not good, there is still this method
and tradition present in society. (AWW, Udaipur)
We face a lot of problems; Suppose the child is suffering from jaundice or measles, if I suggest they
(caregivers) take the child to hospital they will tell “No, it is the incarnation/blessings of God”. (AWW,
Udaipur)
Beliefs like not giving the mother’s milk for the first three days are not good for the child. Baby needs
mother’s milk. We all know that we cannot give a baby anything to eat for 6 months (besides breast
milk). The old generation people say to give the baby biscuit & milk, we try to say that it's wrong, we
shouldn't give them anything to eat for 6 months but they don't listen. (AWW, Udaipur)

Yes, they (old beliefs) are harmful for children. We are talking with community people in the meetings
and pay home visits to make them aware, educate and sensitize them on child development,
immunization, malnourishment, growth of the child, education etc. They are listening to our advice
and a positive change in attitude is slowly being seen. (ASHA, Dungarpur)
Yes, there were some old beliefs but not now. Previously, when a baby was born then people gave
them honey, but now parents give them mother's milk. These things didn’t happen before but are
happening now. I can say it is a progress. They also used eyeliner for the baby but now most of them
are not using it. Most blind faiths are not followed now. (AWW, Aurangabad)
Earlier when people followed their grandparents, they didn’t breastfeed the child for 2 -3 days but
now only after 30 minutes of delivery breastfeeding is done.
The parents who followed the age-old traditions, for them it’s a serious damage to their baby. Also,
people didn't give the doses on time but now people are more serious about the doses (immunization).
(AWW, Aurangabad)
Some people have traditional views and treat their children traditionally. But nowadays, it doesn't
happen. Now, mothers give treatment to their child according to the doctor’s advice if he/she is sick.
In the past, children were treated according to cultural beliefs, like some cultural thread is tied to
their arm. But now, if anyone gets sick, like stomach pain, dysentery then we give ORS packet first.
And if it is not cured, then the mother takes the child to the doctor. (ASHA, Palghar)
In the past, people cut the umbilical cord of the baby at home by hand and now it is being done in
the hospital. We also tell them to keep the tiles clean of their house and at least use a sterilized blade
for cutting the umbilical cord if some are doing it at home even after repeated counseling. But mostly,
the delivery process is happening at the hospital. (AWW, Aurangabad)
Earlier when Anganwadi teachers used to go to their (caregivers’) houses they didn't pay respect but
now they say please come and sit. If they advise anything they listen and agree to implement that or
to do that for the kids. (ASHA/Anganwadi Supervisor, Palgarh)
Earlier, people didn’t talk with us and didn’t want to listen to us, but nowadays they welcome the
caregivers and offer them seats and greet them in a very respectful way. People did not bother to
listen to us as they thought that it was our job to convince them, but now things have changed, and
they appreciate our work. (Lady Supervisor, Udaipur)
SEQ 2.2: Did the training address the gender and equity-based challenges the frontline worker experience?
Interviews with frontline workers reveal that progress has been made on the gender front. Reiterating this,
many government officials highlight a positive change in mindsets of FLWs in their respective areas and
speak about numerous government schemes, such as the ‘Majhi Kanya Bhagyashree’ and ‘Bhagyashree
Yojana’ launched in Maharashtra, that help to educate parents and spread awareness regarding gender
equality
However, challenges do exist in many parts where children continue to face discrimination such as parents
being biased in favour of the male child (son preference), neglecting the girl child's care and diet,
neglecting the girl child’s education, and even aborting the girl child in some cases. Another form of gender
discrimination that has been widely reported is the low involvement of the fathers in parenting (especially
in Rajasthan), with childcare duties being essentially seen as the mother’s responsibility.
Page|66
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
While challenges exist, many frontline workers report that the training sessions on responsive parenting
and care have equipped them with the required confidence and skills to counsel parents and other
caregivers about the importance of gender equality and helped them make progress towards achieving a
more gender neutral mindset in their communities. Supervisors also note instances of fathers taking a
more active role in their children’s lives - playing with them, bringing them to the Anganwadi and,
sometimes, even attending the meetings and events organized by the frontline workers, although still low.
On the equity front, the two most commonly reported challenges are the inability of caregivers to provide
minimum care to children from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds and the stigma
surrounding children with disabilities. Frontline workers reveal facing several difficulties in counselling
parents from weaker sections since a majority do not have the means, or even the will, to provide optimal
care for the development of their children. Moreover, such families are largely uneducated, making it
difficult to achieve significant progress even after repeated counselling and home visits.
Faced with these challenges, frontline workers highlight how the training received helps them manage
difficult situations and persevere. Some common solutions discussed are - collaborating with other
workers for problem solving, discussions with higher level officials like supervisors, repeated counselling,
and home visits. The FLWs take active steps to ensure that the ECD services are provided to every
household in their community including the families located in remote locations. In Udaipur, for example,
the FLWs travel in groups of 2-3 through the mountainous region to reach out to families located in remote
communities.
Even today there are prejudices regarding a girl child. Every time we pay a visit to their (caregivers’)
home we have complaints of taunting the mother for the birth of a girl child. We have to make the
family understand the importance of a girl child and it is not in the hands of mother or anyone if she
is giving birth to a male or a female child. Also, we make them understand that a girl is a gift of god
to the family and the society too. (ASHA, Palgarh)
I have come across many situations where mothers are mostly held responsible for childcare while
there is low involvement of fathers in childcare. For instance, if the mother goes to work somewhere,
she has to return home early to look after their children whereas it is not the case with the father.
(AWW, Pune)
There are few such things which are still happening. If someone has 3 daughters, then they continue
giving birth until they have a son. So, we tell these people that it is not in our hands, both a girl and
a boy are equal. Our training has taught us a lot on how to convey such sensitive messages to people.
(ASHA, Palgarh)
We counsel them (caregivers) about the importance of equality. Now they don't discriminate against
boys and girls. They treat girls as much as they treat boys. Now they pamper girls more than boys
and love them more. (AWW, Yavatmal)
We have one disabled baby girl in our village. Her parents never pay attention to her. When we
counselled them about the treatment and its importance, only then they got treatment for her at the
hospital. But after 2-3 months, she is still ill. Her parents still ignore her and don’t care. (ASHA,
Yavatmal)
We have to tell those (economically/socially weak) parents again and again. They are unable to
understand it easily...and they all remain busy in their work, in farming, so we go to visit their homes
Page|67
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
and there we tell them about Aanganwadi services, vaccination program, about their children’s
education and care. (AWW, Aurangabad)
Yes, change is occurring. Before, they didn’t treat them equally, but now we explain to them that both
boys and girls are equal. Both boys and girls are equally qualified to do everything. Whatever boys
can do, the girls could also do the same.
In their (caregivers’) old days, both will be there to help. I explain to them that there is nothing like a
boy or girl, both are the same. I even give examples from our own village that there are such families
where instead of boys, the girls are taking care of their parents in their old days. After that I have
observed a change in them. Now most of them don’t have any kind of partiality between boy and girl
child. (AWW, Udaipur)
Children who are from the economically & socially weaker sections are usually physically weak and
need extra care and they need to be fed several types of protein rich foods. Their parents are not able
to provide good healthcare and education to their children. In the training it was specifically told to
try to reach the vulnerable groups, so we do it as much as possible. (ASHA, Udaipur)
We provide information to all the families whether they are poor or rich and I personally inform them
(AWWs) not to leave a single family while counselling in the meetings. (Lady Supervisor, Dungarpur)
Yes, we face some challenges. The parents from weaker sections are both working, and they don’t give
much time to their children or attend meetings. So, when I meet them, I try to convince them to give
some time to their children and think about their development. (ASHA, Dungarpur)

Inspiring scores of workers – A Lady Supervisor
Some events have the power to bring about great change in the lives of many. For Ms. Vandana Nanote of
Yavatmal district, Maharashtra the Early Childhood Development (ECD) intervention was such an event. She
has been working as a lady supervisor since 1993 and managing 32 Anganwadi Centers under her. Especially,
she is grateful to the intervention for giving her the opportunity to significantly upgrade her basket of knowledge
about the issues of mothers and children.
Through the intervention, the lady supervisor learnt more about child development, practices to be adopted by
pregnant mothers, health, and nutrition and others, which gave her the self-confidence to counsel mothers and
caregivers. With her new-found knowledge, she came to understand the benefits of physical and mental
stimulation for holistic development of children; and the ills of harsh punishment such as scolding and beating
young children.
The knowledge and confidence gained by the lady supervisor was gradually passed down to the frontline
workers (FLWs). Vandana trained, encouraged, and motivated the frontline workers on early childhood
development and care. She tried to remove their fear of talking to people and built their confidence to provide
counselling to both mothers and fathers in the community. The FLWs weren’t scolded when they made mistakes,
instead, they were encouraged, appreciated, and shown how to do things in a better manner. With time, the
FLWs enhanced their knowledge and skill set, which attracted a greater number of parents to listen to the FLWs
at Anganwadi centers and during home visits and created demand for new knowledge among them.
Through meetings and home visits, parents and other caregivers were taught about nutrition, practices to take
care of the breastfeeding mothers and pregnant women, playing with babies, responsive parenting and care.
Earlier, toys were bought without any thought, but now parents were taught games that would positively impact
child development. They were taught how to use everyday household objects and activities like cooking and
washing to play with kids and teach them new things. Posters and charts were used to help parents understand
these concepts, which made counselling easy and effective.
The ECD intervention’s activities led to an increase in people’s interest in learning more about child development,
and important ECD practices. Earlier, only mothers attended meetings related to childcare, however, the
intervention made fathers realize their parenting duties and many of them started to attend parent’s meetings
and home visits. In addition, separate meetings were arranged for parents based on the age brackets of their
children. Because of this, parents experienced significant improvements in their knowledge base regarding early
childhood development and incorporated this in guiding their children towards better physical, cognitive, social
and emotional development.
Vandana experienced the positive impact of the ECD intervention on two fronts. One as a woman, for the
development of the children in her area. The second as a lady supervisor, for improving the knowledge and
skills of the frontline workers. She is confident that both fronts would help in the betterment of the children and
positively impact the growth story of the communities.

EQ3: To what extent is the intervention aligned to the broader objectives of the project?
SEQ 3.1: How relevant is the strategy (promoting parental involvement) for ensuring quality early childhood
development?
The project is designed to build the capacities of frontline workers to enable them to improve quality and
coverage of services. The first six years of a child’s life are crucial in determining the future quality of life;
hence, it becomes imperative to train and educate parents regarding proper ECD practices.
To achieve this, in Maharashtra the cascade training model has been adopted to train frontline workers,
who ultimately disseminate the requisite counselling on parenting and ECD to the target beneficiaries. In
the model, the project staff train the supervisors (master trainers), who in turn train the frontline workers,
who finally train parents and other caregivers in the community. The project has undergone a continuous
cycle of iterations since its implementation, with many additions and deletions after collecting experiences
from the field.
In Rajasthan, the project was aligned with the ongoing government programs and cascading model was
not adopted as in Maharashtra. The project grew organically in Rajasthan building in from the experiences
in the field. It started from small rounds of pilot to gradual roll-out of nutrition and education interventions
across the blocks in the two intervention districts. For more details on project implementation, please
refer to Annexure 03.
To improve the counselling support provided to the parents, both the communication style of the frontline
workers and the material itself required changes. For example, in districts of Udaipur and Dungarpur,
particular dialects are used by the parents. In order to ensure effective communication, it was decided
that frontline workers would make use of local words and terms while interacting with parents.
The emphasis of the project was on building the skills of those who immediately engage with the children
through home visits and on initiating dialogue on child care among mothers and other caregivers (tried to
influence the social norms) by conducting parents’ meetings and community-based events. Review of the
communication material also revealed that the project focuses on an intergenerational approach wherein
mothers and children attend sessions together and perform activities together, which is known to lead to
greater impact.
In Maharashtra, another major achievement is the successful alignment of the project with the state
AAKAR curriculum. The intervention keeps the curriculum as a reference point and engages with the
children in front of the parents to ensure they understand the essence of the project activities. The
intervention is using existing resources to make changes on ground, indicating the cost effectiveness and
scalability of the project, and its ability to reach all the caregivers using minimal resources (efficiency).
Given the context, the strategy of the intervention to promote parental involvement for ensuring quality
early childhood development is highly relevant and valid.
When we talk of Poshan Abhiyan, when we talk of nutrition or women and child in our country, we
basically focus on all very urgent kind of issues. But we should understand that to make these urgent
kinds of issues less urgent in the future, we need to start working on ECD. (State government official,
Maharashtra)
In our area, playing with children, bringing toys for the children are treated as waste of time. But we
have seen the change in this type of thinking. The way the parents talk to their children has changed.
They have started doing many activities with the children in between their work too. The bond is being
formed very nicely and the parents have started understanding their children. (State Government
Official, Maharashtra)

SEQ 3.2: How do the envisaged activities and outputs improve quality of counselling and
communication support to parents/caregivers?
In the interviews, frontline workers discuss how training and capacity building on responsive parenting
and care have improved their counselling skills, increased their confidence and aided in providing effective
counselling support to parents and other caregivers. The training sessions provide frontline workers with
new information and techniques that lead to better communication of key messages with their
communities. FLWs are encouraged to communicate in the local language/ dialect and are provided with
communication materials to aid easy understanding.
Stakeholders observed that after the advent of the project, meetings have become more interactive and
are able to engage caregivers better. A government official from Maharashtra explained how the duration
of the home visits increased from around 5-10 minutes to about 30 minutes since the advent of the ECD
project. In addition to this, the ASHA and Anganwadi workers now conduct home visits and parents’
meetings together, which has further led to an improvement in the quality of these platforms.
In Maharashtra, the improvement is evident in the change in the manner in which mothers’ meetings are
conducted. Earlier, the meetings consisted of the ASHA workers delivering information in the form of a
lecture to a group of mothers. Nowadays, however, both the ASHA and the Anganwadi worker (sometimes
accompanied by the supervisor) conduct the meetings, which have now become more interactive in
nature. Such synergies between AWW and ASHA were not widely reported by stakeholders in Rajasthan.
Use of locally found materials to make play materials, dancing, singing and other activities make the
sessions more enjoyable for the participants and improve communication between the caregivers and
frontline workers. Frontline workers used an evidence-based communication strategy by demonstrating
the activities with the children in front of the caregivers. This ensured that the caregivers understood the
‘why’ behind the activity and could adopt it easily in their daily routines.
As an Anganwadi worker, when I visit someone’s home, I feel more confident after the training! In the
training we were taught to speak in the language which is comfortable to the community members,
so I now explain things to them in Babri. Now I am more aware of the things and can explain better
to the community members than before. (AWW, Dungarpur)
The way they (ASHA/AWW) interacted has quite changed and the way they provided counselling has
also improved. (Mother of 0-3 years old, Pune)
After ECD (project) and making quality home visits, ASHAs have now become a prominent personality
of their village. Now every child, adolescent, women of every household could recognise ASHA and
she is involved in major activities of the village. (Government official, Yavatmal)
Initially some of the mothers came and sat only for 15 minutes and some of them never came but
now they are coming with interest because they are getting to learn new things and stay the entire
duration of the meeting. The quality of home visits and mothers meetings have improved a lot.
(Government official, Yavatmal)
The training was helpful. Due to the training they (FLWs) are able to counsel caregivers on various
aspects of child development which they themselves didn't know before the training. (Lady Supervisor,
Palgarh)

At the Forefront – An Anganwadi Worker
For many years, Veena, an Anganwadi worker from Palghar district of Maharahstra, has been at the forefront of providing
important government services to mothers and children in her community. From visiting pregnant women and asking them
to register their names at Anganwadi, giving them MCP cards, to providing essential services to pregnant women, lactating
mothers, and children; Veena has done it all. Earlier, people in her community would give birth at home and give honey and
water to newborns. However, Veena has been successful in making them understand the benefits of institutional delivery and
importance of mother’s milk for the child and the harm of giving anything other than that.
Through the parenting and Early Childhood Development (ECD) intervention, Veena got training on methods of talking to
children and counseling parents on the innovative methods designed for the physical, cognitive, emotional, and social
development of children. For example, she would teach caregivers the importance of treating children with love and care,
and counsel them against beating and other harsh forms of punishment. She would also teach pregnant women the
importance of the first 1000 days - things to do during pregnancy and lactation, and educate mothers on child health and
nutrition using pictures and flipchart which were easy to understand and remember.
During home visits and parent’s meetings, Veena would teach parents and grandparents effective ways of looking after
children, and would also demonstrate different ways to stimulate the child. For example, she would show parents how to use
vegetables available at home to teach kids about colors, shapes, and counting. She would encourage parents to engage their
children in innovative activities such as drawing and colouring. Parents would learn whatever was taught during meetings
and home visits and try to repeat these activities at home, with their children.
Veena revealed that whatsapp numbers of parents were taken and categorized into different groups according to the age
bracket (0-3 years or 3-6 years old) of their children and whether they were pregnant or lactating. Using this, Veena would
disseminate messages related to ECD and share relevant audio/video content with parents over whatsapp. For parents who
did not own smartphones, Veena would show them the videos on her own phone when she would visit them during home
visits.
According to Veena, she faced some challenges in her community. For example, initially, the attendance of parents at
Anganwadi meetings was low. Also, since many parents did not own smartphones, it was difficult for her to share all the
messages with them. Veena also reported that people of the older generation, such as the grandparents, resisted the new
methods being taught on childcare and development and she found it difficult to convince them. She would also face
challenges when both parents were working, as it became difficult to attend the meetings and they were seldom available for
home visits.
However, with time and perseverance, Veena has been able to convince parents and other caregivers regarding the
importance of ECD for the development of children. As people realized the benefits of the positive parenting and ECD, they
became more receptive and attendance improved. Fathers also started engaging with their children, whenever they got time
after work in the evenings.
Veena has found huge potential in the parenting intervention and observed its positive impact on herself, caregivers and
larger community. She is proud of her role as the beneficiary-facing functionary and believes that if her whole community
accepts the parenting and early childhood intervention wholeheartedly, it would be awarded with enhanced well-being of its
children, which would boost the welfare of the community as well.

EQ4: To what extent is the intervention aligned to the priorities of the government and
other partners, specifically the Early Childhood Development strategies and plans?
SEQ 4.1: To what extent the intervention is aligned to the state ECE curriculum?
The intervention and the state ECE curriculum are similarly aligned in their goals and objectives in both
the states (Maharashtra and Rajasthan). However, in terms of scope and implementation, the intervention
is different when compared to other programmes around preschool education. While early childhood
development focuses on children from conception upto the age of six, the focus of preschool education
is on the age group 3-6 years. Moreover, earlier programmes have focused more on preschool education
and nutrition while neglecting other aspects of development. Thus, the present intervention is
supplementing the efforts of earlier programmes such as the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
scheme by bringing in aspects related to responsive parenting and cognitive development.
The intervention strives to prepare young children to attend formal schooling by exposing them to play
and stimulation to enable early learning and development. For children who have already been exposed
to such activities at home, the preschool education that is part of the Anganwadi centres becomes even
more beneficial. While the ECE curriculum tries to enhance the level of activities that are provided to
children in the 3-6 years age group in the Anganwadi centres, the goal of the intervention is to enhance
the capacities of the parents and increase the level of engagement with their children. To do so, it is
important to align the activities being conducted at home with those that are being organized at the
Anganwadi centres and encourage complementarities between the two.
Interviews with UNICEF staff from Rajasthan reveal that the competency that was available in the
curriculum has been used as the base for developing the ECD messages. The creative skills for the age
group 3-5 years present in the curriculum and the UNICEF early learning development scale have been
used to develop the messages and the training manual. This is further corroborated by the analysis of the
communication material which showed that the material for caregivers focusing on the 3-6 age group is
aligned to the state ECE curriculum. Many activities have been picked from the curriculum and redesigned
so they are suitable for learning at home, making use of the same principles and the same language. The
alignment between the two is also evident in project objectives since they strive for the smooth transition
of children from the 0-3 to the 3-6 years age group.
In Maharashtra, while there are many similarities between the AAKAR curriculum and the intervention,
the scope of AAKAR is limited to brief conferences, corner meetings and information related to
motherhood. However, the present intervention is helping parents apply the learnings disseminated by
frontline workers in their daily activities. AAKAR is the state government’s curriculum for ECE in
Maharashtra, while the parent meetings, as part of the intervention, involve all aspects of physical, social
and emotional, motor, language and literacy development. While AAKAR has an objective of making the
Anganwadi children school ready, the parent meetings explain what being school ready actually
entails. During the pandemic period, the AAKAR curriculum has been used to convert 80 activity
suggestions into video and audio formats, which were then made available to the Anganwadis for parents
to make children learn at home.
It (ECD project) is aligned (with state ECE curriculum). Because the activities which we conduct during
the pre-school education, that comes under early stimulation. If early stimulation is being given by
the activities, then the child comes with preparation. I said that previously there was insecurity. But
now children come to the Anganwadi with a sense of security which is helpful for them to establish a
good rapport with the AWW and to get used to the environment. It has become very easy for them
because of that early stimulation. It is also becoming easier for the Anganwadi workers for taking
pre-school education in Anganwadi because the environment which they need for their development,
Page|73
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
they are getting that from their home. Now the development is happening as per their age, which
should happen. (State govt official, Maharashtra)
SEQ 4.2: What are the existing activities that are being planned or carried out by the government and other
partners under ECD in the two States?
There are a number of existing ECD activities being carried out by the government and other partners in
the two states. For example, in Maharashtra the AAKAR curriculum is being implemented under which the
monthly syllabus for children in the age group 3-6 years is designed to be used in the teachings provided
in the Anganwadis.
The ICDS scheme is similarly aligned with a focus on health, nutrition, preschool education and hygiene.
In collaboration with UNICEF, the scheme developed a yearlong calendar composed of messages to be
shared with parents in Rajasthan. In addition, the ICDS is planning to provide workbooks containing
activities for children in the age group 3-5 years. For the Parent Anganwadi Meeting (PAM), orientation of
the Anganwadi workers is being organized as part of their annual work plan.
Delivery of education services to the children through the use of social media and internet are other
schemes that are being carried out by the government in Maharashtra. The Computer-Aided System has
also been implemented by the government where the development indicators of children are regularly
updated into an online database. This is helpful for monitoring the work being done on ground.
In 2018, the Home-Based Care for Young Child (HBYC) Programme was rolled out in Maharashtra and is
in the implementation stage in Rajasthan. The programme aims to improve the nutrition status, growth
and early childhood development of young children (3 months - 2 years), through additional home visits
by the frontline workers. It has also been reported that the government is focusing on expanding the MCP
card statewide in Maharashtra.
A number of community-based events are being conducted under the ‘Poshan Abhiyan’, which was
restarted in 2018. The Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Day (VHNSD), a platform to provide
preventive and development services to the community, is organized monthly in the villages. The
‘Surakhsit Matritva Abhiyan’, a scheme to provide quality antenatal care universally to all pregnant women
free of cost every month is also being implemented in Maharashtra.
Another project in Maharashtra is the ‘Tarang Suposhit’, which is being introduced by the ICDS department,
Rajmata Foundation and UNICEF. This is a digital platform that can be used to reach parents and other
caregivers. It has been developed due to the difficulties the frontline workers have faced in reaching
parents during the pandemic period. UNICEF supported the development of the messages related to
stimulation and development for this platform.
SEQ 4.3: How is the intervention aligned with these activities? What are aspects of similarity/overlap? What are
aspects of difference/divergence?
There are various aspects of similarities and differences between the current intervention and ongoing
government programmes. For example, the intervention is well aligned with the objectives of the
government’s ICDS programme. While ICDS focuses on physical and mental development of children, the
responsive parenting and care intervention brings in aspects of language, cognitive and skill development,
thus complementing the efforts of the ICDS programme. In an interview, a CSO partner highlighted the
need for the current project, stating that the state and district authorities have focused more on the age
group 3-6 years, largely neglecting children in the age group 0-3 years. While ICDS has supported the
nutrition and health aspects of this age group, the development and stimulation side has been ignored
before this intervention. For example, while the MCP card did contain information regarding development,
frontline workers were not using this because they were not aware of its importance earlier.

A UNICEF staff member discussed how the intervention takes a different approach to programme activities
already existing under ICDS. Instead of mechanically performing certain tasks such as weighing the child,
tracking nutrition status, and home visits; the intervention encourages open engagement and focuses on
increasing parental involvement in childcare and development. For example, while weighing the child,
frontline workers now discuss any issues regarding malnutrition and explain what can be done to improve
the nutritional status of the child. The intervention is also heavily influenced by the AAKAR curriculum in
Maharashtra and is trying to move the activities under the curriculum from the centres to the homes.
Many of the government activities mentioned earlier have similar goals as the intervention’s, and work for
the better development of the children in these communities.
The intervention is trying to use existing platforms more efficiently. For example, monthly mothers'
meetings were conducted even before the advent of the intervention where messages for all the age
groups were shared together. However, after the intervention, meetings are being organized separately
for mothers with children from different age groups making the content more relevant and leading to a
spike in the level of interest of the mothers in the community.
In Maharashtra, for the digital media platform, the messages regarding early stimulation and development
were developed by the UNICEF and CSO partner team who provided inputs for nutrition and responsive
feeding. Similarly, while the aim of the HBYC programme aligns well with that of the UNICEF intervention,
the intensity of application of the intervention is greater and has a wider scope with a focus on children
from conception upto six years. Moreover, the training provided to the workers under the UNICEF
intervention has been more intense.
A UNICEF staff member from Maharashtra compares the HYBC programme and the Rashtriya Bal
Swasthya Karyakram being implemented by the government to the present intervention, discussing the
differences in project focus. The two government programmes do not focus on the softer side of ECD such
as the interactions between the parents and the children, instead focusing on more clinical aspects such
as the early identification of defects, development delays, deficiencies and diseases.
SEQ 4.4: Any collaborative efforts and coordination with other partners for convergence?
At the state level, various departments like the Rural Development Department and the Rationing
Department have been involved since the rollout of the project. In Maharashtra, the AAKAR curriculum,
which has heavily influenced the present intervention, has been developed by the ICDS in partnership with
UNICEF and MSCERT (Maharashtra State Council for Education and Research Training). It has been utilized
for the capacity building of the supervisors and the frontline workers.
Interviews with UNICEF staff from Rajasthan reveal that partnerships have been established with various
organizations namely - Vedanta, IPE Global, Pratham, Lupin, Tata Trust and Seva Mandir; for the promotion
of ECD in the state. On the other hand, while Maharashtra does not have organisations working at the
state level, several implementing partners are working at the district levels. For example, in Palghar, at
least 5 NGOs are working in the ECD domain. These organisations are not working in silos but are
operating in a collaborative manner with assistance from ICDS. They are building on AAKAR which is acting
as a bedrock for the design of an intervention and for the assessment of a program. In Maharashtra, most
agencies have been working for ECE, and very few operate in the ECD domain. The government is open to
collaboration as long as a parallel system is not created and they are able to see changes on the
ground.
Another initiative reported by UNICEF staff from Maharashtra is the ECE quality tool, which is a step to
create a common platform so that the efforts of all organizations go hand-in-hand and there is scope to
learn from each other.

4.2. Effectiveness
EQ5: To what extent were the inputs or activities of the intervention delivered as planned,
specifically: development of communication materials, training materials, training of
FLWs?
SEQ 5.1: Were the tools and standards developed to gauge project quality and child development and learning
useful?
In Maharashtra, to gauge the quality of parent’s meetings, the first observation form was developed with
a focus on the behaviour of the frontline workers. This was developed by experts and was aligned to other
ECD tools to collect feedback from the Anganwadis. The tool was added to the ECE quality tool which had
been developed earlier in the state of Maharashtra. The development of the tool was a collaborative effort
involving all relevant stakeholders such as the academic panel with ECD and parenting experts,
representatives of supervisors from Pune and Palgarh, and the block coordinators. Checklists were widely
utilized to monitor home visits, parent’s meetings, and palak melawas, among others. They were also used
for field training, where block coordinators would observe the training sessions and use the checklist to
enter information into a google form in order to discuss loopholes with the supervisors and come up with
effective solutions for the same. In addition, a concurrent monitoring form was used to track the number
of home visits, mothers’ meetings, and any other programme conducted.
In Rajasthan, observation sheets were utilized to measure development changes, if any, in the FLWs and
parents during the course of the project. These observation sheets were filled for both the baseline and
endline periods, to generate reports for the benefit of the team. Interviews with UNICEF staff members
from Rajasthan revealed that tools used for reporting the status of the ECD project to the district and the
state governments were also utilized as monitoring tools by UNICEF. The ECD project made use of the
existing materials and tools that were developed for the government ECD programs like the 1000 days
programme. This meant that no new tools had to be fed into the system, ensuring its sustainability in the
long term.
SEQ 5.2: What were the bottlenecks in terms of implementation, and why?
The intervention faced a number of challenges during implementation. First and foremost, interviews with
UNICEF staff from Rajasthan revealed that UNICEF staff faced some difficulty in convincing state and
district level officials to become a part of the intervention since they were of the view that parents from
socially and economically weaker sections could not play a role in their child’s development – health,
nutrition, childcare and education.
Initially in Rajasthan as reported by a UNICEF staff, training for frontline workers was conducted in the
Anganwadi centres but when centres were closed in the middle of implementation, training had to be
shifted to the sector meetings. Here too, UNICEF faced challenges. Since the sector meetings were being
utilized for administrative purposes before the advent of the intervention, UNICEF had to push hard to
ensure time for training as part of the meeting agenda. Several other training related challenges were also
discussed. AWW Supervisors from Rajasthan reported that allocating time for the training during the
sector meetings was a challenge as most of the time goes into administrative activities.
In Maharashtra, it was reported that sudden data requests from government officials often interrupted
training sessions for the frontline workers. FLWs also experienced training fatigue due to a number of
different trainings, such as the ECD training, CAS training and AAKAR training, being organized in a single
month. Another challenge highlighted by a CSO partner from Maharashtra with implementation was
associated with parent’s meetings and palak sabhas. In Pune and Palghar, in the beginning, 4 meetings a
month were planned, however, both the frontline workers and the parents were not comfortable with this
Page|76
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
arrangement. While frontline workers felt overworked, parents found it difficult to take out time for all the
different activities planned.
It was also noticed that the frontline workers were unable to focus on core activities of the intervention
such as home visits, and mother’s meetings when different vaccination campaigns were ongoing,
particularly in Maharashtra. Thus, there was a need to better utilize these campaigns for carrying out ECD
activities. In addition, interview with CSO partner from Maharashtra revealed that vacancies for
supervisors was a challenge, especially in the remote and tribal areas. This was a major challenge as the
supervisors were responsible for training the frontline workers in the cascading model adopted in
Maharashtra. Because of a shortage of supervisors, some had 70-80 FLWs under them against the norm
of 20-30 FLWs, negatively impacting the quality of supervision as the supervisors found it challenging to
conduct the training sessions.
Most of the time they (FLWs) think that the entire responsibility is being shouldered upon them. They
feel that they are doing all the tasks of the department together. They have to organize everything
including the meetings, co-ordinate the tasks and that makes them think that the government has
imposed a lot of load on them. They feel that they aren't paid enough or respected enough for their
work. (Lady Supervisor, Udaipur)
SEQ 5.3: Was timely corrective action taken, when issues emerged?
As mentioned earlier, initially, government officials at state were not supportive of the intervention. To
convince them, UNICEF staff in Rajasthan highlighted examples from states like Kerala and even countries
abroad and took officials for field visits in order to showcase the interactions between the Anganwadi
workers and the parents. Once officials understood the potential value for child development, sentiments
turned more positive.
Although several training related challenges emerged, efforts were made to resolve these quickly for the
smooth implementation of the intervention. For example, a supervisor from Dungarpur noted that some
frontline workers were not attentive during training sessions; in such cases, supervisors shifted these
frontline workers to the front rows to be able to pay more attention to them. There were also instances
of the less educated frontline workers not being able to grasp what was being taught. To overcome this,
supervisors in Udaipur gave repeated training and asked them to regularly revise whatever was being
taught. They even demonstrated concepts using role-play to aid understanding.
Supervisors also faced resource constraints, although a majority of the time they managed to arrange the
required supplies from nearby places as reported by supervisors from Rajasthan. However, this was
heavily dependent on budgets, which were also constrained at most places.
In Maharashtra, training fatigue presented a major issue when the ECD, ILA and AAKAR training were
combined to establish coordination in the training curriculums. To overcome this, the ECD training
sessions in Maharashtra were skipped in the months when the CAS training was undertaken. Further, the
AAKAR curriculum for the age group 0-3 years, was inculcated in the form of home-based activities. During
the pandemic, when all forms of physical interaction like meetings came to a halt for a long period of time,
the planned activities were implemented using digital platforms. These platforms also helped people stay
connected with the frontline workers and the supervisors.
In Maharashtra, the number of palak sabhas was reduced to 2 meetings a month since frontline workers
and parents were not comfortable with the initially planned 4 meetings. Eventually, palak sabhas became
a part of community-based events, which were already present in the ICDS calendars. Thus, the
intervention became aligned to these events and frontline workers were trained to achieve several
objectives in the same event.
Page|77
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
Similarly, in Maharashtra supervisor vacancies, especially in the remote and tribal areas, were filled by
block coordinators, ASHA facilitators or the project staff themselves, who spent extra time during the
sector meetings on the training of the frontline workers.
SEQ 5.4: To what extent were the FLWs able to use the communication materials/tools in communicating with
parents at the various platforms?
As part of the project, frontline workers were equipped with communication materials in the form of
flipcharts/cards (‘SabRang’ cards in Rajasthan and ‘Samvendasheel palakatv’ in Maharashtra) and posters to
counsel parents. These materials contained information on nutrition, play and engagement, messages for
pregnant women and other ECD related information. The materials not only acted as a guide for the
frontline workers but also contained graphics to make the sessions more interactive.
Figure 4: Reconstructed Theory of Change
It is to be noted that the distribution of communication material is still ongoing and all the FLWs have not
received the communication material still. In Rajasthan, government has taken up the printing and
distribution of communication material (SabRang) cards and is in progress. About three-fourth of AWWs
and more than half of ASHAs in Maharashtra, and about half of AWWs and slightly more than a quarter of
ASHAs in Rajasthan reported that they received the communication material to counsel the parents on
responsive parenting and ECD.

Frontline workers who received communication material reported that they were trained to use it in order
to convey their learnings more effectively to their communities - a positive output that was in line with the
reconstructed theory of change. These findings were also corroborated by quantitative data which showed
that more than 50% of ASHA and Anganwadi workers in Rajasthan reported the communication package
as ‘very useful’, while approximately 65% to 70% of the frontline workers in Maharashtra gave a similar
rating.

Figure 5: FLWs reporting usefulness of communication material/tool in counselling parents on positive parenting and ECD
During the qualitative interactions, frontline workers reported that they felt that the communication tools
made their jobs easier, acted as effective visual aids to explain even the most difficult messages and eased
the language barrier. Moreover, it was reported that the tools helped in establishing trust in the minds of
the community members and strengthened their belief in the messages conveyed by the frontline workers.
Discussions also revealed that frontline workers found the messages in the communication materials
useful to counsel parents and other caregivers. In particular, messages related to cleanliness, health,
cognitive development of children and the parent-child bond, were found to be most useful. Additionally,
frontline workers suggested adding more messages related to toys and creative ways for brain stimulation.
They also suggested adding more pictures, since it was observed that both parents and children were
more attracted to pictorial representations.
Further, quantitative findings signify that FLWs mostly utilized home visits and mothers meeting in
Maharashtra, and parent anganwadi meetings (PAM) and home visits in Rajasthan to use the
communication material to provide messages to the community.
On the beneficiary front, parents presented a mixed view of the frontline workers’ ability to use the
communication materials provided to them. While some parents reported that frontline workers did not
use any materials while counseling them, many others appreciated the information provided in these
materials and observed it aided their understanding around various aspects of early childhood
development. Supervisors and other government officials also received positive feedback from parents
when they went on the field to understand how well the communication materials were being utilized.
Due to the availability of age-appropriate communication material for children, the quality of the training
for the parents had improved. To further elaborate, information shared was aligned to the age of the
children being cared for, be it newborn, infant, toddler, or preschooler. Because it was relevant in its
immediacy and need, parental engagement was more.
Communication material were provided to us and we also took them with us while visiting the homes
in the village. We got training too so we took the cards with us wherever we went and showed it to the
parents. A lot of information was there on those cards related to child development and care. The
good thing was that everybody believed and listened to us after seeing those cards. (AWW,
Aurangabad)
Page|79
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
Parents were quite enthusiastic after we showed them the materials such as flipcharts, pictorial
materials for counselling them on the childcare and development in a better and in a more practical
way. (AWW, Pune)
Messages like parents should give time to their children, they should look after their studies at home
are most useful. The messages related to the cognitive development of the children which were there
in the book are also good. Also, children can make various craft items with paper which would help
them improve their creativity. Something of this kind or ways to improve a child's creativity can be
added in the communication material. (AWW, Dungarpur)
Messages related to washing hands were good, keeping home clean, brain development, parent-child
bonding, using locally available material to make play things, and good behaviour all were good
messages. These were good things which I found. (ASHA, Aurangabad)
Many times when the Anganwadi workers are stuck up with some issues like how certain things can
be implemented, the pictorial charts help them a lot to tackle the issue and explain it to the parents.
Many frontline workers used these ECD play cards, even small colourful leaflets to tell the parents.
(District govt official, Aurangabad)
If we make them (parents) do activities from the pages of the book, the father, and the mother both
become happy and satisfied that their child has learnt something. And in that process the frontline
workers also participate with them, playing and entertaining them and they too feel content and
satisfied. (Lady Supervisor, Dungarpur)

An Opportunity for Collective Empowerment – A Lady Supervisor
As a lady supervisor, if Sunita Pardeshi (Aurangabad, Maharashtra) could think of one programme holding great promise for
the betterment of the children, parents and frontline workers (FLWs) alike, it would be the responsive parenting and Early
Childhood Development (ECD) intervention.
As part of the intervention, she learnt about brain cells, the different stages of physical and mental development in a child’s
life, the connection between play and brain development, methods to engage young children and babies using visual material
and sounds, and other important ECD practices integral for the holistic development of children. Having been trained on ECD
herself, she trained the FLWs under her on the same to increase their capacity and skills on the field.
Before the intervention, the FLWs lacked the confidence to address large gatherings. However, the training as part of the ECD
intervention, equipped them with the necessary knowledge, skills, and confidence to counsel parents and other caregivers on
early childhood development using platforms such as parent’s meetings and home visits. The one-of-a-kind activity-based
training involved role-play of actual scenarios with roles being enacted by FLWs themselves to increase their confidence
through rigorous practice.
Before the advent of the intervention, FLWs would only instruct the parents on particular tasks, however, the ECD training
taught them the proper methods to conduct parent’s meetings and home visits. FLWs were taught techniques to counsel the
caregivers, greet them, listen to them, praise them, encourage them, and gain their trust and confidence, which made the
parent’s meetings and home visits quite successful. They were taught to counsel, not only the parents, but also the other
caregivers who were directly or indirectly involved in the nurturing and care of the child. Sunita, in her capacity as a lady
supervisor, makes all attempt to rectify any shortcomings she observed while supervising the FLWs on home visits and parent’s
meetings.
According to Sunita, the ECD intervention employed innovative approaches like the Palak Melas which involved the set up of
different stalls and demonstration of activities that parents could use with their children for stimulation and development.
Demonstrations were also conducted on the use of everyday items like utensils, vegetables and grains in play activities with
the children. As an example, flour could be used to teach writing and drawing in a fun way.
Further, Sunita shares that the intervention had considerable positive impacts on the parents, children and the FLWs. It
facilitated collaboration between ASHAs and Anganwadi Workers, who shared work responsibility during the period of the
intervention. Parents and other family members got involved in early childhood development activities for their children. Even
though the fathers’ attendance at parent’s meetings was low, many of them participated in the discussions during the home
visits. The parents implemented their learnings on the proper methods for feeding, bathing, clothing, and mentally stimulating
the child using everyday objects to enable the learning of shapes, sizes, and colors etc.
As an example, Sunita shared the story of a mother with two malnourished children who gained right knowledge and
awareness after participating in the intervention. Not only did the mother learn many new activities, she also applied these
in her life and gradually her children’s health improved.
Earlier, parents and other caregivers did not appreciate the importance of ECD and considered it an extra burden. However,
because of the continuous counselling support provided to them by FLWs, parents and other caregivers came to understand
the value of positive parenting and care in the development of their children. They even realized that the ECD activities made
childcare easier and was complementing their daily activities. Scheduling home visits as per the availability of the parents
and adopting an appreciative communication style while interacting with the caregivers, motivated them to participate in the
meetings and home visits.
Being closely involved with the intervention, Sunita has a few suggestions. She proposed to increase the involvement of the
village youth in the ECD intervention which could be achieved by setting up play gardens in every gram panchayat where the
youth could devote some time for the development of the young children in the communities. Sunita strongly believes in the
potential of the ECD intervention to bring significant improvements in the physical, cognitive, social and emotional abilities
of the children and recommends its continuation for a longer time.

EQ6: What was the quality of the training to FLWs, in terms of content, structure and
delivery medium?
SEQ 6.1: What did FLWs like about the training (all training programmes), what did they find useful?
SEQ 6.2: What did FLWs dislike about the training, what did they not find so useful and why?
SEQ 6.3: What suggestions do FLWs have for improvements?
In the quantitative survey, more than fourth-fifth of AWWs (83.2%) and more than half of ASHAs (55.3%)
in Maharashtra and about half of AWWs (46%) and a quarter of ASHAs (23%) in Rajasthan reported that
they received training on positive parenting and ECD. There may be various possible reasons for low
reporting of receipt of training by FLWs. One of the reasons could be FLW recall issue due to considerable
gap between the time FLWs were last trained and the timing of main data collection. The project activities
mostly concluded by first quarter of 2020 and the some of the FLWs were trained in the last quarter of
2019. The data collection spanned from Dec 2020 – Jan 2021. The other reason could be that FLWs
generally receive other trainings throughout the year as a part of their job and in some cases, it might be
difficult for FLWs to clearly distinguish which training they received. Further, COVID might have had an
impact on the recall ability of the FLWs due to the increased work pressure during pandemic. Also, as can
be seen in the results, the recall in Maharashtra is higher when compared to Rajasthan. This could possibly
be because in Maharashtra, once the master trainers were trained, they organized the trainings for FLWs
on a separate day in a month and hence the FLWs had better chances of recalling the trainings received
in Maharashtra since the trainings happened on a separate day in a month. In Rajasthan, since the training
was conducted during sector meetings itself, FLWs might in some cases not recall that the trainings
received during these meetings. Finally, it might indeed be the case that the FLWs may not have received
any training on positive parenting and ECD.
To mitigate the risk of recall issue and distinguish the training, the evaluation team has rigorously tested
the study tools twice and included verbal clues, simplified local language during pilot testing phase and
during main data collection phase, enumerators probed multiple times and provided sufficient time for
FLWs to recall the training in case they received one. In spite of our best efforts, there is always a possibility
that a few FLWs might not clearly recall the trainings they received.
Interviews with frontline workers provided in-depth insights into the quality of training covering aspects
such as content, structure and medium of delivery. Overall, during the in-depth interviews, frontline
workers expressed their satisfaction with the training received on responsive parenting and care. They
were happy with the new information and skills provided in the sessions as it improved their knowledge
base on parenting and care. Similarly, in the quantitative survey, when asked about what they liked about
the parenting and ECD training42 FLWs commonly reported that they liked the new information being
provided, information will help to perform their job better and help in refreshing their skills and knowledge
on parenting and ECD. Many frontline workers also felt that the sessions built their confidence and
ultimately increased their efficiency on the field while counselling parents and other caregivers. Further,
it could be observed that FLWs in Maharashtra are more satisfied with the trainings when compared to
Rajasthan.
42 The team did not read out the options to the FLWs. The responses from the FLWs were self-reported.

They also appreciated the practical techniques taught in the sessions and the wide range of topics
covered. While the overwhelming response was positive, a few frontline workers felt the training sessions
were time-consuming and did not provide enough new information, everytime.
Many frontline workers requested regular training sessions on new and existing topics in order to improve
their performance. They expressed their enthusiasm toward expanding their knowledge and capacity
regarding different aspects of child development and parenting. This was in line with quantitative findings,
which showed that a substantial percentage of the frontline workers expressed the need for training in
new areas (80% (AWW) & 45% (ASHA) in Maharashtra; and 58% (AWW) & 23% (ASHA) in Rajasthan).

(AWW, Pune)
The training has helped us a lot, there were enough practice sessions and they helped build our skills.
Without the training a lot of things would have been difficult to understand related to positive
parenting and ECD. (AWW, Palgarh)
Sometimes there is nothing new to teach in the extra time of training. The training place could be
made more comfortable. (AWW, Yavatmal)
SEQ 6.4: Whether messaging in the communication package customized to gender and vulnerable groups?
The communication package material and messaging is equitable to different groups and gender. Gender
and equity-based concepts are integrated with clarity. Take for example, responsive parenting being the
responsibility of both parents and other family members - this is clearly depicted and integrated through
the content. There is an active representation of mothers, fathers and other family members such as
grandmother, grandfather and siblings engaging in touch, talk and play with both the girl child as well as
the boy child; the prevalent household roles are challenged through depictions like fathers shelling peas
or mothers playing ball; fathers are depicted playing active games with their daughters or reading out
stories to their sons; boys are seen engaging in quieter activities like rangoli making as well and helping
their parents in household chores; the pictorial representation also comprises different geographical
realities such as urban/rural and different cultural contexts and brings in the elders in the family
consistently as contributors in child-rearing. The material also creates a supportive environment for the
Page|84
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
mother by enabling the families’ active and able support in child-rearing. The visual-laden material
addresses the needs of parents who are lower-educated or illiterate as well. Context-specific examples
also make the learning more relevant.
The material breaks the gendered role of toys, communication and activity engagement - by whom and
for whom and where being a focus. It actively engages fathers and grandparents in providing positive
parenting to children at home and explicitly addresses father’s role in caregiving and breaking stereotypes
regarding roles and responsibilities. The activities suggested use materials that are easily accessible at
home and environs so that there isn’t any need to purchase anything and the poorest of the house will
have it.
The material has gone through purposive screening to address implicit biases in messaging and materials
were developed through a participatory process. Most of the messaging uses gender-neutral language
(English) e.g. their/them/they/child/children. Some of the messaging uses he/she and some of the
messaging omits gender inclusive language and uses he, his and him instead of she/he, his/her’s or
him/her. It was also observed that inclusion of children with different needs does not come across
explicitly and as shared by a UNICEF staff, has been addressed in trainings suggesting modifications in
response to individual and family needs and contexts.
During the discussions, some frontline workers were able to identify messages related to gender and
vulnerable groups as part of the communication package received. Gender-related messages were
focused on promoting equality between the girl child and the boy child; improving health, education and
related outcomes for the girl child; educating communities about harmful practices such as female
foeticide or infanticide and counselling fathers and other members of the family regarding parental roles
and responsibilities.
For vulnerable groups, communication materials contained information to encourage frontline workers
to focus more on helping children from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
Both the parents are equally responsible for taking care of their child. It's not written anywhere that
it is the father who has to earn money and it is the mother who has to look after her child. (AWW,
Udaipur)
We were told that people who were financially weak or the family was hard to reach, we should sit
together and communicate together. Through this we can give them more information at one place
and also clear their doubts about child development. (AWW, Dungarpur)
We have to concentrate on the poor child more. We concentrate on them more and give the services
of anganwadi like give them food and take care of them. (ASHA, Udaipur )

A Vehicle of Transformation – ASHA worker
Living in a small family with her husband, and her 17-year-old son, Laxmi has been an ASHA worker since 2010
in the Girwa block of Udaipur district in Rajasthan. Being a health worker, she has been actively involved in
being the first responder for the health issues of the villagers, especially for women and children in the region.
As an ASHA worker, she has been responsible for various activities such as registering pregnant women, taking
them for institutional deliveries, visiting new mothers after the third, seventh, fourteenth and twenty first days,
checking on the health of newborns, educating young mothers on keeping their babies healthy, giving
information on nutrition and hygiene, and others.
Laxmi has always put a lot of emphasis on nutrition and has tried to keep malnourishment at bay in her
community in collaboration with the Anganwadi worker. She has made it a point to regularly check the weight
of the children under her care, and if any child is found to be malnourished, she takes immediate steps to
remedy the situation or avoid it in the future altogether. However, Laxmi shares that she felt inadequate while
providing these services as she is the only ASHA worker responsible for a population of 2300 people, instead of
being responsible for the needs of a population of 1000.
Although Laxmi already possessed some knowledge regarding early childhood development (ECD), she
mentions that the training as part of the parenting and ECD intervention by UNICEF expanded her knowledge
base significantly. She learnt methods and activities pertaining to different aspects of early childhood
development, and techniques to counsel parents and other caregivers in the community. Laxmi recalled that
families in her community were unaware of the importance of early childhood development and the
intervention played a huge role in introducing them to the concepts necessary for building a base for the
physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development of their children.
Utilizing parent’s meetings and home visits, Laxmi teaches the parents different methods of engaging with their
children via play and other activities used for stimulating cognitive and physical development. Parents are
counselled on how to utilize their immediate surroundings and locally available material while interacting with
their children. She provides an example - parents could teach children about colors and shapes by showing
children different vegetables, or parents could mimic different sounds and characters while teaching children
stories or poems. Parents could assess their children’s abilities and their progress while doing these activities.
In case a child is unable to do an activity, Laxmi advises the parents to provide them more practice and not
shout at them.
Being at the forefront of this life-changing intervention, Laxmi truly believes in the value of early childhood
development in bringing long lasting mental and physical transformation for the children in her community.
She is proud to be a part of the intervention that is shaping the future generation of the community and the
community itself.

The improvement in the capacities of the frontline workers, according to the reconstructed theory of
change, was corroborated by the information gathered during the discussions with various stakeholders.
It was revealed that a significant improvement had occurred in the knowledge, attitude and perceptions
of frontline workers on the role of parenting in early childhood development. Supervisors were happy to
note this positive change, post training (especially in Maharashtra). According to them, training sessions
helped to build the confidence of the frontline workers and left them better equipped to counsel parents
and other caregivers. Due to the improvement in their knowledge base, frontline workers became more
aware of different aspects of responsive parenting and ECD. For example, frontline workers were able to
counsel parents on the importance of parent-child interactions. As a result, communication between
parents and children increased, and parents started devoting more time to their children.
Not only this, the trainings have also led to an improvement in the attitude of the frontline workers
towards children during the meetings, as reported by a CSO partner in an interview. The FLWs now
understand that children required guidance and support, and not domination and hence should be
treated with respect. Frontline workers counselled parents on the importance of play for children - not
only for physical and cognitive development, but also to keep children proactive, happy and engaged with
their surroundings. Caregivers were encouraged to combine play and communication activities with
occasions such as feeding, dressing, and bathing if they were short of time. As per quantitative findings,
the percentage of frontline workers convincing caregivers to play with their children went up from 64% to
86.9% (AWW) and 64% to 87% (ASHA) in Maharashtra; and from 67.5% to 85.4% (AWW) and 81.6% to 87.2%
(ASHA) in Rajasthan.

Frontline workers were also able to discuss the importance of the parent-child bond and age-appropriate
discipline. FLWs encouraged parents to establish a friendly, open and loving relationship with their
children and avoid quarreling or bad behaviour with them. This is evident in the quantitative data which
shows a rise in the percentage of frontline workers counselling about the importance of parent-child
bonding in mothers meetings from 36.5% to 52.1% (AWW) and 36.8% and 41.5% (ASHA) in Maharashtra;
and from 35.3% to 40.4% (AWW) and 32.7% to 38% (ASHA) in Rajasthan.
Highlighting the importance of discipline in daily life, frontline workers counselled parents against beating
as a punishment, instead emphasizing the need for calm and friendly discussions to help children realise
their mistakes. There is a considerable rise in the percentage of frontline workers who reported conversing
about discipline and punishment methods in mothers meetings from baseline to endline in both the states;
from 38.8% to 47.3% (AWW) and 27.4% to 36.5% (ASHA) in Maharashtra; and from 18.7% to 24.7% (AWW)
and 18.4% to 29.2% (ASHA) in Rajasthan.

There is a need for communication between children and parents. Children understand this early on
and it becomes very important in their development and it also makes their relationship better and
stronger. (AWW, Pune)
Even if parents are busy with their work, we tell them to spend some time with their children in the
evening as children are happy to play or spend some time with their parents. (AWW, Pune)
Through playing games children develop physical strength, increasing their internal strength, increase
sharpness, and develop physically stronger. (AWW, Palgarh)
Every child loves to play. If parents play with their child, it will relax the child very much and he/ she
will grow in a friendly atmosphere. It is very important for parents to play with their child. (ASHA,
Dungarpur)
Bonding means if we behave freely with the children, if we mix with them, the bond between the
parents and children will be good. Be friendly and loving. The bonding will be strong through positive
parenting, which contributes to development of children. In addition to that, if they communicate
more with children, then their relationship would become good and the bonding between them would
be much stronger. We give counselling to them regarding this. (AWW, Aurangabad)
We advise the parents to never shout at them (children) or get angry at them. There are some children
who get very frightened when they see their parents in such a state. So, what the parents should do
is to give their children time apart from work and try to build a friendly relationship with them. We
tell the parents, not to punish the children. We tell the parents that if they do anything in front of kids
they will always copy. So, they should never behave in front of them in a wrong manner at home, so
that they will not be affected negatively by it and they will have a good life. The children will copy their
behaviour of shouting or violence, so it is always better to treat them with love. (AWW, Palgarh)
I would say it (ECD training) helped in a major way in changing the beliefs of supervisors and frontline
workers. If you talk to them, the frontline workers and supervisors, so many of them would narrate
to you stories of how this whole concept has benefitted them, or some of those who had completed
their families, would come to us and say if the project had come earlier, it would have benefited our
families, our children, it would have benefitted us. (CSO Partner, Maharashtra)
In Palghar one of the ICDS supervisors spoke during the training and she gave an example that she
has a grandchild and she was of the view that the daughter-in-law should give more attention to the
grandson. And after coming to this training, she started insisting to her own son, that he should also
participate equally, not only her daughter-in-law. There when she confessed this, many people started
talking about this. (CSO Partner)
SEQ 7.2: What factors influenced in building the skills and capacities of FLWs?
A majority of the frontline workers attributed the improvement in their skills and capacities to three factors,
namely, the training sessions, the expertise of master trainers/supervisors, and the communication
materials provided as part of the project. In Maharashtra, frontline workers also reported being satisfied
with the training conducted and were highly appreciative of the support network provided by the senior
officials and project staff. In Rajasthan, however, there was a mixed sentiment among FLWs, with some
FLWs reporting that they were satisfied with the trainings and some noting that concentrating on the
training after the administrative tasks during sector meeting was a challenge and very few opportunities
for refresher trainings.
Page|95
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
A CSO partner from Maharashtra noted that the appreciative communication method used in the training
session by the supervisors played an important role in enhancing the FLWs’ interest in the sessions. In the
beginning, the supervisors were continuously handholding the frontline workers and providing active
support on ground. The training sessions were experiential in nature with demonstrations of all the
activities that the FLWs had to on the field, which has been highly appreciated.
During the discussions, supervisors revealed that the training sessions were an important factor in
building the skills and capacities of the FLWs as they were very detailed and explored relevant concepts in
depth. In Maharashtra, AWW Supervisors and ASHA facilitators specifically highlight that the strategy to
have a separate training day during a month (apart from sector meeting) was very helpful in completely
focusing on the training without worrying about the administrative tasks and lack of time. A supervisor
from Pune reported that the training helped built the confidence levels of the frontline workers. The
structure of continuous and refresher training proposed under project was useful in improving the
knowledge level of the frontline workers. Not only that, the training focused on building the practical skills
of frontline workers which helped them on the field.
A supervisor from Udaipur noted the clarity and simplicity in understanding of the ECD material provided
to them, leading to an improvement in the quality of the counselling sessions with the parents.
Before training I didn't have proper skills and the ability to talk with parents but because of the
training, we were taught how to explain things to the parents in a simple way. (ASHA, Aurangabad)
SEQ 7.3: Did the training lead to intended changes in communication style and behaviour of FLWs when engaging
with parents/caregivers?
Figure 10: Reconstructed Theory of Change
In line with the expected immediate outcome of the reconstructed theory of change, frontline workers
and supervisors largely agreed that the training improved the communication style and behaviour of the
frontline workers when interacting with parents and other caregivers. The training not only built their
communication skills and confidence, it also equipped them with the necessary skills that would result in
better information dissemination. FLWs noted that it was easier to connect with caregivers and build
rapport post training, leading to more number of people being counselled effectively. The training
although did not have specific dedicated session on building these skills, it however was ingrained within
the ECD training sessions and during mock sessions. Aspects such as how to communicate with caregivers,
how to ask them questions, how to encourage them to ask questions, how to connect with them were
discussed. Due to the trainings, the FLWs were able to develop the skillset that enabled them to gauge
and understand the needs of the caregivers, and then deliver context specific messages.
They also noticed some positive changes in the communities. While earlier frontline workers were mostly
ignored, now families had started to greet them, show them respect and invite them into their homes.
Many FLWs also reported an increase in parental enthusiasm and engagement, with more and more
families voluntarily approaching them with questions regarding parenting and care. This was also
Page|96
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
corroborated by parents who reported an increase in the engagement between the frontline workers and
the caregivers.
FLWs attributed these changes to the better counselling support parents received, as well as the
communication materials and flip charts provided, which lent authenticity to their messages.
In their interviews, parents (mostly mothers) spoke positively about the FLWs behaviour and conduct while
conducting meetings and delivering ECD messages. They highlighted a few key changes observed in the
services provided by the frontline workers including, better message delivery using simple vocabulary in
the local language; improvement in behaviour and conduct while interacting with parents; increase in the
number of visits; and practical demonstrations of messages. Parents also revealed that the addition of
play and activities made meetings with frontline workers more enjoyable and increased their
enthusiasm. However, these positive aspects were less commonly reported by fathers (especially in
Rajasthan) as most of them mention that they do not regularly meet their FLWs. Interestingly, fathers from
Pune and Palghar reported that they to a large extent, regularly participated in meetings organized by
FLWs (baba palak sabha) and noted improvements in the interactions between them and FLWs.
We have been trying to counsel caregivers from the beginning but through training we have been
taught the proper way of interacting with the parents. After receiving the training on ECD and
communication material, we could make people understand better and connect with them. Our
morale increased. (AWW, Dungarpur)
In the training provided, we were told how to communicate with parents, how to ask them questions,
and how to answer their questions. When done with the training it has been very useful for us to
tackle such challenges. (ASHA, Aurangabad)
Earlier, when we used to explain, people didn’t pay much attention. But, after receiving the training
on parenting and ECD, when we went to explain to them, we have undertaken a new way of explaining
things with the help of charts and pictures. Due to this, people used to pay much more attention. Now
it is easy for us to understand their views and thoughts due to which it was easy on our part to give
proper answers to their questions and make them understand various developmental aspects. (AWW,
Udaipur)
Earlier it was like 10-15 mothers sitting with one ASHA alone and receiving lectures. This was the
earlier way of mothers meeting. This is my own experience while I visited the ASHA on a monitoring
visit. This was the earlier picture. Now when I visit 6 blocks where the piloting has been done, there I
see ASHA, Anganwadi worker, supervisor or the block facilitator all are sitting together with the
mother and equally involving mothers in the discussions and activities. So, there has been a good
quality change in mother’s activity. (District govt official, Yavatmal)
In the beginning, ASHA and Anganwadi workers worked independently. But now we are together. So,
there is an impact on people that we work together and go together. (ASHA/Anganwadi Supervisor,
Aurangabad)
Another important thing that I would like to mention that with lots of efforts, we have been able to
create an environment to a large extent I would say, not fully, but to a large extent an environment
of appreciative enquiry, an environment of support or build a supportive structure around these FLWs,
and it is very important that this continues. (CSO Partner, Maharashtra)

Quantitative findings show an increase (although still low) in the percentage of FLWs organizing fathers
meeting from baseline to endline in both Maharashtra and Rajasthan. This was corroborated by the
qualitative interviews which revealed that frontline workers continued to face challenges while counselling
fathers of the children, and only a minimal progress has been made in this regard.

Some of the major challenges outlined were lack of availability of fathers due to their occupations, migrant
nature of jobs, orthodox mindsets, lack of awareness, illiteracy, and alcohol addiction. Frontline workers
reported (especially in Rajasthan) that a majority of the men considered childcare and parenting outside
their domain and were unaware of their responsibilities as fathers.
Despite this, many FLWs reported an improvement in their counselling skills, especially with respect to
fathers, post training. The new information and techniques learnt during training built their confidence
while interacting with fathers and other family members. This was also corroborated by parents who
shared that many frontline workers were communicating with fathers on home visits. This was further
supported by quantitative findings which showed a jump in the confidence levels of both ASHA and
Anganwadi workers when interacting with male caregivers regarding various aspects of child development.

In the interviews, it was observed that some of the fathers had gained knowledge regarding positive
parenting and were beginning to participate in meetings, even though a majority still did not interact with
the frontline workers nor did they attend meetings conducted in their communities. Thus, an
improvement in the abilities and confidence of the FLWs to interact with fathers, albeit small, was in line
with the expected output of the reconstructed theory of change.
Figure 14: Reconstructed Theory of Change
To encourage fathers’ participation, supervisors suggested putting up posters on relevant issues in
communal spaces in the village and delivering messages during the Gram Sabhas which witnessed large
participation from gents. It was also suggested that frontline workers could take help from persons of
influence in the community such as the sarpanch and the priest to convince fathers to participate more in
early childhood development meetings and activities.
I remember earlier the fathers were unaware of many things but now after counseling they are more
aware of their child wellbeing. We told them their importance in parenting so they are now more
aware. (ASHA, Aurangabad)
Page|99
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
Earlier, child care was a work for only women. But, after much counseling, men are also participating
in parenting, although still low. This can be considered as a vital change. They are now themselves
coming and asking various aspects of childcare. (AWW, Yavatmal)
Actually, children's mothers are coming to us. Fathers are out for work. So, we are counseling the
mothers. But when we go for home visit we meet the father then we make them aware about taking
proper care of the child and mother etc. We ask the father to give some time to the mother to rest.
Enroll the child in Anganwadi center or school, if the child is above 6 years. (ASHA, Dungarpur)
On parent's meeting day or immunization day the parents bring the kids and most of the times the
fathers bring the kids so we talk to them then. They bring the kids in their scooter or motorcycle
themselves for vaccination, so they must stay for 10 minutes and we talk to them during that time.
But this happens rarely. (Lady Supervisor, Pune)
Due to the training the frontline workers are now confident in motivating the fathers in childcare
which was earlier difficult. (Lady Supervisor, Udaipur)
We are now able to give advice to fathers. Generally, we say not to discriminate between a boy and
girl andwe tell the father to treat both of them equally. Childcare is their (fathers’ and mothers’)
collective responsibility. If a mother is engaged in work, then they should engage children with them
by singing songs, telling some lessons, etc. In case of sickness, the child's father should take care of it.
(ASHA, Palgarh)
The frontline workers believe in themselves. They believe I have the essential knowledge. I can
communicate with the fathers with confidence. So, earlier when the fathers were coming to mothers’
meetings, the FLWs were a little bit hesitant, like how I can initiate dialogue with them, but now over
the practice of so many months they are more confident. (CSO Partner)

A Good Samaritan – A Father
For Nilesh Dastridath from Pune, Maharashtra his two daughters are the apples of his eyes. Like any good parent, he is
concerned about their wellbeing and holistic development. Apart from food, clothing, and hygiene, he is aware of the
importance of education in shaping his daughters’ future. This has led him to admit both his daughters into the nearby school
for formal education. The girls are learning a lot of things and their father remains excited to learn from them. To the extent
possible, he also tries to teach them alphabets and numbers by himself at home. Despite being a doting father, Nilesh remains
busy with work, and is able to engage with his daughters only during early mornings or late evenings. The girls stay in the
care of their mother and grandparents for the better part of their days.
The lockdown, during the pandemic period, resulted in a temporary shutdown of the girls’ school as physical classes were
suspended. Like most educational institutions, the school had to shift their classes online. The school made a WhatsApp group
for parents where it conducted meetings, uploaded materials as pictures and videos, and conducted virtual classes. Nilesh
advised his daughters to take classes and study online and guided them whenever he found time.
The Early Childhood Development (ECD) intervention introduced by UNICEF presented an exciting opportunity for Nilesh and
educated him regarding the importance of ECD in the physical, cognitive, emotional and social development of children. He
makes all attempt to attend the meetings and/ or home visits conducted by frontline functionaries. While work keeps him
busy and sometimes does not let him attend the parent’s meetings or home visits by the frontline workers, he makes sure his
wife attends the meetings and took active part in the home visits, so that he could learn about the ECD intervention through
her.
Through the meetings and home visits as part of the intervention, Nilesh was able to learn new and innovative methods to
engage his daughters while teaching them the alphabets and numbers and identifying objects. With the help of innovative
storytelling methods, charts, pictures, and games, he continues to stimulate his daughters, both, physically and mentally. The
grandparents also received counselling on proper parenting and ECD practices, since the girls spent a significant amount of
time with them.
Being a good Samaritan, Nilesh was not only concerned about the development of his own daughters but was also concerned
about the development of the neighborhood children. When schools were shut, he would visit his neighbors on Sundays to
show them how to use the internet for accessing online study materials and taking classes online. After experiencing the
benefits of the ECD intervention, Nilesh began to motivate and counsel other parents to adopt this new philosophy and
method of parenting children in their early childhood. He found that other parents were equally interested in adopting the
innovative methods for the better physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development of their children.

EQ8: To what extent did FLWs effectively transfer their learnings to the parents/caregivers
on parenting care and creating a learning environment at home?
SEQ 8.1: Were specific strategies adopted to reach out to parents/caregivers across gender and various
vulnerable groups?
To increase the involvement of fathers and other family members like grandparents, aunts and uncles,
frontline workers utilized home visits to counsel family members together and explain their
responsibilities. Home visits were also preferred when parents and other caregivers could not attend
anganwadi meetings due to busy schedules and other reasons. Many frontline workers felt that it was
easier to give sensitive information to people inside the comfort of their homes, and it also gave frontline
workers the opportunity to interact with all family members.
While delivering gender related messages, frontline workers sometimes took the help of panchayats and
teachers in the village schools to counsel parents. Such messages were not only delivered to girls or
parents who have a girl child but to all sets of families during sensitization.
To encourage fathers’ participation and build rapport with them, frontline workers suggested organizing
customized meetings and counselling sessions for men, regular home visits in the evenings (or whenever
fathers might be available) and constant communication via telephones, WhatsApp etc. if fathers were
unavailable to meet in person.
Frontline workers also reported that it was easier to reach special groups on cultural events when the
whole village gathered together for celebrations. Such events presented convenient opportunities to meet
all the families, including the hardest to reach populations, and counsel them on child care and parenting.
For the more vulnerable sections, frontline workers felt that repeated counselling with patience and
kindness yielded positive results. Many frontline workers reported visiting such households at least once
a week to spend an hour or two providing family members with counselling support and advice. On these
visits, frontline workers provided the households with information regarding government schemes and
Anganwadi facilities, in order to encourage families to avail these benefits. Frontline workers also delivered
context-specific messages to the families in the tribal community to make them more relatable and
understandable.
Use of digital platforms such as WhatsApp were also noted as a convenient strategy to remain connected
with families located in the more remote regions (although network issues persist). Lady supervisors and
frontline workers explained that audio messages were often recorded and shared with the parents over
a WhatsApp group. These recordings contained messages related to early childhood development, health
or activities that parents could carry out with their children. This method was especially useful during the
pandemic and was used with all members of the community and not only with those located far away.
I liked the way we tried to make the fathers participate in the parenting of the children. In the
beginning, we had called mothers and grandmothers, but for fathers, we slowly informed them and
they increased their participation in this. So, it feels good. Now we can see more participation of
fathers in childcare in the society because of that. Otherwise this generally does not happen in villages.
(AWW, Aurangabad)
We have a case study which was documented in videos where one of the fathers confessed to us that
he was getting very restless as to why my wife is very eager and doesn’t want to miss even a minute
of this parent meeting. So, I followed her even when I was not invited and he said that it was really
great for him to come and sit down and understand why his wife is taking interest in the child’s
Page|102

development and he was missing it. So, he said he will come again to all the Palak Sabhas.. (CSO
Partner, Maharashtra)
For such households (vulnerable sections) we make them understand again and again. We go to their
home regularly and make them understand. We go to their homes to provide counselling and if in
that week there are any games or toys in the Anganwadi, we invite their child and make him/her play
games and we give them nutritious food. We tell them that all these are available so you come and
take it, we make them understand like this. (AWW, Dungarpur)
SEQ 8.2: What were the barriers and challenges faced by FLWs in the effective transfer of knowledge to
parents/caregivers?
One of the major barriers faced by frontline workers was the orthodox mindset prevailing in their respective
villages, an aspect which is more prevalent in Rajasthan. As revealed by a supervisor from Dungarpur,
some of the parents in the community did not even let the FLWs weigh the child due to their beliefs.
Moreover, a large portion of the population in the interiors of Rajasthan are uneducated making it difficult
for them to understand the advice being given by the frontline workers.
Since many families did not understand the importance of early childhood development and positive
parenting, they did not attend meetings and hence, many frontline workers complained of lower
participation in these interior areas. FLWs also reported that parents and caregivers often did not
participate because of busy schedules and other commitments. A supervisor from Dungarpur noted the
absence of fathers in the parents meetings in the Angawandi centres, even after having been invited for
the same.
A government official from Pune reported that parents often leave their children in the care of the elder
siblings or the grandparents. The FLWs have to thus target these groups for disseminating the ECD
messages. The challenge here is that the grandparents are not that responsive to the counselling
surrounding child development and care, citing their own children’s upbringing.
Lady supervisors from Pune and Udaipur also revealed that the FLWs’ preoccupation in other activities
like conducting surveys for government departments, pension work, ration and Aadhar card related work
takes time away from conducting the ECD activities. In some areas, tiny communities with a different
language exists. The FLWs in this case face issues in getting the ECD message across to the target groups
due to language barriers. The FLWs normally make use of the pictorial representation in the
communication material to explain the messages to the caregivers from such tiny communities.
Another major barrier noted by a CSO partner from Maharashtra is the long distances that the FLWs have
to travel. The frontline workers do not have access to vehicles and in many cases have to walk for 3-4 Kms
to conduct home visits.
A lady supervisor from Udaipur has reported the frontline workers’ complaints about the high workload
and low pay. There is need to make the pay commensurate with the private employment alternatives that
are available to the frontline workers.
In their interviews, some parents highlighted similar challenges, citing lack of time and difficulty in
understanding the counselling of the FLWs as major constraints for effective knowledge transfer.
Supervisors also noted that it would take frontline workers some time to strengthen their skills, given that
responsive parenting is a relatively new concept. Challenges related to the communication materials
developed were also discussed in the interviews. It was mentioned that some frontline workers were
overwhelmed by the amount of information and were unable to present it effectively. FLWs also revealed
they faced difficulties in holding the posters, while simultaneously explaining the information to parents
Page|103
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
due to the posters’ large size. A lady supervisor from Dungarpur noted the need for the FLWs to have
more booklets to be used on the field. Such challenges also hindered their ability to effectively
communicate with the caregivers.
Many times when we go to invite people to our events/programs, some people are there who always
say that they won’t be able to attend due to the lack of time. They ignore us. The problem is that not
every parent comes to the meetings. No matter the number of times we visit their home, only about
30% parents attend the meetings. (AWW, Pune)
There are parents who did not understand whatever we told them and some are there who even after
understanding the things didn’t want to accept it. They argue with us. It is all about poor mindset. It
is a challenge here since many are illiterate. (ASHA, Palgarh)
Some people are conservative, some are not. We usually go to villages and keep telling people that
you should do these things, only then they understand that it is a good thing.
And there are some people who are busy with their work, they tell us, they have no time for children.
Children will grow even without such effort. In addition to that we have to explain them. (AWW,
Udaipur)

Agent of Change – An Anganwadi Worker
In the hilly areas of Shishod village in Dungarpur district of Rajasthan, 30-year-old Mahinda Katara has spent
8 years as an Anganwadi worker. She has been actively involved in providing different services in the areas of
health, hygiene and nutrition, to the mothers and children of the village. For example, she has been providing
information regarding the importance of mother’s milk for babies and has also been teaching and playing with
the children at the Anganwadi.
As part of the parenting and Early Childhood Development (ECD) intervention, Mahinda has been trained on
various aspects of parenting and care. She mentions that she has gained new knowledge regarding ECD and
has learnt techniques to counsel parents on the same. The training has built her skills and given her the
confidence to interact with parents and other caregivers.
Utilizing meetings and home visits, she has been teaching parents and grandparents different methods to
effectively engage with children while doing household chores such as teaching children the colours, sizes, and
shapes of vegetables while cooking. Being a strong believer in positive parenting, she has constantly emphasized
that appreciation - talking gently and lovingly with children, is the key to their development and acts as a way
of positive reinforcement.
Mahinda says she has observed changes among the parents’ behavior after the advent of the ECD intervention.
Parents have been able to follow the messages being delivered using flip charts and pictures and demonstrate
the lessons learnt as part of the intervention, such as asking children to bring the cups after counting them, or
identify groceries, during home visits from the Anganwadi workers. Mahinda has noted that many children were
easily able to carry out such exercises and enjoyed doing them.
Mahinda shares that being a part of the intervention provided her a sense of achievement as she has been an
agent of change and has been helping the physical, cognitive, emotional and social development of the children
in her community. She feels proud to have been able to contribute to bringing light to the future of the children,
and in turn, to the community.

EQ9: To what extent were existing platforms used effectively to reach caregivers for
counselling? (e.g. Anganwadi centres and home visits)
SEQ 9.1: To what extent FLWs optimally utilized the contact points (Mothers meeting, PAM, community meetings,
home visits) that they have with parents/caregivers for delivering quality ECD services?
In line with quantitative findings, the majority of frontline workers agreed that home visits and parent
anganwadi meetings were the most effective platforms to reach caregivers for counselling. This sentiment
was also shared by the other stakeholders namely government officials, supervisors, CSO partners and
the UNICEF staff members. These two platforms were preferred due to convenience and easy availability
of facilities. The home visits also enabled the dissemination of ECD messages to those caregivers who
were unable to attend the meetings and events organized in the Anganwadi centres due to lack of time or
distance. The mothers' meetings are also excellent platforms for the delivery of information to a large
group with a common objective.

Other platforms such as mother’s/father’s meetings, palak melawas, school, hospital and temple premises,
and community centres were also utilized. Many frontline workers reported that events such as
Vaccination Day, Nutrition Day and cultural festivals such as Father’s Day, Mother’s Day, Teacher’s Day etc.,
were important contact points for meeting a large number of people and interacting with them. These
findings suggest an enhanced utilization of existing platforms by frontline workers to orient caregivers on
the importance of early childhood development and are in line with the reconstructed theory of change.

Mothers shared that frontline workers also made an effort to interact with the community members
during community based events such as Annaprashan divas and Godhbharai. They reported that there
was regular and continuous engagement between parents and the FLWs via different events, and they
usually met both the Anganwadi and the ASHA workers two to three times a month.
A lady supervisor from Udaipur noted that the FLWs conducted meetings for the fathers on new moon
day. There is a belief in the community that on new moon day every month, the farmers and agricultural
workers do not touch their farming equipment. The FLWs make use of this opportunity to conduct
meetings for the fathers who are otherwise unavailable due to their work commitments.
A CSO partner from Maharashtra has noted the innovative methods that have been used by the FLWs to
reach out to members in the community. An example shared was the use of morning walks through the
communities wherein the Anganwadi workers sing songs with ECD messages locally known as Prabhat
Feri.
As mentioned earlier, during the pandemic, digital platforms gained popularity with WhatsApp groups
being used by the frontline workers to impart important information to the parents in their communities.
We like using anganwadi centre because here all tools and material are available to give information
properly to parents and caregivers. (AWW, Dungarpur)
The project made the best possible use of the available institutional platforms and demonstrated that
nothing can be better than these platforms. All we need to do is energize and use these platforms so
you can really transform the families and the caregivers and make them understand the importance
of nourishing and nurturing. (UNICEF Staff, Maharashtra)
SEQ 9.2: What problems and challenges hindered FLWs for not utilizing the contact points effectively?
As mentioned in the section above, home visits and Anganwadi meetings were utilized most effectively by
the frontline workers. However, there were some challenges involved. FLWs pointed out that sometimes
family members were preoccupied with household work during home visits, and thus, did not pay
attention to what was being discussed. Long distances, lack of transportation and remote locations were
other common challenges faced by frontline workers while utilizing home visits.
For Anganwadi meetings, low participation and parents walking in late were major challenges. The lack of
adherence to the meeting timings by the parents’ also leads to lack of time to explain all the topics in the
meeting agenda. In some areas where Anganwadi centres were used for multiple social purposes,
Anganwadi workers found it difficult to conduct meetings due to space constraints.
A CSO partner from Maharashtra noted that the Palak melawas and the community-based events (CBEs)
were not conducted as regularly as planned. There is a need to expand the usage and purview of the CBEs
to make them more innovative and empowering for the parents. The FLWs also, in turn, found it difficult
to manage the organization of the community-based events.
Many times, it happens that parents are unable to come during Anganwadi timings, so we must
organize it according to their convenience. Like if they come at 1 o'clock we keep the schedule at 1, if
they come at 8, we schedule it to 8. We must do this because most of the people in the village go for
agriculture work in the early morning so when they come home before lunch for some time, we call
them at that time. (Lady Supervisor, Palgarh)

The Ultimate Guide – A Mother
Being a mother is difficult - and caring for four children at a young age just adds to the difficulty. Twenty-five-
year-old Parvati Henab of Bijuda village from Bicchiwara district of Rajasthan has been juggling farming
responsibilities and childcare duties for quite a few years now. Like any other mother, she has been bathing,
clothing, and feeding her children, every single day. Having completed her schooling till 10th standard, the
knowledge acquired by Parvati has come in handy while teaching her children alphabets and basic numeracy
skills. As a mother, she has remained by the side of her children for a majority of the time, however, her husband
has only been able to engage with the children for about an hour a day. The grandparents have also been
involved in the childcare activities.
The advent of the parenting and Early Childhood Development (ECD) saw active participation from Parvati’s
side. She regularly attended the mother’s meetings, and other platforms earmarked for disseminating messages
related to early childhood development. Parvati and her whole family were engaged via regular home visits by
the frontline workers who counselled the family members on the importance of early childhood development
for the physical, cognitive, social and emotional development of the children. The frontline workers organized
different activities, such as, showing pictures in books, informing parents about the right kind of clothes for
children, playing games with the kids, teaching caregivers how to control anger, teaching children counting in
a fun and practical way etc.; all of which were highly appreciated by Parvati.
Incorporating the knowledge and activities related to childcare into their daily lives, Parvati and her children
started enjoying themselves while learning new things. Recognizing fruits and vegetables while holding them
and counting rotis (flatbread) while cooking became a favorite pass time in the household.
Parvati was quick to realize the importance of early childhood development in creating the solid base for the
physical, cognitive, social, and emotional wellbeing of her children. She found the hands on and practical
activities, efficient, as well as enjoyable and noticed an increase in engagement with her children.

4.3. Efficiency
EQ10: To what extent was the intervention efficient in making the best possible use of
available resources to achieve its outcomes?
SEQ 10.1: To what extent effective coordination and collaboration with existing govt. programmes and
interventions were made during the implementation?
In both the states, the implementation of activities has been through existing government platforms: for
capacity building of frontline workers (AWWs and ASHAs); as well as the delivery of quality services
including counselling of parents through existing platforms of ICDS.
The intervention used existing government resources (human resource + infrastructure) for its
implementation. For example, the intervention was implemented in collaboration with the health
departments and the ICDS using the network of the ASHA and Anganwadi workers. The Anganwadis have
taken centre stage in the implementation of the parenting project.
One of the main government platforms the intervention utilized is the ICDS system. The network of the
ICDS goes to the village level through the government machinery i.e. through the zila parishad, the
principal council and urban area corporations.
In Rajasthan, existing institutional platforms, like sector meetings, were used as training platforms by the
supervisors and block coordinators to train the frontline workers. Not only that, platforms such as home
visits and mother’s meetings were in use even prior to the advent of the intervention, but the intervention
expanded the frequency of use of these platforms and the scope of activities on the meeting agenda. As
reported by a UNICEF staff from Rajasthan, the use of the existing government platforms enabled the
project to operate even under budget constraints. However, utilizing sector meetings for trainings had
some constraints - often more time being consumed for administrative tasks during sector meetings with
less time remaining for training of FLWs. Further, the project leveraged the existing community platforms
such as Parent Anganwadi Meeting (PAM), home visits, community-based events such as Annaprashana
diwas and Godhbharai to reach out to caregivers in Rajasthan.
In Maharashtra, instead of sector meetings, separate training sessions were conducted for master trainers
and FLWs. The training on responsive parenting was rolled out in five cycles of five days each for master
trainers (constituting AWW supervisors and ASHA facilitators). The trained master trainers further rolled-
out the training to the FLWs. Each master trainer after the conclusion of each cycle of training (provided
by CSO) rolled out the contents of that particular cycle of training to FLWs in three days within a period of
three months (one day per month).
As conveyed by a CSO partner in Maharashtra, the reason for organizing separate training sessions apart
from sector meetings was that the administrative tasks were very time-consuming and left little time for
conducting the training sessions. Hence, UNICEF and CSO partners convinced the government officials to
allocate a separate day in a month (apart from sector meeting) to organize the training for FLWs. This
aided FLWs to focus completely on the training module without worrying about the time and other regular
administrative activities. Further, in Maharashtra, the existing community platforms such as mothers
meeting, home visits, palak melawas and community-based events such as Annaprashana diwas and
Godhbharai have been used to reach out to caregivers.
The project also made use of the platforms developed under other government schemes in order to
increase efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the project. As an example, under the Poshan Abhiyan in
Maharashtra, all the Anganwadi workers were provided with android mobiles to carry out their daily
Page|110
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
reporting. This digitization led to a rise in the communication intensity and reporting and was beneficial
in monitoring the ECD project. These digital platforms were also beneficial in the continuation of ECD
activities after the advent of the pandemic. On similar lines, the use of various platforms like audio-visual,
television and radio channels like Aakashvani was made to convey ECD messages to the people during the
pandemic period.
EQ11: How the existing government platforms for continuing education and training has
been used to bring efficiency?
SEQ 11.1: To what extent the sector meeting and ICDS supervisor visits has been leveraged for project efficiency?
In Rajasthan, the sector meetings were initially used for administrative work like collation of data. The ECD
intervention added trainings of the frontline workers to the agenda of the sector meetings. The sector
meeting was the only existing platform that could be used as a training avenue for the frontline workers
since this was the only time ASHA and Anganwadi workers came together. Besides conducting training,
the on-ground challenges being faced by frontline workers in their respective areas were discussed in
order to reach solutions. The sector meetings witnessed participation from block coordinators,
representatives from ICDS and health department, and UNICEF staff members.
In Maharashtra, where the administrative work was very time consuming and left little time for conducting
the training sessions, a separate day was allocated for training at the discretion of the supervisors and the
frontline workers. As reported by a CSO partner from Maharashtra, minimal expenses had to be incurred
by the system for the separate training session as it was easily incorporated into the existing system. This
was not the case in Rajasthan, where the sector meetings was the only training platform for the frontline
workers.
Interviews with the UNICEF staff from Maharashtra revealed that conducting the training sessions as part
of the sector meetings was not the ideal scenario given the workload of the supervisors but was the most
efficient way given the current infrastructure. This was a platform which was readily available and where
the health and ICDS departments came together.
The ICDS supervisor visits also witnessed drastic changes after the advent of the project. Earlier, the
supervisors checked the facilities in the anganwadis including the quality of the food and non-formal
education. However, the level of engagement of the supervisors increased after the intervention was
implemented. During their visits, they not only interacted with the frontline workers, but also with the
parents. The supervisors normally scheduled their visits on days when either parent’s meetings or other
community-based events were taking place in the anganwadis. They observed and provided feedback on
how the frontline workers were interacting with the parents. In some instances, the supervisors also
accompanied the FLWs on home visits and demonstrated methods that could be used to interact with the
parents.
There was an improvement in the scope of engagement of the supervisors during the anganwadi visits
after the ECD project was implemented. In an interview, a supervisor from Udaipur reported that wherever
she visited the Anganwadi centres, she enquired about the children who were not attending the AWC or
about the parents who did not actively participate in the activities conducted in the centres; she tried to
understand the reasoning behind the absence and provide solutions for improvement. On similar lines,
another supervisor from Yavatmal reported checking on children who appeared malnourished or weak
and meeting their families to discuss about feeding practices on their visits to the Anganwadi centres.
In the visit of ours every Thursday, we let them (FLWs) explain those things (ECD counselling) to us. We
check the quality of what has been conveyed by the frontline workers. (Lady Supervisor, Pune)
Page|111
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
Whenever we make visits to the Anganwadi centers we inform them earlier to tell all the parents to
come that day. We then address the parents and give them information regarding positive and
responsive parenting. We see which ones need more help and then we give them information and
look out for them accordingly. (Lady Supervisor, Pune)
4.4. Sustainability
EQ12: Is the intervention and implementation modality scalable to other areas of the
state?
SEQ 12.1: To what extent the models for promoting parental involvement (communication package, training
modules, capacity building and monitoring) adopted in the project, scalable to other districts?
All the stakeholders such as the government officials at state, district, UNICEF staff members, and CSO
partners are of the view that the project should be scaled up to other districts in the two intervention
states (Maharashtra and Rajasthan). The scalability of the present model is apparent in the fact that it
makes use of the existing government human resource and infrastructure like the ICDS and health
workers (AWWs, ASHAs, AWW supervisors and ASHA facilitators),, sector meetings, and community
platforms such as parents meeting, home visits, palak melawas, and community-based events such as
Annaprashana and Godhbharai. The government officials have found this project to be influential in
nature with the caregivers in the areas where it has been implemented.
All the components of the project are essential for the development of children and should be
implemented as a whole package. The incremental learning approach used in the FLWs’ training is
especially important since it provides critical information about the child’s growth. The other components
of the project that show potential for scaling to other districts and states include the ECD messages,
parent’s and mother’s meetings, community-based events, planned activities on a daily and monthly basis,
and the workshops on nutrition.
An interview with a UNICEF staff from Maharashtra reveals that the decision to expand the program in the
remaining blocks in Yavatmal and Aurangabad districts and in Gadchiroli district has already been made
and plans are underway for its implementation. The scalability of the project is also apparent in the
positive reception of the training by the frontline workers, as reported by a district government official
from Aurangabad.
UNICEF staff members have also commonly mentioned that when scaling up the project, there is a need
to have intensive engagement with the government departments.
Digital media should be used while scaling up the project since it is a resource-saving method. Digital
media like videos can be used to provide teachings to the parents in the community. Catchy slogans or
captions can be used while spreading messages using posters or WhatsApp to attract the attention of the
parents. The successful use of these techniques in Maharashtra has been witnessed during the pandemic
where digital platforms were used to share messages on ECD with parents who were not necessarily part
of the project before.
I realized after seeing this (project) that if they would have given this type of training to FLWs earlier,
then it would have been very beneficial because they could have reached every parent and thereby
explain the importance of child development to everyone. They could have explained to them that for
their children’s brain development they don’t need expensive toys to play with their children. Any
household item can be used to play with the child. (District government official, Yavatmal)
Page|112
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
The district administration has decided to scale up this (ECD) project from a few blocks to all the
blocks in the district. And we are scaling up all the modules because we have seen the differences in
the community. (District Government Official, Aurangabad)
When we initially tried to scale up, the frontline workers thought of the program as an addition of
one more problem (task). Whenever we launch any new program, this is the first issue that we have
to face every time. But when we started training them (FLWs), they enjoyed it and realised that it
wasn't only for the community, but they also missed many things when they were parenting their own
children. (District Government Official, Aurangabad)
SEQ 12.2: What are the issues and challenges in design or implementation if any, that need to be addressed
before scaling up the interventions?
Even though the project relied on existing government platforms, it faced some challenges in its
implementation. One of the major challenges was to get the attention of the officials at the administrative
levels and the policy levels towards the important role played by ECD in childcare. There is a consensus
among the UNICEF staff members about prior involvement of the government ministries from the
beginning of the implementation of the project. There is a need to convince the bureaucrats and make
sure that the project is present in the annual work plan of the government. The issue that the project
targets should be a part of the policy agenda of the government, so that it becomes mainstream in terms
of the government initiatives. Coordination issues should also be tackled before the scaling up the project.
In Maharashtra, another bottleneck was that initially the ASHA and the Anganwadi workers used to work
separately. ASHA worked for the health department and the Anganwadis worked for the ICDS, with
different responsibilities granted to both. A related challenge was the lack of availability of the data, given
that the FLWs did not share information amongst them. The joint trainings provided under the project led
to an amalgamation of the activities of these two groups and improved their relationships. The FLWs
started conducting joint meetings, which led to a rise in the quality of home visits and also led to the active
sharing of data and information.
There are some challenges in the implementation of the training to the FLWs that needs to be tackled
before scaling up. The first challenge is the variability in the educational qualifications of the frontline
workers across districts and states. The FLWs with lower levels of education require more refresher
trainings in comparison to FLWs with higher educational levels.
The second challenge that was faced while training was that ASHA workers were not getting compensation
for the travel and expenses incurred for taking the training once in a month from the health department.
The ICDS department is proactive in reimbursing the anganwadi workers for their training expenses and
that encourages the frontline workers to attend the meetings. The lack thereof for the ASHA workers
affected their attendance in the training.
Another crucial recommendation is to capture in a video format palak sabhas that don’t work well instead
of just scripting them. This will ensure that the supervisors know what design of the palak sabha is missing
and act as a support system for them and the frontline workers.
It is important to highlight that the intensity of support that is provided to the pilot project will be difficult
to replicate if it is scaled up to other districts and states. The level of the monitoring and the coordination
will not be the same and can hamper the outcomes that have been seen in the pilot phase. Thus, there is
a need to make the project less resources intensive either by reducing the number of training cycles or by
using digital platforms like videos or by conducting online training sessions. In addition to this, having a
block coordinator and a district official to take the project forward will ensure its smooth implementation

and scalability. Further, in Rajasthan, utilizing sector meetings as a training venue needs some re-thinking
to strategically place the training session during the course of the meeting to ensure sufficient time.
Most of the time they (FLWs) think that the entire responsibility is being shouldered upon them. They feel
that they are doing all the tasks of the department together. They think that they're being paid less and
also have to organize everything including the meetings, co-ordinate the tasks and that makes them say
that the government has imposed a lot of load on them and they feel that they aren't paid enough or
respected enough for their work. (Lady Supervisor, Udaipur)
EQ13: Are any of the positive results of the intervention likely to be sustained?
SEQ 13.1: What are the positive results and which of these results are likely to be sustained? Why?
One of the most commonly discussed results by almost all the stakeholders is the positive change in the
knowledge, attitude and perceptions (KAP) of FLWs around childcare and parenting. This was
corroborated with the quantitative findings which show improvements in the KAP of FLWs in both the
states (Annexure 17). Moreover, frontline workers have themselves experienced the benefits of the training
provided and note a positive change in their skills and capacities. They have become more confident and
have noted improvement in their communication and counselling skills. The FLWs see value in the
messages that they share, and also have developed the ability to tailor the messages as per the needs of
the caregivers. These results are sustainable if the capacity building of the frontline workers is ingrained
in the system, and a platform for constant support and engagement is maintained.
FLWs also report an increase in the parent response rate and an improvement in meeting attendance,
indicating a change in the community perspective. The supervisors and the parents have noted an
improvement in the quality of home visits and mothers’ meetings, partly attributable to the joint
participation of the anganwadi workers and the ASHAs. At the child level, frontline workers have observed
advent of some positive changes, albeit small, in child health, hygiene, education and discipline. This is
due to the increased knowledge levels of both the frontline workers and the parents, and the positive
relationships that they have built with each other.
The improvements in the functioning of the anganwadis is another positive development of the project
which is likely to be sustained. As reported by a government official from Yavatmal, the project led to an
increase in the involvement of the ASHA facilitators, block community mobilizers and the lady supervisors.
The ASHA’s role and responsibility has been enhanced with the inclusion of Palak melawas and mothers’
meetings to their work agendas. There is also an improvement in the communication gaps between the
supervisors and the FLWs, leading to a reduction in the supervisory gap that had existed before.
Another positive result which was discussed but still at a preliminary stage is the knowledge and attitudes
of caregivers around childcare and parenting. Stakeholders including frontline workers, UNICEF staff
members and CSO partners report that parents are better informed and more interested in their
children’s development as a result of the intervention. Some of the parents are now spending more time
with their children. These results are likely to be sustained as once parents realize the benefits of these
activities on the children’s welfare and development, they will continue that engagement for a long time.
Now people are giving importance to education of children, sending them to Aanganwadi centres
regularly. Keeping them clean and tidy and also giving them good food. (ASHA, Udaipur)
It (ECD project) has yielded some great results and impacts and it can be observed in our district. As
I said now, the National Family Health Survey has helped us to understand the indices that indicate
malnutrition among children in our district. Our district has performed quite well. So, the results
Page|114
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
which are visible are seemingly good and the impact of the project is note-worthy as well. (District
govt. official, Yavatmal)
I think the whole approach of the capacity development (of the FLWs) was not that, you know, I teach
and you learn, it was mutual teaching and mutual learning and I think that is really translated into
very clear sense of empowerment and also adequate skills which have helped them to really know
the job that they are doing more comprehensively and with better results. (UNICEF Staff, Maharashtra)
There was one common feedback that we are getting from Anganwadi workers saying that "we knew
that we had to do something about early child education. We have heard that is important. We really
understand the project and we feel confident talking about it and taking it to homes because we have
a lot of materials to engage with parents." (UNICEF Staff)
ECD made them (FLWs) very innovative and today, they come out with such innovative videos and all,
you will be amazed! So, innovations are coming from them. (UNICEF Staff)
The attention to parenting has been one of the positive results of this. Parenting for health and
nutrition was always there. But parenting for learning, the attention to that is a good thing and is one
of the positive results. So much that the education department jumped at it and they were absolutely
going to do it for their anganwadi centres. (UNICEF Staff)
SEQ 13.2: Are any areas of the intervention clearly unsustainable? What lessons can be learned from such areas?
Despite the success that the project has achieved, there are certain components of the project that might
be difficult to sustain in the future. For example, parents require renewed and continuous training on the
technical aspects of the project since it is difficult for them to retain information on technical terms such
as cognitive development, responsive parenting and so on. A mechanism to refresh their knowledge on
such relevant topics can lead to sustainability in the long term.
As per a government official from Yavatmal, Palak melawas might be difficult to sustain in the long term.
Even though these melawas are successfully conducted by the FLWs and the parents have built an interest
in such events, they require continuous support, a budget and planning for their implementation. If this
support is not continued, it will be difficult to sustain them in the future.
The feedback mechanism developed between the ICDS supervisor and the Anganwadi worker might be
difficult to sustain in the long term since the block coordinator took on many of the responsibilities of the
supervisors as per a CSO partner from Maharashtra.
Another important aspect shared by a UNICEF staff from Rajasthan is that the direct support that was
granted to frontline workers under the pilot project is not scalable to other areas. This was only part of
the learning project and is not something that can be replicated in other districts, given its resource
intensity. In addition to this, the support provided by the CSO partners is an area that is difficult to replicate
and sustain in the long term without an injection of funding support.
There have been communities where the attendance to the Palak Sabhas was restricted, or the
Anganwadi worker wasn’t influential mostly because of the relationship of the supervisor and another
work which was given priority to. So, the struggles will continue. Sustaining this and doing this again
and again is going to be a real bottleneck because once reinforcement from partners like us stops,
and they take over their own role, I think, they will face more challenges. (CSO Partner)
SEQ 13.3: What are the major factors that influenced the achievement or nonachievement of sustainability of
the intervention?
Page|115
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
As per a CSO partner and UNICEF staff member from Maharashtra, one of the main factors that will
contribute to the sustainability of the project is the continuation of monthly training sessions for the
frontline workers or at least refresher training sessions from time to time. Without this continuous
supportive and appreciative system for the frontline workers, it will be difficult to sustain the positive
results
The core approaches adopted by the project such as home visits already existed in the Health and ICDS
infrastructure. These are mandated by the government and will continue to function in the future as well.
The fact that the project is built within the government schemes and within the scope of the government
funding can ensure its sustainability as per a CSO partner and UNICEF staff member. The regular monthly
meetings with CDPOs and monitoring with supervisors has to be integrated holistically into the project.
There is a need to provide the frontline workers with constant support and to have active communication
with them.
The shift in the priority of the local government bodies is one area that hampers the sustainability of the
project. The changing of department heads is also of concern since it takes time to convince the new
official of the importance of ECD and the importance of the project.
Another factor that will determine the sustainability of the project is the catalyst for supervisor training in
Maharashtra. The training for the frontline workers is performed within the system, however, the training
of the supervisor is done by an external partner. So, the senior officials will have to act as catalysts to
encourage and spread the training to the supervisors, as well as bear the related costs of the same.
A simple thing that I believe in and we all talk about is believing in the intent and capacity of each
one of us. And we believed in the intent and the capacity of the supervisors and frontline workers,
and that paved the way, because that helped us build an excellent relationship with supervisors and
FLWs. Everyone felt part of the project, everyone owned the project. And that was the major reason
due to which the kind of response we have got in this project, that was possible. And while we used
an appreciative approach while we were dealing with supervisors and FLWs, we also had liaison with
higher authorities. So, they knew that this is what the system also wants and that was very helpful.
(CSO Partner)
I think the frontline workers led a huge part because as they are the members of the community, the
community has more acceptance for their words rather than the someone external to their
community and telling something. (CSO Partner)
The best thing about ECD training was the participatory role of each person. They (FLWs) really
enjoyed it. That really makes a huge difference. They (FLWs) agreed and felt that the project was for
them, and they could stay in the program and make some change. (District Government Official,
Aurangabad)
Without constant support and constant communication with the field functionaries, it is not possible
to keep it (project activities) sustainable. (UNICEF Staff, Rajasthan)

A Caring Guardian – An Uncle
Twenty-three-year-old Rajesh, of Amarpura village in Udaipur district of Rajasthan, has been an uncle for quite
a few years. Though unmarried, he has in-depth knowledge regarding the issues of women and children in his
community and has observed many changes related to the same in his village. Earlier, children started school
at the age of 6 years, however, nowadays toddlers were getting pre-schooled at the age of 3 in the Anganwadi
centers, before joining formal schools. He has also observed a decline in the fertility rate in his community with
families preferring 1-2 children, as compared to 4-5 children in the past.
Parents in the community had always wanted their children to develop but lacked awareness on the proper
methods for bringing about that change. Rajesh found the parenting and Early Childhood Development (ECD)
intervention a welcome change in the lives of the parents and children of the community. Through regular
parent’s meetings and home visits, parents were counseled on ways to educate their children effectively on
different aspects of early childhood development. While a majority of the men remained busy with work,
mothers made it a point to attend the meetings and discussions organized by the frontline workers. Rajesh, his
niece’s mother, and grandmother - all attended these meetings.
The parent anganwadi meetings and home visits were organized to train and educate parents and other
caregivers regarding early childhood development and care. They were taught effective learning techniques to
engage young children at home such as teaching children about shapes, sizes and colors by showing them
vegetables in the kitchen, holding children’s hands and teaching them how to write, teaching young children
proper hygiene practices via demonstrations, using play to stimulate physical and cognitive development.
Parents were repeatedly counselled not to beat or shout at children citing development concerns; instead they
were taught to handle their children with love and care.
Being actively involved in the intervention, Rajesh took it upon himself to increase his engagement with his niece
to foster her care and development. He would conduct surprise tests such as asking his niece to recite poems
she had learnt, stories she had heard, the names of birds and trees, colors of the things present in their
surroundings etc. Observing gradual changes in her responses, Rajesh realized the true importance of early
childhood development in creating a strong base for the physical and mental development of his niece, and
bringing a bright future for her, her parents, and the society at large.

EQ14: To what extent there is government ownership to sustain the focus on parenting
care for improved ECD services?
SEQ 14.1: What are the specific components in which the state government would continue the focus on
parenting care for improved ECD services?
The government is likely to continue its focus on preschool education and the AAKAR curriculum as noted
by a government official from Aurangabad. The ECD modules which have been introduced as part of the
intervention are informative and easy to understand and are likely to supplement the government’s efforts
around preschool education. Being a part of the ICDS scheme, the focus on the 1000 days programme is
likely to be sustained for a long time. Given that refresher training is organized by the government, they
can ensure that ECD is a part of the refresher training given to the frontline workers.
In Maharashtra, the government will continue to support the implementation of the parent’s meeting
platform. This is because the activity suggestions for the meeting are derived from the government’s
AAKAR curriculum. In addition to this, the ECD tool and the Palak Sabha tool have been prepared and
fitted into the functioning of the meetings.
The Home Based Young Child Care programme is a flagship government scheme being implemented in
Maharashtra in the ECD domain, which can incorporate and sustain aspects of responsive parenting and
stimulation from the UNICEF project. In the nutrition domain, focus will continue on responsive feeding
and complementary foods, and on parenting and stimulation for early learning.
In Rajasthan, as reported by an official from Dungarpur the government’s focus on certain schemes such
as the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan and Indira Gandhi Priyadarshini Yojana for child health
will be retained for a long time. The areas of child health and nutrition will continue to garner the attention
of the government officials. A UNICEF staff from Rajasthan has also noted that the government will
continue to focus on parent anganwadi meetings and home visits, given that they are already a part of the
government infrastructure.
In addition to this, focus on budgeting for the schemes being implemented by the government will be
enhanced. Given that the training delivered to the frontline workers have budgetary constraints, the
expansion of these services warrants an expansion of the budget allocation towards these programs.
The expansion of non-formal education for children under the new education policy in the country will
also renew focus on the needs and requirements of children under the age of six.
SEQ 14.2: To what extent the sub-district, district and state-level officials of ICDS and Health have been involved
in the project intervention?
Various levels of officials from ICDS and Health were involved during the planning of field training,
supporting supervisors in their training to the frontline workers and providing administrative support for
the training. One of the CSO partners noted that they received more support from the ICDS department
in comparison to the health department. They were present for the training and reviewed the progress
on the project actively. They were informed from the very beginning about the project activities.
Officials at four levels, the Secretary, Director, Deputy Director, and CDPOs were well informed which
ensured their continued support. They were advocates of the project and pushed it forward. The project
team took these officials for home visits, to mothers’ meetings and palak melawa. Seeing the components
of the program live in action and based on their own experience in these field visits, they appreciated the
additions that were being made for the project.
Page|118
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
One of the CSO partners from Maharashtra noted that their team did not expect staff from the health
department to have proactive engagement with the project since the health department’s priority is on
diseases and other treatment-related activities. However, they were surprised to see the participation
from the department’s employees on a large scale, although their participation ebbed in the COVID
period.
The district level and block level staff were so moved and so excited with this intervention that they
said, this intervention can’t go forward till we join the training. So, we must join the training. (CSO
partner)
So, definitely state ICDS, they were on board. From day one they were part of all the discussion. Lady
supervisors, anganwadi workers, they were part of developing those materials, those packages which
we used for this parenting program. Later, the principal secretary and minister were very happy to
see that package. They wanted to scale it up in all the anganwadi centres with the proper training
mechanism. (UNICEF Staff)

5. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNT
5.1. Conclusions
The evaluation team has drawn conclusions from the key findings according to the research questions
that guided the evaluation. It has been structured along the evaluation criteria, summarizing the key
findings and analysis for each of the evaluation criteria.
Relevance: The project has demonstrated its relevance in building the capacities of frontline functionaries
(AWWs and ASHAs) on responsive parenting to achieve the goals of ECD to ultimately reach the caregivers
in the community. The FLWs were equipped with the what, why and how of responsive parenting
messaging through regular trainings, continuous monitoring and handholding. The project’s relevance
further gains strength given that responsive parenting is relatively a new area in the Indian context.
The project addressed the most pressing needs of parents regarding child development and care and
enhanced their understanding of different ECD aspects. FLWs were also gender-sensitive in organizing
suitably timed meetings specifically for fathers and utilized innovative engagement methods e.g. the
blackboard painting task outside their homes for children. Although still on the lower side, the emerging
role of father as a parent who interacts, and plays is an encouraging improvement from a role where they
were feared or not involved. In fact, as some of the case studies illustrate, some fathers have emerged
champions for responsive and pro-active parenting for their children, inspiring others.
Effectiveness: The evidence suggests that the project, as a pilot, has been largely effective in – a) building
the skills and capacities of the FLWs (AWWs and ASHAs) on responsive parenting and care, b) utilizing the
available institutional platforms to reach out to caregivers. Evidence suggests that the trainings not only
built FLW’s communication skills and confidence, but also equipped them with necessary skills for
improved information dissemination. However, lower proportion of ASHAs (55.3%) in Maharashtra and
AWWs (46%) and ASHAs (23%) in Rajasthan reported to have received the training on positive parenting
and ECD. This suggests further efforts required to include all the FLWs in these training sessions.
FLWs were able to use the communication materials/tools in communicating with parents at the various
platforms effectively. The communication materials in the form of flipcharts/cards and posters to counsel
parents contained information on nutrition, play and engagement, messages for pregnant women and
other ECD related information. The FLWs perceived that the communication tools made their jobs easier,
acted as effective visual aids to explain difficult messages and eased the language barrier.
Gender and equity-based concepts are integrated in the communication package material with clarity and
seamlessness. It breaks the gendered roles and responsibilities, toys, communication and activity
engagement. Most of the messaging uses gender-neutral language (English) e.g.
their/them/they/child/children.
At the child level, frontline workers have observed the advent of some positive changes, albeit small, in
child health, hygiene, education and discipline. This is due to the increased knowledge levels of both the
frontline workers and the parents, and the positive relationships developed with each other.
However, the intervention was partly effective in reaching out to fathers due to reasons such as lack of
availability of fathers due to work, migrant nature of jobs, orthodox mindsets, lack of awareness, and
illiteracy. Findings reveal that majority of men considered childcare and parenting outside their domain
and were unware of their responsibilities as fathers. It is critical to engage fathers as well as other family
members in the responsive parenting sessions to ensure a more supportive system for the mother and
child at home.
Page|121
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
Home visits and parent Anganwadi meetings were found to be the most effective platforms to reach
caregivers for counselling. Other platforms such as mother’s/father’s meetings, palak melawas, school,
hospital and temple premises, and community centres were also utilized. Findings suggest an enhanced
utilization of existing platforms by frontline workers to orient caregivers on the importance of early
childhood development and are in line with the reconstructed theory of change.
Efficiency: The evaluation provides evidence on the efficiency of the parenting project in terms of utilizing
the available government resources – human resource, infrastructure and institutional platforms such as
mothers’/ parents meeting, home-visits, community-based events.
Although the utilization of sector meetings for trainings in Rajasthan was an efficient way of using available
government platform, often the issue of lack of time for training of FLWs cropped up due to administrative
duties to be rendered. In Maharashtra, instead of sector meetings, separate training sessions were
conducted for master trainers and FLWs, with a minimal cost to the system. Although there was a slightly
greater time requirement from master trainers and FLWs. Having a separate day in a month for FLW’s ECD
training was more effective as FLWs were able to concentrate and learn better.
Sustainability: There is consensus among stakeholders (government officials at state and district, levels,
UNICEF staff members, and CSO partners) that the intervention is scalable to other blocks/ districts in the
two intervention states. The scalability of the present model is apparent in the fact that the project utilizes
existing government human resource, infrastructure and platforms, and the positive reception of training
by the FLWs. Efforts are being made at the block, district and state levels to integrate ECD into their existing
working framework, which ensures its sustainability.
Further, for more sustained results, some potential issues need to be addressed – enhanced coordination
between ICDS and health department, more frequent and regular refresher trainings for FLWs, providing
travel allowance for ASHAs, and re-adjusting the training schedule to cover the critically required contents
within less time. Another potential challenge which was addressed well in Maharashtra and should be
used as a case study is the teaming up of Anganwadi worker and ASHA (for trainings and joint visits).
Another critical observation is the lack of continuation of the intensity of support provided to the pilot
project in its scale up, that can have consequences on the intended outcomes from the intervention. Thus,
the project should be made less resource-intensive either by reducing the number of training cycles or by
using digital platforms like videos or by conducting online training sessions.
In sum, the evaluation findings indicate that the supportive resources and structures need to be adjusted
for scale-up and the intervention needs to be further institutionalized in the planning processes. The
project efficiently and effectively makes use of the existing government resource and infrastructure and
supplements and compliments the government ECD initiatives. The project should be streamlined in both
the policy agenda and the annual work plan of the government, ensuring that the project’s domain
becomes mainstream in government initiatives. Tackling of coordination issues with Ministries and
Departments will also support project scale-up.

5.2. Lessons learnt
The evaluation has highlighted several learnings that will inform the scaling up of the model in other
blocks/ districts in the two intervention states and designing similar interventions.
a) Leveraging of existing resources from government schemes/ programmes/ initiatives and
empowering frontline functionaries continues to be the mainstay of the project replicability and
scalability: The scalability of the present model is apparent in the fact that it makes use of the existing
government human resource and infrastructure like the ICDS and Healthcare workers, sector
meetings, community platforms and community-based events; as well as aligns communication
material content to the existing preschool curricula and uses tools already existing in the system like
the MCP card. This leveraging of existing resources effectively and efficiently and through strong
project components, is already resulting in plans afoot to scale to other districts. There is readiness
and need in the system to adopt and adapt the project on a wider scale. The inclusive approach of
involving officials from different levels has supported in implementation of the project. The advocacy
efforts from UNICEF and CSO partners have been critical in sustaining the project and supporting
scalability.
b) UNICEF’s continued advocacy, availability of technical support and commitment on the part of the
Government stakeholders have resulted in increased acceptance of the project by the Government
of Maharashtra (GoM) and Government of Rajasthan (GoR) and must continue: The project has seen
strong acceptance from both the Government of Maharashtra (GoM) and Government of Rajasthan
(GoR). This is reflective in Maharashtra’s decision to expand project activities to other districts in the
State as well as Rajasthan’s plans for distribution of communication packages across the state in the
upcoming year/s. UNICEF has played a critical role in the transition of the parenting project into a
state-level policy, engaging regularly with ICDS and health departments for policy advocacy. It has also
provided high-level technical assistance to the states in the form of training of master trainers,
frontline functionaries, developing communication packages, training content etc. Further, a good
learning is that committed government stakeholders will augment the impact further.
c) Collaboration between ICDS and Health departments in Maharashtra has amplified the results: The
collaboration between the government departments (ICDS and health) has improved the synergies
and the joint trainings under the project led to an amalgamation of the activities and improved their
capacities. Further, FLWs have started conducted joint meetings which led to a rise in the quality of
home visits and community meetings.
d) The FLW’s and Supervisors knowledge, attitude and perceptions (KAP) are likely to be sustained if
capacity building around responsive parenting and better work conditions are ingrained in the
system: As the most important part of the project and those who connect with families and
communities to work on behaviour change, frontline functionaries (AWWs and ASHAs) act as the
nucleus of the intervention. There are positive results of the intervention which are likely to be
sustained such as the positive change in the knowledge, attitude, and perceptions (KAP) of FLWs
around childcare and parenting, ability to use the available platforms better or supervisor’s capacity
built as trainer thereby creating a cadre of skilled human resource from within the system.
These results are sustainable if the capacity building of the frontline workers is ingrained in the system,
and a platform for constant support and engagement is maintained. Positive changes have been noted
at all levels – increased parent response rate and improved meeting attendance indicate a changing
community perspective; improvement in the quality of interactions between FLWs and caregivers
partly attributable to the joint functioning of the ASHAs and AWWs; and small improvements in child
health, hygiene and discipline due to increased knowledge of FLWs and caregivers.
Page|123
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
However, FLW’s are poorly compensated, overworked, not given travel expenses or allowances and
are drawn into all ground activities continually hence making their job extremely demanding on skill
and will but the needed job satisfaction and security are missing in the form of compensation. Thus,
work conditions need to improve and be systemic if the intervention has to create impact at scale.
e) Efforts to engage parents – both mothers and fathers and other caregivers is of utmost importance
to create a familial support and ownership for ECD: The results show that it is very important to
engage fathers as well as other family members in responsive parenting sessions. Efforts to educate
and improve engagement of fathers and other caregivers including elders in the family to change
social norms around parenting and childcare is a good strategy to build a supportive system for the
mother and child at home and for the child to receive continued responsive care.
Parents however would require renewed and continuous training on the technical aspects to retain
information. A mechanism to refresh their knowledge can lead to sustainability in the long term. Other
mediums like video and audio messaging could be harnessed as well.
f) Including fathers in the childcare remains a challenge: Despite best efforts of the project, involving
fathers in childcare remains a challenge due to lack of availability of fathers, migrant nature of jobs,
orthodox mindsets, lack of awareness, and illiteracy. This merit concerned efforts from government,
UNICEF and development partners to encourage the involvement of fathers in the childcare and
development for the well-being of the children.

6. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1. Recommendations based on key findings
The following recommendations were formulated based on (i) discussions with various stakeholders,
involved in design and implementation of the parenting project, such as frontline functionaries (AWWs
and ASHAs), master trainers (lady supervisors and ASHA facilitators), government officials at different
levels, CSO partners and UNICEF; (ii) analysing the perceptions of ultimate beneficiaries of the project –
caregivers of children 0-6 years; (iii) FLW survey findings and, (iv) review of relevant project documents.
The recommendations have incorporated views and perceptions of these stakeholders to provide
practical suggestions, which support and improve future programming and implementation.
Recommendations for UNICEF
a) Continue technical assistance to the Governments on responsive parenting and ECD as they scale up
and replicate in other districts [immediate and on-going]
UNICEF should continue its engagement with the Government of Maharashtra (GoM) and Government
of Rajasthan (GoR), providing technical assistance in the following areas:
• Liaising with the state level officials from ICDS and health departments to support in strengthening
monitoring and review systems
• Updating/ re-structuring the training modules on responsive parenting and care
• Training of trainers (master trainers)
• Process documentation
• Preparing policy briefs on importance of parenting and child development
• Any other activity identified in consultation with GoM and GoR
b) Sustained efforts to encourage the involvement of fathers and family members beyond the mother
in responsive parenting [immediate]
Sustained efforts are required at the community level to increase the participation of fathers and
families in responsive parenting. Separate sessions for fathers are warranted given the tendency of
mothers to speak freely in sessions without male members, and/or the sessions for fathers can be
presented as something especially for men, to avoid any perceived stigma of being involved in
"female" activities. Keeping in mind the challenges posed by the existing socio- cultural norms which
often act as inhibitors, for all future programmes, greater efforts are needed for including fathers and
families (especially grandparents) in ECD responsive parenting initiatives.
Discussions on household roles and responsibilities and decision-making processes around childcare
can be incorporated in sessions to facilitate behaviour change. Innovative strategies like harnessing
digital media, recognising and building father champions/leaders (mother or grandparents as well)
who become advocacy champions as well, and gender sensitive programming taking account of
challenges of time and space would be helpful. It is important to provide continuous support to parent
leaders to help them implement behaviour change exercises around existing parenting practices.
Lastly, parental leaders could also be compensated or recognised for their work to increase their level
of commitment with the project.
c) Keep the main components of the project model with some adjustments [immediate]
For a project that was implemented for a relatively short period of time, the results achieved in the
domains of capacity building of frontline workers, increased knowledge base of parents and caregivers,
Page|126
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
increased utilization of ECD services as well as alignment of project activities within the realm of the
existing government infrastructure are promising. The overall logic of the project and the way it is
implemented do not need to be substantively modified. The components around training, planning,
content, methods need to be retained as they are. Adjustments that need to be made can be done in
another iteration on content for modifications in activities for inclusion and equity, including explicit
practice-oriented sessions in training modules, and translations in different languages.
d) Equity and inclusion of children with different needs in communication material needs to be
continued but more explicitly [immediate]
There needs to be explicit training sessions on equity and inclusion. Also, one more iteration of the
content to move to gender neutral language, adding an explicit session on equity and inclusion, and
adding modifications for children with different needs is required especially in the context of care of
children from socially and economically disadvantaged sections as well as children with disabilities. In
addition, translation of the communication material content to local and regional languages will make
the intervention more implementable.
Recommendations for Government
h) Integration of responsive parenting intervention into the annual work plan [immediate]
The addition of the project in the annual workplan will help build coordination with various
departments right from the start and enable streamlining the priorities of the local government bodies.
The senior officials will have to act as catalysts to encourage and expand the training conducted by an
external partner and to bear the costs of the same. This will also help support clear resource allocation
at the government level for integrated ECD. Utilizing sector meetings as a training venue needs some
re-thinking to strategically place the training session during the meeting to ensure sufficient time for
the training. Review formats will need to include responsive parenting as well, so it is clearly
institutionalized, allowing the Governments to systematically review and address issues.
i) AWWs and ASHAs collaboration and working together [immediate]
The collaboration between the AWWs and ASHAs needs to be leveraged and become a core
component of the project implementation given that ASHA’s messaging on health and nutrition
benefits tremendously by being empowered with responsive parenting strategies.
j) Frontline functionaries (AWWs and ASHAs) education, job description and work status improvement
[immediate]
Skill, Will and Time Amortization are three essentials to look at. Skill - Capacity building of the frontline
workers should be ingrained in the system; Will - a platform for constant support and engagement
needs to be maintained, clarity in FLW’s job description with focus on 0-3 and 3-6 age groups and on
services beyond the centres as well as inclusion of data monitoring, parenting services and advocacy
components; Time - trainings need to follow the successful Incremental Learning Approach.
There needs to be greater recognition of their work in cash and/or kind, further enhancing
participation in FLW services. The variability in the educational qualifications of the frontline workers
across districts and states needs to be relooked. In addition, FLWs with lower levels of education
should receive more refresher trainings in comparison to FLWs with higher educational levels.
k) Ongoing trainings for parents [immediate and on-going]
Page|127
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
Parents require renewed and continuous training on the technical aspects of ECD. New parent
trainings as well as refreshers along with guidance and counseling as in the project should be
continued, ensuring long term sustainability.
l) Convergence with line departments [medium to long-term]
To ensure convergence of departments, clear set of institutional conditions for implementation should
be in place and a clear distribution of tasks between partner departments/organizations should be
laid down. Staff involved from other departments could then clearly understand the roles and
responsibilities of planning, monitoring and reporting and where they converge as well. Other
necessary conditions include available human and financial resources and skills and capacities
(technical and administrative) which could be leveraged.
m) Harnessing digital technology for responsive parenting [immediate and on-going]
Innovative technology usage can improve service delivery, enhance supervision and monitoring, and
leverage the use of data in decision making. The use of activity content in the form of a calendar during
the pandemic period worked well and needs to be studied and expanded as an additional support.
Use of digital platforms and telephonic networks (such as Whatsapp or an SMS group) should be
considered, especially for the beneficiaries located in remote and far-flung regions.
n) Interweaving with POSHAN Abhiyan completely to bring AWWs and ASHAs working together as a
team [immediate]
Given the tremendous benefit of responsive parenting in breast feeding and complimentary feeding,
and the synergistic work done by the AWWs and ASHAs as a team, it is critical that responsive parenting
be an integrated ECD approach bringing in WCD, health and ICDS together and complementing efforts.
Joint meetings to detail the implantation plan for the project in their respective regions will not only
improve planning and resource allocation but will also remove duplication of efforts across
departments.

Annexure 1: Terms of Reference for the evaluation
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Evaluation of the project “Space for Kids to be Kids” in Maharashtra and
Rajasthan
1. Background
The first six years of a child’s life, a period of rapid brain development and learning, are particularly
critical. Early childhood research and programmes have consistently demonstrated that provision
of services to support early childhood survival, growth and development along with parenting care
and safety are pre-requisites for early childhood development. Young children’s healthy
development depends on nurturing care—defined as care which ensures health, nutrition,
responsive caregiving, safety and security, and early learning.
Positive parenting is essential for building a secure relationship for healthy development of the
child, both boys and girls. It builds resilience, promotes brain development and is essential for the
child to function well as an adult. Caregiving that is responsive, gender neutral and disciplinary
practices influence behaviours in early childhood and are also a predictor of adult behaviour.
Furthermore, parental support and involvement is important once children go to preschool as well,
as children who have learning support at home have better school readiness and learning
outcomes in the early primary grades.
In keeping with the spirit of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, family and parenting support
is increasingly recognized as an important part of national social policies and social investment
packages aimed at reducing poverty, decreasing inequality and promoting positive parental and
child well-being.
Focus on the young child in India
The Integrated Child Development Services Programme of Ministry of Women and Child
Development is a multi-sectoral endeavour which aims at integrated delivery of a package of
services for children of 0–6 years of age, pregnant and lactating mothers and adolescent girls from
disadvantaged sections belonging to poorest of the poor families. Anganwadi centres, established
under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme for the delivery of early child
development services, have service provisions which includes nutrition, health, play-based pre-
school education. A fixed day approach namely the Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Day
(VHSND) organized at the anganwadi centre is a key platform to deliver the integrated package of
services for health and nutrition. The fixed monthly Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE)
Day is a platform for interface between the Anganwadi worker (AWW) and the parents/community
on care and education with a specific focus on children in the pre-school programme. The VHSND
and the ECCE day are complemented with other activities such as mothers’ meeting and preschool
Page|130
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
activities organized at the anganwadi centres and home visits undertaken by the AWW and the
Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA), who is a community health worker instituted by the
government of India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) as a part of the National
Rural Health Mission (NRHM).
Early Childhood Development and Gender
Gender inequality in India often manifests itself early, children are subjected to gendered nurture
and care. Data indicates that median duration of exclusive breastfeeding and any breastfeeding is
longer for boys as compared to girls (NFHS-4). In India under-five mortality rate is higher among
girls as compared to boys. Gender discrimination together with son preference results in young
girls receiving less nutrition, health-care, opportunities to play and access early learning. Also, it is
during the early years that girls and boys learn gendered attitudes and expectations - from parents,
caregivers, other family members and teachers. Right from the earliest age boys are prepared for
their future role as provider and protector, and girls as mothers and caregivers. Learning these
rules and expectations can be limiting for all children –particularly limiting for girls. Programming
that supports young girls and boys to develop to their fullest potential while also working to
transform unequal gendered power relations, and challenge “traditional” gender socialisation
processes offers a key opportunity to break the inter-generational cycle of gender discrimination,
and to advance rights of girl children.
IKEA Project
The current intervention “Spaces for kids to be kids” is a multi-country IKEA Foundation (Stitching
IKEA Foundation) supported project to improve early development. The intervention in India
adopts a system-based approach and utilizes the platforms available within the Anganwadi
services to reach caregivers. Strategic thrust is on building the capacity of the frontline workers
primarily the AWW and the ASHAs to effectively support parents/caregivers in improving care of
children at household level and in providing opportunities to support early learning in homes. The
strategic components of the intervention include development of training materials,
communication packages on parental care; building capacity of the frontline functionaries (AWWs
and ASHAs), which includes training and on the job support to enhance their knowledge, attitude
and perceptions on parenting care; and use of such learning through various platforms for quality
counselling and interaction with the parents/caregivers.
The IKEA funded project with its gender dimension aims that both male and female children have
equal access to services for early childhood care and education which will contribute towards
ensuring all girls and boys survive, thrive and develop to their fullest potential. The project
interventions are designed to emphasise that child care is not only the responsibility of mothers
but also needs the involvement of fathers. The capacity building of frontline functionaries included
how to use communication materials/tools in communicating with fathers as well.
In the context of the present intervention, parenting can be understood as the interactions,
behaviours, emotions, knowledge beliefs, attitudes, and practices associated with the provision of
nurturing care which is defined as care which ensures health, nutrition, responsive caregiving,
Page|131
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
safety and security, social emotional well-being and early learning43. The term parenting is not
limited to biological parents but extends to any guardian or caregiver providing consistent care to
the child.
To know more about current practices around parenting for early childhood development please
refer to Annex 1.
Project implementation
The intervention has been designed based on UNICEF’s approach to ensuring sustainable
development adopting pilot to policy to results-at-scale. The project in India aimed to improve
service provision and utilization and improve the coverage and quality of counselling and
communication support to parents/caregivers to provide nurturing care and early learning
opportunities to their children. The intervention covers select districts in the states of Maharashtra
and Rajasthan. This project is an innovation in India since promoting parental involvement for
quality early childhood development (ECD), both in terms of improving their awareness with
regards to care and development of their children and increasing demand for quality services, had
not been implemented in India.
For sustainability and to ensure scale up, interventions were designed within the overall
governments’ capacity development strategy linked to ongoing programmes e.g. Poshan Abhiyaan,
Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK), Home Based Young Child Care (HBYC) and
strengthening early childhood education under the umbrella of the ICDS programme. In both
states, the implementation of activities has been through existing government structures: for
capacity building of frontline workers (AWW and ASHA); as well as the delivery of quality services
including counselling of parents through existing platforms of ICDS.
The project was initiated in August 2017, in a partnership with the Department of Women and
Child Development in the states of Maharashtra and Rajasthan. Select districts44 in each state were
identified for implementation of the project activities. In each of the selected districts, specific
blocks were identified for implementation of the project activities. Districts have been selected
targeting marginalized populations of children (children from tribal groups, children living in urban
slums, and children living in rural areas. In each state, blocks within the district were selected
based on certain parameters. In Maharashtra, blocks were selected in consultation with
government on the basis of the least number of staff vacancies in ICDS. In Rajasthan, the blocks
selected were those with ongoing programme on nutrition/education. UNICEF was responsible
for developing the project design and providing technical support to partners for the
implementation of the project. Civil Society Organisations (CSO)45 partners were selected to
provide technical and monitoring support to the project and were responsible for developing the
43 Nurturing Care Framework - a framework for helping children survive and thrive to transform health and human
potential was created in response to strong evidence and growing recognition that the early years are critical for human
development. https://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/nurturing-care-early-childhood-

training material and communication toolkit for parents of children (0-6 years) and imparting
training to front line workers (FLW). The target for each state was to build the capacity of 2,500
frontline workers across the selected geographies.
Each state has adopted a capacity building strategy to suit the programming context as well as the
platforms available for communicating with parents e.g. in Maharashtra an Incremental Learning
Approach (ILA) was adopted for training. ILA builds learning incrementally to enable the frontline
workers to internalize the learning, develop skills and take necessary actions. Training used games,
activities and demonstrations on how to conduct a mothers’ meetings and home visits. In
Rajasthan, the capacity building of frontline workers was implemented during the monthly sector
meetings organised by the field supervisors. A team of field supervisors was trained to equip them
with skills and knowledge on training AWW on positive parenting with special reference to
responsive parenting including early stimulation and creating a learning environment at home.
The implementation approach in each state was different. The brief notes on the implementation
strategy adopted by each state is attached in Annex 6.
Training of FLWs followed a cascade training model. The training programme content covered
various aspects of early childhood development as outlined in the nurturing care framework along
with an understanding of early childhood education (ECE) focussing on all domains of
development and linked to the ECE curriculum. The training programmes also focussed on
building skills on effectively communicating key messages using the communication tools, for
counselling parents during, meetings and home visits. CSO partners in each state imparted
training to the master trainers including ICDS field supervisors and ASHA facilitators and also
provided oversight to trainings for quality assurance. In case of Rajasthan a mix of ICDS officials
and resource persons from CSOs were part of the master trainers’ group. The master trainers in
turn imparted training to the FLWs on responsive parenting, and on creation of a learning
environment at home for child development etc.
In Rajasthan, the trained FLWs reached out to parents/caregivers through the existing platform of
mothers’ meeting, community meetings, Parent Anganwadi Meeting (PAM) 46 with
parents/caregivers, home visits and community-based events, maternal and child health and
nutrition sessions. The intervention prioritized the effective use of communication tools (MAA tool
kit for promoting infant and young child feeding, POSHAN Abhiyaan key takeaways, Mother Child
Protection card and communication cards (Sabrang) developed focussing on promoting learning
at home for children age 3-6-years-old) and improving the coverage and quality of these events.
Parenting communication toolkit Sab Rang in Rajasthan focused on key messages for counselling
parents to promote learning at home for children 3-6-year-old. These messages were aligned to
the developmental milestones laid down in the Early Learning Development Standards (ELDS)
developed and standardized for children in India.
In Maharashtra, parents’ meetings, VHND, growth monitoring week, community-based events,
home visits and family fairs (palakmelas), were strengthened for the delivery of parenting
messages. The focus of messages for children in the 0-3 age group was on exclusive breastfeeding,
46 In Rajasthan the monthly ECCE day is referred to as Parent Anganwadi Meeting (PAM)
Page|133
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
complimentary feeding, responsive feeding, feeding during illness, care of a new-born baby,
growth monitoring and promotion, and play and communication.
The Samvedansheel Palakatv (Responsive Parenting) flip-charts were developed for communicating
messages for responsive parenting focussing on children in the 3-6 age group. The key messages
have been aligned to the state ECE curriculum Aakar. Learning was further reinforced through
supportive supervision by Field Supervisors and ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) mentors
or the CSO partners.
The project envisaged a number of immediate outcome and two intermediate outcomes from the
intervention. The immediate outcome of the project intervention is increase in knowledge, attitude
and practices of FLWS, who received the training from Master trainers. The two intermediate
outcomes are: change perceived by parents/caregivers on improved services in terms of
improvement in the quality of counselling and interaction with the community; and new
information on parenting received by parents/caregivers. Hence, the evaluation will not only
assess all the project activities including capacity building of frontline workers to communicate
parenting messages but also to what extent the FLWs transferred these learnings to the
parents/caregivers through various platforms such as Mothers meeting, Parent Anganwadi
Meeting (PAM)/Monthly ECCE day, home visits and community meetings.
A baseline study47 was commissioned and the study covered the six intervention districts and
assessed the knowledge, attitude and practices of the frontline workers (both AWW and ASHA
workers). The baseline was done as part of a formative study on parenting that examined how
raising children (both girls and boys) is understood among different stakeholders and what
sources of parenting support exist for parents and caregivers. The study used mixed method
approach with quantitative survey and Dyads (anganwadi worker and ASHA interviewed together)
with the frontline workers. Computer assisted individual interviews were conducted with 600
AWWs and; 14 dyads were also conducted to explore their current level of involvement, expertise
and training on ECD.
2. Rationale & Objectives
Rationale
The evaluation of the ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project is necessary at this stage for several
reasons. First, it is important to ascertain whether the positive parenting intervention actually
worked as intended, and to determine its strengths as well as areas for improvement (and this is
also why an evaluation is required by the donor). Second, there is not much evidence on positive
parenting currently available in India, and this evaluation will generate important evidence for
early child development in India, where this is still a relatively new area. Third, this evaluation has
the opportunity to influence policy decisions, in both Maharashtra and Rajasthan, as well as
nationally, using the evaluation findings to support scale-up. Specifically, the findings will generate
learnings for the government on the sustainability and scalability of such a systems approach in
which interventions for early childhood development were designed within the overall
governments’ capacity development strategy linked to various ongoing programmes. Aside from
the donor requirement, due in early 2020, the timing of the evaluation is apt as there is strong
47 Formative Study on Parenting, UNICEF 2017
Page|134
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
appetite from the concerned state governments to learn from the evaluation findings before
strategizing on scaling up in other districts.
Objectives:
The main objectives of this evaluation are to:
9. Assess the relevance of the project, specifically the role of parental support and
involvement to support early childhood development including the support of early
learning in the home.
10. Assess the effectiveness of the programme in the select districts in Maharashtra and
Rajasthan, specifically in terms of whether it has achieved its intended immediate and
intermediate outcomes or not
11. Assess the programme effectiveness from gender and equity perspective; specifically to
what extent the programme was able to achieve its gender and equity focus e.g. reach
out to vulnerable communities as well as fathers.
12. Assess the efficiency of the programme in terms of utilisation of available resources and
timely implementation, and understand where processes can be improved for better
programme delivery
13. Capture immediate results of the interventions if any that support pathways to
programme impact
14. Determine the readiness for the programme to be scaled up to other districts
15. Assess the sustainability of the programme in terms of ownership of the government
16. Capture good practices and lessons learned
3. Use of Findings
As described, the findings from the evaluation will be used to inform the national and state level
policy makers and programme planners about improving the quality of ECD services with a specific
focus on promoting responsive parenting for children in 0-6-years age-group. For the states of
Maharashtra and Rajasthan, the findings will be of great importance as the intervention has been
implemented in selected districts through the existing structures and platform of ICDS. As the two
state governments are planning for scaling up of this intervention across all anganwadi centres,
the learnings and recommendations of this evaluation will be of great value.
From UNICEF programming perspective, the conclusions and recommendations from this
evaluation will inform UNICEFs support to government, for improving the quality of ECD
programmes, with a specific focus on promoting positive parenting for children below the age of
6 years. The dissemination of the findings from the evaluation will enable UNICEF to reach out to
parents, caregivers, professionals and the larger community and create awareness regarding ECD
services with a specific focus on promoting parental involvement in providing nurturing care for
their children.
The findings from the evaluation will contribute to evidence building in India on improving the
quality of ECD services with a specific focus on promoting parental involvement. The findings will
also inform other key stakeholders who are part of the ecosystem, including CSOs, academic
institutions who work closely with state governments in improving the quality of ECD services.
4. Publication Plan
Page|135
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
The findings will be made publicly available, as per UNICEF’s Evaluation Policy, and published on
UNICEF’s website. At this stage there is no intention to publish the results academically since the
results are meant primarily for programmatic purposes. However, a final decision around this will
be taken during the Inception phase of the evaluation. The findings will be disseminated internally
by UNICEF through various programme network meetings. The findings of the study will also be
disseminated at the national and state level, to the officials of the relevant ministries and their
departments in the implementing states to inform scale-up of the programme.
Any publication will follow UNICEF’s guidelines. For academic publishing, UNICEF’s Guidance on
External Publishing should be followed.
5. Scope of the Evaluation
Evaluation criteria and questions
The evaluation will cover the OECD/DAC evaluation criteria of relevance, efficiency, effectiveness
and sustainability. The evaluation of impact is beyond the scope of this TOR, and is anticipated to
take place at a later stage, once the intervention has been running for sufficient time to be able to
affect behaviour and practices of parents/caregivers regarding positive parenting.
The evaluation should focus on two broad aspects of the cascade training method: (i) the training
causal chain, such as quality of the training of the master trainers, supervision of the trainers,
testing of FLWs, replacement of trainers, training of new FLWs as old ones leave, etc); (ii) the
organizational causal chain, specifically UNICEF working with CSOs to train government workers
at level middle to train front line workers at level bottom.
The draft evaluation framework matrix including the evaluation questions is given in Annex 2. The
matrix will be revised by the evaluation team, in consultation with UNICEF, during the inception
phase. Based on their understanding, bidders are encouraged to add additional gender and equity
specific questions and sub-questions in each evaluation criteria.
Geographic focus and scope
The evaluation will be conducted in four districts of Maharashtra and two districts of Rajasthan,
where the ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project has been implemented, between August 2017- till the
date of commencement of the study. It is pertinent to mention here that State-specific training
packages and communication tools, including parenting communication toolkit, were developed
to suit the programme context in both the states. Hence, the evaluation design and approach
should factor in the state level specificities.
Time Period
The evaluation will cover activities implemented between August 2017 till the commencement of
the study. In order to assess the extent to which the FLWs used their learnings to communicate
with parents/caregivers, through various platforms, those FLWs will be chosen for data collection
where the parenting intervention should be at least of one-year duration after the training.
Page|136
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
6. Methodology
In order to meet the objectives, it is expected that this formative evaluation will use a cross-
sectional mixed-methods design, involving both quantitative and qualitative data collection and
analysis of both primary and secondary data sources. A quantitative survey will predominantly be
used to assess to see changes in knowledge, attitude and practices of frontline functionaries
regarding ECD, while qualitative methods such as key informant interviews, focus groups and case
studies will be used to determine some of the more descriptive results. It is further suggested that
observation is used, especially to measure the actual behaviour and practices of FLWs when they
are interacting with parents/caregivers. The quantitative survey will need to adopt a similar
methodology as the baseline study, to allow for a pre- post- comparison on the knowledge and
attitudes of front line workers.
In addition to interacting with FLWs, the evaluation will need to capture the views and opinions of
various stakeholders involved in the project implementation including government functionaries
from the relevant departments at state and district levels, CSO partners, Master trainers and the
UNICEF staff. Furthermore, it is expected that there will be data collection with parents/primary
caregivers, to understand the change perceived by parents/caregivers on improved services in
terms of improvement in the quality of counselling and interaction with the community, and to
assess whether parents/caregivers received new information on parenting.
The proposed methodology, as set out in more detail below, is based on experience of designing
similar evaluations but should be enhanced based on the bidders’ understanding of the project,
and objectives and scope of the evaluation. Therefore, the agency could either utilise a similar
methodological approach to what is being proposed below or further suggest
improvements/modifications to the proposed methodology in their technical proposals. The
design, analytical methods and tools will be agreed between the selected agency and UNICEF
during the inception phase.
Importantly, bidders need to outline in sufficient detail in their proposals how they will be able to
conclude attribution and contribution of outputs and outcomes to the programme. Given the way
in which the project was implemented, it is not feasible to identify a control area to conclude. In
an intervention district, certain blocks were selected for the project intervention and currently the
process of scaling up is going on in other blocks of the district. Hence, it is difficult to select a
control block for comparison.
In order to help the bidder to develop a robust evaluation design and to understand the pathways
of change, a broad Theory of Change (ToC) of ECD is given in Annex 5. The bidder will develop a
ToC of the project intervention reconstructively based on their understanding of the broad ToC
and review of other project documents. The draft ToC will be shared during the inception report
stage and this ToC will be finalized in consultation with UNICEF programme team.
a) Desk review of documents
This will entail review of all key documents of the ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project, including
training modules, communication packages developed with key messages for different age
groups of children focusing on health, responsive care, nutrition, safety and protection and early
learning along with training materials developed for capacity building of FLWs. The review will aim
to assess whether the content was relevant for FLWs and parents/caregivers and whether they
Page|137
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
were of good quality, as well as evaluate gender and equity issues: e.g. whether messaging in the
communication package is gender neutral; whether messaging is customized to vulnerable
groups etc. In addition, the existing programme documents, baseline report and partner reports
will be reviewed. These will be useful in developing the study tools, and especially the baseline
report will be an important source to help design the quantitative survey, as mentioned above.
The desk review will also entail reading of important guidelines and policy papers such as
▪ National Early Childhood Care and Education Policy
(https://wcd.nic.in/sites/default/files/ecce_gazatte_notification_policy_comp.pdf)
▪ India Early Childhood Education Impact Study and Policy brief
(http://img.asercentre.org/docs/Research%20and%20Assessments/Current/Education/R
esearch%20Projects/IECEIStudyReport2017.pdf),
▪ National Guidelines for ECCE day
(https://wcd.nic.in/sites/default/files/eccedaydtd05082013.pdf),
▪ Home Based Young Child Care Guidelines
(http://nhsrcindia.org/sites/default/files/Handbook%20for%20ASHA%20on%20Home%2
0Based%20Care%20for%20Young%20Child-English.pdf) etc.
Apart from these guidelines and policy papers, important reports and studies on other parenting
programme will be reviewed. This will generate good understanding of the role of parenting
especially the best practices in other regions.
b) Primary data collection
It is anticipated that primary data collection will be conducted through field visits at state, district,
and AWC-level, involving four key components: (i) quantitative survey with sampled frontline
workers; (ii) qualitative key informant interviews and FGDs with representatives from relevant
government departments at state and district level, representatives of CSO implementing
partners, UNICEF staff members at state level, master trainers and parents/caregivers; (iii)
observation of FLWs when interacting with parents through various platforms on parenting; and
(iv) qualitative interviews for in-depth case studies to provide additional insights into
strategies/innovations adopted, key challenges, best practices and lessons learned. All primary
data collection should include gender/equity dimensions throughout to the extent possible.
Quantitative survey
The quantitative survey will aim to measure the knowledge, attitude and practices of frontline
functionaries with respect to early childhood development and positive parenting, as should be
based on the methods and tools used in the Baseline study. The Final report of the Baseline study
can be accessed at https://unicef-
my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/sahuja_unicef_org/EauJOuMMdgFAor7Za5qOvcQBdoysA-ye-
uHWGqttA-Zg9Q?e=VDdUOy. It is pertinent to mention here that the baseline study covered
selected indicators. Apart from these indicators, the quantitative survey under this evaluation will
capture data and information on additional indicators. Some of the additional areas of inquiry
include: quality of training received by FLWs; utilization of existing contact points (no. of meetings
organized, participation in meetings etc); ability of the FLWs to use the communication tools to
communicate with family; confidence of FLWs to interact with fathers etc. The bidders in their
proposal should include other indicators/areas of inquiry to be covered in the survey. The survey
Page|138
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
should be administered through CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interview), which improves the
efficiency and quality of the data collection.
Selection of frontline workers – The sample will be selected from the intervention centres based
on a stratified random sampling technique. The stratification will reflect the geographic typology
(rural/urban/tribal), duration of the intervention period and the intensity of the intervention (this
being especially applicable for Rajasthan)
The project was implemented in selected blocks of four districts of Maharashtra and two districts
of Rajasthan. The total number of sample frontline workers in a state will be proportionally divided
among the intervention districts. Selection of a frontline worker will be done randomly from the
list of AWWs of the select blocks. However, the selection should be done in such a way that the
sample will cover all the blocks of an intervention district. As mentioned in the scope of Evaluation
section, FLWs will be chosen from areas where the parenting intervention covering children 0-6
years has been implemented for at least one year.
Sample size calculations - The sampling universe for each state is 2500 frontline workers across the
selected districts. The estimation of a representative sample size at state level will provide a robust
sample for undertaking the analysis on variables of interest. A two-stage cluster sampling is
adopted to estimate the sample size at state level, i.e. clustering at district level and block level.
The sample size estimation is based on a 95% confidence level and a confidence interval (margin
of error) of 5%. The estimated sample size is 384. Applying a non-response rate of 5%, the required
sample size is estimated to be 400. To adjust the sampling error due to Cluster level sampling a
design effect48 will be considered for providing the required power to the sample size. Taking into
account a design effect of 1.5, the total sample for each state will be 600 (400*1.5). Thus, for two
states the total sample size will be 1200. The sample of 600 will have proportional representation
of AWWs and ASHA.
The agency is encouraged to provide any other sample design with a strong justification behind
the same and this will be scored accordingly in the technical evaluation.
Key Informant Interviews and Focus Group Discussions
Qualitative information from stakeholders will be obtained through KIIs and FGDs. Key informant
interviews will be conducted with representatives from relevant government departments at state
and district level, members of CSO implementing partners, UNICEF staff members at district and
state level, and master trainers. The purpose of the KIIs is to understand the implementation of
the positive parenting intervention, as well as assess what has worked and not in terms of
achieving intended outputs and outcomes. The KIIs will also be able to generate evidence in terms
of efficiency of the programme and what bottlenecks were encountered. Focus group discussion
will be held with the parents/caregivers to understand the change they have noted in the quality
of services delivered with respect to counselling parents, whether the messages are relevant for
them, whether this has influenced their parenting practices, whether the FLWs contact has
increased with the families, etc. It should be noted that the project envisaged to engage fathers in

the Parent meetings conducted by FLW. Hence, some of the FGDs should be conducted among
fathers to bring insights into positive parenting issue.
A suggested number of KIIs and FGDs to be conducted against each respondent group at various
levels has been given in the below matrix. The selected agency is encouraged to review and
validate this indicative number, and suggest any other participatory tools of qualitative data
collection to meet the objectives of the evaluation.
Respondent group No. at dist No. for 2 states (6 Total
level districts)
KIIs with officials of government department (ICDS, 2 2*6 =12 12
Health)
KIIs with Members of CSO implementing partners 4 4
KIIs with UNICEF staff members 1 1*6 =6 6
KIIs with UNICEF staff members at state 2 2
KIIs with Master trainers 4 4*6=24 24
FGDs with Parents/caregivers 2 2*6=12 12
Observation
Instances of interaction of FLWs with parents/caregivers should be observed in order to ascertain
whether FLWs are implementing what they were taught, and specifically how they are interacting
with parents/caregivers. It is suggested that in each intervention district three observations will be
conducted. A total of 18 observations will be held in 6 districts across the two states. Of the three
observations in each district, one will be on AWC based parenting session focussing on children
under 3; one will be on AWC based parenting session focussing on children 3-6-year old, and one
is on home visit by ASHA for counselling parents. The bidder in the proposal should clearly identify
the risks associated with observer bias in such a methodology and will identify risk mitigation
strategies.
Case Studies
Eight case studies should be developed, four each in Rajasthan and Maharashtra, focusing
specifically on key innovations/achievements and challenges of the project. It is expected that the
identification of potential cases will be done during the KIIs and FGDs. For each state, the specific
areas suggested for the case study include: the achievement of a FLW (ASHA/AWW) from the
project; a supervisor highlighting her role in building capacity of frontline worker (Field
Supervisor/ASHA mentor); feedback of a family/parents; and engagement of men especially
fathers. Any other ideas from the bidder on the topics of case study is welcome in the proposal. A
case study template will need to be submitted as part of the inception report.
c) Quality Assurance
The evaluation agency should ensure that data collected is of the highest possible quality,
including operational checks in the data collection process, as well as dealing appropriately with
possible biases. For primary data collection, this entails sufficient oversight and management of
the quantitative survey, KIIs and FGDs. Bidders are required to outline in their proposals what
quality assurance mechanisms they will put in place. At a minimum however, the expectation is
that surveyors and interviewers will be sufficiently trained, that tools and protocols and piloted,
and that a management structure exists where field managers will conduct spot checks and data
Page|140
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
checks. Furthermore, it is expected that where possible, data from different sources will be used
to triangulate the findings. Any potential bias either in the design or implementation of this
evaluation should be appropriately mitigated, and agencies are requested to outline in their
proposals what risks and risk mitigation strategies they will employ to ensure quality of the
evaluation.
d) Data Analysis
Standard analytical software needs to be used for both the quantitative and qualitative analysis to
allow for comparison of results with the baseline. The quantitative analysis may be done using
SPSS, STATA, or another standard package. For the qualitative analysis, analytical software such as
NVivo is recommended. Agencies are asked to specify which software they plan to use and their
level of experience with using it.
Bidders are expected to propose an appropriate analysis framework and analysis plan to
undertake comparison with the baseline on selected variables while undertaking analysis of
additional variables in this evaluation. In addition, given that the programme that was
implemented in Maharashtra and Rajasthan are slightly different, it is expected that a comparative
analysis will be conducted between the two States, as well as a unified analysis for the programme
as a whole. The analysis framework and analysis plan will be further refined and validated during
the inception phase, and agreed upon by UNICEF. Data emerging from the evaluation will need to
be disaggregated by sex, age, social group, etc, to the extent possible.
7. Ethical Considerations
The evaluation agency is expected to follow the ethical principles and considerations outlined in
the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation and the UNICEF
Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation and Data Collection and Analysis. In
addition, the UNEG norms and standards will be observed. Data collectors must undertake
appropriate ethics training as per the UNICEF Procedure. Any primary data collection conducted
with stakeholders must only be carried out with informed consent. Data collectors will emphasise
the voluntary nature of participation in the evaluation activities. In addition, participants who wish
to withdraw from the study after providing consent will be free to do so. All results will be reported
at aggregate level and no identifying information will be disclosed. The agency bidding for the
study should detail their ethical protocols in their proposal, along with their data protection and
data storing protocols.
The evaluation agency is strongly encouraged to seek IRB approval for this evaluation; while this
evaluation does not involve interacting with children, when speaking to FLWs and parents there
could be sensitive issues around parenting that may come up, such as examples of corporal
punishment or violence. Bidders should clearly identify any potential ethical issues and
approaches, as well as the processes for ethical review and oversight of the evaluation process in
their proposal.
8. Risks and Limitations
There are a number of anticipated risks and limitations of this evaluation. Bidders are required to
outline risks and appropriate mitigation strategies in their proposals, for the approach and
methodology they have chosen.
Page|141
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
• Key respondents for KIIs may not be available, especially given the short-time frame
available for primary data collection
• There are multiple risks involved while collecting qualitative data. Some of these include,
social desirability bias, interviewer or experimenter effect, issues of recall, etc.
• While collecting data from ‘implementers’, i.e. the key informants, there is a risk of
confirmation bias. The agency is encouraged to 1. triangulate findings and 2. Come up with
a strategy of identifying what is ‘true’ if two stakeholders have conflicting statements
• Data loss due to poor handling of data. Leakage of information is a possibility as data is
entered at multiple levels, travels from field to the evaluation team and changes various
formats. It is required of the agency to put in place transparency measures, such as the
Progress Reporting Template with live activity logs to ensure all details are logged and
reported in real time.
• Data manipulation- UNICEF teams will conduct on-field audits to ensure all practices stated
by the agency in the study design and work plans are followed. In addition, the agency
must ensure that the data is collected in the local language/dialect and must minimise
information loss during translations.
• Weather and climatic conditions (such as a heatwave, monsoon or natural disasters) may
disrupt the evaluation and/or cause delays, and inhibit movement of data collectors, key
informants, and the community at large.
• This evaluation does not seek to evaluate the impact of the ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’
project, only the inputs and outputs, and immediate outcomes. Therefore, cannot
conclude whether the scheme had an impact. In addition, it is anticipated that concluding
true contribution in terms of immediate outcomes might not be possible, and this should
be addressed appropriately in the findings.

Note: If required, two or more agencies may join to make a consortium bid. However, the
consortium will need to nominate one agency and individual as the clear point of contact with
UNICEF.
13. Duty Station
Data collectors from the evaluating agency (or from a partner/sub-contracted agency) will need to
be able to coordinate presence in the two states (Rajasthan, Maharashtra), where the evaluation
Page|144
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
is to be conducted and should understand the local context and speak and understand the
language used in these states.
14. Management and Supervision
Evaluation Management: Research & Evaluation Specialist, SPME (UNICEF)
Technical Support: Education Specialist (ECE), and Child Development Specialist, UNICEF.
UNICEF Responsibility: UNICEF India’s Child Development section and Education section will be
responsible for providing the evaluation team with the necessary background information to carry
out the evaluation as well as technical inputs throughout. UNICEF India will also keep the
evaluation team updated on any changes or development that may affect the evaluation.
For local logistics, the UNICEF State offices will provide necessary support to the evaluation team,
such as making introductions to key informants and stakeholders. However, the agency will ensure
‘independent selection’ of respondents in order to ensure that the responses received are not
biased toward or against UNICEF.
The Supply and Procurement Section will remain the focal point for all administrative, financial,
and commercial queries and correspondence, including contract amendment.
Evaluation Reference Group: An Evaluation Reference Group will be formed to oversee the
evaluation process and ensure compliance to United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and
Standards. It is an independent group of UNICEF and non-UNICEF experts (consisting of technical
experts, government representatives) constituted for a specific evaluation by UNICEF India. From
the government, UNICEF envisions the empanelment of various officials. In addition, state Child
Development Specialists from relevant states will be a part of the Evaluation Reference Group.
This group will serve as an advisory body which will support the evaluation by 1. providing strategic
direction and technical inputs, 2. monitoring progress and quality, and 3. bringing critical issues to
the notice of the Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist.
Responsibility of the Evaluating Agency: The evaluation agency will be required to satisfactorily
complete all the tasks mentioned in section 13 and all deliverables mentioned in section 15. The
“satisfactory completion” of each of these tasks, is subject to review by Evaluation Reference Group
and UNICEF internal and external review.
15. Official travel involved
The evaluation team will be required to travel to the states of Maharashtra and Rajasthan for data
collection and interactions with all stakeholders. These visits will be to the districts of Aurangabad,
Palghar, Pune and Yavatmal in Maharashtra and Dungarpur and Udaipur district in Rajasthan.
In addition, core team members from the selected agency will need to travel to UNICEF ICO for a
kick-off meeting during the inception phase.
It is assumed that, if the need be, on-field data collectors will be locally recruited by the agency (or
a partner/sub-contracted agency). Therefore, their training will be conducted by the agency,
individually in each state. It must be clarified that travel cost shall be calculated based on economy
class travel, regardless of the length of travel.

Annexure 2: Importance and Rationale of ECD and global approaches
and frameworks
2a. Importance and rationale of ECD
Evidence from literature suggests that interventions in the early years of a child’s life is more
effective than remediation in later stages of life of an individual49. Therefore, it becomes essential
that governments, in collaboration with development agencies and private sector, invest
adequately in ECD programmatic interventions50. Such an investment will optimise a government’s
spending, offsetting higher costs that governments would otherwise face if having to adopt
measures later on to ensure all children have equal access to primary school and achieve the
desired health and nutritional outcomes. Evidence from economics, behavioural and
neurosciences studies, which show that investment in early childhood can potentially yield long-
lasting benefits for children, families, communities and nations alike51.
An extensive analysis of existing ECD programme evaluations52 found positive trend of outcomes
that emulate those found in intervention programmes implemented in developed countries. The
study concluded that the potential long-term economic effects of increasing preschool enrolment
to 25% or 50% in every low-income and middle-income country has a potential benefit-to-cost
ratio ranging from 6.4 to 17.653. In the US studies have shown that the return for every dollar
invested in preschool is much greater (8:1) for the individual and society than an investment in
school-based programs (3:1)54. This corroborates the analysis that ECD is a cost-effective
intervention and help in accelerating the economic growth of a nation55. As per Lancet series56,
there are a number of interventions and policies which contribute towards holistic development
of children, such as family support and strengthening package; caring for the caregiver package;
and early learning and protection package. These details have been summarised in the Figure
below.

Figure 20: Interventions for ECD
Research shows that the early years of a child’s life are crucial for optimal development, thus ECD
interventions are widely recognized to have high social rates of return, especially in developing
countries. ECD is considered as one of the best interventions to prevent inequality caused by
poverty, due to its direct impact on child wellbeing (on nutrition, health, cognitive skills, self-help
skills and socialisation), on siblings (able to attend school), and on parents (parental employment).
Furthermore, ECD, as a package is considerably less costly than any other welfare and custodial
service and therefore contributes to greater productivity. For example, in a study conducted in
Brazil, it was estimated that the cost of a child in ECD is $100, on the street $200 and in prison
$100057.
Literature also identifies important factors that promote optimal child development, which
includes a mix of quality child-care, caregiver-interaction, maternal education, social support, and
breastfeeding58. Comprehensive approaches to ECD programmes are designed to improve the
cognitive and social-emotional functioning of children, which directly impacts their readiness to
learn and grow in a community setting59. Beyond this, ECD gives children developmental

stimulation, improving their academic and ultimately professional prospects. By combining
different aspects of early years support and development, ECD provides a comprehensive and
inclusive care package for the backbone of a country- their children. In the short term, it supports
the community by enabling parents and families to concentrate on their income and livelihood
needs whilst the younger generation is safe and well-cared for at ECD centres. In the long term, it
contributes to better standards of living and sustainable opportunities for those who attended
ECD programs60.
There are diverse factors which impact development of children in low- and middle-income
countries, and thereby can perpetuate inter-generational disadvantage 61 . These include
undernutrition and malnutrition (including iodine and iron-deficiency, child and maternal
anaemia62, minerals and micronutrients deficiency), infectious and other diseases (e.g. malaria,
HIV/AIDS, diarrhoea), and adverse psycho-social stimulation (e.g. children’s exposure to violence,
chronic anxiety and stress, maternal depression).
One of the key factors that affects the early development of child is maternal and child
undernutrition. Evidence suggests that maternal and child undernutrition are directly associated
with human development and therefore a nation’s human capital. Maternal undernutrition during
pregnancy contributes to low birth weight babies who, as a result, are vulnerable to infections and
other illnesses, leading to infant and child mortality. On the other hand, child undernutrition
contributes to stunting, wasting and underweight children. ECD programmes which targeted
nutrition and related health practices reduced:
i. stunting by 36 percent at 36 months,
ii. mortality between birth and 36 months by 25 percent,
iii. disability associated with stunting and severe wasting by approximately 25 percent63.
The period from conception to 24 months of age is a crucial window of opportunity for reducing
undernutrition and its adverse effects64.
Additionally, children’s exposure to adverse psycho-social environments (e.g. maltreatment,
exposure to violence and situations creating long-term anxiety and fear, inadequate stimulation,
maternal stress during pregnancy, and maternal depression) are risk factors which disrupt the
neural functioning of the brain and undermine a child’s cognitive functioning with lifelong

consequences65. Parental distress and family conflict also diminish the capacity to offer children
adequate care and protection66. Similarly, parents’ capacity for childcare is reduced, when families
live in disaster zones or countries in conflict zones, where there is a breakdown of services and
networks of support. The complexity, and immediate and long-term accumulative influences of
undernutrition, illness and adverse psycho-social stimulation, and its impact on ECD and life-long
opportunities are shown in Figure 3.
Figure 21: Effects of risk factors associated with child development
2b. Global approaches and frameworks
Approach to multi-sectoral ECD
In order to design effective ECD programmes, it is critical to understand the hidden and complex
interlinkages between maternal and child undernutrition and other illnesses. Undernutrition
greatly undermines children’s survival and detrimentally affects their growth, development, and
education. The compound and accumulative effect of these factors perpetuates inter-generational
poverty. The social and economic costs of such cases is immeasurable and hence their prevention
becomes an imperative priority for any nation.

Provision of quality ECD services, that integrate health, nutrition and pyscho-social skills and
education, provides a unique opportunity to address developmental needs of young children, over
a long duration, in a focused, child-friendly approach. Such approaches contribute to lifelong
educational and employment outcomes for children who attend ECD, with wider impact on a
society’s social capital and wealth.
Putting integrated ECD at the core of programmatic interventions
“... to be most effective, interventions must be intersectoral, going beyond education to
encompass health, nutrition, and protection. The healthy development of a child’s brain
depends on multiple positive experiences. Nutrition feeds the brain; stimulation sparks the
mind; love and protection buffer the negative impact of stress and adversity. And distinct
interventions are mutually supportive, achieving the strongest results when delivered
together.”
-- The Lancet, 20 Sept 2014
While children living in extreme poverty and those in conditions of conflict, disaster or
displacement are at greatest risk, children all over the world may be exposed to adversities that
impair their optimal development. In response to this urgent need, the World Health Organization,
UNICEF and the World Bank, in collaboration with the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child
Health, the Early Childhood Development Action Network (ECDAN) and many other partners, have
developed the Nurturing Care Framework, which was launched during the Seventy-first World
Health Assembly in May 2018. The Framework provides an evidence-based road map for action
and outlines how policies and services can support parents, families, other caregivers and
communities in providing nurturing care for young children. It calls for attention to be paid to
communities where children are most at risk of being left behind. The Framework depends on a
whole-of-society approach, mobilized through a coalition of parents and caregivers, national and
local governments, civil society groups, academics, the United
Nations, development partners, the private sector,
educational institutions and service providers, to ensure that
every child gets the best possible start in life.67
To reach their full potential, children need the five inter-
related and indivisible components of nurturing care: good
health, adequate nutrition, safety and security, responsive
caregiving and opportunities for learning. In the first years of
life, parents, intimate family members and caregivers are the
closest to the young child and thus the best providers of
Nurturing Care. This is why secure family environments are
important for young children. In order to provide caregivers

with time and resources to provide nurturing care, policies, services and community supports
need to be in place.68
As discussed in previous sections, including the Nurturing Care Framework, early childhood is seen
as the foundation for holistic human development. For a comprehensive understanding, as also
guided by the evidence-based framework, it is pertinent to look beyond a single sector approach
and focus on a joint approach that tackles the multiple impacts on children’s needs. This demands
a concerted effort to bring together sectors, which may not be traditionally integrated, under the
ambit of ECD programmes like education, health, nutrition and protection.
There are many effective nutritional interventions, but the interventions are not wholesome, and
provision tends to be fragmented69, which results in its inability to reach the poorest and most
disadvantaged sections of a population, especially those living in rural and inaccessible parts of
the world. Interventions which integrate the various components and dimensions discussed in the
sections above have been found to prevent the loss of developmental potential and sustain
children’s cognitive and educational benefits and psychological functioning70.
Another advantage of operationalising integrated ECD programmes is its capacity to tackle
multiple risk factors in low- and middle-income countries71. Integrated ECD programmes which
balance nutrition, health services and structured parenting programmes are found to have
substantial positive effects on the overall development and productivity of children compared to
stand alone programmes72.
However, in devising an ECD programme, it is imperative to understand the mechanism of its
delivery and provisioning. The reason being extent of ECD benefits is conditional on the quality of
its provision. There cannot be a ‘one-size-fits-all’ framework for understanding the ECD
programmes but there are certain parameters that determine the quality standards of
independently of the country in which it is provided.

As informed by the National report on the Rapid Survey of Children (RSOC) 2013-1481, some pop-
up statistics are good to be cognizant of for the project states. Children accessing and attending
PSE were low in Rajasthan and more than the National average in Maharashtra.
• The state wise percentage of children 36 to 71 months who attended PSE for 16 or more
days was as low as 17% in Rajasthan and 58% in Maharashtra as compared to the National
average of 39% annually.
• Children from rural areas tend to attend ICDS run pre-school whereas those from urban
areas tend to attend privately run pre-schools more. In Maharashtra, 51.4% (23.2%-Urban
and 74.3%-Rural) were attending ICDS Pre-school education and in Rajasthan, 15.5%
(11.2%-Urban and 16.9% -Rural) were attending ICDS Pre-school education.
• The incidence of low birth-weight babies in Rajasthan was fairly high at 23 percent.
ASER Survey reports of the last two years place Rajasthan among the bottom five states in learning
outcomes linked to reading, writing and arithmetic in the academic year 2018-19. ASER Report
201982 states that % of children age 3 and 4 who are not enrolled anywhere is much higher in few
states including Rajasthan.

CSO partners
In Maharashtra, Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (MGIMS) was responsible for
designing of the counselling material for parents related to children in the 0-3 age group and
implemented the project in Aurangabad & Yavatmal districts. In Pune & Palghar districts, during
the initial stages of the project, Save the Children (STC) supported in design of the counselling
material for parents related to children in the 3-6 years age group. But, later, Gram Mangal took
up the project implementation in Pune and Palghar districts as the partnership of UNICEF with STC
ended.
It is to be noted that the 0-3 year material developed by MGIMS and 3-6 years material developed
by STC was used across the four intervention districts for trainings. Only difference was in
implementation of the project as mentioned above.
Development of training packages & communication materials
UNICEF Maharashtra along with the CSO partners developed a training package for ICDS and
health functionaries on infant and young child feeding inclusive of early stimulation and parental
education for early learning and stimulation (covering children 0-6 years). As part of the package
a number of training materials were created for master trainers, supervisors, AWWs/ ASHAs, and
parents. For more details, please refer to Annexure 06.

Focus areas
The following focus areas were defined for 0-3 and 3-6 age groups:
• 0-3 age group
This component looks at empowering parents of children in the age group 0-3 years to
support their child’s development at home. The messages related to 0-3 years child were
delivered at the centre through AWWs and through home visits by ASHAs. The key
messages are drawn from the following areas:
▪ Exclusive breastfeeding
▪ Complimentary feeding
▪ Responsive parenting
▪ Feeding during illness
▪ Care of a newborn baby
▪ Growth monitoring and promotion
▪ Play and communication
For the parent counselling related to children in 0-3 years age group, MGIMS (Mahatma
Gandhi Institute for Medical Sciences) has played a key role in developing content and
creating training materials. The implementation has been done by the same partner in
Aurangabad and Yavatmal. Save the Children supported in designing the parent
counselling material for 3-6 years child age group and Gram Mangal implemented the
project in Pune and Palghar. The platforms used to reach caregivers/parents of the
children below the age of 3 years were – monthy meetings at the anganwadi centres,
community outreach events of POSHAN Abhiyan, Palak Melavas and home visits.
• 3-6 age group
The parent counselling material related to children in the 3-6 age group mainly focuses on
helping parents understand how to support their child’s learning at home. Globally, school
readiness is gaining currency (as emphasized in SDG target 4.283) as a viable strategy to
close the learning gap and improve equity in achieving lifelong learning and full
developmental potential among young children. School readiness has been linked with
positive social and behavioural competencies in adulthood as well as improved academic
outcomes in primary and secondary school, both in terms of equity and performance. In
addition, school readiness has been garnering attention as a strategy for economic
development. Approaches to economic growth and development consider human capital
as a key conduit for sustained and viable development, the inception of which begins in
the early years84. The project aims to familiarize parents with ways of how they can help
children get school ready by engaging with children through play. The content is designed
to be delivered in sessions. The activities suggested in these sessions cover all domains of
development, namely, physical development, sensory, perceptual and cognitive
development, language, literacy and communication, personal, social and emotional
83 SDG Target 4.2: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development care and pre-
primary education so that they are ready for primary education
84 School readiness: a conceptual framework, UNICEF, 2012

development and creativity. The sessions provide opportunities to parents to experience
the activities on their own and then practice them with their parents. The platforms used
to reach caregivers/parents of the children 3-6 years age group were mainly – monthly
meetings at the anganwadi centres, growth monitoring sessions, and home visits.
The Samvedansheel Palakatv (Responsive Parenting) flipcharts were developed for
communicating messages for responsive parenting focusing on children in the 3-6 age
group. The key messages have been aligned to the state ECE curriculum Aakar. Learning
was further reinforced through supportive supervision by Field Supervisors and ASHA
(Accredited Social Health Activist) mentors or the CSO partners. Please refer to Annexure
02 for roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in Maharashtra.
Platforms
The following institutional platforms were strengthened and utilized for the delivery of key
messages to 0-6 age child parents/caregivers:
o Parents’ meetings
o VHND
o Growth Monitoring week
o Community Based Events (Godhbhrai; Annaprashan diwas)
o Home visits
o Family fairs (palak melas)
Training of master trainers
• An Incremental Learning Approach (ILA) was adopted for training. ILA builds learning
incrementally to enable the frontline workers to internalize the learning, develop skills and
take necessary actions. Training used games, activities and demonstrations on how to
conduct a mothers’ meetings and home visits
• The trainings have been delivered in a cascade manner, where the CSO partners trained
the ICDS supervisors/ASHA facilitators (master trainers), who in turn trained the
AWWs/ASHAs, who ultimately conducted parents’ sessions on ground.
• Cascading method of training was adopted in Maharashtra as shown below
• CSO Partner trained Master trainers (ICDS Supervisors/ASHA
facilitators)
• Master trainers trained FLWs (AWWs & ASHAs)
• FLWs counselled the parents/caregivers in the community on
responsive parenting
Page|157
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
• The training on responsive parenting (for 0-6 continuum) was rolled out in five cycles of
five days each for master trainers (constituting AWW supervisors and ASHA facilitators).
Therefore, each master trainer went through one cycle of 5 days each and there were 5
such cycles (5*5 = 25 days in total).
• The trained master trainers further rolled out the training to the FLWs. Each master trainer
after the conclusion of each cycle of training (provided by CSO) rolled out the contents of
that particular cycle of training to FLWs in three days within a period three months (one
day per month).
Note: In Pune, since this district is primarily an urban area, no ASHA facilitators were available to be
included in master trainer’s training by CSO partner. Therefore, only AWW supervisors were part of the
master training in Pune.

Supportive supervision
Supportive supervision support was provided by the master trainers (AWW supervisor and ASHA
facilitator) to the FLWs during the home visits, at the AWC, parents meeting, community-based
events.
3.6.1.2. Rajasthan
In Rajasthan, the project was initiated with an assessment of the practices and beliefs of the
parents on ECE and their role in bringing up their children. Series of workshops and discussions
were held with community, Anganwadi workers to understand the best way to reach out to the
parents and other care givers as well as the platforms through which these parents could be
reached. The results from the study helped in designing a strategy for creating a learning
environment at home. The ‘Sabrang’ cards were developed after a range of interactions with
community. These cards primarily have messages and activities that promote development of
children in different domains – physical, motor, social-emotional, language and literacy for the age
group 3-6 years.
Geography
In Rajasthan, the project was rolled out in two districts – Udaipur and Dungarpur. The details of
the number of blocks targeted within each district is provided below:

Note: * It is to be noted that since, for the endline, the evaluation team had considered only those blocks for
sample selection where the project has been rolled out at least for a year, four blocks from Udaipur (Gogunda,
Bhinder, Mavli, Badgaon) were not included in the study as the project was rolled out in second half of 2019 (less
than one year of implementation) in these specific blocks.
Project specific nuances (for blocks with at least one year of intervention only)
In Rajasthan, the project was implemented in three blocks87 of Udaipur district and five blocks88
of Dungarpur district. Among these blocks, the CSO Partner (Unnati Sanshtan) supported the
implementation in three blocks (Girwa, Rishabhdev, Kherwara) of Udaipur district and one block
(Bichhiwara) in Dungarpur district. In the other four blocks (Aaspur, Dungarpur, Gmadi Ahara,
Simalwara) of Dungarpur district UNICEF supported government in building the capacities of
AWWs on MYCN (CSO Partner did not support in implementation in these four blocks in
Dungarpur district). The below graphic helps us visualize the implementation nuances in
Rajasthan better:
Note: Please note that in four blocks (Gogunda, Bhinder, Mavli, Badgaon) of Udaipur (outlined with RED color in
figure above), the project was rolled out in second half of year 2019 (less than one year of implementation). Since
evaluation team considered only those blocks for sample selection where the project has been rolled out at least
for a year, these four blocks from Udaipur were not included in the study.

Project Implementation (for blocks with at least one year of intervention only)
a) CSO supported implementation
The capacity building of frontline workers was implemented during the monthly sector meetings
organised by the field supervisors. A team of field supervisors was trained to equip them with skills
and knowledge on training AWW on positive parenting with special reference to responsive
parenting including early stimulation and creating a learning environment at home.
The trained FLWs reached out to parents/caregivers through the existing platforms – mothers’
meeting, community meetings, Parent Anganwadi Meeting (PAM)89 with parents/caregivers, home
visits and community-based events, maternal and child health and nutrition sessions. The project
prioritized the effective use of communication tools (MAA tool kit for promoting infant and young
child feeding, POSHAN Abhiyaan key takeaways, Mother Child Protection card and communication
cards - ‘Sabrang’ developed focusing on promoting learning at home for children age 3-6-years-
old) and improving the coverage and quality of these events. Parenting communication toolkit Sab
Rang in Rajasthan focused on key messages for counselling parents to promote learning at home
for children 3-6-year-old. These messages were aligned to the developmental milestones laid
down in the Early Learning Development Standards (ELDS) developed and standardized for
children in India. Institutional platforms 90 were used by the FLWs to reach out to the
parents/caregivers. Please refer to Annexure 02 for roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in
Rajasthan.

provided intensive support. Subsequently, in 2019, the project was scaled up to rest of the AWCs
in Girwa and Bicchiwara blocks along with AWCs in additional blocks Rishabhdev and Kherwara.
During the scale up phase in 2019, CSO partner reached the AWCs in the above-mentioned blocks
during sector meetings organized as a part of ICDS programme and also simultaneously continued
to provide intensive support in the 87 AWCs from Girwa and Bicchiwara blocks.

As already mentioned in the ‘Project specific nuances’ section above, in four blocks (Aaspur,
Dungarpur, Gamdi Ahara, Simalwara) of Dungarpur district UNICEF supported government on
building capacities of AWWs on MYCN. In these blocks of Dungarpur district, the ECD interventions
were integrated into the maternal infant and young child nutrition (MIYCN) programme. All
participants were provided training for 3 days based on the MAA (Mothers’ Absolute Affection – a
programme of MoHFW to accelerate improvements in IYCF with a focus on breastfeeding) with
addition of maternal component and missing ECD components like importance of food and
feeding in brain development and early stimulation. During the training, discussions were on ANC,
maternal diet, maternal weight gain, updated MCP card, IFA and CA supplementation.
For the infants and young children thrust was on – early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive
breastfeeding, timely initiation on CF and age appropriate CF with continued breastfeeding. The
early stimulation component included – how to engage with the child.
The MIYCN and ECD components were reinforced through all platforms like Sector meetings by
Lady Supervisor under ICDS (LS), ILA sessions by LS and by AWWs during community - based
events like Annaprasana (event to mark introduction of CF at 6 months) and Godbharai (baby
shower) and through home visits.

Tracking trainings provided to Master trainers
Regarding the trainings provided to master trainers (supervisor and ASHA facilitators) in
Aurangabad and Yavatmal, the CSO partner - MGIMS tracked and documented the planned vs
actual timelines and the attendance of the participants from ICDS and health departments for
each of the five training cycles. The same has been provided in Table 05 in project description
section above.
Tracking core project activities
To concurrently monitor three core project activities – (i) mothers meeting, (ii) home visits and (iii)
Palak Melawa, check lists were developed for each activity and the same were shared with the
supervisors and front line workers. During the first cycle of training, all supervisors have been
trained on using the checklists during home visits and mothers’ meetings and how to give feedback
to the frontline workers.

Further, in order to track the progress of trainings conducted at field level and for internal
monitoring and evaluation purposes, an online google form was designed by the CSO. This form
was filled by project block coordinators of Aurangabad and Yavatmal districts for the trainings
conducted at Sector level. The form also acted as a checklist to understand and evaluate the quality
of each training. However, this form was designed to be used only by project staff during project
cycle. Therefore, no document of this data is available.

The staff was required to daily fill the ODK forms to capture the data from field which helped in
monitoring progress of the project. Staff shared pictures daily and small videos of the work in
Unnati’s WhatsApp group which was being monitored and reviewed by program coordinator.
Sector meetings and trainings were monitored by maintaining attendance sheets and live pictures
shared from the meeting. While conducting one to one visits and attending sector meetings, staff
used to share the learning and challenges in the staff meeting.
In the AWCs where Unnati provided direct support, pre-post tests were conducted to assess the
understanding and learning from the training of the participants on the essential topics. Apart
from daily visits at the AWCs by the field staff, field monitoring visits were also conducted by
management team on monthly basis to track the activities in the field.
Although data were collected using ODK forms and during pre-post tests during the trainings, the
same has not been analysed and documented at any level such as sector/ block/ district/ project

Annexure 4: Review of training material/ communication packages
Communication Packages
Development is the result of the interaction between the environment and the child. The key aspect of
this environment is ‘nurturing care’, which consists of a core set of interrelated components, including
behaviours, attitudes, and knowledge about caregiving (e.g., health, hygiene care and feeding);
stimulation (e.g., talking, singing and playing); responsiveness (e.g., early bonding, secure attachment,
trust and sensitive communication); and safety (e.g., routines, protection from violence, abuse, neglect,
harm and environmental pollution).92 Parents play a critical role in providing these critical early
experiences through the provision of this nurturing care, which ensures health, nutrition, responsive
caregiving, safety and security, social- emotional well-being, and early learning.93 Also, girls and boys see
gender inequality in their homes and communities every day and Gender inequalities can start in utero
and increase as children age. Gender roles are learned through interactions between a child and his/her
immediate environment. Throughout their life cycle, children become aware of their gender, and play
styles and behaviours begin to crystallize around that core identity of girl or boy. Adults impose their own
gender beliefs and practices through their interactions with young boys and girls. Early childhood is a
critical time for the development of boys’ and girls’ sense of themselves and their place in the world.
While designing the project intervention, parents/caregivers and ICDS functionaries were consulted and
engaged as part of the context analyses that were carried out in both states for a better understanding
of needs and expectations in relation to ECD services and parenting as well as to under gender and other
inequities. This informed the design – both in terms of positive indigenous beliefs and practices that can
be built upon, as well as strategies for behaviour change - including the orientation of ICDS functionaries
of the states on the importance of promoting positive parenting and improved service delivery. This
information has been gathered through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with
supervisors, AWWs, parents and other caregivers.
For developing the communication package, the existing national and global packages/guidelines/training
modules related to parenting /care for development were mapped, reviewed and contextualized for the
intervention. Aligned to need for nurturing care, “the intervention” is essentially an integrated ECD
package focusing on nourishment and nurturance with a concerted focus on positive parenting including
responsive feeding, psychosocial stimulation and learning activities to stimulate optimal brain
development, improved feeding for infants and young children and school readiness. This also addresses
parental involvement in the care and development of children as focused on by India’s National ECCE
Policy ratified in 2013, global guidance by core ECD agencies as well as Early childhood development as a
key aspect of UNICEF ICO’s new country programme (2018-2022). The intervention has been planned
holistically with TLM’s, environment, sensitization and training of different levels of functionaries,
monitoring and participation of community. An intergenerational approach, where mothers and children
attend sessions together or are met with together through home visits etc. has been planned which is
known to lead to greater impact. During the group as well as individual sessions, AWW’s and ASHA’s model
how to play with children, demonstrate feeding and care techniques, demonstrate techniques of problem
solving during challenging behaviour situations, and provide other hands-on experiences in real-life
situations. Also, the intervention focuses on increasing knowledge among the general community through

platforms such as Palak Melawa on the importance of the earliest years of life for healthy brain
development and overall growth and development so that there is more support towards the intervention
by the ecosystem.
The communication material is inclusive and has a considerable equity focus, ensuring that the process
and the product are driven by the needs of the most vulnerable population. E.g., it ensures active
representation of mothers, fathers, and other family members such grandmother, grandfather and
siblings; pictures demonstrate different geographical realties such as rural/urban and different cultural
contexts and brings in the elders in the family as supportive and active in good practices in child rearing.
Gender focus is overarching e.g, play and early learning is depicted and discussed to learn to interact,
play and communicate with those from the other gender. Key messages on ECD are targeting both
mothers and fathers and other significant caregivers, emphasizing the importance of their involvement
in the care and development of the children – as well as in decision making. Gender socialization seems
to begin early with value education, gendered toys for boys and girl. This is also addressed in the
pictures depicted in the material. The material also aims to create a supportive environment for the
mother by the families active and able support in child rearing.

fathers are seen as key recipients alongwith mothers, is good step
from Mother centred to parent centred approach to raising
children in keeping with research on paternal involvement as a
crucial link to positive parenting. Tools like the Mother Child
Protection (MCP) card, is used as a counselling tool for positive
parenting focusing on children below 3 years. This is
complemented with communication cards to counsel parents for
creating a positive learning environment at home for children age
3-6 years.
Focus has also been given on father’s role in caregiving and
communication materials and training kits developed have
ensured messaging reiterates the same. Gender is seen as an
overarching focus through the material reviewed however a
separate focus on emphasis on the implications of some gender
different practices would be good to foreground. The material
reviewed is equitable in reach across gender, ethnicity, class,
geographic location and messaging has accounted for the same.
Also, Information elicited in the communication packages focus on
changing cultural beliefs and attitudes towards parenting with a
key focus on what, why and how of responsive parenting. More
focus on gender linked biases as well as keener focus on Social
Emotional Learning to help parents respond well to challenging
behaviours and break patterns of inappropriate disciplining
practices, would be good.

for 3-6 years in a participatory manner to bring in greater relevance

from 0-6 years of age. For 0-3, a more basic messaging model has
been followed while for 3-6 a more intense participatory
methodology has been adopted to develop the parent reference
cards- SABRANG. This addresses the need for parents to feel more
empowered through specific parenting skills across domains, ages
and stages of development and hence be responsive to children’s
developmental needs. The content specifically intends to improve
parents’ knowledge and practices related to caregiving, nutrition
and child health and is also aligned to what is ensuing in the
Anganwadi Centres (AWC’s) in the context of 3-6 years.
The material reviewed aims to communicate gender equitable
opportunities through responsive parenting. Focus has been given
on father’s role in caregiving through the material to build change
in beliefs and practices.
Training materials
The intervention is a twin track approach to build the capacity of ICDS and health system functionaries,
including frontline workers to raise awareness and build the capacity of parents and caregivers on
providing nurturing care, positive parenting and early stimulation which in turn will positively influence
the development trajectory of children. Increased capacity of frontline workers (e.g., social workers, health
workers, teachers, childcare workers) to deliver quality interventions for ECD is a focus. The training
materials follow a comprehensive approach with respect to the child’s nutrition, health, growth and
development to equip the FLW’s with the knowledge, attitude and practice to feel confident themselves
as well as be able to effectively empower the child’s family and caregivers.
Once trained, existing service delivery platforms within the ICDS include mothers’ meetings organized at
the Anganwadi Centres, exclusive fathers meets, home visits by frontline functionaries and community
events were used to reach out to parents and support them.
The material has a strong equity focus, ensuring that the process and the product are driven by the needs
of the most vulnerable population. Districts have been selected targeting marginalized populations.
Gender focus is overarching e.g, Play and early learning is depicted and discussed to learn to interact,
play and communicate with those from the other gender. Key messages on ECD are targeting both
mothers and fathers and other significant caregivers, emphasizing the importance of their involvement

in the care and development of the children – as well as in decision making. Gender socialization seems
to begin early with value education, gendered toys for boys and girl. This is also addressed during
parent and caregiver meetings with frontline workers.
STATE DESCRIPTOR REVIEW
Maharashtra • Training Relevance- Training Material
manuals Cycle Training materials have been developed on positive parenting. They
1-5 are being used to enhance the knowledge and skills of programme
functionaries to mobilize communities and families to promote
responsive parenting and early learning. For developing training
materials, the existing national and global
packages/guidelines/training modules related to parenting /care for
development were mapped, reviewed and contextualized for the
current programme. In Maharashtra training is imparted in five
cycles, each cycle consists of five days training for the master
trainers (Anganwadi Supervisors-AWS, ASHA Facilitator, Block
Coordinator). For the frontline functionaries five cycles of three
days, one day per month for three consecutive months in one cycle,
therefore, fifteen rounds of monthly training for a day each. A
cascade model is followed wherein The Civil Society Organisation
(CSO) team trains the master trainers who in turn train the frontline
functionaries.
Information elicited in the training materials focus on changing
cultural beliefs and attitudes towards parenting with a key focus on
what, why and how of responsive parenting. Training sessions
through a well-structured flow included pertinent content and
methodologies. Experiential learning, role plays, case studies etc.,
were used as well as involved the active participation of the AWWs
rather than acting as passive learners, facilitators of the sector
meeting provided active learning situations to the participants and
facilitate the learning process and Sector meeting were conducted
in an open and democratic environment which allows the
participants to voice their experiences and opinions to also help
them experience an equitable environment. In addition to
innovative training methodology, community events like Palak
Melawa (fairs for caregivers) based on early childhood development
(ECD) care continuum have been effectively leveraged. Through
these fairs, the larger community has been made aware, especially
fathers, about positive parenting practices that can be adopted in
the home environment and their role. The training material equips
the FLW’s to conduct the parent meets, home visits and community
fairs more effectively with an overarching focus on responsive
parenting. Training uses games, activities and demonstrations on
how to conduct a mothers’ meetings and home visits. Learning is
further reinforced through supportive supervision by Anganwadi
Supervisors and ASHA (mentors.
However, a focused discussion around gender and equity
challenges was not seen clearly articulated in the training materials.

children need nurturing care from the start. The most formative experiences of young children come from
nurturing care received from parents, other family members, caregivers, and community-based services.
Nurturing Care is characterised by a stable environment that promotes children’s health and nutrition,
protects children from threats, and gives them opportunities for early learning, through affectionate
interactions and relationships. Benefits of such care are life-long, and include improved health, wellbeing,
and ability to learn and earn. Also, childhood development is a maturational process resulting in an
ordered progression of perceptual, motor, cognitive, language, socio-emotional, and self- regulation skills.
Thus, the acquisition of skills through the lifecycle builds on the foundational capacities established in
early childhood. Each are necessary for nurturing care. Nurturing care reduces the detrimental effects of
disadvantage on brain structure and function which, in turn, improves children’s health, growth, and
development95. Support and responsiveness, with a foundation in early bonding, are expressed through
social and emotional relationships, building trust and attachment and behavioural interactions such as
hugging, holding and loving physical contact96. Responsive parenting includes prompt response to a child’s
behaviour that is appropriate to the child’s needs and developmental phase . Responsive feeding
97
practices have been positively associated with young children’s nutrition status98.

The strategy was to build on government programme priorities, including POSHAN (Prime Minister’s
Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nourishment) Abhiyaan to utilize and increase regularity and quality of
the three platforms of home visits, monthly mother meets (including meets with fathers) and community
meets to improve interactions between FLW’s and caregivers. Also, the strategy of cascade supportive
mentoring and supervision was there with the Block coordinator, Supervisors and FLW’s forming the
cohesive triad of the same. Training uses games, activities and demonstrations on responsive feeding,
play and communication with children, how to conduct meetings and visits like mothers’ meetings and
home visits etc. Learning is further reinforced through supportive supervision by Anganwadi Supervisors
and ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) mentors.
The continuous involvement of beneficiaries in project design, implementation and monitoring has also
been an effective strategy such as, consultative process with FLW’s and Caregivers were used in
development of the materials and example of which is addition of relevant messages regarding excessive
screen time on the request of field supervisors in Maharashtra; another pertinent example is that the
approach was refined as per ground realities such as scheduling mothers meet as per ages of children,
separate fathers meets and utilizing folk media and Palak Melawas (community based parent festivals)
to garner community support for ECD.
Relevance - Alignment to State ECE Curriculum
Overall, the goal of this intervention is for children aged 0–6 years to benefit from an integrated package
of ECD interventions with a focus on positive parenting (which ensures responsive feeding, psychosocial
stimulation and learning activities) towards enhanced brain development, improved infant and young
child feeding, and school readiness. This is aligned to India’s National ECCE Policy ratified in 2013, which
focuses on the importance of parental involvement in the care and development of children. This strategy
(promoting parental involvement) for ensuring quality early childhood development is recognised globally
as one of the most effective ones with lifelong implications. Early childhood development is a key aspect
of UNICEF ICO’s new country programme (2018-2022) and Maharashtra is one of the focus states for this
intervention. Both states have used the state curricula as a base to build the intervention.
Training manuals, monitoring tools and communication package for improved parenting is in place in
both the states. State governments are scaling up different components of the package. The e-learning
course comprising of 21 modules on ECE has been developed at the national level and is currently
available with the MWCD for further dissemination during sector meetings of anganwadi workers in
coming months. Furthermore, UNICEF has developed a resource kit on responsive parenting based on a
review of materials developed in Maharashtra and Rajasthan. This resource kit includes a flipbook with
40 odd illustrated cards, in which the messages are developed using every alphabet of Hindi language
which will enable easy recall of messages. A floor game has been designed for frontline workers to use
during their sessions. In addition, a set of films depicting positive parenting practices with children of
different age groups and a training film for frontline workers focusing on conducting home visits have
been developed. These national prototypes will be shared with other states which plan to implement
similar programmes in their states. To complement the existing communication tools in Maharashtra,
UNICEF developed a deck of playing cards for use by the anganwadi workers to promote learning through
play for children between 3-6 years. The anganwadi worker uses these cards during home visits to
reinforce key messages with parents on the use of local materials for play and the activities that can be
done as part of daily routine.

*Progress reports promoting through the National Nutrition Mission. ILA is a system
which uses opportunities in the form of existing supervisory
interactions at different levels, through which practical and guided
learning may be accomplished. It builds learning incrementally to
enable the frontline functionaries to internalize the learning,
develop skills and take necessary actions. Different tools such as a
family retained Mother Child Protection (MCP) card and the
communication cards for promoting learning at home for children
aged 3-6 years are used to promote learning. The MCP card is a
family retained tool, which frontline functionaries and parents use
to track delivery of services and developmental milestones and seek
referral in case of developmental delays. Training uses games,
activities and demonstrations on how to conduct a mothers’
meetings and home visits. Learning is further reinforced through
supportive supervision by Anganwadi Supervisors and ASHA
(Accredited Social Health Activist) mentors. Training packages have
been designed to be transacted in phases. In Maharashtra training
is imparted in five cycles, each cycle consists of five days training for
the master trainers and three days for the frontline functionaries -
one day per month for three consecutive months. A cascade model
is followed, the Civil Society Organisation (CSO) team trains the
master trainers who in turn train the frontline functionaries. Based
on the feedback provided by the supervisors, the training of
frontline workers has improved the quality of mother’s meetings
and home visits. The mothers’ meetings are now planned for a
counselling tool for different age groups of children. Tools like the
Mother Child Protection (MCP) card, is used as positive parenting
focusing on children below 3 years.
This is complemented with communication cards to counsel parents
for creating a positive learning environment at home for children
age 3-6 years. Further to improve Early Childhood Education (ECE)
services at the AWC, supervisors are being trained to implement
state ECE curriculum and on the use of ECE Quality Assessment tool.
The manuals for parents are also aligned to the state ECE
curriculum- Aakar to reinforce some key learning at home through
play and communication and equip parents better to provide a
responsive and positive learning environment at home.
Further, in Maharashtra, Government has also initiated training of
doctors and nurses to integrate stimulation and nurturing care into
pediatric care in public health institutions at district-level. But this

Effectiveness – Inputs/Activity Implementation as per plan- Usefulness of Tools and Standards
The programme was conceptualized in two phases (1) Preparatory (2) Implementation – intensification,
scaling and consolidation.
In 2019, as per preparatory plans, the thrust was on the consolidation of learnings and practices towards
scaling up the programme. Currently, the frontline functionaries (anganwadi workers and ASHAs) across
all 5,000 anganwadis prioritized using existing platforms regularly - home visits, meetings at the AWC and
community-based meets for engaging with parents.
In the consolidation phase three key activities were undertaken, first was the strengthening of supportive
supervision by establishing a system for FLW’s through (a) sector-level meetings for reinforcing learning,
addressing implementation challenges faced by the frontline functionaries (b) handholding and onsite
support to the frontline functionaries for planning and improving the quality of service delivery including
home visits, monthly meetings and community events and (c) quality assurance activities by the field
supervisors with support from CSO partners to monitor progress and refine inputs. In both the states,
monthly sector meetings have become forums for monthly planning, capacity building of anganwadi
workers and for sharing best practices. In Rajasthan, the state government has developed an annual
calendar for these meetings along with a monitoring mechanism. This will be integrated into the state
monitoring system. In Maharashtra, a monitoring checklist was developed to review frontline
functionaries’ interactions with the caregivers which aided in the refining of the training of frontline
workers to make the interactions more effective. In addition, in Maharashtra, 42 field supervisors were
trained on an ECE Quality Assessment Tool, who used it for mentoring anganwadi workers to improve the
quality of the ECE programmes at their centres. As a result, the supervisors are able to offer need-based
solutions such as organizing the space within the anganwadi centre for ECE activities and supporting
anganwadi workers to plan and implement developmentally appropriate activities for children 3-6-year-
old.
The second activity was use of Learning Hubs as demonstration sites in Rajasthan to promote ECD along
the entire age continuum of 0-6-years. Select anganwadi centres were developed as learning hubs and
demonstrated desired practices on parental engagement. They also provided peer-to-peer support to six
to eight adjoining anganwadi centres. Currently, 60 anganwadi centres are functioning as learning hubs
in one district. These will, in turn, facilitate scaling up the programme.
Page|181

The third activity is the Capacity building and scale-up wherein various steps have been initiated in
Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The state governments, with support from UNICEF, have worked to
strengthen the quality of ECE programmes in anganwadi centres. to ensure that anganwadi workers first
have the capacity to implement developmentally appropriate ECE programmes before they can effectively
carry out a responsive parenting programme to guide parents on reinforcing their children’s development
and learning. In Maharashtra, 200 state-level master trainers have trained 3,036 field supervisors on the
new ECE curriculum to strengthen the programme across 97,377 anganwadi centres in the state. In
Rajasthan 1,600 state resource group members and master trainers were trained on ECE who further
trained 63,000 anganwadi workers and 38,000 mentor teachers from primary schools. Furthermore, 320
core trainers from ICDS and the Department of Health trained as ECD champions are supporting scaling
up of the programme, which includes:
• District-wide implementation of ECD intervention focusing on children below 3-years in seven
districts, including 4 aspirational districts and 2 urban corporations.
• Training of frontline workers has been initiated in 16 tribal districts on the MCP card
Also, to ensure effectiveness, parents, caregivers and service providers have been engaged in the
planning and implementation processes. The behaviour change communication utilizing existing contact
points has been designed in such a way that each household with a pregnant woman or a child in 0-6
years age-group will be reached at least once each month through the frontline workers. In addition, the
workers were trained to provide customized messages through these platforms based on the need of
each household. The three platforms for behaviour change communication also complement each other;
while home visiting aims to empower parents and other caregivers at the household level, mothers’
meetings utilize peer-group approach and Palak Melawa tries to build a positive community norm.
Effectiveness – Inputs/Activity Implementation as per plan - Bottlenecks in Implementation
The intervention builds on the national and state government priorities and is delivered through the
current programme structures. As state governments have been closely associated with programme
strategy development and implementation, the risk of the interventions not being sustained is minimal.
Rather the learnings from the programme will inform the implementation of HBYC and improved ECE
services at the anganwadi centres, while also promoting responsive parenting.
Effectiveness – Inputs/Activity Implementation as per plan- Timely corrective action
The approach adopted for implementation was continuously refined on the basis of feedback from the
frontline workers to adjust it to meet their and the communities’ requirements. The adjustments included
scheduling mothers’ meetings according to the age of children, organizing meetings with fathers as per
their availability late in evenings or on holidays and utilizing folk media and Palak melwas (community-
based parents’ festivals) to garner larger support for ECD. In Maharashtra poor participation from fathers
in monthly meetings was reported because of their reluctance to attend meetings with the mothers and
inconvenient schedules of these meetings. Anganwadi workers were supported to re-schedule the
meetings at a time convenient to the fathers to participate. In Palghar and Pune, 1025 sessions were
organized for fathers, in which 4228 fathers attended. Following this dedicated session, there was an
increase in the participation of fathers in the monthly sessions. Participation of fathers in monthly
meetings in Rajasthan continues to be a challenge, primarily because of unavailability of fathers due to
migration. However, during home visits, all caregivers in the family were provided messages on ECD.

Annexure 5: Baseline evaluation report summary
Given the critical role played by positive parenting and the gap in knowledge with regards to
parenting and the use of available services, a study was conducted to find evidence on what
positive parenting practices, promotions or interventions are needed. “The Principal Objective of
the study was to examine how raising children (both boys and girls) is understood among different
stakeholders and what sources of parenting support exist for parents.” The baseline tried to
99
capture knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of the front-line workers (FLWs), mainly
Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and ASHAs, regarding early childhood care and development.
The study used mixed methods research, including quantitative surveys and Dyads with FLWs. The
study was conducted in the Udaipur and Durgapur districts of Rajasthan and Aurangabad, Pune,
Yavatmal and Palghar districts of Maharashtra, in specific blocks within these districts where the
intervention had been planned. 600 CAPI based interviews and 14 dyads were conducted with
AWWs and ASHAs, maintaining a 75:25 proportion at the state level, for each state. Responses
were recorded and analysed in the domain of roles and responsibilities of the ASHAs and AWWs,
underlying demographics, trainings received, knowledge about ECD methods & practices and
interaction with parents; the results for which are summarised below.
The primary demographics indicated that a higher proportion of ASHAs were younger and had
completed secondary (38%) and higher education (31%) than their AWW counterparts. Also, most
of the FLWs included in the study were from tribal communities (majority belonging to their village
of work) given that the ICDS study blocks were predominantly tribal. In addition, 95% of AWWs and
97% of ASHAs have access to mobile phones, but only 24% and 28% respectively have access to
the internet. Television with cable/DTH was reported to be the primary source of information, with
73% of FLWs having access to it. The study also assessed the knowledge and behaviour of FLWs
on-field.
The services provided to different target groups overlap between ASHAs and AWWs. Both reported
that the most common service provided to children in the age group 0-6 was immunisation or
health check. AWWs additionally provided supplementary nutrition and preschool education for
the 2-6 child age group. With regards to pregnant women, the majority of AWWs distributed
supplementary nutrition and provided immunisation and health check (82%). For the ASHAs, the
trend was similar, in that health check topped the list of services provided, followed by the
provision of IFA tablets. For mothers of children, AWWs continued to report provision of
supplementary nutrition (80%) as a critical service disseminated while for ASHAs health education
topped the list (60%) followed by immunisation & health checks (58%) and referral services (57%).
In turn, all AWWs and most (97%) of ASHAs reported conducting monthly group meetings with
mothers in Anganwadi centers. The topics discussed in the meetings comprised of maternal health
and nutrition, complementary feeding, the importance of diet diversity for mothers and exclusive
breastfeeding. Only 7% and 3% of the AWWs and ASHAs, respectively, have reported having held
meetings with fathers in their area every month. They reported that the topics of discussion were
mostly centered on feeding the child and health and nutrition for mothers.
The second focus area is the training of FLWs, wherein 85% of AWWs and 83% of ASHAs reported
receiving job course training. It was found that a lesser proportion of rural FLWs reported receiving
the training compared to their urban and tribal counterparts. On similar lines, 91% of AWWs and
99 Report of Findings: Baseline with AWW and ASHA in Rajasthan and Maharashtra, UNICEF and Kantar Public
Page|183
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
96% of ASHAs received in-service training. Most of the FLWs reported positive feedback on the last
training that they attended. Payment for participation and transportation arrangement were rated
poorly among both groups. In addition, FLWs reported that there were insufficient training time
and a lack of practical sessions. Another positive highlight in this domain was that 93% of AWWs
and 98% of ASHAs reported receiving mentoring support, majorly from their supervisors, followed
by their trainers and government doctors. ANM and supervisors were also reported to be
significant sources of information on parenting issues the FLWs were unable to address
themselves. A greater percentage of ASHAs (84%) compared to AWWs (64%) reported conduction
of monthly sectoral meetings wherein the key activities included reporting, documentation, and
briefing on upcoming activities.
Another crucial area studied during baseline was FLWs knowledge on ECD methods and practices.
Both AWWs and ASHAs reported having good knowledge of eating requirements for pregnant
women, consumption of IFA tablets and the importance of rest. In contrast, knowledge of the
importance of non-abusive environment and avoidance of hard work were low. FLWs reported
‘home visits’ as a significant occasion for interaction with pregnant women, wherein the discussion
centered around the dietary intake and IFA or calcium tablets consumption. The major challenge
faced by them in this interaction was the influence of family members and lack of coherence and
understanding by the recipient. FLWs' knowledge on stimulation was also found to be inadequate
(less than 50% of AWWs and ASHAs had knowledge of the same). FLWs, at the same time,
performed better in the case of methods of stimulating the child than the meaning of the same,
with 93% of FLWs reporting that they counsel mothers on methods of stimulation.
The knowledge of FLWs on the importance and methods of playing with the child were found to
be adequate. An important point that came out in this area was the assistance provided to
stressed mothers, with more than 60% in both groups reporting providing counselling for the
same. In turn, FLWs knowledge on early childhood learning for young children and the importance
of parent-child bonding was appreciable.
Gender and family perceptions among the FLWs were found to be mainly progressive, with only
about 15% of them agreeing to give preference to male children when breastfeeding and a similar
figure agreeing to have a shorter breastfeeding period for the girl child. These proportions were
higher among the tribal AWWs and rural ASHAs. A positive trend was noted with reference to
confidence levels when interacting with women, men and children on various topics such as the
importance of playing with children, early learnings, and safe environments for children, among
both AWWs and ASHAs.
The study found variation in access to and dispersal of information among the FLWs across the
different geographies. In addition, variation was also found between ASHAs and AWWs, although
in most cases their interests were found to be similarly aligned. The study investigated the
interaction of the FLWs with the target groups, keeping in mind the dynamics of family and
community life, social beliefs and practices of parenting, including gender stereotypes and norms.
Finally, the study aided in understanding the existing situation and some potential platforms
available for future expansion.

Annexure 6: Quantitative sampling plan for endline evaluation
Sampling during baseline evaluation:
During the baseline evaluation, the study team conducted 600 FLW surveys (450 AWWs + 150
ASHAs) with the allocation in each intervention district as follows:
Activities Rajasthan Maharashtra Total
Dungarpur Udaipur Aurangabad Palghar Pune Yavatmal
AWW
75 75 75 75 75 75 450
interviews
ASHA
25 25 25 25 25 25 150
interviews
Total 100 100 100 100 100 100 600
As can be observed, the study team during baseline allocated the sample equally to all the
intervention districts during baseline evaluation. All the blocks that were planned to be included
in the project were included in the sampling. Systematic random sampling was used to sample the
AWCs per block.
Further, the sampling was done to calculate the desired ratio from a given block in each district as
follows:
• To calculate the Class Interval (CI) the total number of AWCs in each block were divided
by the required ratio (primary sample + 100% buffer).
• Once the CI was calculated, a random start (RS) was generated between the starting
serial number (S No.) and the CIs No. (S No. + CI value - 1).
• The RS, thus became the first sampled AWC.
• The next selection of AWC was done by adding RS + CI.
• This was done until a required number of sampled AWCs were achieved in each block of
the district.
Once the AWCs were sampled, the respective AWWs were interviewed. AWWs and ASHA were
sampled in 75:25 ratio i.e., ASHAs from every fourth AWW selected.
Sampling for end-line evaluation:
For purposes of this assessment, a two-stage cluster random sampling was used i.e., clustering at
district and block level powered to provide state-level estimates. The evaluation team ensured to
select FLWs from all the eligible intervention blocks (where the intervention was at least for a year)
within a district. The team used systematic random sampling to select Anganwadi Centers (AWCs)
from a block ensuring the representativeness of geographic typology (rural/urban/tribal). Once
the sample of AWCs was arrived, the evaluation team sourced the list of AWWs within those
selected AWCs from the UNICEF/ CDPO office. The sample was selected to be reflective of the
underlying population of FLWs (proportionate to the FLW population in each intervention district
and within each district, proportionate to FLW population in each intervention block). It is to be
noted that the endline evaluation did not follow up the same FLWs (cohort) selected during
baseline and as such during endline evaluation, the FLW sampling was re-done.

Eligibility criteria: FLWs from areas (blocks) where parenting intervention covering children 0-6
years has been implemented for at least one year.
Sample size calculation
The current evaluation is a cross-sectional one and hence, we used the one-sample formula to
arrive at the sample size (N). The formula for calculating the sample size for cross-sectional studies
is:
𝐷∗𝑍2∗𝑃∗𝑄
𝑁 =
𝐸2
Where, D is the design effect (1.5) – to account for two-stage clustering
P= proportion of outcome indicator (0.5)
Q=1-P
Z= α=the z-score corresponding to a 95% significance level (1.96)
E= maximum error allowed (5%)
To obtain the maximum sample size, we chose the proportion of outcome indicator (P) to be 0.5
(i.e., 50%). Design effect (D) was set to value 1.5 to account for two-stage cluster design and
maximum error (E) allowed was 5%. We have used a 95% significance level (z=1.96) to calculate
the sample size.
The required sample size in each state, based on the above values, was 576 respondents. During
sample size calculations, it was envisaged that due to remote data collection strategy (in view of
COVID-19), the non-response rate would be on higher side. Therefore, evaluation team considered
a buffer of 100% (as was done during baseline) to account for potential non-response. The desired
sample size for each state to provide state-level estimates (after rounding-off) was about 600
participants. To ensure the comparability of results with baseline, we divided the total sample
between AWWs and ASHA in 75:25 ratio as was done in the baseline. We sampled the ASHAs from
every fourth AWW selected. Therefore, in each state, the evaluation team sampled 450 AWWs and
150 ASHAs.

3.7.1.1. Sampling strategy – Quantitative FLW survey
Since the intervention was adopted to cater to the needs of the local contexts in both the
intervention states (Maharashtra and Rajasthan), the evaluation team proposed a suitable
sampling strategy to reflect the state-specific contexts in the evaluation design.

End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
Once the required number of AWCs in each block within a district is determined, the evaluation
team followed the below-mentioned steps to select the respondents:
• Under each block, the list of AWCs were sorted by – ‘Sector’ name in alphabetical order
• All the AWCs in the block were allotted a serial number starting from 1
• A buffer of 100% AWCs was added to the primary sample in each block
• To calculate Class Interval (CI), the total number of AWCs in each block was divided by the
required ratio (primary sample + 100% buffer)
• Once the CI was calculated, a Random Start (RS) was generated between the starting serial
number (S.No.) and the Class Interval (CI) S.No.
• The Random Start (RS) was the first sampled AWC
• The subsequent selection of AWCs was done by adding the RS + CI
• This process was done until the required number of sampled AWCs are achieved in each
block of the district

• Once the required number of AWCs are obtained for each block, AWCs
were selected based on systematic random sampling method
Step 5
Note: As there were programmatic level differences between blocks, the evaluation team adjusted the
sampling strategy accounting for the differences in the implementation strategy for various sub-groups.
Further, as the mandate of the project was 0-6 intervention, upon discussion with the UNICEF program
team, majority (60%) of the sample was allocated to 0-6 age category and the rest 40% of the sample was
allocated equally between 0-3 and 3-6 age category.
Once the required number of AWCs in each block within a district was determined, the evaluation
team followed the below-mentioned steps to select the respondents:
• Under each block, the list of AWCs were sorted by – ‘Sector’ name in alphabetical order
• All the AWCs in the block were allotted a serial number starting from 1
• A buffer of 100% AWCs were added to the primary sample in each block
• To calculate Class Interval (CI), the total number of AWCs in each block were divided by the
required ratio (primary sample + 100% buffer)
• Once the CI was calculated, a Random Start (RS) was generated between the starting serial
number (S.No.) and the Class Interval (CI) S.No.
• The Random Start (RS) was the first sampled AWC
• The subsequent selection of AWCs was done by adding the RS + CI
• This process was done until the required number of sampled AWCs are achieved in each
block of the district

available for the capacity building purposes on nurturing care and responsive
parenting, providing high-level inputs and guidance.
In Rajasthan, the government itself rolled out the project (without CSO partner
support) in select blocks of Dungarpur district.
Ministry of Health and MoHFW is the main government entity responsible for the delivering health related
Family Welfare (MoHFW) services to the pregnant women/ mothers/ children in the country. For the current
project, MoHFW supported in terms of making the human resources (ASHAs)

United Nations Children’s UNICEF is the lead technical and resource stakeholder, with primary role in project
Fund (UNICEF) design, organising technical and financial support for project delivery. The role
involved advocacy with different national and state partners.
CSO partner/s The major role of CSO partners was in identifying the needs of the
parents/caregivers in the community on nurturing care and responsive parenting,
design communication tools, training materials, advocacy with the local
government officials, organizing and delivering the trainings for AWW
supervisors/FLWs, building the capacities of AWW supervisors/FLWs, providing
support in terms of handholding the FLWs during Home Visits, CBEs, parents
meeting. Unlike Maharashtra where the CSO partners only trained the master
trainers, in Rajasthan, in the CSO supported blocks, the CSO itself organized and
delivered the training to both AWW supervisor and FLWs.
AWW supervisors AWWs supported the AWWs in handholding on the ground during Home Visits,
CBEs, parents meeting, AWCs with supportive supervision
FLWs (AWWs/ASHAs) FLWs (AWWs/ASHAs) are key stakeholders in transferring the right messages on
nurturing care and responsive parenting to the parents/caregivers on the ground
via various community platforms such as – home visits, community-based events,
parents meetings.
Community Parents/Caregivers have been at the heart of the project as ultimate beneficiaries.

Annexure 8: Aligning ToC with KEQs
An outline of ToC was available in the ToR. Based on the available ToC and preliminary discussions
with UNICEF state teams, the Evaluation Team constructed a broad ToC. This retrospectively
constructed ToC is very descriptive and thus far from exhaustive programme theory. The
evaluation team was not able to map pathways i.e. from activities to outputs or from outputs to
outcomes as it required wider consultations and inputs from programme teams which was out of
the scope of current evaluation. Resultantly, the assumptions associated with the specific
pathways are not listed. The Evaluation Team have provided broad assumptions for instance at
activity, output, outcome level.
Wherever possible, an attempt has been made to align the outputs and outcomes with the agreed
KEQs/ sub questions.

Annexure 10: Primary Data Collection and Quality Assurance
a. Primary Data Collection
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the normal ways of work immensely. During the time of
evaluation, there was uncertainty as to when the situation would return to normal. Since the on-
field data collection was not possible in current pandemic circumstances, the evaluation team
collected the required data remotely via telephonic survey. During telephonic survey, the trained
interviewers contacted and gathered the information from the respondents over
telephones/cellular phones.
Primary data collection team recruitment, training, pilot orientation and
placement
Engagement of Appropriate Study team: The evaluation team mobilized and engaged qualified
and experienced study team (separately both for quantitative and qualitative study) from the
empanelled list for undertaking the survey. The supervisors and investigators who could speak
the local language or having past experience of conducting studies in the study States were
recruited.
Team structure and detailed responsibility
Program Manager
Quantitative Study
IT Expert Documentation Expert Qualitative Study Team

Supervisors Qualitative Researchers
Investigators Transcribers
Besides the data collection team (DCOR), Athena staff also supported in conducting select state
and district level KIIs.
Activities before data collection
Translation of Questionnaires and Topic Guides: We translated all the study instruments into
the local languages (Hindi and Marathi). The quality assurance of the translation was made
before administering the questionnaires and topic guides for the testing.
Recruitment of the Data Collection Team: The following key processes were adopted for the
recruitment of the data collection team.
• The data collection team comprised of only female researchers.
• The quantitative survey team included 20 enumerators and the qualitative survey team
comprised of 8 enumerators. Two supervisors per state were deployed.
Page|204
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
• The female researchers empanelled/associated with DCOR from the relevant study areas
were screened and suitable candidates were identified for data collection.
• Emphasis was given to those researchers who had prior experience of conducting
surveys/studies (especially who conducted phone surveys).
• Researchers possessing a hold over the local language and the context of the study
states were selected. Separate teams were placed in each state for the quantitative and
qualitative data collection.
Training of main data collection team
• The training was conducted remotely over Zoom as per the agenda.
• Keeping the number of researchers in mind, the training was organised over a week.
• Separate training sessions were conducted for the teams, one for the FLW survey team
and another for the qualitative team.
• The training sessions were undertaken in Hindi language. The training sessions were
recorded for the later reference of the participants.
Pilot testing
Field Testing of Questionnaires and Topic Guides: Before the training, pilot testing of both
quantitative and qualitative study instruments was conducted by the study team.
Soon after the testing, team conducted the de-briefing sessions to capture takeaways from the
same, which were used to make necessary modifications in the questionnaires and topic guides.
The pilot-testing of the tools helped the team to:
a) Make the design, language, logic, response options, etc. contextually relevant.
b) Helped in grounding of evaluation team members on the questionnaires and topic
guides
c) Helped in developing the CAPI applications and build logic checks and skips in the
applications.
d) Minimized the scope of changes in the questionnaires and topic guides during actual
data collection.
Actual data collection process
FLW Survey
• The respondents’ (Frontline Workers) valid contact numbers were obtained from UNICEF
state teams/CSO partners.
• The respondents were interviewed by the enumerators, over telephone/cellular phone.
• Before the actual interview, the respondent was contacted by the investigator to inform
regarding the evaluation and invite them to participate in the interview. If the respondent
consented to participate in the interview, a suitable date and time was agreed taking the
respondent’s comfort and availability into consideration.
• Before the start of actual interview on the agreed date and time, investigator
reconfirmed the availability of the respondent just before the start of the interview. If the
respondent was not in a position to share information comfortably at that time, the
interview was rescheduled at a mutually convenient time.
Page|205
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
• The verbal consent of the respondent for the interview was taken over phone just before
the interview.
• While conducting the interviews with the FLWs over phone, the data was fed directly into
CAPI by the interviewer.
• Prior consent was obtained from the respondent to record the interview. Only if the
respondent provided the consent, the interview was recorded. If the respondent did not
provide consent to be recorded but provided consent for interview, then investigator
moved ahead with the interview without recording.
Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) - stakeholders
• The KII participants’ valid contact numbers were obtained from UNICEF.
• The respondent was interviewed by the facilitator over telephone/cellular phone.
• The interview was scheduled according to the respondent’s convenience.
• The verbal consent of the respondent for the interview was taken over phone just before
the interview.
• The key informant interviews were recorded with prior consent and later transcribed by
listening to the audio files.
• Prior consent was obtained from the respondent to record the interview. Only if the
respondent provided the consent, the interview was recorded. If the respondent did not
provide consent to be recorded but provided consent for interview, then investigator did
not move ahead with the interview without recording (as there is no note taker to take
the notes).
In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) - FLWs
• Team conducted the master trainer interviews (KIIs) before conducting the FLWs IDIs
• Evaluation team sourced recommendations from the interviewed master trainers (lady
supervisor/ASHA facilitator) to identify 3 FLWs (AWWs and ASHAs each) who are active in
delivering services to HHs with children less than 6 years within their sector
• From the list of 3 recommended FLWs, one was selected randomly
• Once the FLWs were identified, their contact numbers were obtained from the master
trainers
• The identified FLWs were interviewed by the facilitators over telephone/cellular phone.
• After the interview with the selected FLWs (recommended by master trainer) was done,
the evaluation team requested the interviewed FLW to identify 3 FLWs (AWWs and ASHAs
each) who generally face issues in the community in the delivery of services to HHs with
children below 6 years of age
• From the list of 3 FLWs recommended, one was selected randomly for the interview
• In total, data collection team conducted 2 AWW and 2 ASHA IDIs in each selected sector
(i.e., sector of interviewed master trainer)
• The interview was scheduled according to the FLW’s convenience.
• The verbal consent of the FLW for the interview was taken over phone just before the
interview.
• The in-depth interviews were recorded and later transcribed by listening to the audio
files.
• Prior consent was obtained from the FLW to record the interview. Only if the FLW
provided the consent, the interview was recorded. If the FLW did not provide consent to
Page|206
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
be recorded but provided consent for the interview, then investigator did not move
ahead with the interview (as there was no note taker to take the notes).
In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) – parents/caregivers
• Evaluation team asked the AWW interviewed to recommend three enthusiastic parents
and three parents who have not been receiving/ willing to receive any services related to
their child in their community (mother and father each). The social category, distance
from AWC, gender of the child for each nominated parent were noted
• Phone numbers of the nominated parents were obtained from AWW
• From among the list of 3 mothers and 3 fathers recommended as active parents and 3
mothers and 3 fathers recommended as resistive parents, one mother and one father
were selected from each group randomly
• The selected parents (from nominated list) were contacted by team and were included in
the IDI
• In case AWW mentioned that there was no family within her village who do not take up
any services, then the interviewed active parents were requested to identify three
parents (recommendations for mother was sourced from interviewed mother and for
father likewise) who have not been receiving/ willing to receive any services related to
their child in their community
• The sampled parents/caregivers were contacted prior to the interview to obtain consent
and fix a suitable date and time for the interview
• The respondent was interviewed by the facilitator over telephone/cellular phone.
• The interview was scheduled according to the respondent’s convenience.
• At the scheduled time one facilitator interviewed the participant over phone.
• The verbal consent of the respondent for the interview was taken before commencing
the interview.
• The in-depth interviews were recorded and later transcribed by listening to the audio
files.
• Prior consent was obtained from the respondent to record the interview. Only if the
respondent provided the consent, the interview was recorded. If the respondent did not
provide consent to be recorded but provided consent for interview, then investigator did
not move ahead with the interview without recording (as there was no note taker to take
the notes)
b. Quality Assurance Mechanisms
Development of CAPI application for electronic data collection: The CAPI version of the
questionnaire was developed after the paper version of the same is pilot tested and finalised.
Team deployed an IT Expert for developing the android application software which was installed
and used on android operating system-based tablets during data collection. Open Data Kits (ODK)
data collection software was used for developing the CAPI application, which is an android based
open source data collection tool developed by Google. The software was supported by a backend
server, a mobile client, ‘ODK collect’ for data collection and ODK Aggregate as a server application
to generate basic graphs, visualize data using maps and to export data in CSV files.
• Developing tools software: The ODK software with its Xforms technology was used to
design the data collection forms. The finalized FLW questionnaire was converted into
Page|207
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
data collection survey forms, through XLS Form syntax in Excel. Data entry errors were
minimized by programming acceptable data value ranges, skips, and error messages
into the data collection forms.
• Pre-testing: We adopted a two-stage pre-test of the ODK survey application. In the first
stage the mobile tools were circulated to the core study team to test for its validity and
consistency. Then, the tool was tested during pilot testing of FLW survey tool jointly by
the core survey team and IT expert.
• Devices/Type of mobiles: The assessment forms developed using ODK platform were
downloaded into android tablets of data collection team with ODK Collect mobile app.
The ODK Collect is a mobile container, which serves for forms download, filling, and
submitting to the server.
• Database creation and management: Database was created using MySQL Server for
the systematic storage of collected data in a readily analyzable form. The data
dictionary/code book was developed to define column attributes, specify the range of
allowable values, and standardize data coding (e.g, yes = 1, no = 0). Data entry errors
were minimized by programming acceptable data value ranges and error messages into
the data collection software. Additional cleaning and editing of data for outliers and
inconsistencies were performed on an ongoing basis during the data collection phase.
• Security and confidentiality: ODK application used for data collection was protected
using passwords. Interviewers were needed to login to the system to access the surveys
and to upload data. All uploaded data were stored under password protection and only
authorized personnel had access to the password(s). All data were transmitted
electronically from the mobile ODK application via secured SSL connection to the server.
The data were extracted in csv files for analysis.
• Use of CAPI: Data collection using CAPI helped to reduce errors in data collection and
data entry to a great extent. The ODK application was developed with all logic and
validation checks. There were mandatory field and validation controls to prompt the
enumerator to check the survey forms before saving or uploading in the application. This
helped to get data on real time basis to track and assess the quality of data collected in
the field.
• Data validation: Each evening the data published by the teams were run through a
validation system in the server – which highlighted blank fields, data entry errors, etc.
• Further, UNICEF constituted an Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) to ensure quality
assurance of the evaluation. ERG supported the evaluation by providing strategic direction
and technical inputs and bringing critical issues to the notice of the Evaluation agency.

help in persuading FLWs to cooperate with the
survey team by explaining them the
importance of the study. Also, as a mitigation
measure, evaluation team included a buffer of
100% for FLW quantitative survey to account
for the potential non-response rate.

Annexure 11: Remote Data Collection, Challenges and Mitigation
Measures
Strategy for Remote Data Collection
Initially, the evaluation team planned to collect all the primary data in-person on the field. But, due
to unexpected circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person on the field data
collection was not possible. Therefore, the evaluation team in consultation with UNICEF Country
and State offices decided to collect all the primary data remotely (via phone survey).
Following the decision to collect all the primary data remotely, the evaluation team adapted the
study tools and evaluation design (in consultation with UNICEF ICO and state offices) to account
for possible risks involved in the remote data collection strategy. The following necessary
revisions/ adjustments were made during the inception phase to adapt the evaluation to remote
data collection strategy –
• The FLW quantitative tool which was quite lengthier was trimmed down to optimal level
with an objective to complete the interview via phone survey within 30-35 minutes
• Additional line of evidence – IDIs with FLWs was added to qualitative answer the questions
dropped during the FLW quantitative tool trimming process
• Further, the FGDs planned with parents/caregivers (0-3 and 3-6 child) was replaced with
IDIs
• The evaluation team in consultation with UNICEF ICO and state offices created a matrix
mapping quantitative and qualitative lines of evidence with KEQs/SEQs to strategically
spread the information across the respondents which helped in tailoring the study tools
to each respondent strategically
a. Pilot testing of study tools
The draft study tools adapted to remote data collection strategy were rigorously tested twice
during Pilot 1 (24th – 26th Aug 2020) and Pilot 2 (14th – 16th Oct 2020).
Pilot 1
Pilot testing - 1 of study tools (FLW quantitative survey tool, FLW IDI guide, and parents/caregivers
IDI guides) was conducted from 24th – 26th August 2020. A total of 15 interviews were conducted
(refer to Annexure 2 for more details). The following risks were identified, and the appropriate
mitigation measures were suggested –
i. FLW Survey

• Asking FLWs to list/ recommend To avoid the risk of select bias in selecting parents from
parents – potential biases the list recommended by AWWs, the data collection
team to ask the AWWs to indicate the social category of
the parents and probe for the distance of the parent’s
location from the AWC.
After Pilot – 1, the evaluation team had a debriefing call with the UNICEF ICO. Further to the
discussion, the FLW quantitative tool was further trimmed down and the specific questions
dropped from the FLW quant tool were added in the FLW IDI tool. Necessary updates were made
Page|211
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
in the Hindi/ Marathi translations related to the technical terms. One of the key findings from Pilot
– 1 was invalid/ switched off status of FLW’s contact numbers. In this context, Pilot – 2 was planned
to further deep-dive into testing core technical terms local translations, closely monitor the time
duration for each tool, and check the validity of the contact numbers.
Pilot 2
Pilot – 2 was conducted from 14th – 16th Oct 2020 covering 8 FLWs. Additionally, about 135 FLWs
contact numbers from select blocks were dialed in for validity checks. The main findings from Pilot
-2 were –
• The FLW quantitative survey time duration was within optimal levels (AWWs ~ 40-45
mins and ASHAs ~ 35- 40 mins)
• The updated translations for key technical terms was more easily understandable for
FLWs when compared to previous translation of these terms
• The clear statement added before the start of the interview that all the discussions will
pertain to the period before COVID-19 (Mar 2020) helped in avoiding any confusion
related to the period of discussion.
• The invalid/ switched-off/ not reachable cases were quite high
Following Pilot – 2, the evaluation team again had a de-briefing call with UNICEF ICO. In view of
high invalid/ non-contactable numbers, it was decided that UNICEF ICO would ask the respective
state teams to support in re-checking the available contact numbers and provide updated contact
numbers to the best extent possible.
Main Data Collection – Risks and Mitigation Measures
• The strategy to dial in the numbers which are switched off/ out of network area/ not
reachable/ unanswered for seven times over three days helped in reaching out to the
respondents and fixing the interviews to push the response rate up
• Wherever the team was not able to reach out to odd-numbered respondents, the team
relied on even-numbered respondents. This strategy as well aided in pushing the response
rate.
• Team was flexible in fixing calls in the evenings at the respondent’s convenience
(specifically with respondents from tribal blocks). This flexible nature of the team aided in
encouraging respondents to participate in the interview.
• In few blocks in Rajasthan and Maharashtra, an additional sample was needed to be
supplied as the team was unable to meet the target sample for that block with odd and
even-numbered samples combined, as in these blocks, we mostly had old contact
numbers (most of which were not reachable) and had less/no updated contact numbers
for those blocks.
• In some sectors where there were a large number of unreachable contacts, in such sectors,
the team requested the FLWs whom they managed to interview to help them source the
updated contact numbers of uncontactable FLWs from their respective sectors. This
helped in reaching out to more FLWs.
• Few FLWs who provided us a date for the interview did not pick the call even after multiple
attempts. In such cases, the team relied on the even-numbered sample for their
replacement. Similarly, during parent's IDIs as well, few parents who provided an
Page|212
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
appointment did not pick the call thereafter even after multiple attempts. In such cases as
well, the team relied on the extra sample recommended by the AWWs.
Outcome of Quality Checks
A. High-Frequency Checks (HFCs)
1. To detect errors:
a) Survey coding: Responses to questions with skip patterns were analysed and it was
observed that all the skip patterns in the CAPI were working correctly
b) Missing data: Quality checks were done to identify if there are completely blank
rows (or) questions that were skipped more than others (or) if there are questions
that no respondent answered. Three missing rows were observed which were blank.
These were the interviews that were initiated but since the respondent had to drop
due to some emergency, the interview was ended and conducted later. These three
blank rows will be removed in the final cleaning process.
c) Categorical variables: Quality checks were done to identify if there are interviewers
whose interview data shows high ‘don’t know’/ ‘No’ / ‘nothing’. The analysis shows
that such responses were minimal (less than 2% for most of the questions).
d) Too many similar responses: We ran an analysis to identify if there are questions
where most of the respondents answered in the same way. This was not the case
across the variables except for one variable on the mother’s meeting where most of
the responses were ‘yes’. But this was not the case with ‘father’s meeting’ where the
responses were a mix of options.
e) Outliers: As all the open-ended questions were qualitative and there were no
quantitative open-ended questions in the FLW survey, identifying outliers was
irrelevant
f) Respondent IDs: We have PSU codes as the unique identifier in the FLW survey.
Quality checks were done to identify if there were duplicates in the unique identifier
(PSU code), blank or invalid IDs. Although no blank and invalid unique IDs were
detected, overall, about 2% of AWWs and 1.5% of ASHA responses had duplicate IDs.
These IDs were noted by the team and conveyed to DCOR for follow-up. These
specific duplicates were followed-up and traced by the supervisors and the correct
IDs were identified.
2. To monitor survey progress and track respondents
a) Survey duration: The time taken for each interview was analysed. The average time
duration for the AWW interview was around 41 minutes and for ASHAs the average
time duration was around 32 minutes. Outliers were detected in terms of
abnormally high or low time durations in about 3 percent of the cases. These cases
were tracked and rectified.
b) Monitoring progress: We internally have set up an online monitoring excel sheet
which is updated once every two days. This helped us monitor the progress of the
no. of interviews being conducted and to identify areas where the survey was
moving slowly
B. Back-Checks (BCs)
Page|213
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
A short-structured questionnaire (refer Annexure 5) was used for checking the quality of the FLW
survey data that systematically back-checked the information from already interviewed FLWs. This
was done by re-interviewing some FLWs randomly by the supervisors and checking the results
with what was collected by the interviewer. We included only static questions in the back-check
tool the responses to which would not change regardless of the interview (e.g. type of respondent,
PSU area, religion, social category, date of birth, marital status). Back-checks helped reduce two
types of problems that could potentially affect the accuracy of the survey data.
1. First, back-checks were used to check that the interviewer actually interviewed the
selected FLWs or not. Sometimes interviewers either inadvertently locate the wrong
FLWs or they may deliberately interview an FLW, thus making it easier to finish their
work quickly.
2. Second, to estimate the extent of errors which the investigators could have made
The back-check questionnaires were filled in by the supervisors. The back-checked data was then
matched with the original response from the main dataset. In total, about 8 percent of the total
responses were back-checked. Below, we provide a snapshot of the extent of error observed in
each question included in the back-check.
Q.No Question Error rate
(in %)
PSU Code Is the PSU Code entered correct? 1.96%
Type of Is the respondent AWW? 0%
respondent Is the respondent ASHA? 0%
101 What is your name? 0.98%

506A Did you receive any communication material/ tool to counsel 1.96%
parents/caregivers on positive parenting and early childhood
development in the past two years?
An effort was made to conduct the back-checking on the same day of the interview (or) at least on
the following day, which helped to estimate the error rates and update the team accordingly.
C. Spot-Checks (SCs)
The supervisor observed each interviewer multiple times throughout the course of data collection.
Each interviewer was listened during the first two days of data collection so that any errors made
consistently are identified and rectified immediately. Additional observations of each interviewer's
performance were made during the rest of the data collection period on a rotational basis. All the
supervisors observed at least one interview per day of each field investigator during the course of
the data collection.
During the interviews, the supervisor listened to the interviewer being on the same call. This way,
they checked if the investigator interprets the respondent correctly and follows the proper skip
Page|214
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
patterns. The supervisor made notes of problem areas and points to be discussed later with the
interviewer. The supervisor did not intervene during the course of the interview and ensured to
conduct herself in such a manner as not to make the interviewer or respondent nervous or uneasy.
After each observation, the field supervisor and interviewer discussed the interviewer's
performance. Overall, about 15 percent of the interviews were spot-checked.
The supervisors met daily with the interviewers at the end of the day via conference call to discuss
the quality of their work and progress made. During these team meetings, the supervisor pointed
out the mistakes discovered during the observation of interviews. In most cases, mistakes were
corrected immediately and the interviewing style was improved by pointing out and discussing
errors during these meetings. The supervisor discussed the examples of actual mistakes identified
during spot checks. Also, during the meetings, they encouraged the interviewers to talk about any
situations they encountered during the data collection with the larger team for cross-learning. The
group discussed whether or not the situation was handled properly, and how similar situations
should be handled in the future. Team members learned a lot from one another in these meetings.
Lessons learnt
We had some excellent lessons to learn from the remote data collection strategy we deployed for
the current endline evaluation. Some of the key lessons learnt are –
• The detailed planned during the inception phase to adapt the whole evaluation to the
remote data collection strategy was pivotal for the successful data collection
• Clear identification of potential risks via two rounds of rigorous pilot testing of study
tools aided immensely in terms of –
o Strategically tailoring study tools to specific respondents to execute each tool
within 30 mins
o Think through the possible mitigation measures which are pragmatic and
practical in application
o Have a plan B in case Plan A is not successful (‘Odd’ and ‘Even’ & additional
sampling strategy)
o Evidencing the need to re-check the available contact numbers and update the
same
• Informing the government officials at different levels (block, district, and state) via
UNICEF state offices and CSO partners, and supporting letter from the state government
aided in garnering support from the government
• Odd-Even sample: The Odd-Even sampling strategy helped in mitigating potential risks
of low response rate by substituting the primary sample (ODD) with secondary sample
(EVEN) in case the primary sample is not reachable
• Dialing respondents at different times: The strategy to dial-in the switched-off/ not
reachable/ out of network area contacts seven times over a period of three days aided in
pushing the response rate up
• Flexibility of team in organizing the interviews: The flexible nature of the data
collection team in fixing the interviews early morning/ late evenings at the respondent’s
Page|215
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
convenience (specifically with respondents from tribal blocks) assisted in including more
respondents in the interviews
• Additional sampling (resampling): In some blocks where the team was unable to meet
the target sample for that block with odd and even-numbered samples combined, the
additional sample (resampling) aided in filling the gap
• Continuous coordination with CSO partners: For blocks where the supervisors/ FLWs
were not providing the consent/ willing to participate in the survey, the data collection
closely coordinated with the respective CSO partners to leverage their local connections
with block/district level officials in convincing the supervisors/ FLWs to participate in the
study
Analysis of sample covered from ‘Odd’ and ‘Even’ Sample & no. of attempts
Overall, 87.7% of the sample was achieved from the original sampled list and the remaining (12.3%)
was achieved from the additional sample list (resampling). Both the original sampled list and the
additional list had 'Odd' and 'Even' sample. The tables below present an overall analysis of the
number of attempts made for each category (AWW/ ASHA) in two states.

Triangulation of findings
Triangulation of findings generated through different lines of evidences (qualitative and
quantitative) was be done wherever possible to deepen and widen the understanding which
improved the findings. It facilitated validation of data through cross verification from different
sources and helped in assessing and strengthening contribution narrative thereby increasing the
confidence in the findings.
Page|227
End-line evaluation of ‘Space for Kids to be Kids’ project in Maharashtra and Rajasthan
We provide an example below to demonstrate how triangulation was used during analysis stage
–
Example:
Sub-Evaluation Question (SEQ) – 7.1 Data sources
• Quantitative survey with FLWs
SEQ7.1: To what extent there was change in
• KIIs with CSO implementing partners
knowledge, attitude and perceptions of FLWs
• KIIs with district officials/block officials of
on the role of parenting on ECD?
ICDS
• Firstly, the results of key KAP indicators from quantitative FLW survey endline were compared
with baseline data to assess changes in KAP levels of FLWs
• Then, the qualitative findings related to the perceptions (on changes related to KAP of FLWs)
of different stakeholder groups (govt officials and CSO partners) were compared to determine
areas of agreement as well as areas of divergence.
• Finally, the key emerging findings from qualitative analysis (on areas of agreement or
divergence) were paired with associated quantitative survey findings to determine if both the
qualitative and quantitative sources draw similar conclusions.
• If both the qualitative and quantitative sources drew similar conclusions, then the confidence
in the findings/results was considered to be higher which strengthens contribution narrative.
If both qualitative and quantitative sources drew diverging conclusions, then this was
considered as a weak evidence of change
