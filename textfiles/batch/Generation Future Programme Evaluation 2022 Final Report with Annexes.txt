Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
Executive Summary
Generation Future Programme
The Generation Future programme (referred to as 'the programme’ hereafter) was implemented by UNICEF
Cambodia in 2021 as a pilot and continued in 2022 as a complete programme. It had the goal of engaging
more young people as change-makers by providing them with the skills, confidence and opportunities they
needed to create positive change in their communities. The budget of the programme in 2021 was about USD
80,000 and that in 2022 just under USD 160,000.
The programme had 15 mentees in 2022 (and 13 in the 2021 pilot). Each mentee was matched with a mentor;
about half of the mentors in 2022 worked in the private sector. Each mentee implemented a social impact
project on a social issue that they chose according to a plan that they designed. All mentees were given
technical support, guidance and advice by their mentors, UNICEF Cambodia and other partners. Volunteers
(95 in 2021 and 128 in 2022) were recruited by the mentees to help implement the projects. The programme
organised training sessions on 19 topics for the mentees (and some volunteers in selected sessions) to help
them develop 21st Century Skills; these sessions were provided by private sector contributors, UNICEF
Cambodia and other partners. Each project had access to a seed fund of up to USD 2,000 for its
implementation.
The youth-led projects engaged young people both online (on UNICEF Cambodia communication channels
and dedicated pages of the projects on social media platforms) and in-person (in events and in schools). A
total of 5,752 youth ‘participants’ were directly and actively engaged by the mentee-led projects. 27,820 young
people were involved as ‘supporters’ who promoted and/or encouraged others to engage in activities of the
mentees’ projects. In the school implementation component of the programme, 6 of the projects went into 18
schools in Siem Reap Province to conduct activities for a total of 898 students (counting towards the 5,752
supporters) on the social issues that these projects addressed. These schools used a skills-based syllabus
(i.e., Local Life Skills, or LLS), and the visits to them were arranged by UNICEF Cambodia.
A large-scale event, the World Children’s Day celebration event, marked the end of a programme cycle; high-
profile figures from multiple sectors of the country were invited to attend the event that showcased the
mentees’ projects.
Evaluation of the Programme
The evaluation is commissioned by UNICEF Cambodia and conducted by Dr Alvin Leung, an independent
international consultant. It uses the six Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Assistance
Committee’s (OECD DAC) evaluation criteria to assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence,
(early) impact and sustainability of the Generation Future programme. The evaluation includes an additional
criterion on gender equality, equity and human rights. It adheres to the United Nations Evaluation Group
Norms and Standards for Evaluation amongst other international guidelines for research and ethics.
The evaluation examined the contribution that the private sector has made to the programme, the changes in
the lives of the children and youth who have been part of the programme, and the impact that these youth
have brought to their communities and other youth around them. Based on the findings, the evaluation
provides key recommendations on (a) the value of the programme for UNICEF Cambodia; (b) the architecture
of the programme; and (c) the best ways to scale, extend and sustain the programme in the future. The
primary users of the evaluation are UNICEF Cambodia, programme implementing partners, mentors and
mentees of the Generation Future programme (rights holders), the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport
(MoEYS; particularly at the province level in Siem Reap) (duty bearer), and private sector contributors.
The evaluation is based on the programme’s theory of change reconstructed by the consultant in collaboration
with the core programme team at UNICEF Cambodia. The evaluation used contribution analysis approach,
which used the theory of change to assess the relationships between programme inputs, outputs and
outcomes. The evaluation adopted a non-experimental, mixed method research design. It also adopted a
participatory approach in all its stages to ensure that young people and other stakeholders were adequately
involved and informed.
iv
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
The evaluation collected primary data using feedback forms, interviews and focus group discussions with 139
individuals, including mentees, mentors, youth volunteers, students and teachers at schools that used the LLS
syllabus, officials of the MoEYS, private sector contributors, UNICEF Cambodia staff, and staff of the
implementing partner. The data collection took place in January and February 2022; most of the data
collection activities were conducted in person in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap of Cambodia, with a small
number of them conducted online. The evaluation also reviewed programme documents, data and budget as
well as relevant policy documents and literature. Primary data collected from various stakeholders and
secondary data were triangulated in an iterative analysis process.
Key Evaluation Findings
Based on the data collected, the evaluation had the following findings, organised by the six OECD DAC
criteria and the additional criterion on gender equality, equity and human rights.
Relevance
The programme was relevant and responsive to the key national policies on education and youth
development, in particular the Education Strategic Plan and the National Policy on Youth Development. It was
also relevant to the needs of adolescents and youth in Cambodia. Young people participating in the
programme agreed that they developed 21st Century Skills and that these skills developed were what they
needed and would be helpful in their study, work and daily lives. The youth-led approach has proven strong in
ensuring relevance: most social issues chosen by the mentees were very relevant to the Cambodian youth, as
demonstrated in the large number of participants and supporters that the projects engaged. A small number of
social issues selected (e.g., introduction of IT sector jobs) were less relevant to young people in rural contexts,
though.
The programme was largely relevant to the programme’s mentors and its private sector contributors. The
matching between mentees and mentors ensured that most mentors could work on relevant projects with
young people with similar interests. Representatives of the private sector contributors interviewed opined that,
by providing training sessions to young people, they contributed towards fulfilling corporate social
responsibilities.
Coherence
The programme was coherent – and did not overlap – with similar programmes of other development partners.
The Generation Future programme focused more on online campaigning, skills development for youth, and
youth participation, while the programmes of other development partners emphasised more the provision of
support to start-ups and promotion of entrepreneurship education.
The programme had the necessary linkages with the private sector for contributing to achieving programme
outputs and outcomes. These linkages benefited the participating adolescents and youth directly as well as
helped UNICEF Cambodia build new relationships with private sector partners and provided them with an
entry point to collaborate with UNICEF. Yet, the Phnom Penh-centric positioning of the programme could have
been improved to provide valuable experiences to young people in the provinces where similar opportunities
were very limited.
The programme has been consistent with other interventions and activities of UNICEF Cambodia. The
linkages that the programme had with multiple sections/strategy of UNICEF Cambodia were somewhat
productive. The most productive linkage was the one with the Adolescent Development and Participation
(ADAP) strategy, as the programme contributed to the work of ADAP by increasing young people’s capacity to
participate meaningfully in their communities and by providing an enabling environment for participation and
increasing youth engagement. The linkage with the Education Section was productive, but the contribution
made by the programme to the Education Section was small in scale; the evaluation also found that the
programme’s outputs and outcomes were not well aligned with those of the Education Section.
Effectiveness
The programme was overall effective in achieving its three outcomes.
v
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
First, young people were sufficiently engaged in actively addressing social issues that impacted them
(outcome 1). Mentees were provided a high level of support from the core programme team as well as high
quality training from UNICEF Cambodia, other development partners and private sector contributors on a wide
range of topics. The available seed fund (up to USD 2,000 for each mentee-led project) was crucial to
implement the projects. The mentors chosen for the mentees and their projects were suitable and highly
relevant, and most mentor-mentee relationships were very productive. The technical expertise, seniority and
influence of the mentors were conducive to project implementation, ensuring that the social issues were
addressed and that the projects gained attention from young people in the country. Youth volunteers provided
instrumental technical support to project implementation; they themselves also gained valuable skills and
experience that would be useful for them not only for study and work but also to potentially lead actions that
address social issues. The school implementation component and the online engagement very effectively
expanded the reach of the programme. The programme to some extent inspired the school students to
participate in addressing social issues more actively through their other learning activities in the LLS syllabus.
Second, the programme was somewhat effective in improving access to stable employment opportunities for
young people (outcome 2). The programme helped mentees gain confidence in creating positive change,
broadening professional networks and improving knowledge in project areas or themes; mentees believed
that these benefits would be useful in furthering their study and subsequently finding jobs. Volunteers,
although less involved compared to mentees, also agreed that the skills and confidence gained would help
them in studying. Since the skills gained were in demand in the labour market, it could be inferred that the
programme was contributing to improving the access to employment through skills training. It is nonetheless
worth noting that this outcome was limited to mainly mentees and volunteers because: (a) the training was
provided only to them; and (b) the involvement from other target groups (i.e., participants and supporters) was
not significant enough for the evaluation to conclude that their access to employment was improved.
Third, the programme was effective in increasing opportunities for young people to contribute to civic decision
making (outcome 3). This was primarily achieved by: (a) enabling and supporting (including on skills
development) mentees and volunteers in running their projects (linked to outcome 1); (b) creating online
spaces for youth participation; (c) raising awareness of social issues among young people; and (d)
showcasing to stakeholders, including senior government officials and other influential members of society,
young people’s success in addressing social issues through online platforms and in events and subsequently
seeking to open more opportunities for youth participation.
Efficiency
The economic efficiency of the programme was high considering the large number of young people reached
(33,000+) by the programme and its relatively small budget (< USD 160,000). The evaluation found that the
seed fund and mentoring together brought the most impact on young people and children in the most cost-
efficient manner. The training bootcamp, wherein intensive skills development sessions were provided, also
offered great value for money.
The operational efficiency in implementing the programme across sections needs improvement. In particular,
the cross-section linkages appeared to have been hampered by the unclear responsibilities of the sections of
UNICEF Cambodia involved; this caused minor delays in implementation and frustration among the staff
involved. Moreover, the implementing partner was not managed properly, resulting in failures in recruiting
volunteers from a multi-provincial youth organisation and in seed fund management.
(Early) impact
The programme successfully formed a network of talented young people who are agents of change; they are
equipped with the right skillsets and hands-on experience to make changes in communities. This network can
be useful for UNICEF Cambodia in furthering its work on youth empowerment and participation. The
programme also built work relationships with mentors, many of which are influential individuals in the
government, private sector and NGOs. The programme experience of working with mentors and private sector
contributors, on the one hand, demonstrated that the private sector in Cambodia can be engaged to provide
vi
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
very specific technical support and, on the other, provided an entry point for the private sector to collaborate
with UNICEF Cambodia on youth development. Also, the unique strategies of the programme on enabling
youth-led online campaigns and on creating online spaces for youth participation were very conducive to
promoting youth participation and to reaching many young people in the country. Also, it can be inferred from
the above that the programme improved UNICEF Cambodia’s brand visibility among young people and the
private sector.
That said, the contribution of the programme to the country programme of UNICEF Cambodia was evident but
indirect, limiting the programme’s impact. The evaluation finds that the contribution was mainly made to higher
level goals but not to the specific outcomes (and their indicators) set for the work areas and sections of the
country office. Another factor limiting the early – and potential – impact of the programme was the unrealised
institutionalisation and scaling attempts, including that on building partnership with a multi-province youth
network and that on connecting the programme with a government initiative on youth participation and
volunteerism.
Sustainability
It is very likely that the programme’s contribution to mentees and volunteers on the individual level will sustain;
such contribution includes the skills improved, knowledge acquired, confidence gained and networks
extended. As for the impact made on students and other participants, the evaluation cannot conclude
confidently that it will sustain because the programme’s interaction with them was relatively brief.
Some youth-led projects may not continue and their impact may therefore not sustain; this was because some
mentees needed to focus on their study and would like to discontinue their projects, despite some
continuation support offered by the programme team.
On the programme level, the planned – yet not materialised – institutionalisation efforts negatively impacted
the programme’s prospect and sustainability. The sustainability of the benefits brought by the school
implementation component of the programme was questionable mainly because the programme had no
institutional partners in this regard. These weaknesses can be attributed to the programme’s short history and
limited resources to create conditions for sustainability.
Gender equality, equity and human rights
Gender equality has been carefully considered by the programme in its design and implementation; it was
evident that the programme contributed to ensuring gender equality: a few youth-led projects chosen had an
explicit focus on ensuring gender equality and challenged gender norms and stereotypes that could limit girls’
and young women’s equal access to and participation in certain sectors of the economy of Cambodia.
The programme’s design sought to use mechanisms to ensure equity (e.g., working with a multi-provincial
youth network that engaged young people from disadvantaged backgrounds). Such attempts nonetheless
were of limited success, and that negatively impacted the programme’s ability to directly engage young people
from marginalised and disadvantaged backgrounds. Some human rights issues, such as climate change,
children’s oral health and nutrition, were adequately addressed by the youth-led projects, but the evaluation
found that some most urgent human rights issues identified in the country programme remained untouched by
the programme.
Key Conclusion and Recommendations
Considering the programme’s achievements and results, the evaluation concludes that the Generation Future
programme should be continued.
The evaluation found that the most impactful programme components were the seed funds given to the youth-
led social impact projects and the mentorship provided by influential individuals in Cambodia. However, it is
evident that the programme cannot be significantly scaled only by increasing the number of projects, mentees
and mentors unless there is a major increase of human and financial resource input.
vii
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
Therefore, in expanding and scaling the programme, UNICEF Cambodia should aim to: (a) reach more young
people, particularly those in marginalised and disadvantaged communities and outside Phnom Penh, without
overwhelming the mentees and the core programme team; (b) deepen the engagement with participants, in
particular students in schools that used the LLS syllabus, given the success of the school implementation
component; (c) utilise existing infrastructure of the government by stepping up the programme’s early
institutionalisation efforts; and (d) devise plans to capitalise on the connections built particularly those with the
private sector.
Considering the above and based on the findings, the evaluation made the following 8 recommendations.
Recommendations 1 and 2 are on volunteer recruitment. Recommendations 3 and 4 are on school
implementation and the programme’s presence outside Phnom Penh. Recommendation 5 is on private sector
engagement. Recommendations 6, 7 and 8 are on programme management.
1. Map the youth networks in Phnom Penh and select provinces to support an improved outreach
process. This will help the core programme team identify channels to better advertise volunteering
opportunities under the social impact projects. Working with local youth networks can help establish
longer lasting relationships and leverage their local knowledge to reach young people from
marginalised and disadvantaged communities in volunteer recruitment. These networks can also be
used in inviting applications for being mentees.
2. Establish the connection between the programme and the Volunteer for My Community (VMC),
a government initiative to promote youth development and participation. This will, on the one hand,
help expand the reach of the programme and increase the diversity of the volunteers and, on the
other, make an important step in institutionalising part of the programme.
3. Introduce ‘quotas’ for mentees based in select provinces and strengthen core programme team
support for them. This means that a fixed number of mentees chosen must be ‘from’ and residing in
the select provinces during the implementation of their social impact projects. This is to ensure that the
selected mentees – and hopefully their volunteers – are not all based in Phnom Penh (as this has
limited the reach of the programme). More importantly, having mentees in the select provinces allow
them to work with target schools much earlier and in multiple occasions. These mentees should still
receive the same opportunities to attend the training bootcamp and benefit from mentorship and
training sessions.
4. Establish connections with Youth Councils in Phnom Penh and select provinces. The
connections will further strengthen mentees’ projects, as the Youth Councils can be engaged and/or
consulted with in multiple components (e.g., mentee recruitment, volunteer recruitment, campaigning,
school implementation) to further expand the reach of the programme and diversify the backgrounds
from which mentees and volunteers come.
5. Study how to best capitalise on the connections built with the private sector by consulting with
participated individuals and studying companies’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies. The
findings will contribute to devising a more relatable approach to engaging the private sector. It is also
important to consider the long-term objectives of engaging the private sector in the Cambodian
context.
6. Position the programme either under the Deputy Representative Office (with one section acting
as the Secretariat) or under ADAP (with a significant increase in stable funding to ADAP). One
concern that the new positioning should address is the availability of funding and human resources
that can be dedicated to the programme, as the programme cannot scale on the current allocated
human resources (1.5 staff members) and budget (<USD 160,000). Another concern that this new
positioning should address is the cross-section linkages (see the following recommendation) for better
operational efficiency and accountability.
7. Reinforce cross-section linkages. The aims of the reinforcement are to: (a) align the objectives of
the programme with those of the projects/activities under the sections involved; (b) define the
contribution to be made by the programme to the sections involved; (c) establish agreement on what
and how the sections involved should contribute in return; (d) dedicate resources to keep to the
agreement; and (e) ensure accountability.
viii
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
8. Strengthen the partnership with the Child Rights Coalition Cambodia (the implementing
partner). In response to the failures on volunteer recruitment and seed fund management, it is
advisable to strengthen the partnership with the CRC-Cambodia (which managed a multi-provincial
youth network) and improve the capacity of the partner. The CRC-Cambodia must also be given
adequate resources; monitoring indicators must be clearly defined to ensure its accountability.

1. Introduction
This report presents findings, conclusions and recommendations of the evaluation of the Generation Future
programme.
The Generation Future programme was implemented by UNICEF Cambodia in 2021 as a pilot and in 2022 as
a full programme. It had the goal of engaging more young people as change-makers by providing them with
the skills, confidence and opportunities that they need to create positive change in their communities.
The purpose of the evaluation is to assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, (early) impact
and sustainability of the Generation Future programme. The evaluation provides key recommendations on: (a)
the value of the programme for UNICEF Cambodia; (b) the programmatic architecture of the programme; and
(c) the best ways to scale, extend and sustain the programme in the future. It examined the contribution that
the private sector made to Generation Future, the changes on the lives of the children and youth who have
been part of the programme, and the impact that these youth have brought to their communities and other
youth around them.
The evaluation is summative in that it provides an overall judgement on the programme, and formative in that
it provides feedback on how well the different components of the programme are working.
The evaluation covers the period between August 2021 (when the programme was first implemented) and
January 2023 (which falls in the data collection period). The timing of this evaluation aims to inform UNICEF
and other stakeholders on the progress of the programme and lessons learned, and to present
recommendations for future project adjustment. The primary data collection with 139 individuals took place in
January 2023 and February 2023.
The evaluation was commissioned by UNICEF Cambodia. It was conducted and led by Dr Alvin Leung, the
International Consultant for the evaluation assignment. He is referred to as ‘the consultant’ and ‘the evaluator’
in this report. Ms Kimputhvitheavy Vonn worked as an Evaluation Assistant to Dr Leung; she provided Khmer
language support and administrative support during the data collection phase. Dr Leung and Ms Vonn form
the ‘evaluation team’ mentioned in this report.
The report is structured as follows. Chapter 1 introduces the report. Chapter 2 provides the context and
background to the evaluation. Chapter 3 presents the evaluation purpose, objectives and scope. Chapter 4
introduces the evaluation approach and methodology. Chapter 5 presents the findings of the evaluation,
organised by the 6 OECD DAC evaluation criteria and an additional criterion on gender equality, equity and
human rights. Chapter 6 discusses the main evaluation conclusions and lessons learned. Chapter 7 offers
recommendations based on the evaluation findings. Annexes include: evaluation matrix; data collection tools;
consent forms, term of reference of the evaluation; ethical review approval; the inception report approved; and
the revised theory of change.
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
2. Background to and Object of Evaluation
2.1 Background to Evaluation
This section sets out the background to the evaluation, including the Cambodia context and its policy
landscape. It covers three themes/concepts that are most relevant to the Generation Future programme: skills
development and education, youth development and participation, and entrepreneurship education.
2.1.1 Context
Cambodia has one of the youngest populations in south-east Asia, with a third of its 16 million people under
the age of 15 years and a fifth between the ages of 15 and 24 years. This dynamic and highly mobile
population is poised to enter the work force and could be a major contributor to sustainable development and
economic growth1.
Over the past two decades, Cambodia has undergone a significant transition, reaching lower middle-income
status in 2015 and aspiring to attain upper middle-income status by 2030. Driven by garment exports and
tourism, Cambodia’s economy has sustained an average growth rate of 8% between 1998 and 2018, making
it one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The national GDP per capita increased for about 7 times
from USD 253 in 1993 to around USD 1,591 in 20212, despite the recent setback brought by the COVID-19
pandemic.
There have also been significant improvements made to Cambodia’s education system. School enrolment
rate has increased over the two decades; the school enrolment rates in 2018 are 90% (primary) and 38%
(secondary). The system, however, has been impacted by the pandemic, the situation analysis conducted by
UNICEF Cambodia estimates that 5% of young people aged 10-24 years old completely missed their
education during the pandemic, which led to months long closure of schools.
2.1.2 Skills Development and Education
Whilst the growth of the economy and the development of the country over the last two decades are
encouraging (despite the recent negative impact of the pandemic on the education system), there remain
challenges regarding skills development. One key challenge is the mismatch between the skills learnt in
schools and the skills needed by employers.
A study conducted by the ADB and the ILO3 in 2015 concluded that skills among young people did not match
with employers’ needs in Cambodia. In other words, the country’s education system was not helping young
people develop skills that were needed in the labour market. The study accordingly advocated a coordinated
approach wherein private enterprises would be involved in providing education to help ‘close the skills gap’. It
also recommended providing nonformal and lifelong learning outside schools as well as ensuring information
flows among students, schools and employers.
Another study, conducted by the World Bank4 in 2018, came to a similar conclusion that Cambodia’s
education system was not producing a future labour force that will be able to meet country’s future job
challenges. It stressed the need for building a skills development system that can incorporate socio-
behavioural skills (e.g., creativity, innovation, leadership) and higher-order cognitive skills (e.g., critical
thinking, problem solving, reasoning). It also underlined the need for incentivising private enterprises to play a
more prominent role in providing, guiding and advocating for a demand-driven skills development system.
The findings above indicate a need for providing skills development opportunities to young people in
Cambodia in formal, informal and nonformal education settings. There is also a need to engage the private

sector in youth skills development, as this can help match the skills learnt in education settings with the skills
needed in entering the labour market and/or starting one’s own business. Coordination among young people,
the government, the private sector, development agencies and other stakeholders is also key to success.
The involvement of the private sector in skills development and education has since been written into key
government strategies including the Rectangular Strategy and the Education Strategic Plan – both published
in 2018. The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) stated in the Rectangular Strategy5 that it would
increase education’s response to labour market demand and livelihoods. It also pledged to design
programmes to incite entrepreneurship and to continue to promote the life skills programme for young people.
The Education Strategic Plan 2019-20236 is a major guiding document of the RGC on education. The
secondary and technical education sub-sector in the Education Strategic Plan is most pertinent to the
Generation Future programme. The strategy for this sub-sector specifies the need for involving development
partners and the private sector in school development planning, promotion of lifelong learning and provision of
learning opportunities including those for the development of 21st Century Skills and other transferrable skills.
More specifically, there is a strategy (1.2) on expanding partnerships between schools and the private sector
on skills requirements and one (2.1) on meeting the 21st Century Skills frameworks.
Despite the attempts of the RGC and other stakeholders, adolescents and youth reported to UNICEF
Cambodia in a 2020 situation analysis survey7 that the skills they had learnt in school were not useful for their
daily lives. Only 15% of in-school adolescent and youth felt that most of the skills learnt were useful in their
everyday lives. Adolescent and youth also expressed that they had limited capacity to meet the corporate
world’s needs and those of the society more broadly due to the skills gap. It is nonetheless worth noting that
the situation analysis was conducted only 2 years after the aforesaid strategies were devised; major changes
made to skills development and education systems take time to accomplish.
In view of the current situation and in line with government strategies, UNICEF Cambodia’s country
programme 2019-2023 is committed to increasing the access to inclusive, equitable, relevant and quality
education that promotes lifelong learning8. It is also committed to engaging the private sector, schools and
communities to help adolescents and youth reach their full potential and use innovation to address issues that
impact young people of Cambodia.
2.1.3 Youth development and participation
The RGC has multiple strategies and frameworks in place to ensure youth9 development and participation.
For example, the MoEYS established a nation-wide network of Youth Councils for upper secondary schools
and has the National Council for Youth Development, which has been implementing programmes and
activities including a youth volunteer programme and vocational skills programme. Spaces for youth
participation in government programmes were also evident in the widespread efforts of the RGC to encourage
and support volunteerism. Also, the RGC developed the National Policy on Cambodia Youth Development in
2011 to promote youth participation and to help young people become good citizens.
Despite these efforts, UNICEF Cambodia’s situation analysis in 2020 found that youth participation in the
development process and general programme development and implementation was lacking. It found that
young people, both male and female, reported still having limitations to their social and community
participation, including attending classes, workshops and social events. While young people and students
took part in activities in the education sector, no activity had been reported to be headed by the youth
themselves. Only 11% of responding young people said that they expressed their views and opinions or
exchanged ideas with someone, a group of people or an organisation in the preceding 12 months.

Policy on Cambodia Youth Development as those between 15 and 30 years old.

Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
The findings above prove the need for further empowering and engaging young people to contribute to – and
even lead – policy discussions and civic decision-making. UNICEF Cambodia has been working with young
people and the government through implementing the Adolescent Development and Participation (ADAP)
cross-sectoral strategy; it also involves young people in some programme design and evaluation activities.
One priority action under the ADAP10 is the use of Local Life Skills (LLS) syllabus11 that introduced a subject
where students are guided to create a project or find solutions to everyday scenarios as well as to explore and
learn from their local context. According to the syllabus, students are given support to develop 21st Century
Skills in the LLS subject12. The syllabus was developed by the Department of Curriculum Development with
the support of UNICEF Cambodia (which also co-organised teacher training sessions in the last 2 years); it
was being implemented in select schools in 7 provinces of Cambodia, including Siem Reap Province, as of
January 2021.
2.1.4 Entrepreneurship education
Another work area that is relevant to the Generation Future project is entrepreneurship education. Currently,
entrepreneurship education in Cambodia is mainly provided in higher education institutes (HEIs). According to
a report published by the UN-ESCAP and the MISTI (a relatively new ministry)13 in 2021, most of the 118
HEIs in Cambodia offer business-related courses, with a recent emphasis on entrepreneurship education.
HEIs are also considered an important component in the nascent entrepreneurial ecosystem; they run dozens
of start-up programmes and host incubators and innovation labs14. Multiple development partners, such as the
EU, ILO and USAID, and private enterprises, such as Smart Axiata and EZECOM, are involved in supporting
the development of the ecosystem. In addition, the government established in the last 5 years the USD 5-
million Entrepreneurship Development Fund and an Entrepreneurship Promotion Centre.
There are nonetheless several weaknesses facing entrepreneurship education in Cambodia. The UN-
ESCAP/MISTI report stated that coaching was limited in scale and structure, although young local
entrepreneurial role models and innovation centre provided some support. Also, public universities reported a
lack of meaningful partnerships with other stakeholders in the start-up ecosystem. Girls’ relatively limited
participation in STEM fields, and hence in innovation, was also an issue (this is partly because innovation is
deemed by the government as closely related to STEM). Lastly, the skills gap mentioned earlier was also
considered a hindrance to nurturing entrepreneurs in Cambodia15. The Generation Future programme’s
design responded to some of these systemic weaknesses, for instance, by developing young people’s
transferrable skills and by supporting youth-led projects that promote gender equity in STEM fields.
2.2 Object of Evaluation
The Generation Future programme has the goal of engaging more young people as change-makers by
providing them with the skills, confidence and opportunities that they need to create positive change
in their communities. It supports young people through training, personalised mentorship and seed funding
to bring their own ideas to reality.
2.2.1 Programme Pilot in 2021
The programme was run as a pilot by the Communication Team of UNICEF Cambodia between August 2021
and November 2021 with a budget of USD 80,218. It started as a communication and outreach campaign.

Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
The programme pilot had 13 mentees (10 females and 3 males) aged between 18 and 24; each mentee ran a
project of their choice and could access a seed fund of up to USD 2,000 to implement the project. All mentees
were also offered regular support, guidance and advice on project management and problem solving. Each
mentee was matched with a mentor (11 in total, with 2 of them mentoring more than 1 mentee). During the
15-week project planning and implementation period (August 2021 to November 2021), the mentors and
mentees were advised to meet on a weekly basis to discuss the projects. Handbooks were developed by
UNICEF Cambodia to guide the discussions.
Also, the mentees were provided training delivered by UNICEF Cambodia and its partners; these training
sessions were on a wide range of skills, including communication skills, problem solving skills and teamwork.
In addition, mentees had the opportunities to extend their professional networks as well as to gain project and
professional exposure through UNICEF Cambodia’s digital channels.
The programme pilot had five themes, and each mentee-led project fell into one or more of the five themes.
The themes are: (a) health; (b) education; (c); the environment; (d) mental health; and (e) equality.
The programme was – and still is – closely connected to the World Children’s Day (WCD) (celebrated globally
on 20 November) event organised by UNICEF Cambodia. The design of the programme was partly inspired
by how WCD events brought stories of Cambodian children to the forefront. More importantly, programme
mentees were given the opportunity to present their projects in the high-profile WCD 2021 event, where they
also formally ‘graduated’ from the programme. In addition, digital channels and social media were utilised to
provide exposure for the projects.
The programme pilot had the following three objectives:
1. To provide mentorship and support to up to 10 (later adjusted to 13) Cambodian young people with
visions to ‘become change-makers’, equipping them with the resources to develop their skills and
ideas into tangible projects.
2. To engage influencers and thought leaders on issues around youth empowerment and youth
development.
3. To position UNICEF Cambodia as an organisation empowered by young people.
The programme pilot was internally assessed, with a report written, in December 2021. The pilot’s strategies,
results and overall effectiveness were examined. The assessment found that the programme pilot achieved
its three objectives. Other key findings of the internal evaluations are as follows:
 Mentees improved their knowledge, technical skills and soft skills.
 The programme pilot provided new opportunities for both mentees and youth volunteers.
 The We Are Generation Future (later renamed Generation Future) Facebook group created a new
youth engagement entry point, with over 800 people joined as members as of December 2021.
 The programme pilot successfully engaged influencers and the wider public on youth development.
 Mentees achieved a combined social media following of 25,780 across all platforms, with one mentee
achieving over 100,000 views on his mental health video as of December 2021.
 The programme pilot amplified young people’s voices and positioned UNICEF as an organisation
empowered by young people. The collective impressions of WCD social media post reached almost
2.3 million as of December 2021.
The internal assessment report identified a few challenges regarding the programme pilot’s implementation.
They include: (a) limited staff resources for implementation; (b) seed fund distribution (which was managed by
Child Rights Coalition Cambodia (CRC-Cambodia), a partner of UNICEF Cambodia); and (c) social media
campaign management including that of co-creating content with mentees.
2.2.2 Programme in 2022
Having proven that the programme pilot had traction and achieved its objectives, UNICEF Cambodia
continued the Generation Future programme as a complete programme in June 2022. Its annual budget was
increased to about USD 160,000. The funding was from the Australian Government through the Australian
5

NGO Cooperation Program (ANCP). Following the pilot and its internal assessment, the core programme
team revised the programme’s objectives. The three objectives for the 2022 programme and their indicators
are presented in Table 1.

Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
In addition to the revised objectives, there were some other changes made to the programme after the pilot;
these changes were informed by young people’s feedback and the findings of the internal assessment. The
most significant changes were:
 The programme’s implementation period was lengthened from 15 weeks to 6 months (June to
November 2022), with some training sessions and ongoing support extended to February 2023.
 The number of mentees increased from 13 in the pilot to 15 (11 females and 4 males).
 The five themes were consolidated into three: (a) education; (b) the environment; and (c) health.
 Applicants were required to submit a project plan and budget plan, which were not needed in the pilot.
Written responses were needed in 2022 in either Khmer or English; this contrasted the 2021
application process wherein videos and voice notes were allowed.
The programme in 2022 adopted four scale-up strategies.
 From a youth engagement initiative to a multi-sectoral initiative.
 The programme in 2022 added a component on engaging school students through the Local Life
Skills (LLS) syllabus. The LLS syllabus is implemented by the MoEYS, with support from UNICEF
Cambodia’s Education Section, in schools in seven provinces including Siem Reap Province. it
aims to develop the 21st Century Skills through inquiry-based, project-based learning. This
component of the Generation Future programme intended to broaden the reach of the
programme and extended the support networks.
 The programme intended to use the existing partnerships with the Adolescent and Youth
Reference Group (AYRG) and the Child Rights Coalition Cambodia (CRC-Cambodia) to recruit
young volunteers for the mentee-led projects. It aimed to create peer-to-peer linkages between
mentees and members of the AYRG.
 Increased co-design and co-creation opportunities.
 The programme in 2022 aimed to engage volunteer youth advisors at various points, for instance,
on designing the mentee application and mentor selection processes, selecting themes for
training, and planning the World Children’s Day event.
 From individual to community-based approach.
 The programme sought to help mentees and volunteers involve the communities wherein the
projects were implemented. It expected that mentees would act as amplifiers, influencing, sharing
knowledge with and creating new opportunities for their volunteers. The aim of this approach was
to enable volunteers to upskill in areas that would appeal to future employers and to improve their
abilities to participate actively in their communities.
 Making partnerships a cornerstone.
 The programme aimed to build and strengthen UNICEF Cambodia’s partnership with the private
sector. It intended to connect the mentees with professional experts and influential spokespeople,
who would provide mentorship and support for mentees’ projects.
 The programme aimed to invite private firms to provide training for mentees22.
 The programme sought to connect mentees to businesses, schools and international NGOs with
the aim to create synergies between their projects and the work of those organisations.
 The programme sought to establish connections with creative and media agencies, aiming to
support young people to showcase their projects and gain exposure. The connections were
expected to provide mentees with resources and capacity to grow their projects more effectively
and sustainably while allowing them to influence and inspire a wider youth audience.
To summarise, the programme in 2022 had the following components:
Table 2 Generation Future programme (2022) components
Component Details Timeframe
22 By contrast, the training in the 2021 pilot was mainly provided by the development sector and with social media
influencers.

Component Details Timeframe
Mentorship One-to-one mentoring sessions were provided by mentors with June 2022 to
technical expertise in the mentees’ chosen subject/area. The mentors November 2022
and mentees were advised to meet weekly during the implementation
period.
(Mentors received a handbook, joined an introduction session at the
start of the programme, and all but two joined the training bootcamp
(mentioned below) networking sessions and the World Children’s
Day event. They were also offered one-to-one support provided by
the core programme team.)
Seed funding Each mentee had access to a seed fund of up to USD 2,000 to August 2022 to
support the development of their project. The money was managed November 2022
and distributed by the programme partner CRC-Cambodia.
Mentee Training and capacity building sessions (19 in total)23 were provided June 2022 to
training, by UNICEF Cambodia and partners to the mentees and other young February 2023
including those people engaged in the Generation Future programme. Ten (10) of
provided in the training sessions were provided in a 1.5-day bootcamp at the
bootcamp beginning of the mentee-led project designing and implementation
period.
Volunteer Mentees recruited and onboarded volunteers (128 in 2022) to June 2022 to
recruitment support them with project development. Mentees in turn provided November 2022
volunteers opportunities to learn new skills and build their knowledge
and capacity.

A theory of change (ToC) was developed by the core programme team to guide the evaluation. The ToC
(see Figure 1) focuses on the expected pathways of change for the mentees and young people who took part
in the programme. The outcomes in the ToC are changes that are expected to happen by the end of the
programme (December 2022); the impact is expected to be achieved in 3 to 5 years after the start of the
programme (between mid-2024 mid-2026). The changes expected for UNICEF Cambodia were not captured
in the ToC, yet they are in the scope of this evaluation and are included in the evaluation questions (e.g., that
on brand visibility).
While the changes expected for mentors were also not captured in the ToC, the programme expected that
mentors would benefit from the programme in the following ways: (a) personal growth through the
development of mentoring skills; (b) exposure across UNICEF Cambodia channels and through the wider
media; (c) an opportunity to share knowledge to inspire the next generation of talent in Cambodia; and (d)
23 The training sessions provided by private sector contributors included the following topics: communication and problem
solving; building a website; public speaking; utilising social media for social impact projects; personal empowerment;
branding and marketing; budget management; CV building and professional online profiles; pitching projects to donors
and investors; and pitching brunch. The sessions provided by UNICEF Cambodia included the following topics: project
management; and media engagement. The sessions provided by other partners (e.g., NGOs, ex-mentees and ex-mentors
not working in the private sector) included the following topics: diversity, inclusion and equality; looking after one’s mental
wellbeing; photo-taking; volunteer engagement; budget management (by implementing partner the CRC).

activities
After discussions with the core programme team in the inception phase of this evaluation, three changes were
made to the Theory of Change provided in the Terms of Reference. This was done according to objective 9 of
the evaluation (see Section 3.1).
First, an extra output ‘private sector engaged to provide training and skills development opportunities’ was
added, given the importance of such contribution and the fact that private sector’s contribution was mentioned
in the purpose and objectives of this evaluation.
Second, the 5,000 target in output 5 was adjusted to 2,000. This was caused by significant delays in
launching U-Report in Cambodia, which was expected to help engaged more young people online. U-Report
was not incorporated into the programme, and the target was adjusted accordingly.
Third, the word ‘sustainable’ in the phrase ‘sustainable “social good” projects’ in output 4 was removed. This
was because the programme did not intend to sustain all mentee-led projects beyond the end of the year’s
activities in November. The core programme team and the evaluator agreed in the inception phase that it
9
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
would be unrealistic to expect that all projects can continue regardless of their quality. It is because: (a) most
mentees were in upper secondary schools and will further their study; and (b) further funding could not be
guaranteed for all projects. This, however, does not imply that the impact on young people and others was not
sustainable. It also did not affect how the evaluation criterion of sustainability (evaluation question 8) was
studied in this evaluation (see Section 5.6 for findings on sustainability).
The programme in 2022 had the following key stakeholders (Table 3) and target groups (Table 4).

on decent work and economic growth; and (c) SDG 17 on building and strengthening partnership for the goals.
On the mentee-led project level, multiple SDGs were relevant as the projects covered a wide range of social
issues; these included SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education),
SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and
production) and SDG 13 (climate action).

Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
3. Purposes, Objectives and Scope
3.1 Purposes and Objectives
The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, (early)
impact and sustainability of the Generation Future programme, with gender equality, equity and human rights
considered. It also examined the contribution that the private sector made to Generation Future, the changes
on the lives of the children and youth who were part of the programme, and the impact that these youth
brought to their communities and other youth around them.
The evaluation provides key recommendations on: (a) the value of the programme for UNICEF Cambodia;
(b) the programmatic architecture of the programme; and (c) the best ways to scale, extend and sustain the
programme in the future. Please refer to Chapter 7 for the recommendations.
As described in its terms of reference, the evaluation has 9 objectives:
1. Assess the relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency of the Generation Future and all its components.
2. Examine the coherence of the programme and its coordination, multi-sectoral linkages and
complementary/supplementary relationships between all the stakeholders involved and identify the
factors that enable or challenge successful coordination.
3. Evaluate the early/short term impacts and potential for impact that the programme has achieved for all
its target groups (i.e., mentees, volunteers of programmes and their communities as well as youth
participants of online trainings) and assess the sustainability of the results and impacts achieved at
the individual, school, and community level.
4. Assess the contribution that the private sector partners have made on the mentees’ and volunteers’
skills, knowledge and network, and on their project results.
5. Assess the potential additional indirect effects that the programme might have on UNICEF’s
relationship and network with the private sector through the engagement with them for Generation
Future.
6. Evaluate the extent to which the programme has increased UNICEF brand visibility and positioning of
UNICEF Cambodia as an organisation empowered by children and young people.
7. Assess the continuation and scalability of the programme, identifying the most impactful components
of the programme and evaluating the conditions required for its successful continuation and scale up.
8. Provide forward looking recommendations that are actionable and feasible in the short and medium
term to help shape the programme design.
9. Reconstruct the ToC to guide the evaluation and develop a revised ToC (see Annex Q) that takes into
consideration the forward-looking recommendations on programme design.
Key users of findings of this evaluation are UNICEF Cambodia, CRC-Cambodia/AYRG (implementing
partner), mentors and mentees of the Generation Future programme (rights holders), the MoEYS (particularly
at the province level in Siem Reap) (duty bearer) and private sector contributors.
Additional users include: schools that participated in the Generation Future programme (rights holders);
youth volunteers of the programme (rights holders); development partners that operate in Cambodia; other
government institutions; organisations that contributed to the Generation Future programme; the UNICEF
Regional Office for East Asia and the Pacific (EAPRO) and other UN agencies.
3.2 Approach
The evaluation adopts a human rights-based approach25. It collected and analysed data to produce findings
and to give recommendations to: (a) empower people (rights-holders; adolescents and youth in this case) to
claim and exercise their rights; and (b) to strengthen the capacity of the actors (duty-bearers, for example)

who have a particular obligation or responsibility to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of the poorest, weakest,
most marginalised and vulnerable, and to comply with these obligations and duties.
The evaluation also takes into consideration gender equality, and equity. Certain groups of adolescents and
young people in Cambodia are disadvantaged, which include: young women and girls; young men and boys
(who are more likely than young women and girls to drop out of schools26); adolescents and young people
from rural areas; adolescents and young people from non-majority communities; adolescents and young
people with disabilities; and children and adolescents not in education, employment or training (NEET). The
consultant scrutinised whether and how the programme adequately engaged with, and empowered, these
groups and communities; he sought to achieve this not only through reviewing programme documents and
data but also through actively including them in the data collection process to allow them to express their
views and be heard. Please also see Section 4.9 for ethical considerations.
This evaluation is guided by the UNICEF’s revised Evaluation Policy (2018)27, the United Nations Evaluation
Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards for Evaluation (2016)28, UNEG Guidance on Integrating Human Rights
and Gender Equality in Evaluation (2014)29, UN-SWAP Evaluation Performance Indicator, UNEG Ethical
Guidelines for Evaluation (2021)30, UNICEF Procedure on Ethical Standards and Research, Evaluation and
Data Collection and Analysis (2021)31 and UNICEF-Adapted UNEG Evaluation Report Standards (2017)32.
To ensure the quality of the evaluation, the consultant worked closely with the Evaluation Management Team
at UNICEF Cambodia. Also, UNICEF Cambodia formed a Reference Group comprised of two mentees in the
2022 cohort and UNICEF Cambodia staff from multiple sections (no external partners were invited to join).
The group was actively involved in multiple stages of this evaluation to give comments and suggestions. A list
of the members of the Reference Group can be found in the acknowledgements in this report.
3.3 Framework and Questions
The framework used in this evaluation is informed by the well-established OECD DAC evaluation normative
framework.
The consultant accepted all the overarching and evaluation questions listed in the terms of reference (ToR).
The evaluation aims to answer three overarching questions, which were also used to frame the conclusion of
the evaluation. The three overarching questions are:
1. What has the programme achieved during its two rounds’ existence?
2. Have the resources invested produced the expected and long-lasting results on those who have been
engaged with the programme?
3. Should the programme be continued, and if so, what are the best ways to expand and scale the
programme?
There are 16 evaluation questions that guide the evaluation that provide an objective and comprehensive
response to the overarching questions. All the evaluation questions and their corresponding OECD DAC
criteria can be found in Table 5. These 16 evaluation questions were provided by UNICEF Cambodia in the
ToR. Evaluation questions 10 to 14 (in green below) are on scaling up the Generation Future programme.
Evaluation questions 15 and 16 (in yellow below) are on gender equality, equity and human rights.

Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
3.4 Scope
The evaluation focuses on the 2022 version of the programme. However, it also reviewed and understood
what happened in the 2021 version (programme pilot) in order to better understand the changes and
modifications that took place in the second version of the programme. A small number of programme activities
continued into January 2023 when the data collection of this evaluation was taking place. The evaluation uses
31 January 2023 as a cut-off date when evaluating the programme; any activities beyond the cut-off date were
not evaluated.
All programme components (as listed in Table 2) were assessed. The geographical scope of this evaluation is
national, with a focus on the locations of the 28 mentees’ project implementation (15 from 2022 cohort as the
primary focus and the 13 from 2021 pilot as a secondary focus). Siem Reap Province was given special
attention in this evaluation, as it was where the school implementation component of the programme took
place. The implementation area covered all six districts of the province including both urban and rural areas.
Figure 2 shows the locations of the 18 schools (colour pinned) wherein the component was implemented.
Figure 2 Locations of schools wherein the school implementation component of the programme was implemented
The evaluation includes the impact criterion. However, only early impacts were captured at the time of the
evaluation because the programme started only in mid-2021. The potential impact was explored through
considering whether the pathways for change were valid (see contribution analysis in the Section 4.1).

Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
4. Methodology
This chapter delineates the methodology of the evaluation. It provides information on data collection and
analysis methods, methodological limitations, challenges and mitigation, and ethical considerations.
4.1 Overview
This is a utilisation-focused evaluation. It was planned, designed and implemented in a way that aimed to
maximise the utilisation of the findings and the process of the evaluation to inform decisions and improve
performance. The evaluation engaged with the key intended users of the evaluation (listed at the end of
Section 3.1) to ensure a sense of ownership among them; it also strives to meet the users’ practical needs for
making judgement and decisions.
The evaluation adopts a non-experimental, mixed methods research design (as proposed in the ToR),
which uses both qualitative and quantitative data. This approach combines the two kinds of data to balance
out the limitations of each of the data type; it also ensures that the two types of data are well integrated to
evaluate the project meaningfully and to provide stronger evidence and more confidence in the evaluation’s
findings.
It is nevertheless important to note that the programme has relatively little quantitative monitoring data.
Considering this limitation, the consultant spent a significant amount of time in Cambodia (4 weeks) speaking
with and collecting quality qualitative data from programme participants. He also made use of pre-interview
digital surveys with mentees to help inform the interviews and to some extent collect quantitative data; he
used the surveys to, primarily, compare to the self-assessment data collected for the 2021 pilot and to,
secondarily, help the core programme team to set indicators (e.g., percentage of participants agreeing that
they improved certain skills in participating in the programme) for any future iterations of the programme.
This evaluation uses contribution analysis, which is an approach for inferring the degree to which
programme activities have contributed to the perceived outcomes. The theory of change of the programme
(reconstructed and shown in Figure 1) is the foundation of the contribution analysis. The articulation of a
theory of change and subsequent assessment of the perceived relationships between the various linkages
and the validity of the assumptions can be used to generate a plausible argument for programme contribution.
The conclusion of a contribution analysis is not necessarily a definitive proof, rather it provides evidence of a
line of reasoning that the programme has contributed to its observed results.
The evaluation also adopts a participatory approach in all its stages. Mentees of the 2022 programme were
engaged in the inception phase in an informal online meeting to learn about the evaluation; the meeting was
then followed by a digital form to collect data collection suggestions from them. These suggestions were
considered carefully during the development of the data collection tools; for example, the evaluation plan
allocated more of the in-country visit time to conducting focus group discussions with youth volunteers, as
mentees pointed out that the volunteers were essential to implementing the projects. The consultant also
presented in February 2023 the initial findings of this evaluation in a session designed specifically for the
mentees to ensure that they were informed and that they had the opportunity to respond to the initial findings.
Following this approach, a reference group was formed with the support of UNICEF Cambodia. This setup
facilitated the participation of mentees and select UNICEF Cambodia staff. The consultant gave presentations
on the inception report and initial findings (immediately following the data collection) as well as on the final
findings and recommendations. These presentation sessions have helped the consultant validate the data
collection plan and the findings. Participants were encouraged to ask questions, express their opinions as well
as give feedback and suggestions.

Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
With assistance provided by UNICEF Cambodia, primary data (see Table 7) were collected in January and
February 2023 in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap Province and online.
Three data collection instruments – feedback forms (surveys), focus group discussions (FGDs), key
informant interviews (KIIs, or interviews) – were used. Guides developed for all focus group discussion
and key informant interviews are given in annexes B to L; these guides were written using the evaluation
matrix (see Annex A), amongst other key documents, as a foundation.

33 One mentee in the 2022 cohort removed himself from communication with UNICEF and associated partners. The
evaluation therefore could not reach to the mentee.
34 The actual number of volunteers participated in the FGDs was lower than what was expected in the inception phase.
This is because some projects had fewer than 3 volunteers (this piece of information was unavailable to the evaluation
team in the inception phase and the first half of the data collection period). Furthermore, 5 nominated volunteers either
declined the evaluation team’s invitation or made last-minute cancellation.

The consultant worked with the core programme team to recruit individuals to participate in the evaluation
activities. The consultant sent invitations directly to the selected individuals so that they understood the
evaluation was being conducted by someone independent of UNICEF Cambodia. For the LLS schools, the
communication was initiated by the UNICEF Cambodia Siem Reap Office. Participation in all evaluation data
collection activities was voluntary.
The KIIs with mentees and FGDs with volunteers were conducted in two venues. First is a secondary school
in southeast Phnom Penh wherein six of the mentees in the 2022 cohort studied. Second is a coffee shop in
the building in central Phnom Penh where the UNICEF Cambodia office is located. The selection of these
venues ensured the safety of the participants and avoided giving the impression that the evaluation was
conducted by UNICEF Cambodia.
Regarding the language use for FGDs and KIIs, please refer to the notes in Table 7. All Khmer language
support was provided by the consultant’s assistant, a native Khmer speaker. Relevant data collection tools
and consent forms were translated into Khmer.
All but two KIIs and FGDs were audio-recorded. The recordings were used by the consultant to develop this
report and other deliverables. All recordings were held only by the evaluation team and were not shared with
UNICEF Cambodia and other stakeholders. This is to ensure confidentiality of the respondents. Also, the
consultant did not and will not use the recordings directly in any deliverables. Summaries were prepared by
either the consultant or his assistant for each KII and FGD conducted. These summaries are held only by the
evaluation team and will not be shared.
Piloting of data collection tools with mentees and volunteers took place in the week commencing with 23
January 2023. That with LLS school students took place in the week after. The evaluation team used the
feedback to refine the tools; there were no significant changes needed.
4.4 Sampling
All the 15 mentees of the 2022 cohort were invited to interviews, given that they were heavily involved in the
programme and that the number of mentees is relatively small. One mentee was unreachable. As for the 13
mentees in the 2021 cohort, the consultant worked with the core programme team to select 5 for the
interviews; 2 of them were mentees who chose not to continue their projects after the close of the programme
pilot.
Selection of mentors for interviews was guided by the mentors’ responses to the feedback form (online
surveys). Seven (7) out of 15 were invited according to the plan. At least 2 mentors, whose relationships with
19
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
mentees were deemed (by the mentors themselves) more challenging to maintain, were selected to give a
more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the implementation of the programme. The selection also
sought a balance between Khmer (n=3) and non-Khmer mentors (n=4).
Table 8 provides details on the sampling for focus group discussions with youth volunteers and LLS school
students.

Sample size: Sample size:
- Number of focus groups: 8 - Number of focus groups: 10
- Number of participants in total: 24 - Number of participants in total: 60
The sampling considered two categories – namely gender and urban/rural locations – as they could have an
influence on the implementation and results of programme activities. The sample sizes were decided with the
length of the in-country visit considered; they were maximised to ensure that the evaluation team met as many
young people as it could.
The evaluation allocated more time and resources to meeting with youth volunteers (with more than half of all
volunteers included) because they had more active and direct involvement in the project compared to the LLS
school students. Regarding the selection of LLS schools, the evaluation covered all the 6 projects that went
into schools to work with students.
The youth volunteers participated in the FGDs were nominated by the mentees who worked with them in
social impact projects. Whilst the mentees were encouraged to nominate volunteers of a diverse backgrounds,
the evaluation team did not have control over who were nominated. This was because the mentees kept a
record of who their volunteers were, with their gender and disabilities recorded. Volunteers’ race/ethnicity was
not recorded while their disabilities were not provided to the evaluation team35; they thus were not used as
categories to select participants for this evaluation.
As for the LLS schools, 6 mentees and 6 volunteers went to 18 of them in Siem Reap Province. Each of the
mentee-volunteer pair went to 3 schools. The evaluation team chose 1 school from the 3 that had the same
mentee-volunteer pair going in. A total of 5 schools were chosen in this way, 2 FGDs with students and 1
interview with a teacher were conducted in each of them. In choosing these schools, the evaluation team
achieved a balance of schools that were visited as the first, second and last by the mentees; this was needed
because the core programme team observed that mentees were less effective in delivering activities in the
first schools that they went to. The remaining 2 of the 7 schools chosen were primary schools; their students
were considered too young to participate in FGDs – only teachers were interviewed.
4.5 Evaluation Matrix
35 Disability disaggregated data of ‘participants’ was also not available to the evaluator. Such data was considered by the
core programme team as too challenging to obtain due to the lack of data obtained at youth-led events (with no formal
registration possible) and school student data limited to those with ‘visible’ disabilities. ‘
20
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
The evaluation matrix is an analytical framework that guides the evaluation. It used the 16 evaluation
questions (EQ) as a foundation. Evaluation indicators were developed for the evaluation questions (except for
EQs 10-14 on scaling up36); they provided a more granular understanding of the questions. The evaluation
questions and indicators were then mapped against data collection tools to guide the tool development
process in the inception phase (phase 1) and the writing of this report (phase 3). Please see Annex A for the
evaluation matrix.
4.6 Data Analysis Methods
The data analysis relied on thematic analysis for highlighting key themes identified in the documents and
data and connect them to the relevant points in the evaluation matrix. A thematic analysis focuses on the
search and generation of themes from the dataset; these are then clustered into categories and emergent
themes from each category for further analysis and re-categorisation to identify key patterns.
In analysing and organising the primary qualitative data, the evaluation used an iterative process. It was
used to identify key thought units related to each evaluation question from both the FGDs and the KIIs,
organising these thought units into clusters and identifying the key themes within each cluster. These themes
and the ones emerged from the thematic analysis, however, did not contradict the higher-level themes
determined by the evaluation questions and framework.
The evaluation also used the method of narrative analysis in making sense of the qualitative data collected,
particularly those from adolescents, young people and children. A narrative analysis refers to a family of
approaches for interpreting diverse texts, which have in common a storied form. In practice, this method
seeks to understand human experience and social phenomena through the particularity and context of stories.
Evidence for conclusions was built via triangulation analysis, a method used to mitigate biases. Themes or
patterns were examined to determine if they were coming from multiple stakeholder levels and multiple
stakeholder categories. Observations or comments that only came from a single source or a single category
of stakeholder were given less weight during the building of the analysis. Findings highlighted in this report
emerged from multiple actors and across multiple stakeholder categories.
The data collected and evidence generated in the analysis process were used to logically develop
recommendations for UNICEF Cambodia. The consultant worked to ensure that the recommendations made
in the final report would be useful to primary intended users and that realistic descriptions of how they can be
made operational in the context of Cambodia were given. Actions for target groups are included. The
programme lead was consulted in the development of the recommendations. The recommendation validation
process is described in Chapter 7.
4.7 Limitations
This evaluation relied heavily on UNICEF Cambodia and its implementing partner for monitoring data. Whilst
the consultant used primary data and findings of document review to triangulate such monitoring data, there
was very limited time to verify all monitoring data. Therefore, one limitation of this study is that it assumed the
validity of monitoring data.
As mentioned in Section 4.1, the programme has very limited quantitative data. Also, there is no pre-activity
baseline data (e.g., self-assessment on skills to be developed) for the 2022 programme. This limited the
possibility of drawing direct comparisons between different time points (e.g., the beginning and end of pilot as
well as the beginning of the 2022 programme) using quantitative data. That said, the use of the feedback form
36 This is because these evaluation questions (EQ) are worded differently (these questions were provided in the ToR).
First, some of these questions (e.g., EQ 10) are already very specific and thus do not require a further breakdown. Second,
all these questions are very much forward-looking, and the answers to them requires a higher level of analysis of the
findings to other evaluation questions. For example, EQ 13 asks what lessons can be drawn from the use of the scale-up
strategies; the response to this must be informed by the findings of multiple other EQs. Another example is EQ 12 on how
effective the stakeholders played their role and what better ways could the stakeholders contribute to the programme; this
question, again, requires a higher level of analysis using the findings for multiple other EQs.

produced a small amount of quantitative data that are comparable to that produced in the evaluation of the
2021 pilot, and these could potentially be used for future comparisons and other monitoring purposes. The
consultant also quantified some qualitative data collected in focus group discussions.

4.9 Ethical Considerations
The evaluation is conducted in full accordance with the following international guidelines for research ethics,
as well as personal data protection, health and safety precaution and protocols for reporting abuses:
UNICEF’s revised Evaluation Policy (2018)37, the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and
Standards for Evaluation (2016)38, UNEG Guidance on Integrating Human Rights and Gender Equality in
Evaluation (2014)39, UN-SWAP Evaluation Performance Indicator, UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation
(2021)40, UNICEF Procedure on Ethical Standards and Research, Evaluation and Data Collection and
Analysis (2021)41, UNICEF-Adapted UNEG Evaluation Report Standards (2017)42, and UNICEF’s Policy on
Personal Data Protection (2020)43.
The evaluator, Dr Alvin Leung, and his assistant, Kimputhvitheavy Vonn, are independent of UNICEF
Cambodia. They are impartial and have no conflict of interest. Dr Leung is accountable for the evaluation.
Ethical review was conducted by an external team at the Health Media Lab, considering that the evaluation
involved children as participants. The ethnical review team was shared a copy of the inception report including
its annexes which contained the data collection tools used (annexes B, C, D and E are for data collection that
involves children). An approval was obtained on 7 January 2023; a copy of the ethical approval is attached to
this report (Annex O) for reference.
The evaluation team adhered to the principles below to ensure that ethical concerns were taken into
consideration to avoid stigma, discrimination, any form of harm to children and adolescents, protection of
confidentiality, protection of rights, ensuring the dignity and welfare of all respondents.
1. Do no harm
o The data collection exercise of this evaluation did not expose anyone, particularly adolescents and
children, to additional risks through the evaluation team’s actions. No sensitive issues (e.g., gender-
based violence) were mentioned in data collection activities.
2. Protection of rights of children, adolescents and youth
o The consultant and his assistant sought explicit verbal consent (see Annexes M1 to M5 for the
consent form) to participate in the data collection exercise from all participants of KIIs and FGDs,
including children, adolescents, youth and other stakeholders. They were informed of the purposes of
the data collection activities and of their rights to withdraw from the data collection anytime. The
verbal consent was audio-recorded in the cases of KIIs and FGDs.
o The feedback forms for mentees and mentors contained at the beginning a statement on the
purposes of data collection, data privacy and data protection. Participants were required to confirm
that they understood the statement and that they agreed to proceed before they can answer any
questions.
o For LLS school students, a separate consent form was sent to their teachers, who were asked to
return the forms before the start of data collection.

Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
o For mentees and volunteers under the age of 18, a consent form in Khmer was sent to their parents
or guardians to obtain their assent.
3. Ensure health and safety of children and adolescents
o Health and safety precaution measures were in place for in-person data collection. First, the venues
chosen for conducting KIIs and FGDs (i.e., a secondary school and a coffee shop in the same
building as UNICEF Cambodia – both in central Phnom Penh) were safe to access. No data collectors
were allowed to be in an enclosed room alone with the participants. Second, during the data collection
period, there was no COVID-19 restrictions in Cambodia, apart from that individuals with COVID-19
symptoms were asked to stay home. No participant reported such symptoms.
o It is mandatory for the evaluation team to report abuse of children. No such abuses were reported
during the data collection period.
o The consultant, Dr Alvin Leung, has more than 10 years of experience working with children and
adolescents in multiple countries. He is a qualified teacher and has taught in schools.
4. Improve welfare and wellbeing of children, young people and adolescents
o The design of the evaluation and its data collection tools had the rights, welfare and wellbeing of
children, adolescents and young people well considered. The evaluation team explained to children,
adolescents and youth at the beginning of data collection the objectives of speaking with them.
5. Preserve dignity of respondents
o The team treated all respondents as being of worth and in a way that was respectful to them as
valued individuals irrespective of differences such as gender, race, ethnicity and religious background.
o The team complied with codes for vulnerable groups. The team was aware that groups and/or
individuals, who, by virtue of their capacities, demographics, personal identification or affiliation,
opinions, beliefs or circumstances may have less agency or may be at greater risk of harm within their
current context. The team followed the guidelines named at the beginning of this chapter to ensure
the safeguarding of these groups.
6. Fair representation
o The evaluation team was committed to capturing the voices of participants with due considerations to
respect for persons, justice, nonmaleficence and beneficence, as well as to representing the
participants and their experiences ethically in as true a form as possible in the evaluation report and
other deliverables of the evaluation.
7. Data protection and privacy, and anonymity
o All interviews with mentees and mentors as well as focus group discussion (FGD) data (from youth
volunteers and LLS school students) were anonymised. Codes rather than names were used in
summaries for additional protection. None of the participants are identifiable.
o This evaluation report and other deliverables produced summarise the views and opinions of
respondents without connecting them to specific individuals and without using names. This intends to
make it as difficult as possible for anyone to determine the identities of these individuals.
o All data collected in the evaluation activities are stored on password-protected devices that can only
be accessed by the evaluation team. Online forms are stored in password-protected Google online
storage that can only be accessed by the evaluation team. All data were then transferred to
password-protected Microsoft cloud storage that can only be accessed by the evaluation team. All
raw data held by the evaluation team will be destroyed within 3 months after the completion of the
evaluation. UNICEF Cambodia will not be given access to any of the raw data of interviews and FGDs
to ensure confidentiality and to avoid the team from finding out who informed the team of what.
o Some interview data (i.e., those collected from adults except for mentors) are not anonymised. This is
because their identities are already known to UNICEF Cambodia. These interviewees were notified of
this arrangement before the formal start of the interview.
o The data collected in FGDs and interviews were only used to evaluate the Generation Future
programme, including the production of the evaluation report and other deliverables stated in the
terms of reference of the evaluation. They will not be used for any other purposes.
o UNICEF Cambodia is the sole data controller after the evaluation is completed. It means that UNICEF
Cambodia decides how to use the data shared with them (e.g., anonymised and aggregated survey
results) and is responsible for looking after the data according to UNICEF’s most up-to-date data
protection protocol44 once the evaluation is completed.

5. Findings
This chapter presents the evaluation findings. The findings are guided by the 16 evaluation questions
provided in the Terms of Reference of the evaluation. The findings are grouped by the six OECD DAC criteria
(Sections 5.1 to 5.6). Findings on gender equality, equity and human rights are provided separately in Section
5.7. The evaluation matrix (see Annex A) was used in the writing of the findings to ensure that the findings are
comprehensive.
The programme’s achievement of outputs has been provided in Table 1 in Section 2.2.2 on page 26 of this
report.
5.1 Relevance45
5.1.1 National Policies
The programme has been relevant and responsive to the national policies on education and youth
development, the most important of which are the Education Strategic Plan (ESP) and the National Policy on
Youth Development. There are four areas in which the programme responds well to the national policies. First,
the learning of life skills and the 21st Century Skills (ESP strategy 1.3). The programme provided mentees
and volunteers opportunities to improve – and use in real-world situations – life skills and 21st Century Skills.
All responding mentees and volunteers agreed that they improved these skills and that the skills were relevant
to their study, work and/or daily lives.
Second, the use of inquiry-based learning and student-centric approach in classrooms (ESP strategy 2.1).
Six mentees and their volunteers went to 18 schools in all the 6 districts of Siem Reap Province to conduct
interactive activities with 898 school students. The activities were given as a part of the LLS syllabus.
Students were asked to conduct simple research, have discussions and give presentations. Although the
activities were relatively short (0.5 days), its success showcased that these pedagogies could work in rural
settings. MoEYS officials went to some schools during the activities and were encouraged by the results; they
said in interviews that the activities were engaging and went well with the LLS syllabus. Teachers also agreed
that the activities were relevant to their students.
Third, the provision of career counselling and guidance for secondary school students (ESP strategy 2.2).
Multiple youth-led projects of the programme used innovative ways to provide career counselling and
guidance. For example, a project used workshops to help students identify their career interests. Two projects
in 2022 encouraged female students to enter the STEM fields. These projects were responsive to the ESP in
that they provided career guidance while at the same time tackled gender stereotypes that contributed to
gendered jobs (e.g., jobs in STEM were for men).
Fourth, the promotion of youth participation. The programme developed young people’s capacity to
participate in civic decisions and enabled them to use digital tools to voice their opinions and amplify their
influence; the digital platforms also connected young people who shared interests in addressing the same
social issues. These mechanisms, which build an enabling environment for youth participation, respond well
to the strategy 5.6 of the National Policy on Youth Development. Also, the promotion of volunteerism, which is
central to the programme, is well aligned with the strategy 5.10 of the National Policy of Youth Development.
While the programme is relevant to the national policies, its concept note did not mention explicitly these
policies and related strategies. The consultant suggests that the core programme team include a section on
policy and operational context analysis in programme documents and/or concept note, as this should guide
any upcoming institutionalisation efforts.
45 According to the terms of reference, the following evaluation questions are under the OECD DAC evaluation criterion of
relevance: 1, 2 and 13.

Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
5.1.2 Needs of Adolescents, Youth and Other Stakeholders
The programme’s focus on skills development, particularly those of the 21st Century skills, was aptly
chosen. As pointed out in Section 2.1, multiple studies in Cambodia concluded that young people were not
equipped with the skills that employers desired primarily because the formal education system did not provide
enough opportunities for young people to develop these skills. This programme addressed this by providing
opportunities to mentees and volunteers to develop 21st Century Skills not only through training but also
through working on projects.
All young people participated in the evaluation agreed that the skills developed (as well as confidence
gained and professional networks expanded) were what they needed and would be helpful in their
study, work and/or daily lives. This can be attributed to the consultative process that the programme used
at the beginning to better understand mentees’ needs regarding skills development. The team then used the
findings to arrange training sessions on the skills mentioned by the mentees. The team also provided on-
demand support to projects to ensure that relevant support was given to help young people implement their
projects.
The youth-led, bottom-up approach used in the programme has proven strong in ensuring relevance.
The approach emphasised the importance of working with young people for young people. All the 28 projects
(13 in 2021 and 15 in 2022) were led by mentees who had the autonomy to design and implement their
projects. Mentees expressed in the evaluation’s interviews strong interests in addressing the social issues
chosen by them.
Most social issues chosen by the mentees were relevant to the Cambodian youth. The projects’
relevance can be seen in their huge number of followers (27,000+) on multiple social media platforms. A
project that used blogs and podcasts to share stories of how young leaders and entrepreneurs overcome
difficulties, for example, had close to 20,000 followers/subscribers on its pages on social media platforms
(with the number of views even larger). It can be established that the messages of these projects resonated
with young people in the country. Three mentee-led projects in 2022 (i.e., Ladies in Tech, Engineering for
Girls, Girls Kick) had an explicit focus on gender equality issues that were very relevant to the context; for
instance, two projects encouraged and inspired female students to pursue careers in the STEM fields, which
were male-dominant in Cambodia and in demand of workers.
Some of the youth-led projects were nonetheless relatively less relevant to the needs of the most
marginalised and disadvantaged adolescents and youth in the country. One example is the project on
encouraging young people to pursue careers in the IT industry; the mentee and volunteers of the project went
to schools in Siem Reap to conduct activities, which, in the consultant’s opinion, were only tangentially
relatable to the students. This gap was somewhat a manifestation of the urban-rural divide in the country,
given that most mentees and volunteers were based in Phnom Penh, the capital city.
The extensive use of online communication channels also increased the programme’s relevance. With
the increasing popularity of smartphones and improving Internet penetration in the country, the projects’
messages and online campaigns could effectively reach many young people. Equally importantly, the
interactive nature of these platforms (e.g., Facebook) allowed the mentees, volunteers and the core
programme team to better understand the needs of adolescents, youth and children. According to the
UNICEF Cambodia staff members interviewed, the programme’s experience also helped the organisation
improve its capabilities for developing engaging content to connect with young people. Furthermore, it helped
the organisation discover new channels and modalities in communicating with young people.
5.1.3 Other Stakeholders’ Needs
The programme was largely relevant to the private sector contributors and the mentors, most of which
came from the private sector and some from the development sector and the government.
Regarding the programme’s relevance to the private sector contributors, representatives interviewed opined
that, by providing training sessions, they contributed towards fulfilling corporate social responsibilities
(CSR). However, there remained a gap between what the contributors wanted and what the programme
could offer. A few mentors mentioned that the representatives of the private sector would like to have ‘good
27
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
publicity’ from participating in the programme; this nonetheless was limited by the (reasonably drafted)
UNICEF guidelines on private sector engagement, which associated the level of publicity allowed with the
amount of donation made. Also, there was no end-of-project report on impact produced for mentors’ and
private sector contributors’ use in reporting to their companies. This gap posed a challenge for the programme
to stay relevant to the private sector.
In the case of mentors, the matching between them and the mentees ensured that most mentors could
work on relevant projects with enthusiastic young people with similar interests. To mentors in more senior
positions, they appreciated the opportunities to ‘give back to the society’; younger mentors, in addition,
appreciated the usefulness of the experience in advancing their careers. A small number of mentors were
running businesses that could collaborate with mentees’ projects. All the above contributed to the relevance of
the programme to mentors.
5.2 Coherence46
5.2.1 Internal coherence
The programme is consistent with other interventions and activities of UNICEF Cambodia; it is aligned
with UNICEF’s mission goals and principles of communication and youth empowerment. The
programme is currently under the Communication Section, and it has linkages with the Education Section,
Child Protection Section and the ADAP strategy. These cross-section linkages were in general productive.
They, on the one hand, gave the programme the support that it needed to achieve its outputs and outcomes
and, on the other, allowed the programme to contribute to the activities of other sections.
The linkages with the ADAP cross-sectoral strategy were most productive, for the two were well
aligned and their activities harmonised. The programme built young people’s capacity to address social
issues, empowered young people through establishing an enabling environment, and prepared them to
meaningfully participate in civic decision and policy making – these results contributed to the ADAP’s work. In
addition, the programme’s school implementation component in school that use Local Life Skills (LLS)
syllabus (under the ADAP, which was managed by the Child Protection Section) enriched the students
learning experience and development of the 21st Century Skills in select schools. (It is nonetheless worth
noting that the ADAP had only 1 dedicated staff member in 2022 and had very limited capacity.)
Apart from providing support for the ADAP (and the associated LLS), the Child Protection Section also
provided the necessary technical support on managing the implementing partner, CRC-Cambodia/AYRG. The
partnership with CRC-Cambodia/AYRG was designed with good intention: the programme intended to offer
AYRG members the opportunities to work on youth-led projects while AYRG could offer potential connections
to expand the reach of these projects. Nevertheless, the execution was cumbersome and, as a result, the
partnership was never realised and the intended results of the partnership not achieved (see Section 5.4).
The linkage with the Education Section was constructive, but the contribution was on a small scale.
The experience of implementing issue-based learning contributed to the Education Section’s aim to provide
quality education through showcasing to teachers and officials of the MoEYS how issue- and inquiry-based
learning could take place in rural schools. Some youth-led projects on promoting STEM education for girls and
on development of digital skills were also relevant to the work of the Education Section. Such contribution was,
however, small in scale because, first, the school implementation reached only 18 schools with each given
half-day activities and, second, the Education Section focuses more on early childhood and basic education
as well as ministerial and leadership capacity building.
The programme’s positioning (under the Communication Section) was functional, but it could no
longer fully support the programme. The current positioning is a legacy of the programme’s start as a
communication and outreach campaign partly to contribute towards the World Children’s Day 2021. The
programme has evolved in the last two years, especially with the addition of the school implementation
46 According to the terms of reference, the following evaluation questions are under the OECD DAC evaluation criterion of
coherence: 2, 4 and 13.
28
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
component and the integration with the ADAP. Its positioning within UNICEF Cambodia therefore needs to
change.
There is a consensus among UNICEF staff interviewed that it should be taken out of the
Communication Section and become a cross-section programme. Two possible options emerged in the
discussions. The first is that the programme sits with the Deputy Representative’s Office (or the
Representative’s Office) with one section acting as the secretariat; this is the preferred option of the senior
management of the country office. The second is that it sits parallel or as part of the ADAP, considering its
focus on adolescent development and participation as well as its deepening linkages with the LLS. Staff
interviewed agreed that both options will strengthen the cross-sectional nature of the programme and allow
the programme to continue to contribute to multiple sections.
5.2.2 External coherence
Cambodia has a burgeoning innovation ecosystem, and there is an increasing number of programmes
providing support to social enterprise start-ups and promoting entrepreneurship – mainly run by universities
and development partners47 48. This programme does not overlap with them, as it had a unique focus on
online campaigning and was strategically designed to focus on promoting youth’s skills development
and facilitating youth participation. This vision nonetheless was not well communicated in publication and
to all mentors, 2 of the 7 mentors interviewed, rather, saw the programme more as a start-up support
programme. This was unexpected in the core programme team’s perspective.
The programme’s Phnom Penh-centric positioning could have been improved to provide valuable
experiences to young people in provinces where similar opportunities were very limited. Although the
application was open to youth in the whole country and despite the fact that all personal information (including
that on applicants’ residence) was redacted in the selection process, all but one selected mentees (and most
volunteers) in 2022 were based in Phnom Penh. This unexpected outcome of mentee selection severely
limited the programme’s abilities in reaching young people outside Phnom Penh who had few similar
opportunities. In other words, the programme’s external coherence with other similar programmes was
unintentionally compromised. Although one may argue that the programme’s focus on online campaigns could
help mentees’ projects reach other parts of Cambodia, this cannot be assessed because the engagement
data were not geo-tagged.
The necessary linkages with the private sector were in place and contributed to the achievement of
programme outputs and outcomes. The programme engaged the private sector by inviting employees and
senior executives of private companies (e.g., Hyundai, American Chamber of Commerce) to be mentors. It
also invited private sector company’s representatives (e.g., Facebook, KPMG, Smart) to give training sessions
to young people. These linkages benefited the participating adolescents and youth directly as well as helped
UNICEF Cambodia build new relationships with the private sector and provided them with an entry point to
collaborate with UNICEF (as agreed by some UNICEF Cambodia staff members interviewed). These kinds of
collaboration aligned well with the government’s policies on ensuring that young people are equipped with
skills needed in the labour market.
The programme also established linkages between mentees and other partners on the youth-led
project level. Many of these linkages were initiated by mentors for mentees and volunteers, while some were
established by the mentees themselves. These partners included the print and digital media, small and
medium size enterprises (SMEs) of the private sector, environmental groups and universities. Some of the
partners, such as cyclo drivers and art groups, were badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the
projects provided them with timely support.

This section reports on whether and how the programme has achieved its objectives and outcomes. It first
reports the findings by components (see Table 2 on p.7 for a list of programme components), with the
contribution of the components to achieving the objectives and outcomes explained and supported by
evidence and data. Some smaller and closely associated components are combined. The section then reports
the overall effectiveness, organised by outcomes, with effectiveness of all the components considered
holistically.
5.3.1 Mentorship
The selection and matching of the mentors were outstanding and considered by both mentors and
mentees as effective in implementing the youth-led projects. The core programme team identified
mentors and matched them with mentees only after the selection of mentees was finalised; this ensured the
quality of the matching. More than half of the mentors in 2022 were from the private sector (with the remaining
from the government, development sector and the academia), and it appeared that the relationships built
increased UNICEF Cambodia’s presence in the private sector.
Most mentees interviewed thought highly of their mentors who, in their opinion, provided them with
technical expertise, professional network, inspiration and emotional support needed not only to
implement their social impact projects but also to develop themselves personally and professionally. Mentors
introduced to mentees the people whom they worked with and they knew professionally, expanding mentees’
professional networks. Some of these people introduced even provided additional funding to individual
projects. This funding was often in the form of small sponsorship arrangements between businesses and the
mentees and was therefore managed by them directly. Also, mentees said that their mentors provided
guidance by means of asking facilitating and constructive questions and that some helped them sharpen skills
needed for project results (e.g., how to communicate with difference audiences, how to approach funders). At
least 11 out of the 15 mentors in the 2022 cohort also used their presence on social media platforms to
amplify the influence and expand the reach of the youth-led projects. At least wo mentors even offered
mentees their business facilities (e.g., studios) for use in implementing the project.
Eleven of the 12 mentors responded were delighted to have taken part in the programme and described
the experience as ‘rewarding’, ‘warm’ and ‘joyful’. Most valued the opportunities to work with the young people
and see them grow. According to mentor interview data, the programme was able to provide positive
mentoring experiences, and this contributed to maintaining long-lasting mentor-mentee relationships (output 2)
and ensured that it could continue to attract experts and key individuals to become mentors.
Some mentor-mentee relationships were relatively loose, with fewer than 4 meetings over the 6-month
implementation period – significantly fewer than what the programme expected (one one-hour meeting per
week). The following factors contributed to the looser relationships: (a) an overreliance on online meetings,
which were not conducive to building rapport; (b) physical distance, which limited the possibility of meeting in
person; (c) language barriers, as some
mentors were not Khmer speakers and some
mentees not proficient in English; and (d)
time availability on both sides. The infrequent
meetings did not appear to have impeded the
implementation of the projects or the skills
development of the mentees. Also, it did not
appear that the frequency of the meetings
indicated the health of the relationships
(because most mentees involved still felt that
their relationships with mentors were good,
only 2 out of 19 interviewed said the
relationships were ‘not good’). Although the

to give mentors and mentees in the future a more realistic expectation base on this finding.
5.3.2 Skills development for mentees and volunteers
The programme was highly effective in improving young people’s 21st Century skills. All mentees in
the 2022 cohort interviewed agreed that, in participating in the programme, they improved a range of
the Skills. Figure 3 shows the extent to which the mentees (n=14) agreed that they improved the skills
(extracted by the evaluation team from the handbook for the mentees).
The skills-based training organised by the programme was seen by the mentees as useful for implementing
their projects (see Figure 4). The training sessions delivered by the private sector contributors were
considered relatively less useful because (a) some sessions were didactic according to the mentees; (b) some
projects did not have corresponding components (e.g., branding); (c) a couple of sessions were delivered late
due to trainers’ limited availability (e.g., the session on pitching was given only after the WCD event wherein
potential funders and government officials approached mentees, some of which were not prepared to respond
to such enquiries and give ‘pitches’).
31
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
As for volunteers, they also reported an improvement of skills in participating in the programme. As
shown in Figure 5, a majority of responding volunteers (n=24) said that they improved teamwork and problem-
solving skills. However, volunteers believed that, like mentees, they should be introduced to mentors and
have the access to training sessions including the bootcamp. The core programme team recorded some
training sessions and made them available online to respond to this request. The bootcamp was limited to
mentees and one volunteer per project partly because of considerations over costs, according to the
programme lead.
All responding mentees and volunteers said that the skills improved were and would be useful in their
study, work and/or daily lives. Mentees who planned to continue their projects added that these skills
would be crucial in the continuation. Some mentees had prior experience of running similar projects; the
improvement in skills for them was generally less significant. An exception in this regard was budget planning
primarily because the amount of seed fund given (up to USD 2,000) was larger than that in similar
programmes run by other organisations (often under USD 1,000 in the evaluator’s understanding; the VMC, a
government initiative, offered USD ‘00 to 'winning teams’, for comparison).
5.3.3 Volunteer recruitment and online supporter engagement
The 15 social impact projects in 2022 had a total of 128 volunteers (73 females and 55 males; 38 under the
age of 18 and the remaining aged between 18-25), exceeding the target of 110. The number of volunteers in
each project varies from 1 to 32 (median: 9). Volunteers provided vital support to the mentees leading the
project.
The inclusion of volunteers as a target group in the programme design effectively expanded the reach
to more young people. This addressed the limiting factor of the programme: the number of mentors and
mentees that it could support given the resource allocated. This arrangement sought to ensure that mentors
and mentees could develop close relationships (by not overburdening mentors) while mentees were given the
support needed to implement their projects.
The recruitment of volunteers nonetheless did not produce the intended results, even though the
target of 110 volunteers was met. The programme planned to recruit volunteers from the Adolescent and
Youth Reference Group (managed by the implementing partner, CRC-Cambodia), a group of 400+ young
people from 10 provinces and Phnom Penh, many of them from marginalised and disadvantaged communities.
The recruitment efforts were unsuccessful, with fewer than 3 members becoming volunteers. Most volunteers
were indeed friends and classmates of mentees and some worked together on previous projects50. This had
50 This was an estimate as the programme did not record whether volunteers were ‘new’. There was also no record of
whether AYRG members have become volunteers; the evaluation team learnt from interviews with mentees that one
project had 3 AYRG members signed up but they then became uncontactable.
32
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
the unexpected negative effect of limiting the scope and reach of the programme, particularly to those who
were from marginalised and disadvantaged backgrounds and/or lived outside Phnom Penh.
Multiple factors contributed to the ineffective volunteer recruitment: (a) the online recruitment session co-
organised with the CRC-Cambodia for the AYRG was deemed by the mentees unengaging; (b) some
mentees used English in their presentations in the session while most AYRG members were not sufficiently
proficient in English; (c) the one-time recruitment session was at the beginning of the projects when some
mentees were unsure what help they would need from volunteers; (d) the CRC-Cambodia did not follow up
with the volunteer recruitment even though its staff was aware of the lack of engagement; (e) according to
mentees, there was not enough training and support for them on volunteer recruitment; and (f) according to
the CRC-Cambodia representatives, they were not sufficiently engaged in earlier stages of the programme.
Furthermore, the programme’s original plan of connecting with the Volunteer for My Community (VMC), a
government initiative supported by the Education Section of UNICEF Cambodia, was not implemented due
mainly to a lack of resource and dedicated support.
As for online supporters, the 15 social impact projects had a total of 27,820 ‘followers’ on social media
platforms, including Facebook (76%), YouTube (6%) and Telegram (6%), as of December 2022. This number
does not include those who only ‘shared’ projects or viewed online posts/uploads. The number of supporters
that each project had varied, from 0 to 18,682, with a median of 254; it is more than five times the target. It is
possible to infer that this larger number of followers contributed towards amplifying the influence of the
mentees and their projects as well as increasing brand visibility51 of the Generation Future, and to some
extent that of UNICEF Cambodia52, among young people in Cambodia.
The programme’s online engagement was effective in attracting a large number of followers, thanks to
a few factors: (a) the programme, being in the Communication Section, used the Section’s expertise in
creating online content for young people; (b) some posts of the social impact projects were highlighted on
UNICEF Cambodia’s webpage and social media platform; (c) a few mentors had extensive experience in
content creation and heavy social media presence, both of which helped mentees to engage young people
online; (d) many mentees were digital-savvy and some were working on other projects which helped bring in
followers; and (e) a few mentees’ projects were featured in newspapers and other traditional media.
Some youth-led projects had relatively fewer online supporters and engagement. A few of them prioritised
going into communities and invested less time in online content creation; another few set up their project
pages a bit too late in the process. Also, the original plan of using U-Report to engage more young people
online did not materialise owing to severe unexpected delays of the rollout of the platform.
5.3.4 School implementation
The school implementation component (wherein 6 of the 15 mentees and 6 volunteers went to 18 schools
in Siem Reap Province that used the Local Life Skills (LLS) syllabus to conduct activities as part of the
syllabus) was effective and successful.
These 18 schools are referred to as ‘LLS
schools’ in this report.
LLS school students were able to recall
what they had learnt in the activities 3
months after when the evaluation team visited
them. Some said that they shared the
knowledge learnt (e.g., that on nutrition and
environmental protection) with their families
and communities.
51 This exact extent of the brand visibility increased, however, cannot be decided scientifically in this evaluation, as it
would require a country-wide questionnaire akin to the ones used in Situation Analysis.
52 Mentees were not allowed to use the UNICEF branding in their projects – only that of Generation Future was permitted.

province 33
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
The students found the activities very engaging and were able to practise the 21st Century Skills
taught in the LLS syllabus. Although the activities were not extensive (0.5 days), most were designed by
mentees to be inquiry-based, so that the students had the chance to work in small groups. Some students
also gave presentations towards the end; they said in FGDs that the experience helped them gain confidence.
According to teachers in the LLS schools, this component of the programme and the LLS syllabus
complemented each other well in helping students develop the skills and increasing students’ interests in
social issues that impacted them. Many students said in FGDs that they would love to have more similar
activities.
Some students said that they were inspired by the mentees and volunteers and expressed willingness
to run similar projects locally. While the implementation of the LLS syllabus varied53, some LLS school
students had the experience of interviewing village leads and local government officials; for these students,
the mentees’ projects were particularly relatable and appeared to be more effective in encouraging students to
address social issues.
The component effectively created ‘buy-in’ from the MoEYS on the provincial and district levels, as
indicated by the MoEYS officials interviewed. They opined that the programme activities helped students learn
about social issues in an engaging way. The career guidance given through interactive activities (2 of the 6
projects were on career) was also appreciated by the officials, as such guidance was very limited in rural
areas. In relation to that, having guests visiting from outside the province was also considered advantageous,
as it could expand students’ horizon and inspire them. UNICEF Cambodia staff interviewed felt that this buy-in
could potentially generate more civic participation opportunities for school students.
Teachers found the activities engaging and relevant to the students’ needs. When asked how the
students benefited from the activities, most teachers mentioned a gain of knowledge of the social issues
discussed in the activities and a change in attitudes towards the issues; only a few of them actively mentioned
21st Century Skills development (while the evaluation can confirm that it took place).
In 2 of the 7 schools visited in this evaluation, teachers were not present in the classrooms during the
activities; this was a missed opportunity to allow for follow-up lessons given by teachers. Also, as the officials
pointed out, watching how activities were conducted could have helped those teachers develop themselves
professionally. Furthermore, the MoEYS officials pointed out that the mentees’ school visits were ‘one-off’ in
nature and that there was limited collaboration between the mentees and teachers in the schools involved.
They felt that closer collaboration between mentees and teachers and further integration of the programme
component into LLS would be beneficial to school students, mentees and volunteers.
Mentees and volunteers found their interaction with students memorable; most of them said these were
their proudest moments in the project. The activities also helped the mentees build a wider supporter base for
their projects and familiarise them with the local (and, in many cases, rural) contexts in the country. Some
mentees said that this helped them better understand the rural contexts and the challenges faced by the
children and adolescents living there.
The coordination of the school visits was effective, but the implementation plan had to be scaled back,
limiting the reach of the component. Due primarily to the very limited human and financial resources, the
programme team decided not to go to schools in Battambang Province as it was originally planned.
5.3.5 Campaigns and World Children’s Day event
With the support of the core programme team and the Communication Section, most mentees’ projects set up
online pages. UNICEF Cambodia also used its communication platforms to feature all mentees’ projects and
showcased young people’s successes. The pages had 27,000+ followers in total (demonstrating the
effectiveness of this component), and this support base allowed mentees to expand the reach of their
projects and allowed messaging to reach young people in Cambodia directly. In addition, the Generation
53 Whilst the implementation of the LLS syllabus was not in the scope of this presentation, the evaluation team collected
data on that to assess whether the two were implemented coherently. The implementation of the LLS syllabus varied
greatly in timing, duration and modalities (e.g., whether it is a separate subject, whether students need to write a report).
34
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
Future Facebook page (with 1,900+ followers as of December 2022, in addition to the aforementioned
27,000+), managed by the core programme team and a few former mentees, brought updated of various
projects to its followers.
The effectiveness of this component (i.e., campaigns) to mentees’ projects varied; it mainly depended
on the designs of the projects. It appeared to be more useful to projects that sought to raise awareness on
social issues (e.g., a project on reducing food waste and projects on encouraging girls choosing careers in
STEM) and those that focused on online content production (e.g., a project on producing podcasts on how
young people overcome difficulties in their lives) and online platform building (e.g., a project on providing
volunteering opportunities information).
In relation to this, several projects attracted the attention of the media. Reporters actively approached the
mentees, interviewed them and featured their projects in national newspapers and overseas publications,
further amplifying the influence of their projects.
The World Children’s Day celebration event was to some extent effective in increasing opportunities
for young people to contribute to civic decision making. This is mainly achieved by having influential
representatives from the government, private sector and development agencies attending the event. Mentees
and volunteers gave pitches/presentations on their projects to the audience; they also had booths where they
could explain to attendees their projects in details. Mentors and private sector contributors interviewed said
that they were impressed by the mentees. It is still early to tell whether such influence will translate into actual
opportunities to participate in civic participation, but it can be concluded in this evaluation that the event
provided a platform for young people to demonstrate their capabilities in making changes in their communities.
In addition, many mentees said that the experience of speaking in front of important members of the society
greatly increased their confidence. A few of them also said that the positive reception of their pitches assured
them that the project was worth pursuing even after the end of the cycle.
The core programme team observed that the event inadvertently distracted some mentees from implementing
their social impact projects as mentees needed to prepare for their presentations and ‘project booths’. This,
however, was not mentioned by mentees in the evaluation team’s interviews with them. The core programme
team also opined that the organisation of the event diverted its attention from providing support for mentees
towards the end of their projects.
5.3.6 Overall effectiveness
The programme was overall effective in achieving its three outcomes.
First, young people were sufficiently engaged in actively addressing social issues that impact them (outcome
1). Mentees were provided a high level of support from the core programme team as well as high quality
training from UNICEF, other development partner and private sector contributors on a wide range of topics.
The considerable amounts of seed fund to implement the project was also crucial; its use was diverse and
responded to the projects’ needs. The mentors chosen for the mentees and their projects were suitable and
highly relevant, and most mentor-mentee relationships were very productive. The technical expertise, seniority
and influence of the mentors were conducive to project implementation, ensuring that the social issues were
addressed and that the projects gained attention from young people in the country. Volunteers provided
crucial technical support to project implementation; they themselves also gained valuable skills and
experience that would be useful for them not only for study and work but also to potentially lead actions that
address social issues. The school implementation component and the online engagement very effectively
expanded the reach of the programme. It to some extent inspired the school students to participate in
addressing social issues more actively through their other learning activities in the LLS syllabus.
35
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
Second, the programme was somewhat effective in improving access to stable employment opportunities for
young people (outcome 2). The programme helped mentees gain confidence in creating positive change,
broadening professional networks and improving knowledge in project areas or themes (see Figure 6); these,
they believed, would be useful in furthering their study and findings jobs. Volunteers, although less involved
compared to mentees, also agreed in FGDs that the skills and confidence gained would help them in studying.
Since the skills gained were in demand in the labour market, it could be inferred that the programme
contributing to improving the access to employment through skills training. It is nonetheless worth noting that
this outcome was limited to mainly mentees and volunteers because: (a) the training was provided only to
them; and (b) the involvement from other target groups was not significant enough for the evaluation to
conclude that their access to employment was improved.
Additionally, some mentee-led projects appeared to have contributed to achieving this outcome. For instance,
the projects on encouraging young women to enter STEM fields, the project on promoting volunteerism
(somewhat as skills development opportunities as well), and the project on providing training on IT skills and
familiarising participants with jobs in the IT sector logically could contribute to outcome 2. However, the
participants of the projects were not contacted in this evaluation (as it focusses on the programme-level
effectiveness, not project-level), the consultant cannot give a conclusion in this regard. Also, as most mentees
were still in secondary schools and years away from entering the labour market, there were limitations in
assessing the results under outcome 2.
Third, the programme was effective in increasing opportunities for young people to contribute in civic decision
making (outcome 3). This was primarily achieved by: (a) enabling and supporting (including on skills
development) mentees and volunteers in running their projects (linked to outcome 1); (b) creating online
spaces for youth participation; (c) raising awareness of social issues among young people; and (d)
showcasing to stakeholders, including senior government officials and other influential members of society,
young people’s success in addressing social issues through online platforms and in events and subsequently
seeking to open more opportunities for youth participation.
5.4 Efficiency54
54 According to the terms of reference, the following evaluation questions are under the OECD DAC evaluation criterion of
efficiency: 3, 11 and 13.
36
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
5.4.1 Economic efficiency
The economic efficiency of the programme was high considering the large number of young people
reached (see Table 1 for outputs). The spending of this programme in 2022 was just under USD 160,000.
About half of that human resource costs, including the salaries of the programme lead and of a 0.5 FTE
United Nations Volunteer (UNV) as well as the payments for various contractors providing audio-video support.
About a quarter were seed funds for youth-led projects (up to USD 2,000 each). There is, however, no
comparable project in Cambodia for the evaluation to compare spendings with.
The programme spending was not significantly different from the original budget, except for the
agency fees for organising the World Children’s Day celebration event. The event costed about a quarter
(USD 48,000) of the total spending, even though it was not exclusively about the programme. This budgeting
was a result of the fact that the programme sat under the Communication Section. It is advisable to separate
the spending on the WCD event from that on the programme, regardless of the future positioning of the
programme within the organisation. A more sensible arrangement is that this programme contributes a
proportion (for example, 25% to 30%) of the costs to organising the WCD event.
The seed fund and mentoring together brought the most impact on young people in children in the
most cost-efficient manner. The USD 2,000 seed fund available for each of the 15 mentee-led projects
enabled the young people to implement the projects and amplify the influence through volunteers and online
supporters. It is nonetheless worth noting that such impact was only possible with the help of mentors (who
were not paid for in 2022) and mentees’ own time invested (who was not paid for, strictly speaking). The
training bootcamp (around USD 5,000 for 15 mentees and 15 volunteers for 1.5 days) also offered great
value for money, as it was mentioned by many mentees as a memorable experience with lots of learning
opportunities.
Two important programme components were not allocated dedicated financial resources in the
budget: volunteer recruitment and school implementation. Volunteer recruitment in 2022 was considered
mainly as a responsibility of the implementing partner, CRC-Cambodia; its costs was therefore subsumed
under the USD 1,000 management fees paid to the CRC-Cambodia. As for the school implementation
component, the costs on local transportation and accommodation in Siem Reap Province as well as on
preparing teaching and learning materials came from the seed funds of the projects (for each of the 6 projects,
about 10% of its seed fund). Although this was not an intentional choice, it treated the mentees who took time
out to go to schools unfairly, as they had less seed money for project implementation compared to their
counterparts who did not go to schools in Siem Reap.
5.4.2 Operational efficiency
The operational efficiency in implementing this programme across sections needs improvement,
despite the programme’s good internal coherence (see Section 5.2.1). In particular, the cross-section
linkages appeared to have been hampered by the unclear responsibilities of the sections involved.
The programme was started by the Communication Section. It then established connections with the Child
Protection (CP) Section and the Education Section in its second year of existence. The former mainly
managed the implementation partner (i.e., CRC-Cambodia), led the ADAP (which was also supported by the
Education Section); the latter mainly supported the school implementation component in Siem Reap Province
(alongside the so far unfruitful U-Report and VMC efforts).
The cross-section linkages were not well-defined, with responsibilities of the staff members involved unclear.
This judgement made by the consultant was agreed by some UNICEF Cambodia staff members interviewed.
While these constantly evolving linkages gave the agility that the programme needed, they also caused
confusion – and sometimes minor delays and frustration – among the staff involved, as this evaluation finds.
Multiple staff members interviewed felt that these linkages needed to be formalised, as this could help clarify
the inputs and responsibilities of the sections involved.
The substandard management of the implementing partner severely impacted the programme’s
operational efficiency. The partner, CRC-Cambodia, provided support on seed fund management (in 2021
and 2022) and volunteer engagement (in 2022). Seed fund management was a significant problem in both
37
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
years. According to the mentees, the training session on managing finances provided by the CRC-Cambodia
was unhelpful (as it was perplexing and overly technical) and the support given inadequate. About one in four
mentees in 2022 had to at some point spend their own and parents’ money on the projects – mostly USD 100
to 200 but in an extreme case USD 1,000. While in some of these cases the mentees were indeed
responsible for not following the guidelines, in most the culprit was the complicated processes involved in
using the seed fund. For instance, a simple request of modifying project budget would need to go to the CRC-
Cambodia, the programme lead and the Child Protection Section. This caused significant delays and
subsequently led to young people spending their money to solve the problems more quickly given the tight
timeframe of the implementation. All they money that the young people spent has been reimbursed by
January 2023.
Furthermore, as mentioned in Section 5.3.3, the volunteer recruitment handled by the CRC-Cambodia was
unsuccessful. This, in the consultant’s judgement, could partly be attributed to the vague contractual
agreement between the country office and the CRC-Cambodia overseen by the CP Section; for example, an
indicator asked for pairing 28 mentees with 28 AYRG members without specifying what the pairing meant. In
the perspective of the CRC-Cambodia, the online briefing session fulfil the agreement even though only a few
from the AYRG expressed willingness to join the projects as volunteers in 2022.
5.4.3 Timeliness
The programme was implemented within the intended timeframe, except for two training sessions
provided by private sector contributors. The decision made after the 2021 internal review of the
programme to extend the implementation period from 15 weeks to 6 months was proven appropriate.
On the youth-led-project level, some mentees found the implementation timeframe (< 6 months) very tight;
most mentees, nevertheless, were able to complete their projects.
5.5 Impact55
As pointed out in section 3 of the terms of reference of this evaluation, the impact assessed here is early
impact because the programme has a short history (i.e., 16 months; in 2 cohorts). Objective 3 of the
evaluation (set in the terms of reference) also asks for a study of the potential for impact. The findings
reported under the criterion of impact therefore include the impact beyond the programme outcomes in the
theory of change. More specifically, it looks into the change that the programme has on its integration with the
ADAP and LLS (evaluation question 4) as well as its relationships built with the private sector including the
indirect effects of the programme may have on UNICEF Cambodia’s relationships with the private sector
(evaluation objective 5)
The programme successfully formed a network of talented young people (i.e., mentees, volunteers)
who are agents of change. They are equipped with the right skillsets and hands-on experience (as
elaborated in the effectiveness section) to make changes in the communities. There were already occasions
in which these young people were approached by different sections of the country office for consultations
when planning activities. The programme lead also established close relationships with some of the mentee
alumni of Generation Future 2021 and continued to work on specific issues such as climate change. This
network can be useful for UNICEF Cambodia in furthering their work on youth empowerment and participation;
the interview data suggest that there is a high level of willingness among these young people to continue to
work with UNICEF Cambodia to address key social issues.
The programme has built work relations with mentors, many of which are influential individuals in the
government, private sector and development agencies. The interview and feedback data suggest that the
mentors were impressed by the capabilities of the young people involved (particularly mentees) in leading
changes in communities; this understanding was gained through working with them on projects and from
listening to their pitches in the WCD celebration event. The experience appeared to have encouraged a small
55 According to the terms of reference, the following evaluation questions are under the OECD DAC evaluation criterion of
impact: 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15 and 16.
38
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
number of mentors to reflect on the private sector’s roles in youth skills development. One wrote, ‘[t]he private
sector [can] contribute not only financial resources but also we can offer the use of buildings and facilities,
training, volunteering with young people, providing working experience, and providing business expertise.’
The programme proved that the private sector in Cambodia can be engaged to provide very specific
technical support. So far, the contribution given in this programme has mainly been in the form of technical
support and of a ‘one-off’ nature. The primary objective of the support was to support the development of the
projects. It undoubtedly provided an ‘entry point’ for companies to collaborate with UNICEF Cambodia, but as
pointed out by a UNICEF Cambodia staff member, there needs a strategy to transform the support into
higher-level, sustainable and scalable contribution. These relationships built with the influential, high rank
individuals and with companies and organisations could potentially be capitalised on by UNICEF Cambodia,
which may want to carefully consider case by case what these companies and organisations can contribute.
The unique strategies of the programme on enabling youth-led online campaigns and on creating
online spaces for youth participation have proven valuable. The social impact projects demonstrated that
young people are capable in communicating with each other in innovative ways to address social issues and
make change in communities. The extensive use of short videos and podcasts appeared to be much more
effective than text-based communication in the digital age. These strategies can potentially be used by other
programmes and the ADAP to mobilise young people and to complement in-person and direct activities with
adolescents and children.
Moreover, the success stories of these young people and their social impact project are inspirational and
motivational to other young people in the country – and this could be used in promoting youth participation
and empowerment. This finding derives from mentor and mentee interview data as well as volunteer and LLS
school student FGD data. The communication materials produced by the programme and the Communication
Section reinforced the message that young people can make meaningful changes in the society.
Considering the work connections built with the mentors and private sector contributor as well as the
engagement with a large number of students and online supporters, it can be inferred that the programme
improved brand visibility among young people and the private sector. However, it must be stressed that
the projects were not permitted to use the UNICEF branding directly and that ‘brand visibility’ could not be
scientifically assessed in this evaluation. It was also impossible (and perhaps too early) to conclude in this
evaluation whether the improved brand visibility enhanced achievement of other UNICEF Cambodia’s efforts.
The contribution of the programme to the country programme of UNICEF Cambodia was, in the
consultant’s judgement, evident but indirect, limiting the programme impact. The evaluation finds that
the contribution was mainly to higher level goals (e.g., economic participation for young women and girls,
skills development, youth participation) but not to the outcomes (and their indicators) set for the work areas
and sections of the country office (with ADAP as an exception). The discussions with staff of the country office
indicate that this impeded the performance of the multi-section linkages and caused uneasiness among teams,
as relevant sections felt that there was no direct contribution from the programme to them. These interviewees
also hoped that the issues addressed by the programme could be more aligned with those being addressed
by the sections involved to generate synergy that could lead to bigger impact.
Another factor limiting the early – and potential – impact of the programme was the unrealised
institutionalisation and scaling attempts. These included: (a) the connection between the programme and
the Volunteer for My Community; (b) working with AYRG on recruiting volunteers from more diverse
backgrounds; (c) delivering the school implementation component in more than one province; and (d)
integration between the programme and the U-Report platforms. Although these unsuccessful attempts did
not stop the programme from achieving its outputs and outcomes, it limited the early impact and scalability of
the programme as well as the possibility of working on and with the wider systems.
5.6 Sustainability56
56 According to the terms of reference, evaluation question 8 is under the OECD DAC evaluation criterion of sustainability.
39
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
5.6.1 Individual- and project-levels
The programme has made direct and clear contribution to the mentees and volunteers participated. It is very
likely that the benefits from skills improved, knowledge acquired, confidence gained and networks
extended will sustain on an individual level. The mentee interview data strongly suggest that most had the
will to continue to make changes in their communities. The attention they gained from online campaigns and
the influence they had during the programme may decrease over time, but, as the experiences of the mentees
in the 2021 cohort demonstrated, such attention and influence – together with the skills, knowledge and
confidence gained – are conducive to mentees making changes in their communities beyond their ‘graduation’
from the programme.
As for the youth-led projects, the picture is mixed. First, not all mentees would like to continue their
projects because some of them would like to focus on their study as they would be going to universities either
in Cambodia or overseas. Among the 14 mentees in the 2022 cohort responded, 7 would like to continue their
projects, 5 said that they were not sure, and 2 said they would not. Second, whilst some projects already
secured funding (mainly from other NGOs) for continuation, most of them did not; some mentors
interviewed added that their mentees’ projects lacked a sustainable business model. Target support for
projects that were most likely to continue and secure further funding could have helped address these
concerns, but the provision of such support was considered by the mentees as limited. Setting the funding
concerns aside, mentors were asked to what extent their projects’ impact could sustain; 3 chose ‘to a large
extent’, 7 ‘to some extent’ and the remaining 3 ‘to a small extent’. It is nonetheless worth noting that this
programme, unlike start-up support programmes, did not have a primary goal of setting up profitable, and
hence sustainable, businesses.
The project pages online to some extent created spaces for young people to take part in addressing social
issues, but it remains difficult to assess how sustainable these spaces are. The consultant observed that,
although the pages were still being updated in January and February 2022, they became much less active
(i.e., with less frequent updates and fewer ‘likes’ and ‘sharing’ from their followers) after the formal close of the
project cycle in late-November. It also remains difficult to gauge how deep the engagement is, not to mention
monitoring how such engagement online (e.g., following a page) is turned into actions (e.g., influencing civic
decision making) over time.
As for the impact made on students and communities (also referred to as ‘participants’ of the programme), the
programme’s interaction with them was relatively brief. In the case of students, while there is strong evidence
that, after 3 months of taking part in the school activities, students were able to recall what they learnt, the
evaluator cannot confidently conclude that this will sustain for a longer time, unless there are continuous and
repeated messaging. Similarly, the interaction with the communities was also brief and the conditions for
sustainability was not strong, and it can be logically deduced57 that any impact made will fade unless there are
repeated activities and messaging.
5.6.2 Programme-level
The programme established connections with many influential individuals in the private sector, other
development partners and the government. Most mentors and private sector contributors interviewed
expressed willingness to continue to contribute; the positive experiences and increased brand recognition are
also useful for recruiting more mentors. These suggest that mentorship, being the most important component,
can continue to be provided. However, due partly to the programme’s short history, there is not yet a plan on
how to transform these kinds of ‘one-time’ contribution into scalable and more sustainable ones.
It was evident that the school implementation component, as part of the LLS syllabus, secured buy-in
from the local MoEYS officials in Siem Reap Province. The experience proved that this component is
workable in rural contexts, and such buy-ins will help bring the component to more LLS schools in Siem Reap
and probably other provinces.
57 Please note that no 'participants' other than LLS school students were involved in this evaluation by design (as they
simply attended an event and could leave no contact details), the findings on the impact on them were drawn from
assessment of the conditions of sustainability.
40
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
While the LLS syllabus is institutionalised (as it was endorsed by the MoEYS) and could be scaled up and
sustained, this component is of a different nature and hence difficulties in ensuring its scalability,
replicability and sustainability. Since the programme plan did not include an institutional partner in this
regard (e.g., teacher training college) and had no clear plans to work with schools on a more sustainable
model (e.g., engaging teachers in planning the activities), the programme relied heavily on individual mentees’
capabilities in conducting interactive activities that can complement the use of LLS syllabus in schools. This
heavy reliance became a threat to the sustainability of the school implementation component, as it could not
be guaranteed that future mentees would be as capable as this year’s in delivering activities that could help
develop students’ 21st Century Skills. In other words, the success of the component in 2022 may not be
replicated while such replication will be needed to ensure that the positive effects on students (and to some
extent teachers and schools) can last (see Sub-Section 5.6.1). Moreover, the success of the component in
2022 was achieved mainly because 4 of the 6 mentees who conducted activities in schools came from the
same reputable Phnom Penh-based private school that focuses on project-based learning. Yet, this school is
not a formal programme partner and will not have students of the right age next year to apply for being
mentees of the programme.
Also, the core programme team intended to work with the Education Section to integrate the programme with
the Volunteer for My Community (VMC), a government initiative. This institutionalisation effort could have
ensured sustainability of the programme by means of stably recruiting volunteers and paving the way to
transferring the programme (at least in part) to the government. Yet, this arrangement was not materialised;
the evaluation team was therefore unable to assess the sustainability of this connection.
Another factor that could challenge the sustainability of programme outcomes and impact is the capacity of
the implementing partner, CRC-Cambodia. As reported in Section 5.4.2, the partner experienced significant
difficulties in recruiting volunteers and supporting projects’ seed fund management. Capacity building for the
implementing partner, and potentially new partnerships with youth networks and local civil society and not-for-
profit organisations promoting youth development and participation, is needed to sustain the impact.
Many of the challenges mentioned above were results of the very limited financial and human
resources the programme had, as pointed out by the core programme team and agreed by the consultant.
These challenges also ought to be considered with the fact that the programme had a short history (i.e., 16
months). Furthermore, UNICEF Cambodia staff members interviewed pointed out that the programme’s
funding model limited the extent to which the core programme team and the country office could
devise plans on institutionalisation and continuous implementation.
5.7 Gender Equality, Equity and Human Rights
Gender equality has been carefully considered by the programme in its design and implementation; it
was evident that the programme contributed to ensuring gender equality. The programme in 2022 had
more female than male mentees (F: 11; M: 4), volunteers (F: 73; M: 55) and participants (F: 2,340; M: 1,581).
A few youth-led projects chosen had an explicit focus on ensuring gender equality; for example, the projects
on encouraging young women to develop careers in the STEM fields and the project on promoting football
among girls. The programme provided these projects support and an enabling environment for
implementation and advocacy. These projects also challenged gender norms and stereotypes that could limit
girls’ and young women’s equal access to and participation in certain sectors (i.e., STEM, IT, football).
As seen in the programme outputs, most mentees in both 2021 and 2022 were females (2021: 10 in 13; 2022
11 in 15). This, according to the core programme team, was primarily caused by the mentee selection process
wherein all personal information including that on gender was redacted. While this ensured that mentees were
selected based on merits and their project plans, it did not help with ensuring equal participation between
males and females. A UNICEF Cambodia staff member suggested that, in the next programme cycles, the
gender ratio in different stages of the selection process be monitored to help achieve a more desirable male-
41
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
to-female mentee ratio. It is worth noting that boys and young men in Cambodia were more likely to drop out
from schools58 and that they were also more vulnerable to online grooming/exploitation59.
The programme’s design considered equity and human rights. For example, the core programme team
was cognisant that, given the demanding requirements on mentees, the programme needed to use other
mechanisms to ensure that young people who were less capable in managing large-scale projects could still
participate as volunteers. The first mechanism was the agreement with the CRC-Cambodia and AYRG, many
members of which came from marginalised and disadvantaged backgrounds. The second was the
connections to be built with the Volunteer for My Community, a government initiative that could ensure more
equal participation. The third was the use of U-Report, which should allow young people nation-wide to
express their opinions on specific issues (most are related to rights of children and adolescents).
However, such attempts were of limited success, and that in particular negatively impacted the
programme’s ability to directly engage young people from marginalised and disadvantaged
backgrounds. Although there were no relevant data, stakeholders were aware that most mentees and
volunteers (all but two were based in Phnom Penh during the implementation period although most grew up
outside Phnom Penh) came from ‘good schools’ and ‘good families’. This negative impact on equity was to
some extent compensated for by the school implementation component wherein mentees and volunteers
went into schools in rural contexts to conduct activities. Yet, these interactions were relatively brief and the
benefits that these participants received were incomparable to those received by mentees and volunteers.
Some human rights issues were adequately addressed by the youth-led project; obvious examples
included climate change, children’s oral health and nutrition. Yet, the evaluator observed that the most
urgent human rights issues (identified in the country programme) remained untouched by the
programme, these included: gender-based violence, discrimination against people with disabilities, child
marriage, and teenage pregnancy. Of course, the programme team could not dictate what human rights
issues were to be addressed as the topics were proposed by mentees. Some UNICEF Cambodia staff
members interviewed acknowledged this concern and suggested that the programme may want to consult
with different sections to identify ‘priority issues’; and, in selecting mentee applications, prioritise projects that
are proposed to address these issues. This could potentially strengthen the connections between the
programme and the sections’ work in UNICEF Cambodia. Such considerations in selection should be made
transparent to prospective mentees.

Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
6. Conclusions and Lessons Learned
6.1 Conclusions
Conclusions are structured around the six OECD DAC evaluation criteria and an additional criterion on gender
equality, equity and human rights. These conclusions underpin a basic recommendation that the
programme should be continued.
6.1.1 On relevance
The programme has been relevant and responsive to the national policies on education and youth
development, in particular the Education Strategic Plan and the National Policy on Youth Development. There
were four areas in which the programme responded well to the policies. First, the programme helped
adolescents and youth develop life skills and the 21st Century Skills. Second, the programme developed
young people’s capacity to contribute to civic decisions and provided an enabling environment for youth-led
participation. Third, the programme promoted the use of inquiry-based learning and student-centric approach
in schools in Siem Reap Province. Fourth, a few mentee-led projects provided career counselling and
guidance to secondary school students. While the programme is relevant to the national policies, its concept
note did not mention explicitly these policies and related strategies.
The programme was relevant to the needs of adolescent and youth in Cambodia. Its focus on skills
development, particularly those of the 21st Century Skills, was aptly chosen. Young people agreed that the
skills developed (as well as the confidence gained and professional networks expanded) were what they
needed and would be helpful in their study, work and/or daily lives.
The youth-led approach used in the programme has proven strong in ensuring relevance. Mentees had the
autonomy to design and implement their projects. Most social issues chosen by the mentees were relevant
to the Cambodian youth. That said, a small number of the projects were less relevant to the needs of the most
marginalised and disadvantaged adolescents and youth in the country, especially those in rural contexts.
The programme was largely relevant to the programme’s mentors (about half of them from the private sector)
and its private sector contributors. The matching between mentors and mentees ensured that most
mentors could work on relevant projects with young people with similar interests. A small number of mentors
were running businesses that could collaborate with their mentees’ projects, further increasing the relevance
of the programme to the mentors and the private sector. As for the private sector contributors, representatives
interviewed opined that, by providing training sessions, they contributed towards fulfilling corporate social
responsibilities.
6.1.2 On coherence
The programme was coherent – and did not overlap – with similar programmes of other development
partners in Cambodia. The Generation Future programme focused more on online campaigning, skills
development for youth, and youth participation, while the programmes of other development partners
emphasised more the provision of support to start-ups and promotion of entrepreneurship education. Also, the
programme had the necessary linkages with the private sector for contributing to achieving programme
outputs and outcomes. These linkages benefited the participating adolescents and youth directly as well as
helped UNICEF Cambodia build new relationships with private sector partners and provided them with an
entry point to collaborate with UNICEF. Yet, the Phnom Penh-centric positioning of the programme could
have been improved to provide valuable experiences to young people in the provinces where similar
opportunities were very limited.
The programme has been consistent with other interventions and activities of UNICEF Cambodia and is
aligned with UNICEF’s mission goals and principles of communication and youth empowerment. The linkages
that the programme had with multiple sections/strategy of UNICEF Cambodia were somewhat productive. The
most productive linkage was the one with the Adolescent Development and Participation (ADAP) strategy, for
the objectives of the two were well aligned and their activities harmonised. The evaluation finds that the
programme contributed to the work of ADAP by increasing young people’s capacity to participate meaningfully
43
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
in their communities and by providing an enabling environment for participation and increasing youth
engagement both online and in-person (through large-scale events and in-school activities).
As for the linkage with the Education Section, the programme experience of implementing issue-based
learning certainly contributed towards to the Section’s aim to provide quality education through showcasing
how issue- and inquiry-based learning could take place in rural schools. However, the contribution was small
in scale, as the programme could only reach 18 schools, with each given half-day activities. Moreover, the
Education Section focuses more on early childhood and basic education as well as ministerial and leadership
capacity building – areas that were not well covered by the Generation Future programme.
The positioning of the programme in UNICEF Cambodia under the Communications Section was
functioning, but it could no longer fully support the programme. There was a consensus among UNICEF
Cambodia staff that it should become a cross-section programme and be placed either under the Deputy
Representative Office or as part of the ADAP.
6.1.3 On effectiveness
The selection and matching of the mentors were outstanding and considered by both mentors and
mentees as effective in implementing the youth-led projects. Most mentees interviewed thought highly of their
mentors who, in their opinion, provided them with technical expertise, professional network, inspiration and
emotional support. Most mentors were delighted to have taken part in the programme. That said, some
mentor-mentee relationships were relatively loose; they met much less frequently than what the programme
expected them to (i.e., one hour per week).
The programme was highly effective in improving young people’s 21st Century Skills, with all mentees in
the 2022 cohort interviewed agreed that they improved a wide range of skills in participating in the programme.
Volunteers also reported an improvement of skills. The development of the skills was facilitated by training
sessions organised by the core programme team and provided by private sector contributors, mentors and
mentees in the 2021 cohort, NGOs and the UNICEF Cambodia.
The inclusion of youth volunteers (128 in 2022) as a target group in the programme design effectively
expanded the reach of the programme to more young people, given that the number of mentees was small
(15 in 2022). While the volunteers recruited exceeded the target (110 in 2022), most volunteers were
classmates and friends of the mentees, limiting the intended ‘spill-over’ effect. The volunteer recruitment
process was ineffective due mainly to a lack of commitment from and capacity of the implementing partner.
The school implementation component of the programme (wherein mentees and volunteers conducted
activities with students in Siem Reap Province) was effective (in achieving outputs 1 and 5). The students and
their teachers found the activities very engaging; many students were inspired to make positive change in
their communities and had the opportunities to practise some 21st Century Skills. The component also
effectively created ‘buy-in’ from the MoEYS in the Province. The coordination of the school visits was effective,
but the implementation had to be scaled back (by not going to Battambang Province), limiting the reach of the
component.
The online campaigning was very effective; the projects attracted a large number of followers (27,000+,
more than 5 times the target) on multiple social media platforms. The World Children’s Day (WCD)
celebration event was to some extent effective in increasing opportunities to civic decision making. This was
achieved mainly through having influential representatives from the government, private sector and
development agencies attending the event. It is still early to tell whether the event’s influence will translate into
actual opportunities to participate in civic participation, but it can be concluded that the event provided a
platform for young people to demonstrate their capabilities in making changes in their communities.
Overall, the programme (and its components) was effective in achieving its three outcomes. Young people
were sufficiently engaged in actively addressing social issues that impact them (outcome 1). The programme
was somewhat effective in improving access to stable employment opportunities for young people (mentees
and volunteers in particular) primarily through skills development (outcome 2); some mentee-led projects
directly contributed to this outcome by advertising skills development opportunities and improving young
44
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
people’s understanding of the job market. Lastly, the programme was effective in increasing opportunities for
young people to contribute in civic decision making (outcome 3).
6.1.4 On efficiency
The economic efficiency of the programme was high considering that the programme reached a large
number of young people (33,000+). The budget for the 2022 programme was just under USD 160,000. About
half of the costs was on human resources, a quarter on the seed funds of the mentee-led projects, and a
quarter on the WCD event. In the evaluator’s judgement, the seed fund and mentoring together brought the
most impact on young people and children in the most cost-efficient manner. The training bootcamp, wherein
intensive skills development sessions were provided, also offered great value for money.
The operational efficiency in implementing the programme across sections needs improvement. In particular,
the cross-section linkages appeared to have been hampered by the unclear responsibilities of the sections of
UNICEF Cambodia involved; this caused minor delays in implementation and frustration among the staff
involved. Moreover, the implementing partner was not managed properly, resulting in failures in recruiting
volunteers from a youth organisation and in seed fund management.
The programme was implemented within the intended timeframe. The decision made after the 2021 internal
review of the programme to extend the implementation period from 15 weeks to 6 months has been proven
appropriate.
6.1.5 On (early) impact
The programme successfully formed a network of talented young people (i.e., mentees and volunteers)
who are agents of change. They are equipped with the right skillsets and hands-on experience to make
changes in the communities; the interview data suggest that there was a high level of willingness among
these young people to continue to work with UNICEF Cambodia. This network can be useful for UNICEF
Cambodia in furthering its work on youth empowerment and participation.
The unique strategies of the programme on enabling youth-led online campaigns and on creating online
spaces for youth participation have proven valuable, as the programme demonstrated that young people
are capable in communicating with each other in innovative ways to address social issues and make changes
in communities. These strategies can potentially be used by other programmes to mobilise young people and
to complement in-person and direct activities with adolescent and children.
The programme also built working relationships with mentors, many of which are influential individuals in the
government, private sector, and NGOs and development agencies. Most mentors were impressed by the
capabilities of the young people who participated in the programme. The experience appeared to have
encouraged a small number of mentors to reflect on the private sector’s roles in youth skills development. The
programme experience of working with mentors and private sector contributors proved that the private sector
in Cambodia can be engaged to provide very specific technical support.
Considering the work connections built with the mentors and private sector contributor as well as the
engagement with a large number of students and online supporters, it can be inferred that the programme
improved UNICF Cambodia’s brand visibility among young people and the private sector. However, it must
be stressed that the youth-led projects were not permitted to use the UNICEF branding directly and that
‘brand visibility’ could not be scientifically assessed in this evaluation. It was also too early to conclude in this
evaluation whether the improved brand visibility enhanced achievement of other UNICEF Cambodia’s efforts.
The contribution of the programme to the country programme of UNICEF Cambodia was evident but indirect,
limiting the programme’s impact. The evaluation finds that the contribution was mainly to higher level goals
but not to the specific outcomes (and their indicators) set for the work areas and sections of the country office.
Another factor limiting the early – and potential – impact of the programme was the unrealised
institutionalisation and scaling attempts.
45
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
6.1.6 On sustainability
It is very likely that the programme’s contribution to mentees and volunteers on the individual level will
sustain; such contribution includes the skills improved, knowledge acquired, confidence gained and networks
extended. The evaluation’s mentee interview data strongly suggest that most mentees and volunteers had the
will to continue to make changes in their communities. As for the impact made on students, the evaluation
cannot conclude confidently that it will sustain because the interaction with them was relatively brief. The
evaluation extrapolated this to assessing the sustainability of the impact made on communities (or,
participants, as they were called by the programme) and concluded that the impact would wane unless there
are continuous and repeated interaction with them.
On the project level, some youth-led projects may not continue and their impact may therefore not sustain.
This was because some mentees needed to focus on their study and would like to discontinue their projects.
Also, most projects did not have funding to continue their implementation beyond the end of programme cycle.
On the programme level, the planned – yet not materialised – institutionalisation efforts negatively impacted
the programme’s prospect and sustainability. One example was the integration of the programme with the
government’s Volunteer for My Community initiative, which could have ensured the sustainability of the
programme’s benefits by promoting volunteerism and influencing how volunteering is done in the country. The
sustainability of the benefits brought by the school implementation component was also questionable mainly
because the programme had no institutional partners in this regard. These weaknesses can be attributed to
the programme’s short history and limited resources to create conditions for sustainability.
That said, the programme managed to establish connections with many influential individuals in the private
sector, other development partners and the government. Many of these individuals expressed willingness to
continue to contribute to the programme. These contributed to the sustainability of the benefits of the
programme and the likelihood that the programme can still garner support from the sector in the next cycles.
6.1.7 On gender equality, equity and human rights
Gender equality has been carefully considered by the programme in its design and implementation; it was
evident that the programme contributed to ensuring gender equality: a few youth-led projects chosen had an
explicit focus on ensuring gender equality and challenged gender norms and stereotypes that could limit girls’
and young women’s equal access to and participation in certain sectors of the economy of Cambodia.
The programme’s design sought to use mechanisms to ensure equity; these mechanisms including working
with the Adolescent and Youth Reference Group (AYRG) and establishing connections with the government’s
Volunteer for My Community (VMC) initiative. However, such attempts were unsuccessful, and that negatively
impacted the programme’s ability to directly engage young people from marginalised and disadvantaged
backgrounds.
Some human rights issues, such as climate change, children’s oral health and nutrition, were adequately
addressed by the youth-led projects. Yet, the evaluation finds that some most urgent human rights issues
identified in the country programme remained untouched by the programme.
6.2 Lessons Learned
This evaluation has generated some lessons of wider relevance to similar programmes in Cambodia and
beyond. The lessons learned are mainly drawn from the findings on the use of the scale strategies in the re-
design of the 2022 cycle of the programme (also as a response to evaluation question 13).
First, the youth-led participation model used in this programme has proven to be an effective way in
addressing social issues that impact young people. Young people living in the contexts know best the issues
that they and other young people face. Allowing them to design and run projects ensure that the projects and
their actions are relevant to the needs of young people in those contexts. The young leaders in this
programme are provided with training and support as well as given an enabling environment to bring their
projects into life and influence other young people.
46
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
Second, a peer-to-peer (youth-to-youth) approach whereby young people work with and help others in
addressing social issues is effective. The programme experience demonstrated that peer-to-peer help is
effective, as it appeared that young people can better communicate with young people on specific issues. The
projects on mental health in this programme are good examples, in that advice on self-care given by young
people seem to resonate well with other young people.
Third, online campaigning (and its content) planned and run by young people for young people is effective.
The content, mainly in the form of short videos, created by the young people in the programme was creative
and gained traction from young people. The experience proved that online spaces (on social media) can
become effective platforms for youth-led civic participation and for influencing many young people who have
access to the Internet.
Fourth, the private sector can be engaged for very specific contribution. For instance, companies of different
sizes, including large corporations like Facebook/Meta and KPMG, agreed to provide training sessions in the
case of Generation Future. Executive-level managers of multinational corporates provided mentorship and
even asked their employees to provide technical support to the youth-led social impact projects. This
experience proved that there is interest in the private sector to contribute to youth participation and
empowerment as well as young people’s skills development.
47
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
7. Recommendations
The recommendations in this chapter are derived from the findings and conclusions presented above. These
recommendations have been validated by the Reference Group set up for this evaluation. The consultant
discussed with the group the recommendations in a meeting held on 30 March 2023.
Considering the programme’s achievements and results, the evaluation concludes that it should be
continued. In considering how to expand and scale the programme, it is worth reiterating that, the evaluation
found that the most impactful programme components were the seed fund given to the youth-led social impact
projects (as agreed by most mentors, mentees and volunteers) and the mentorship provided by influential
individuals in Cambodia (which has been the core of the programme design).
Meanwhile, it is evident in this evaluation that the programme cannot be significantly scaled by increasing the
number of projects unless there is a major increase of human and financial resource input. It is because: (a) it
would be costly to support more social impact projects per year (each costs up to USD 2,000); (b) these
projects require a high level of support from the core programme team, the capacity of which has already
been maximised; and (c) a larger number of projects could reduce the attention that each of them gets. In light
of the above, it is assumed here that the number of projects is to be kept under 20 in one programme cycle.
Expanding and scaling the programme should therefore aim to:
a. Reach more young people, particularly those in marginalised and disadvantaged communities and
outside Phnom Penh, without overwhelming the mentees and the core programme team;
b. Deepen the engagement with participants, in particular the LLS school students given the success of
the component;
c. Utilise existing infrastructure of the government by stepping up the programme’s early
institutionalisation efforts; and
d. Devise plans to capitalise on the connections built particularly those with the private sector.
Volunteer recruitment
One important way of expanding the reach and maximising the impact of the programme is recruiting a larger
number of volunteers from outside the immediate friend circles of the mentees. This will: (a) allow volunteers
to learn from the mentees who have the capabilities to lead social impact projects; (b) maximise the ‘spill-over
effect’ that let learning go from mentors and the core programme team to mentees – and then to volunteers; (c)
scale the programme without compromising the quality of mentoring; and (d) address the equity concerns
identified in this evaluation.
To do so, the following are recommended, on the condition that more support will be given to mentees to
recruit and manage volunteers (to avoid overburdening mentees and brining negative consequences) as it
is unlikely that mentees could invest more time on this (than those did in 2021 and 2022).
1. Map the youth networks in Phnom Penh and select provinces to support an improved outreach
process. This will help the core programme team identify channels to better advertise volunteering
opportunities under the social impact projects. Working with local youth networks can help establish
longer lasting relationships and leverage their local knowledge to reach young people from marginalised
and disadvantaged communities in volunteer recruitment. These networks can also be used in inviting
applications for being mentees.
Timing: Before the start of the GF programme cycle in 2023.
Responsibility: Country Office (as the mapping can support other programmes as well).
Priority: Medium.
2. Establish the connection between the programme and the Volunteer for My Community (VMC).
This connection was explored in the programme plan 2022 but did not materialise. It should still be
pursued in the next programme cycle because it will expand the reach of the programme and increase the
diversity of the volunteers. More importantly, this is an important step in institutionalising a part of the
48
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
programme. This effort should be easier in the coming years, as the programme has demonstrated
success in bringing benefits to volunteers in terms of skills development.
Timing: Before the start of volunteer recruitment for mentees’ projects in 2023.
Responsibility: Education Section (as it oversees the partnership with the MoEYS, which initiated the
VMC); core programme team.
Priority: High.
School implementation and programme presence outside Phnom Penh
The evaluation finds that the programme was Phnom Penh-centric: all but one mentee in 2022 (and nearly all
volunteers) resided in Phnom Penh, with all training sessions taken place in Phnom Penh (if not online). While
the programme was able to implement school activities and reach close to 900 students in Siem Reap
Province, the coordination was challenging and the costs of travelling and accommodation were relatively high
(and not included in the programme budget). Whilst the activities conducted in schools were impactful, they
were in the form of ‘one-off visits’, with limited relationships built between mentees and the teachers at the
schools (as pointed out by the local MoEYS officials). The following two recommendations sought to
overcome such drawbacks:
3. Introduce ‘quotas’ for mentees based in select provinces and strengthen core programme team
support for them. This means that a fixed number of mentees chosen must be ‘from’ and residing in the
select provinces during the implementation of their social impact projects. This is to ensure that the
selected mentees – and hopefully their volunteers – are not all based in Phnom Penh (as this has limited
the reach of the programme). More importantly, having mentees in the select provinces allow them to
work with the target LLS schools much earlier and in multiple occasions. These mentees should still
receive the same opportunities to attend the training bootcamp and benefit from mentorship and training
sessions. In light of this, it is advisable to have a part-time and/or full-time staff member (or consultant) in
each of the select provinces to provide implementation support, with members of the core programme
team paying regular visits. Also, mentors to be matched with these mentees should ideally be individuals
based in the provinces. A small budget should be allocated for these mentees to travel to Phnom Penh 2
to 3 times during the implementation period to attend the bootcamp, training sessions that could not be
held online, and the World Children’s Day event (if still applicable). The consultant suggests that a total of
6 mentees from 2 select provinces be in for the ‘quota’ in next year’s programme as a pilot for this mode
of operation. Siem Reap Province can be one of the two provinces, as there is buy-in from local MoEYS
officials and UNICEF Cambodia has close working relationship with schools there.
Timing: Before the start of the programme cycle in 2023.
Responsibility: Core Programme Team, Education Section, ADAP.
Priority: High.
4. Establish connections with Youth Councils in Phnom Penh and select provinces. As mentioned in
Section 2.1, the Youth Councils and the National Council for Youth Development were established by the
government to ensure participation. It is advisable to study the possibility of establishing connections with
these bodies; the UNICEF Cambodia colleague based in Siem Reap also actively proposed this in the
interview. The connections will further strengthen mentees’ projects, as the Youth Councils can be
engaged and/or consulted with in multiple components (e.g., mentee recruitment, volunteer recruitment,
campaigning, school implementation) to further expand the reach of the programme and diversify the
backgrounds from which mentees and volunteers come from. Moreover, Youth Councils members have
very relevant civic participation experience on specific issues such as climate change, and the
connections with them could bring the programme closer to the Youth Councils using social issues as
linkages to initiate further institutionalisation efforts. In the recommendation validation meeting, a UNICEF
Cambodia staff also mentioned Provincial Youth Development Centres as possible partners for the GF
programme in the near future.
Timing: In 2023 (this may mean that the programme may not fully engage the Youth Councils in the 2023
programme but should allow for some degree of integration in 2024).

Responsibility: Core programme Team, Education Section, ADAP.
Priority: Medium.
Private sector engagement
The evaluation finds that the programme successfully engaged the private sector by having individuals from
the sector on-board as mentors and trainers, attend the World Children’s Day (WCD) celebration event and/or
participate in mentees’ projects. However, there was no clear plan on how to further the engagement. As
pointed out in Section 5.1.1, there remains a gap between what organisations in the private sector want and
what UNICEF Cambodia can offer. Therefore, it is advisable to:
5. Study how to best capitalise on the connections built with the private sector by consulting with
participated individuals and studying companies’ CSR policies. The findings will contribute to devising a
more relatable approach to engaging the private sector. It is also important to re-consider the objectives of
engaging the private sector in the Cambodian context; the interview data and desk research suggest that
transferrable skills development (as labour force preparation) is a key area to base the engagement on. In
addition, private sector contributors providing skills training will need to be better briefed to improve the
effectiveness of the sessions. The programme may also want to study: (a) the implementation experience
of Generation Unlimited, an initiative co-developed by UNICEF Headquarters in exploring the possibility of
engaging the private sector in providing internship and employment opportunities; and (b) how public
universities in Cambodia engaged the private sector in providing skills development opportunities with the
assistance of the World Bank-funded Cambodia Higher Education Improvement Project (HEIP).
Timing: In 2023.
Responsibility: Core programme team, Corporate Partnership Specialist (under Communication Section).
Priority: Low to medium.
Programme management and positioning in the organisation
The remaining three recommendations derive from the findings reported in Section 5.2.1 on internal
coherence and Section 5.4.2 on operational efficiency. They aim to provide a robust structure for the
programme to scale in its next cycles.
6. Position the programme either under the Deputy Representative Office (with one section acting as
the Secretariat) or under ADAP (with a significant increase in stable funding to ADAP). As the
programme evolved, the current position of it under the Communication Section can no longer provide it
with adequate support. As reported in Section 5.2.1 on internal coherence, there is consensus among the
staff interviewed that the programme should take either of the two captioned options. One concern that
the new positioning should address is the availability of funding and human resources that can be
dedicated to the programme, as the programme cannot scale on the current allocated human resources
(1.5 staff members) and budget (< USD 160,000). Another concern that this new positioning should
address is the cross-section linkages (see recommendation 7) for better operational efficiency and
accountability. This evaluation refrains from concluding which option can best support the continuation of
the programme, as the analysis of country office’s finances and human resources is outside its scope.
Timing: As soon as possible, to include in drafting of the new country programme.
Responsibility: Senior management of the country office.
Priority: Medium.
7. Reinforce cross-section linkages and ensure accountability. As reported in Section 5.4.2 on
operational efficiency, these linkages were not clearly defined and have caused minor delays and
sometimes frustrations among teams in the office. With the structure of the programme more settled now
and with value added assessed in this evaluation, teams involved in the project should revise these
linkages. The aims of the revision are to: (a) align the objectives of the programme with those of the
projects/activities under the sections involved; (b) define the contribution to be made by the programme to
the sections involved; (c) establish agreement on what and how the sections involved should contribute in
return; (d) dedicate resources to keep to the agreement. It is worth noting that the country office is drafting
50
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
a new country programme in early-2023 – an opportune moment to review the interlinkages among
sections as well as between sections and the cross-section programmes.
Timing: Before the start of the GF programme cycle in 2023 and during the drafting of the new country
programme.
Responsibility: Core programme team, ADAP, Child Protection Section, Communication Section,
Education Section.
Priority: Medium.
8. Strengthen the partnership with the CRC-Cambodia. In response to the failures on volunteer
recruitment and seed fund management reported in Section 5.4.2, it is advisable to strengthen the
partnership with the CRC-Cambodia. While actions in recommendations 1 and 2 (on volunteer recruitment)
will improve the reach of the programme, CRC-Cambodia and its AYRG will remain important to the
programme in reaching youth from marginalised and disadvantaged background. Also, it is key to develop
the local organisation’s capacity, as it will contribute to the sustainability of programme benefits and
impact. The CRC-Cambodia must be given adequate resources and significant support on capacity
development (e.g., on providing easy-to-understand training and instructions to young people; on
outreach; on understanding and responding to young people’s needs); monitoring indicators must be
clearly defined to ensure its accountability.
Timing: As soon as possible.
Responsibility: Core programme team, Child Protection Section.
Priority: High.
The evaluation developed a revised theory of change that takes into consideration the forward-looking
recommendations (as per objective 9 of the evaluation). Please see Annex Q for the revised theory of change
and the rationale behind the changes proposed.

2. (Pick at least two skillsets, of which the mentee said that they have improved. For each skillset, ask the
questions.) How did the experience of being a mentee improve these skillsets? Can you give me an
example? How was it useful in helping you to grow as a young person?
3. (Pick at least one, of which they said that they did not improve.) You said that the programme has not
helped you improve this skillset that much. Why? Was there a better way to help you improve these skills?
4. Can you share with me one thing that you did not know about the area that you are working in before you
joined the programme? (This is a question on knowledge.)
5. Do you have a 3-year goal in terms of your study or career in your mind? If yes, can you tell me where
you will be and what you will be doing? Do you think the experience of being a mentee help you move
closer to this goal?
6. Do you think your experience as a mentee has improved your confidence in general? If yes, what helped
you gain the confidence? Did this gain in confidence help your study or work?
7. Now think about the social issue that your project addresses. What are young people’s roles in
addressing it? In your opinion, what is needed to facilitate young people’s participation?
8. (Use the pre-interview online survey to identify at least 3 components of the programme. One of them
should be a component that the mentee thought highly of and one less so.) I want to now speak with you
about [the component] of the programme. Do you think this component has helped you to implement your
project? Why?
9. Let’s now talk about your relationship with your mentor. How would you describe your relationship? How
has he/she/they helped you with implementing your project? Let’s explore the following areas:
opportunities for skills development, making connections and extending your professional networks,
amplifying the influence of the project, providing exposure.
10. Apart from the training provided, have you received any support from the private sector, NGOs, media
agencies and/or development agency in your project? Can you tell me a bit about the support? Was it
helpful?
11. Did your project have a component in which you work with students? What was your experience like?
What did you learn from the experience?
12. I want to discuss with you the seed fund management. Did you encounter any problem?
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
13. Were you paired up with a young person through the CRC/AYRG? How was your experience speaking
and/or working with them? What other support did CRC/AYRG provide?

 The focus group discussion is to be conducted in Khmer.
 Small writing cards and pens will be provided for participants for Qs 3 and 5.
 Small cue cards will be provided for Q4.
 Allocate enough time for participants to write down their responses for questions that require writing. If
participants struggle with writing, they can give their responses in simple drawings.
 For Qs 3 to 5, please use the form provided to record the content of the cards and how cards are placed.
Questions for the group:
1. Can you please tell us your name and your favourite colour? (To facilitator: There is no need to record the
responses to this warm-up question.)
2. Can anyone tell me which project you volunteered for? (To facilitator: After the first response, please ask
for 1 or 2 more participants to add to the first response. This question aims to help them recall the
memories as well as to see how the project is depicted by young people.)
3. Can you please write down your proudest moments in your volunteering experience? (To facilitator: After
the participants finish writing, please compare their answers and see which is the most popular response.
Start asking follow-up questions with the most popular response, then move on to the next one. This
question aims to gauge which parts of the volunteering experience were the most important to participants.
Please collect the cards after the FGD.)
a. Why was that unforgettable?
b. Does anyone agree or disagree?
4. Here are six cards; each of them has a set of skills written on it. (The six sets of skills are: teamwork;
event organisation and management; marketing and branding; writing and communication skills including
public speaking; digital and IT skills including content production; problem solving.) First, can you please
pick the skills that you think you have developed in your volunteering? (After participants picking) Now,
can you please rank them – the skillset that you think you learnt the most at the top, followed by the next
one until all cards you picked are ranked? (To facilitator: Please take a picture of the cards on the table.
Then have the discussion with the participants. Start with the most prominent skills in the response.
Depending on the time, please cover three or more skills. This question aims to gauge skills gained and
how relevant the volunteer experience is to the participants.)
a. How did you develop that skill?
b. Is that useful to you in your study, work life and/or daily life? How? (Ask for an example.)
c. Does anyone agree or disagree?

5. Please write down one more ‘thing’ that you learnt other than the six skillsets we looked at earlier. It can
be a skillset, a kind of knowledge, or anything that you can think of. (To facilitator: After the participants
finish writing, please compare their answers and see which one is the most popular response and start
asking follow-up questions with that one. This question seeks to find out how the skills, knowledge and
confidence gained, as well as relationships built, could be used for the volunteers’ study, work, personal
development and/or contribution to civic decision-making. Please collect the cards after the FGD.)
a. Can you tell me a bit more?
b. Is that useful to you in your study, work life and/or daily life? How? (Ask for an example.)
c. Does anyone agree?
6. From your own experience of being a volunteer, is there anything that the programme can do to make this
experience better? (Note to facilitator: recall what have been mentioned in the FGD and identify areas that
participants had a less positive view on.)

Corresponding evaluation
1.1, 3, 4.1, 15, 16
question(s):
Note to facilitator:
 The focus group discussion is to be conducted in Khmer.
 The FGD is designed to be a mini-lesson wherein students will: (a) first, recall what they have learnt about
an issue; (b) second, have a guided discussion about what was learnt in their Generation Future activities;
(c) third, share where and how they learnt about the issue (knowledge) and the skills they demonstrated
in the mini-lesson.
 Please observe the following:
o To what extent the participants demonstrate critical thinking (e.g., agreeing and disagreeing with
other’s viewpoints and giving reasons), creativity (e.g., coming up with creative solution, using
creative ways to express themselves), collaboration (e.g., working with others towards identifying
causes of the issue), communication (e.g., expressing themselves clearly and logically) and
leadership (e.g., guiding peers towards a goal) skills.
o How they knew about the issue. More specifically: whether they allude to the LLS programme and
the Generation Future programme.
 The issue to be used will be decided by which schools are chosen. There will be 6 issues in total, with
each of them in one of the following themes: education, the environment and health.
 2 small pieces of paper and a pen will be given to each participant.
 A list of key words about the issue will be collected from the mentees who went into school to lead
learning activities.
 Photos taken back when Generation Future programme was implemented will be prepared and shown for
Q5 as a prompt.
Questions for the group:
1. Today we are going to discuss the issue of [one of the six issues of the Generation Future programme’s
mentee-led projects]. Each of us has a small piece of paper with a key word of the theme. You cannot
read the word on your card. In a minute, you will hold your piece of paper on your head and with the word
facing your friends. They will need to give you cues to guess what was written on the paper without
reading out the word.
2. [For each cause shared in Q1] What did you learn about this key word? Why is it important?
3. Thank you for all your contribution. You have demonstrated that you know a lot about the issue, for
example, [give a few points that the students talked about in the activity – avoid very sensitive points
mentioned to ensure safeguarding]. You also demonstrated some amazing skills, for example, [name
skills demonstrated in the activity]. Can you tell me where you learnt these?
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
4. Now I want to focus more on the Generation Future programme – that is when [name of mentee] came
into the school and learnt with you on [the issue]. Do you recall that? Did you like that? Why? [Facilitator
will show a photo taken when the Generation Future programme mentee went into the school.]
5. Do you think you were able to use what you learnt in the Generation Future programme activities? Tell me
how? (Note to facilitator: particularly in local life skills education and student councils)
6. What more can we provide to help you learn in schools? It can be something tangible – that is, materials
(e.g., books, computers) – and it can be some kinds of support (e.g., hands-on activities, career guidance).
(Can you write it down on another piece of paper and share with us?) [If there is time left, please ask the
participants to elaborate.]

question(s):
Note:
 The consultant has been having weekly meetings with the programme lead. He has used the meetings to
clarify programme details with the team and to ask questions in a less constructed way.
 There will be two formal interviews with the evaluation management team, with on in late-January at the
beginning of the evaluation and the second towards the end in mid-February. The first one will focus on
assessing the programme and the second on ideas on expanding the programme as well as responding
to question emerged from other interviews and focus group discussions.
 Owing to the nature of these interviews, the questions below are more ‘broad-brushed’, as it is difficult to
expect what other stakeholders will tell the team. Setting questions too early on and asking them without
modification may not produce meaningful findings.
Interview questions:
This interview is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on the programme’s connections with other
sections of UNICEF Cambodia (as this is more relevant to the interviewees’ work). The second part asks for
the interviewee’s comment and suggestions on the programme itself.
First interview
1. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the following components of the programme: mentorship;
mentee training; volunteer recruitment; campaigning; school implementation; online supporters and youth
engagement; World Children’s Day celebration event.
2. [For programme lead only] Which of the components brought the most impact in the most cost-effective
manner?
3. Do you think the programme had enough staff for its implementation? If not, where are the ‘gaps’?
4. Now, consider the programme as a whole. How well did it achieve its outcomes and early impact?
5. The programme is designed to be cross-sectoral. Let’s first look at the connection with the Education and
Child Protection Sections as well as to the ADAP. How well did these connections work? Is there anything
missing that would have made the programme more effective and efficient?
6. Did the programme amplify UNICEF Cambodia’s other efforts by enhancing achievement results and by
increasing brand visibility? (Note: Also consider whether and how the collaboration with private sector
actors and the social enterprises it created enhanced the achievement of results and by increased brand
visibility.)
7. Now, consider the partnerships and relationships that this programme built with the private sector. Are
they so important? If yes, how can these be utilised by UNICEF Cambodia further?
8. Do you think what the programme has achieved are sustainable? Why?
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
Second interview
Note: The second interview will focus on evaluation questions 10 to 14, which were written as forward-looking
questions. As mentioned, the second interview will also be used to allow the programme team to respond to
other interviewees and FGD participants.
9. What are non-negotiable elements and conditions of Generation Future that are essential for reaching
results and need to be present in any design of the programme?
10. What would be the ideal governance of the programme and what linkages and partnerships would be
needed to secure a successful continuation? What would be needed if the programme is to be scaled up?
11. [For programme lead only] Is the current design of the Generation Future cost efficient? Would the costs
when scaled up be manageable? (Note: The expenses sheet will be used to identify items that will need
to be allocated extra budget if the programme is scaled up.)
12. How effective did the stakeholders (Note: according to the ToR, the stakeholders are mentors, private
sector, CRC and mentees 2021 alumni) play their roles in the programme? What are the better ways that
the stakeholders could potentially contribute to the programme?
13. What lessons can be drawn from the use of scale strategies in the re-design of the second phase of the
programme? (Note: There were four scale-up strategies: (a) From a youth engagement initiative to a
multi-sectoral initiative; (b) Increased co-design and co-creation opportunities; (c) From individual to
community-based approach; (d) Making partnerships a cornerstone.) What can be learned from the
strategies that were planned but not implemented?
14. When scaled, what positive or negative unexpected consequences/ spill-over effects from Generation
Future might emerge? How will they affect the programme implementation and achievement of results at
scale?

10. [Only a] The programme started as a communication and outreach programme and has now extended its
scope; do you think its current positioning in the organisation should be re-considered? (Encourage the
interviewee to peruse the logical framework / theory of change of the programme.)
11. The programme in 2022 is designed to be multi-sectoral. Do you think the connections worked well? If yes,
can this arrangement support further scale up? If not, what needs to be changed and can these changes
support a scale-up?

[This form will be translated into Khmer.]
Hello, our names are Alvin Leung and Kimputhevitheavy (Vitheavy) Vonn. Alvin works for UNICEF
Cambodia as an International Consultant and Vitheavy works as an assistant to Alvin.
Viteavy and I would like to spend 35 minutes with you and your classmates to have a discussion. It is to
ask about your experience with the Generation Future programme. A mentee of the programme, [name
of the mentee], came in a few months ago for 2 days to conduct some activities with you.
What you and your classmates tell us are only for us to write a report on the programme. We are here to
assess the programme, not you. This is not a test or an exam at all.
UNICEF will not know who said what in the discussion today. Also, we will not ask for your names today,
so your name will not appear in any documents or reports. You can be very honest about your
experience, and we are here to make sure that this is a safe space for you and your classmates.
Do you see a device on the table? This is an audio recording device. It does not record videos at all.
Only your voices are recorded. The recording made by the device is only for Vitheavy and me. Your
teacher and UNICEF will not have a copy of this. Again, this is to make sure that this is a safe space for
you and your classmates.
Please do not share with others about what your classmates say in the discussion today.
You may not be benefited from your participation today, but your sharing may improve UNICEF’s work
and may benefit other children like you.
It is entirely your choice whether you want to join us in the discussion. If you choose to join, you can
always skip any questions that we ask you or even leave any time you want to. Your decision will not
affect how you are treated by UNICEF or by anyone in the school.

Based on the evaluation findings and following the recommendations provided, the consultant proposed
three changes be made to the programme’s theory of change (ToC); they are indicated in the ToC above
in red. First, input 6 is added. Second, output 7 is added. Third, outcome 2 is reworded.
Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report
Input 6 and output 7 are added following recommendations 2 and 4 made in the evaluation report.
Please see chapter 7 of the report for the details of the recommendations. Please note that, although this
connection is included in the recommendations, its inclusion in the design of the next cycle of the
programme has not been finalised. The final design will partly depend on whether the MoEYS continues
the VMC initiative. More importantly, discussions with relevant ministry and departments are needed to
assess the possibility of establishing the connection.
Rewording of the outcome 2 is proposed to better reflect what the programme is seeking to achieve.
Outcome 2 in the original ToC is ‘improved access to stable employment opportunities for young people’.
In the process of evaluating the programme, the consultant found that the programme in 2022 sought to
achieve this mainly by providing young people with the experience of running social impact projects as
well as opportunities to develop 21st Century Skills and improve confidence. What was also possible in
the change logics but was found to be relatively less prominent was changing how mentors see the
private sector’s roles in helping young people develop the skills needed for stable employment (see
Section 5.3.1). This understanding is based on the findings of the literature review of this evaluation that
the private sector’s involvement in youth skills development was recognised by the government and
development partners and was included in key education policies. However, the evaluation found that
such involvement could not be significantly influenced by this programme alone. To better reflect the
change logics of the programme, the consultant suggests that the outcome be reworded to emphasise
the aim of increasing young people’s employability.
The rewording of outcome 2 should also improve the evaluability of the outcome. This is because, as
mentioned in Section 5.3.6, the evaluation could not assess directly whether access to stable
employment was improved, as most youth participants (i.e., mentees and volunteers) were young and
years away from entering the labour market.
Finally, it is worth noting that the numbers of mentees and social impact projects mentioned in the inputs
are for the programme in 2022. They may change in the next cycles. The consultant recommends that
the number of projects in the next cycle be kept between 15 and 20. This number is for reference only
and is made assuming that there will be no significant increase in financial and human resources
earmarked for the programme. Please see Chapter 7 of the report for details.
