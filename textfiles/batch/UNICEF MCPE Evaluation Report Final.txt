EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and context
The 12 countries and territories1 covered by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Eastern
Caribbean Area (ECA) Office are Small Island Developing States (SIDS) comprising about 2.3 million
people, of which 27 per cent are children. All 12 of these countries and territories are classified as high
or upper-middle-income and as ‘very high’ and ‘high’ on the Human Development Index (HDI). Most
countries in the sub-region carry a high debt burden. Public debt reduces state spending on essential
public services, which is further exacerbated by the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-
19) pandemic.
Evaluation Object
The object of the evaluation was the 2017-2021 UNICEF Eastern Caribbean Multi-Country Programme
(MCP). It covered 12 countries and territories in the sub-region, with an overall budget of about USD 40
million.
The 2017-2021 UNICEF Eastern Caribbean MCP has been developed in alignment with the UN
Caribbean Multi-country Strategic Development Framework (UN-MSDF) 2017-2021 priorities: (a) an
inclusive, equitable and prosperous Caribbean; (b) a safe, cohesive and just Caribbean; and (c) a
sustainable and resilient Caribbean. The programme is defined in the context of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development, the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action
(SAMOA) Pathway and national and regional frameworks.
The overall goal of the 2017-2021 MCP was “an Eastern Caribbean where no child lives in poverty, all
children achieve minimum academic qualifications in a quality, protective and resilient learning
environment and free from violence, neglect, exploitation and abuse.” Three outcomes were designed
to contribute to this goal:
• By 2021, 10% more children and adolescents, particularly boys, access equitable, healthy, safe
and protective learning environments in development and humanitarian contexts
• 30% more vulnerable and poor households – particularly female-headed and large
households - have access to quality social services
• All girls and boys (in and outside humanitarian situations) grow up healthy, resilient and
benefit from improved parenting practices and strengthened child protection systems
There was an unequivocal UNICEF ECA demand to revisit the UNICEF M-CPD, including its
achievements, but also its ability to adapt and flex to unexpected contextual changes, whether climate
change, migration or the COVID-19 pandemic, among other, inevitable crises, including health crises.
The recent eruption of the Soufriere volcano in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is only one example
of these challenges. There is great emphasis now also on “building back better,” increasing the resilience
of the SIDS to inevitable future challenges.
Evaluation Purpose, Objectives, Scope and Intended Audiences
The purpose of this M-CPE was to supports UNICEF learning efforts in enhancing the relevance and
effectiveness of UNICEF programmes in the Eastern Caribbean Area (ECA), particularly by informing the
development of the next Multi-Country Programme 2022-2026.
The objectives of the evaluation were as follows:
9
FINAL REPORT
EVALUATION
• To assess the relevance, effectiveness, coherence and sustainability of the 2017-2021
UNICEF, MCPD and implementation with a particular focus on relevance and connectedness
and a formative and forward-looking focus on the current and evolving ECA context.
• To take stock of the progress made towards the attainment of the development and
humanitarian results, including effects in addressing disparities and inequities; and identify
the most effective implementation strategies and partnerships for UNICEF ECA to adopt for
the next phase of programme development.
• To determine how UNICEF can most effectively position itself, build on its comparative
advantage, and provide specific recommendations to improve the design and relevance of
the 2022-2026 MCP in the ECA and UN-MSDCF.
The evaluation Terms of Reference served as the basis for the thematic, geographic and chronological
aspects of the scope of work. This included its three main components, with a deeper dive into the
issues of child protection, violence and resilience, as well as the UNICEF hurricane and migration
response, also in relation to the COVID-19 crisis. While the MCP generally aimed to implement the
identified priorities and components across the 12 countries and territories, the evaluation also
identified specific case studies on the selected themes described above, in three chosen countries, the
British Virgin Islands, Dominica, as well as Trinidad and Tobago. It covered three and a half years of the
MCP, from the beginning of the current MCP and UN-MSDF to April 2021.
The primary audience of the evaluation was UNICEF ECA Multi-Country Office (MCO) and UNICEF Latin
America and the Caribbean Regional Office (LACRO), with interest also from UNICEF HQ, UNICEF donors,
and other UN agencies, as well as the sub-regional organizations, governments and civil society
organizations implementing related interventions in the 12 countries and territories.
Methodology
The design of the evaluation was non-experimental and theory based, applying contribution analysis
and utilization focused, participatory mixed-methods that included both quantitative and qualitative
data in assessing the effectiveness of the UNICEF MCP approaches adopted in the
current programme cycle against their intended aims. The formative aspect of the evaluation allowed
for conclusions to be drawn on the MCP conceptual framework and UNICEF’s Theory of Change (ToC)
related to how MCP would achieve the goals they were intended for. The theory-based approach was
further strengthened by describing similar interventions, notably child protection and disaster risk
reduction (DRR) in the British Virgin Islands, Dominica, and Trinidad and Tobago. The selected case
study themes particularly explored the adaptation and flexibility of the MCP to intransigent problems
such as violence and the increasingly frequent crises facing the region.
The evaluation relied substantially on secondary data sources, where these were made available to the
evaluation team. Primary data collection methods enhanced existing data or covered identified gaps
and priorities and included the following:
• Perception survey (e-survey)
• Key informant interviews (KIIs)
• Group interviews
Overall, the evaluation sought to improve data quality through the triangulation of findings. This
evaluation was conducted remotely in a context of restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

FINAL REPORT
EVALUATION
Key Findings
Evaluation question 1: To what extent did the MCP objectives (including any adjustment of objectives)
and UNICEF-supported interventions remain appropriate and relevant to the changing circumstances
in the 12 Eastern Caribbean countries and territories?
Main findings: While the original MCP objectives and outcomes were well aligned with both sub-
regional and the priorities of the supported countries and territories, based on document review, e-
survey and interview data, to a degree, they had to be set-aside to due to the need to react to the
sudden-onset disasters, whether hurricanes, COVID-19 or most recently, the volcanic eruption in Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines. The MCP was able to adapt and flex to both the specific national priorities
of supported countries and territories, as well as to the more immediate needs imposed by these
disasters, but the nexus between developmental and humanitarian work is not yet fully integrated,
based on a review of the MCP TOC and interviews.
Evaluation question 2: To what extent did the MCP objectives (including any adjustment of objectives)
and UNICEF-supported interventions remain appropriate and relevant to the needs of children and
young people, especially the most marginalized?
Main findings: While the MCP prioritized addressing the needs of the most marginalized and
vulnerable children, UNICEF relied primarily on governments to identify these populations (with the
exception of Trinidad and Tobago) and major data gaps existed on identifying the poorest and
especially ‘invisible’ or ‘unaccounted’ children, based on a review of poverty data, as well as interviews.
The COVID-19 crisis has generated a new group of marginalized children, but again with limited data.
Strength of evidence: Medium (Low on disability)
Evaluation question 3: What are the major factors influencing the achievement (or not) of the MCP
outputs? (e.g. (a) external factors - political, social, economic; (b) internal factors – implementation
model/structure, quantity, quality, timeliness of delivery). What influence did these factors have on
achievement (or not) of MCP outcomes?
Main findings:
Progress on original MCP outcomes is mixed, based particularly on UNICEF ECA project monitoring
and reporting data. Primarily this was due to the need to recurrently redirect resources to crisis
management, but also due to the highly ambitious and comprehensive MCP, which was not fully
aligned with the means of UNICEF ECA, as indicated through consultations with UNICEF ECA staff in
particular. More progress was made in outcome areas, namely in life-long learning that utilized the full
suite of UNICEF strategies, including evidence-based advocacy for policy change, communication
strategies to influence behavior change and actual service provision, over a long time period. While
some progress was made in the promotion of child protection legislation, actual implementation was
constrained by institutional capacity, as well as deeply entrenched norms that held-back the behavior
change required. The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) demonstrated that the influence of
evidence alone on government strategies and policies was more mixed, with a particular weakness
identified in influencing public expenditure for children. While tracking public expenditure for children
was a key indicator in the MCP results framework, related data was not systematically collected and
analyzed. Generally, monitoring and evaluation, especially data quality remained a concern across the
main outcome areas, with limited adaptation made to these efforts despite the major challenges
posed by the recurrent crises in the region.
(See below for main findings in the three MCP components)
Strength of Evidence: Medium
11
FINAL REPORT
EVALUATION
Main findings:
Education
Progress on original MCP learning outcomes was mixed, based namely on OECS education statistics
from the sub-region, due to the need to shift attention and human resources to disaster response,
according to interviews.
Further progress was made on the availability and quality of early childhood development and positive
behavioral management, the former employing the full suite of UNICEF strategies, from policy advocacy
to the actual provision of related services, but no effect has yet been felt on school retention rates,
especially of more marginalized boys, based on a review of OECS data, the e-survey and interviews.
While initiatives beyond ECD and positive behavioral management may have responded to real
government needs, they were more piece-meal, based on a review of UNICEF ECA reporting.
Strength of Evidence: High
Main findings:
Child protection
While UNICEF has a unique mandate and clear value proposition on the promotion of child protection,
there has been limited progress in reducing child abuse and violence against children, based on
available data on related cases. While some progress has been made on legislation (e.g. in Saint Lucia
and Trinidad and Tobago), actual implementation is constrained by institutional capacity, as well as
deeply entrenched norms in the small communities, based on interviews.
In addition to promoting related policy change, UNICEF ECA has particularly utilized communications
for development to promote related awareness among children, youth, caregivers and the broader
population, based on UNICEF ECA reporting and interviews. There are particular challenges related to
the time required for awareness raising to influence behavior and underlying norms, as well as
measurement issues with assessing related behavior change.
Strength of Evidence: Medium
Main findings:
Social inclusion and child rights monitoring
The flagship data UNICEF data product has been the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), though
its influence, along with other produced data and evidence on government strategies and policies is
more mixed, based on interview data. UNICEF advocacy for the increase of public expenditure for
children is a particular weakness, with also no data regularly gathered on related government
commitments by UNICEF ECA. UNICEF has been extending its mandate into social protection, especially
through the use of its DRR support as a catalyst for broader policy reform (e.g. British Virgin Islands,
Dominica) but its mandate and added-value, also in relation to that of other UN agencies remains less
clear, based on other evaluations and interview data.
Strength of Evidence: Medium
Evaluation question 4: What is UNICEF’s added value in the 12 Eastern Caribbean countries/territories
– particularly in comparison to other UN agencies? Are these strengths a result of UNICEF corporate
features or are they specific to the multi-country Office?
Main findings:
The M-CPD and ToC did not sufficiently capture UNICEF added-value, especially the interlinkages and
synergies between upstream and downstream approaches and between inside-track and outside track
advocacy; the latter being closely linked to the UNICEF established “brand” and excellent
communications, which are among its global assets, based on the e-survey and interview data.
Strength of Evidence: Medium

FINAL REPORT
EVALUATION
Evaluation question 5: To what extent were meaningful partnerships or coordination mechanisms
established with other key actors e.g. government at national and local levels, civil society, NGOs,
academia, other UN agencies etc. to avoid duplication of efforts, miscommunication and clearer
accountabilities?
Main findings:
While relationships and partnerships were well established with government and other UN agencies,
they were not yet fostered with all potential like-minded organizations (e.g. donors, international
financial institutions (IFIs), civil society organizations, private sector), based on the e-survey, whether for
joint advocacy (e.g. to review structural challenges in data, government budgets, government capacity
and implementation challenges, quality of services) or for leveraging additional funding, including more
innovative financing solutions.
UNICEF is committed to UN reform and joint programming (e.g. COVID-19 response), though roles and
operating procedures are not always fully clear, especially in relation to requirements imposed on
implementing partners, based namely on interview data.
Strength of Evidence: Medium
Evaluation question 6: To what extent have UNICEF cross sectoral strategies (capacity building,
evidence generation, communication, advocacy, Innovation, South-South and triangular cooperation
and partnerships, gender and climate change) enhanced the potential for government replication and
scalability in the future? What are the major factors which influence the achievement or non-
achievement of sustainability of the UNICEF programme?
Main findings: UNICEF ECA has emphasized the promotion of systemic change in legislative and policy
frameworks, with a view to generating sustainability, though there has been less measurable effect on
public expenditure in its core intervention areas. Implementation of policy reforms remains a major
challenge, The sustainability of UNICEF interventions over time is a major concern. Both sustainability
and scale require working through national systems and committing government resources. UNICEF
ECA is well-placed, with its close government relationships to catalyze related reforms, but too
frequently they are still limited to individual, finite project interventions or to working with the same,
government counterparts (e.g. at the ministries for education and social affairs). Likewise, monitoring
and evaluation still remains oriented to ensuring accountability of individual projects or programmes.
The mainstreaming of gender, youth and climate change are also critical sustainability factors and have
been insufficiently integrated into the MCP.
Strength of evidence: Medium
Evaluation Question 7: To what extent did UNICEF respond effectively to emergencies during the
period being evaluated (measured against the benchmarks set in the Humanitarian Action for Children
and Response Plan)?
Main findings: Work on DRR was effective in partnership, notably with CDEMA, among other
humanitarian actors. The focus was on the initial emergency response, notably on psychosocial recovery,
safe schools, including critical pedagogical and recreational materials, access to information on good
hygiene, safety and protection, as well as cash-transfer schemes, based on related evaluation, reporting,
the perception survey and interviews. However, as demonstrated by the Child Friendly Spaces for
migrant children in Trinidad and Tobago, frequently emergency measures were not sustainable over
time and required more systemic reform, in this case, for the government to change its policy and admit
migrant children into the regular public school system.
Strength of evidence: High
Evaluation Question 8: To what extent is Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) mainstreamed in UNICEF’s
multi-country programme?
13
FINAL REPORT
EVALUATION
Main findings: DRR and the MCP did not fully incorporate the humanitarian and development nexus,
based on document review, e-survey and interview data.
Strength of evidence: High
Evaluation Question 9: How can UNICEF ECA ensure that its response to COVID-19 is anchored
coherently within its longer-term program in the next M-CPD?
Main findings: While the initial focus of the COVID-19 response was on life-saving awareness raising
about hygiene measures, as well as support for distance learning, a number of issues will remain longer
term concerns, such as the longer-term implications for the newly and most vulnerable children and
social protection for a much larger portion of the population, as a result of the pandemic. While topics
such as blended learning have received a lot of attention, immediate needs, such as addressing
inevitable learning gaps, especially for the most vulnerable who did not have access to digital devices
and distance learning opportunities need to be addressed; also in the context of already existing gender
differences in school retention rates.
Strength of evidence: Medium
The findings of the MCP-E reflect both evidence on the accountability for the performance of the
previous MCP, as well as providing useful lessons-learned for the M-CPD currently under
development. The main, overall conclusions are outlined below. Ultimately, these conclusions and
the recommendations in the final section should support the design of the next M-CPD.

1. EASTERN CARIBBEAN AREA (ECA) CONTEXT
Multi Country Programme Evaluations (M-CPEs) in UNICEF fulfil a key role in identifying lessons which
can inform the design of the next Country Programme Document (CPD).
UNICEF’s M-CPE 2017-2021 and the reasoning behind UNICEF’s approach in the ECA region and aligned
with overall goal- The overall goal of the 2017-2021 MCP is “an Eastern Caribbean where no child lives
in poverty, all children achieve minimum academic qualifications in a quality, protective and resilient
learning environment and free from violence, neglect, exploitation and abuse”.
The MCP-E of UNICEF interventions in Eastern Caribbean (ECA) region was identified by the UNICEF
Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean (UNICEF LACRO) as a priority in its 2017-2021
Management Plan (see Terms of Reference in Annex 1). The evidence and learning from MCP-E are
expected to contribute to the work of UNICEF, partners and allies in the framework of the
implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
1.1 SOCIAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT RELATED TO CHILD PROTECTION IN ECA
REGION
The 12 countries and territories1 covered by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) ECA Office are
Small Island Developing States (SIDS) comprising about 2.3 million people, of which 27 per cent are
children. The largest portion of these children live in Trinidad and Tobago (57.3 per cent).
Figure 1: Distribution of children in the UNICEF ECA
Source: UNICEF. Situation Analysis of Children in the Eastern Caribbean (2019)1
All 12 of these countries and territories are classified as high or upper-middle-income, with a 2019 Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) per capita between US$ 7,463 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to US$
48,511 in the British Virgin Islands.
1 Eight independent countries: Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and
Trinidad and Tobago and four British overseas territories, namely, Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands , Montserrat and the Turks and Caicos Islands.
16
FINAL REPORT
EVALUATION
Eastern Caribbean countries are also classified as ‘very high’ and ‘high’ on the Human Development
Index (HDI), ranging from 58 (Barbados) to 103 (Dominica) out of 189 countries; and this has been the
case for the last decade.2 Most of the islands are dependent on the tourism sector or commodities (e.g.
oil and gas in Trinidad and Tobago). Trinidad and Tobago have the largest economy and population,

FINAL REPORT
EVALUATION
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sub-region enjoyed a relatively stable Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) growth rate of 2.2 per cent, fueled by reconstruction activity in post-2017 hurricane countries,
robust performance of the tourism sector, and positive developments in main trading partner countries
(Canada, United Kingdom (UK) and United States). Dominica, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Turks and
Caicos Islands and Grenada experienced the highest growth rate during this period. Exceptions were
Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, which experienced tepid economic growth at 0.1 and 0 per cent,
respectively9.
Most countries in the sub-region carry a high debt burden. Except for the UK Overseas Territories and
St. Kitts and Nevis, the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2019 was above the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)
target of 60 per cent, and Barbados’ ratio was especially high, at above 120 per cent. Barbados
developed the ‘Barbados Economic Recovery and Transformation Programme’ to address its economic
crisis10. Public debt reduces state spending on essential public services, which is further exacerbated by
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
COVID-19 has impacted the financial year 2020, with the World Bank anticipating an estimated
contraction of 3.1per cent,11 and the Economic Commission estimating a contraction of up to 7.9per
cent12 for the Caribbean and Latin America both excluding Guyana (but including a number of other
countries beyond the UNICEF ECA). The subregion will be affected by falling tourism and remittance
inflows.13 There are particular needs for social protection, including adaptive safety nets, to ensure
government recovery efforts reach the most vulnerable.
The anglophone Caribbean islands are characterized by two-party systems, stemming from the colonial
past, though on a number of islands a single party has dominated the political scene (e.g. Antigua and
Barbuda, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago). The British Overseas Territories also have
elected governments. The British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis, and Trinidad
and Tobago held general elections in 2019 and 2020. In Trinidad and Tobago, a number of women filled
key positions. These political changes presented opportunities for advocacy and positioning children,
adolescents and young people on the political agenda, based on the latest UNICEF ECA Annual Report
2019.14 However, based on consultations, the elderly, as a strong voting constituency, tend to be
prioritized over young people by most administrations in the region.
1.2 CONTEXTUAL CHANGES DURING THE CPD IMPLEMENTATION
Government strategies and priorities

Concerns nevertheless remain in the implementation of these bills and actual service delivery.15

The legislation and policies are one dimension of government commitment. Capacity dimensions, such
as political leadership and will, the ability to network and relate, presence and efficiency of
organizational structures and processes, and the availability of skilled human resources are critical
challenges in the Caribbean, not least due to the small size of the islands and their respective civil
services. Shared challenges also include the rapid turnover of civil servants, including brain-drain
abroad, especially in the social sector, resulting in a lack of continuity in staff knowledge and skills.
Interagency coordination is not a given, especially on issues such as violence and social protection,
which bridged several different ministries and agencies. Based on consultations, strong political
commitment to children and equity was at times overshadowed by a deep interest in the elderly as a
critical constituency. Deeper resistance to confronting socially accepted norms, e.g. on violence, is also
a concern.
1.3 CHILD RIGHTS IN THE SUB-REGION
All ECA countries have signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
between 1990-93, and it was extended by the UK to its overseas territories in 1994. During the last three
decades of the CRC, Latin America and the Caribbean has made significant progress in its economic and
social development, which has had a positive impact on the wellbeing of the population and the
increasing number of children who can exercise their rights. The 2017-2021 UNICEF Eastern Caribbean

MCP is aligned with the UN-MSDF 2017-2021 priorities. Nevertheless, challenges remain and vulnerable
groups of children still face barriers to access basic services and basic protection. Deeply entrenched
social norms also hinder progress on the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Children’s rights are inextricably linked to the rights
of women.

* The Realization of Children’s Rights Index (RCRI) is a grade between 0 and 10 that shows the level of realization
of Children’s Rights in a country. The lower the RCRI is, the lower the realization of Children’s Rights in the country.
The higher the RCRI is, the more Children’s Rights in the country are real and respected. The Realization of Children’s

The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities in three important aspects of human
development—reproductive health, empowerment (measured by proportion of parliamentary seats
occupied by females); and proportion of adult females and males aged 25 years and older with at least
some secondary education; and economic status (expressed as labor market participation and measured
by labor force participation rate of female and male populations aged 15 years and older).
The GII is built on the same framework as the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index. It
measures the human development costs of gender inequality. Thus, the higher the GII value the more
disparities between females and males and the more loss to human development17.
Political representation was an exception in Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Saint Kitts and Nevis, as
well as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, despite demonstrated progress in women’s representation at
the highest level across the sub-region.

1.4 CLIMATE CHANGE
Caribbean countries are extremely vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters. The ECA
region experienced two Category 5 hurricanes between 2017-2019. Hurricanes Irma and Maria wreaked
havoc across five ECA countries and territories in September 2017 affecting 143,000 people, including
39,000 children. A dedicated Humanitarian Action for Children appeal was launched for the response to
the Caribbean hurricanes raising US$11.5 million through international donations during this time.18
Regional efforts included the activation of the regional response roster and a regional supply and
logistics strategy, which included plans for the distribution of emergency supplies.19 The Commonwealth
of Dominica lost two-fold of its 2016 GDP and British Virgin Islands three-fold. Due to the escalating
impacts of climate change, children and youth face significant risks in all areas, from education, health,
water, and nutrition to child protection, which are also exacerbated by environmental degradation.
1.5 MIGRATION
The ECA region experiences different types of migration including internal migration, intra-
regional migration and forced displacement. Reasons for child migration include seeking of
opportunities, reunification with family members who previously migrated, displacement as a result of
gradual or sudden changes in their environment, and to flee from the impact of natural disasters,
domestic abuse, extreme poverty or political instability. Child migrants face economic vulnerabilities
(e.g. payment for health treatment, non-eligibility for social welfare and/ or immigration requirements).
Migration can often also exacerbate sexual exploitation and child labor; and children can be separated
or be victims of trafficking.20
In the ECA region, migration issues are particularly prominent in Trinidad and Tobago. As of late 2019,
there were around 23,400 Venezuelan refugees and migrants living in Trinidad and Tobago and this
number is projected to rise to about 33,400 by the end of 2020.21 Children represent about 17 per cent
of all the migrants.22 The findings from a survey conducted by the International Organization for
Migration (IOM) with UNICEF support in 2019 revealed income generation/employment, medical care,
legal services, food and education being among the top five priority needs of the population of concern.
Access to education continues to be a challenge as migrant children are not able to access the national
education system in Trinidad and Tobago. Based on a recent Knowledge, Attitudes and Perceptions
(KAP) survey, the majority of respondents among the population nevertheless felt that children should
have access to public education and health services.23
1.6 COVID-19
Since the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the sub-region was reported on 11 March 2020 in St. Vincent
and the Grenadines, there have been subsequently 21,972 infected people and 307 deaths in the 12
ECA countries and territories as of the sixth of April 2021. The resulting restrictions have led to both
direct and indirect socio-economic impacts on children resulting from school closure and disruption of

The IMF has termed this the “lost decade” for developing countries, due to high indebtedness. A number
of additional external shocks include reduction of real exports, lowering of export prices, considerably
lower remittances (capital and cash), as well as substantially lower income from the tourism sector. The
repercussions of COVID-19 could erase gains that have been made to date in combatting poverty and
gender inequality.25
Some of the impacts will hit the already most vulnerable households much harder, e.g. in terms of: (1)
their physical well-being (higher morbidity and mortality among those without means to self-isolate,
protect themselves and afford care); (2) lower income (due to rising unemployment/underemployment,
fewer remittances); (3) limited essential goods or higher costs (food, pharmaceuticals); and (4) reduced
access to essential services (such as school closures, limited healthcare).26
There is great emphasis now also on “building back better,” increasing the resilience of the SIDS to
inevitable future challenges.

FINAL REPORT
EVALUATION
The current MCP was drafted to address particularly the following challenges identified at the time of
strategy development:
• Transboundary issues requiring regional approaches
• Equitable access and quality and effectiveness of services
• Limited availability of high quality and timely data for decision-making
• Lengthy national reform processes
• Persistent social norms
• Limited financial and human resources.27
Due to all of these continuing sub-regional challenges, exacerbated by crisis as the “new normal”,
there is a need to revisit the UNICEF M-CPD, including its achievements, but also its ability to adapt and
flex to unexpected contextual changes, whether climate change, migration, the COVID-19 pandemic
or the recent volcanic eruption on Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The evaluation therefore gave
particular focus to understanding if, when and how the MCP evolved in light of changing circumstances
and how this flexibility can be strengthened in the new M-CPD.

2. OBJECT OF THE EVALUATION
The MCP provided the overall strategy of UNICEF in the sub-region and the shared vision and objectives
of all of its components, programmes and projects. The evaluation assessed the performance of, and
drew lessons learned from, the implementation of the Eastern Caribbean MCP 2017-2021, with a view
to informing the design of the next M-CPD.
The object of the evaluation is the 2017-2021 UNICEF Eastern Caribbean MCP.
The Eastern Caribbean MCP was aligned with the UN Caribbean Multi-Country Strategic Development
Framework (UN-MSDF) 2017-2021 priorities, including: priority area (PA) 1 An Inclusive, Equitable, and
Prosperous Caribbean., (PA2) A Healthy Caribbean., (PA3) A Safe, Cohesive, and Just Caribbean., and
(PA4) A Sustainable and Resilient Caribbean. The programme was also defined in the context of the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the SAMOA Pathway and national and regional frameworks.
The overall goal of the 2017-2021 MCP is “an Eastern Caribbean where no child lives in poverty, all
children achieve minimum academic qualifications in a quality, protective and resilient learning
environment and free from violence, neglect, exploitation and abuse” Three outcomes were designed
to contribute to this goal:
• By 2021, 10% more children and adolescents, particularly boys, access equitable, healthy, safe
and protective learning environments in development and humanitarian contexts
• 30% more vulnerable and poor households – particularly female-headed and large
households - have access to quality social services
• All girls and boys (in and outside humanitarian situations) grow up healthy, resilient and
benefit from improved parenting practices and strengthened child protection systems
The current MCP ToC is depicted below:

Figure 4: Current MCP Theory of change

No changes were made to the original UNICEF logical framework or the results chains and frameworks
in the individual programme strategy notes (PSNs). However, the overall UNICEF ToC was revised in
November 2019. It was agreed at inception that it provided sufficient basis for the evaluation. The
approach of the evaluation to the use of this MCP ToC and its revision, with a view to contributing to
the next strategic planning cycle is described in annex 2.
The programme employed a mix of strategies to support the realization of planned outcomes and
outputs, including:
a) Capacity development for policy formulation and implementation, the delivery
of quality services and the creation of demand for services, particularly for the most
excluded and disadvantaged;
b) Evidence generation and policy dialogue and advocacy to inform policies,
programmes and accountability;
c) Innovation, South-South and triangular cooperation and partnerships to
enhance equity focus and address disparities for vulnerable children;
d) Communication to develop social and behavioral-change models and to
complement and enhance social accountability for children’s rights, empowering
communities to demand services and promote positive behaviors
Programme effectiveness of the MCP-E was evaluated through the assessment of the UNICEF MCP
ToC. This included testing the main change mechanisms, including the following (as defined in the
ToR):
26
a) evidence of cross-sectoral (gender, youth, climate change) convergence to achieve higher
results for children;
b) assessment of UNICEF engagement in evidence generation, analysis and use;
c) use of strategies to support behavior change communication; and
d) presence of mechanisms, tools and processes to support effective programme
coordination, implementation and monitoring.
The 2017-2021 UNICEF Eastern Caribbean MCP covered 12 countries and territories in the sub-region,
with an overall budget of about USD 40 million28. Of the four main components, the largest allocation
was made to life-long learning (36%), with relatively even allocations to the other components (safety
and justice for children, social protection and child rights monitoring and programme effectiveness).
Table 4: UNICEF ECA MCP Fund Utilization 2017 -2020
Source: UNICEF, 2017-2020 ECA MCP Budget Allocations use as of 21 September 2020
The response to natural disasters (mainly hurricanes) was mainstreamed across the main components,
while migration had a separate budget-line.
A resource mobilization strategy was developed in 2016. It identified: (i) private sector fundraising; (ii)
traditional sources, such as national committees; (iii) innovative strategies; and (iv) leveraging funds as
key priorities. The UNICEF ECA office was organized (see Figure 5) to support the implementation of the
four MCP components under the leadership of the Deputy Representative and overall responsibility of
the Resident Representative.
28 The Budget and its further breakdown is in the process of being further analyzed by the strategic planning consultant. These results will be integrated
when complete.
27
3. PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION
The main purpose of the M-CPE is to draw lessons learned to inform the design and implementation of
the next 2022-2026 MCP and hence strengthen the relevance and effectiveness of the UNICEF programmes
in the ECA. The M-CPE will contribute to reinforce UNICEF’s ECA organizational learning, strategic
positioning and value proposition in its partnerships, and enhance its accountability to the Governments,
donors, peers and implementing partners.
Broken down in key components, the M-CPE purpose is to:
i. Identify emerging good practices and key lessons learned from the current 2017-2021
MCP to inform the design of the 2022-2026 programme document and its
intervention strategies to respond better to Eastern Caribbean development priorities
and advance child rights; and
ii. Provide an assessment of the relevance, effectiveness, coherence and sustainability of
the country programme and its strategies for (a) understanding the extent to which
the MCP contributing to national development goals and humanitarian priorities; and
(b) determine the extent to which programmes are adequately addressing disparities
and inequities.
With emphasis on informing the design of the new UNICEF country programmes in the ECA, this
independent evaluation had a formative focus, with summative aspects in assessing performance and
programme effectiveness of its current phase.
This also explains why the evaluation was conducted in the past six months; namely, to inform the
development of the next MCP, which will be undertaken in 2021. From a summative perspective, the
evaluation assessed the effectiveness and performance of the current MCP to enhance accountability to
Governments, peers and implementing partners.
There was also an opportunity to instill an evaluative, learning culture in the strategic planning
process. Double-loop learning was encouraged through close engagement of UNICEF ECA staff. The
participation of UNICEF regional and ECA staff in the evaluation demonstrated their commitment to both
evidence and its application to decision-making. Close coordination with the consultant facilitating the
strategic planning process also enhanced the relevance and utility of the MCP-E for this process. This can
only be encouraged in the future, to close the loop between evaluation and planning for the country
programme development cycle. The remote nature of the consultation process nevertheless challenged
close engagement.
During the inception phase of the evaluation internal and external stakeholders called for a strategic
refresh, focusing on the relevance of the MCP, in light of the prevailing context; the “new normal”
characterized by the climate, migration and COVID-19 crises. They also emphasized the need for internal
reform, including UNICEF structures and processes, not least due to the ongoing, overall UN reform
process. The evaluation processes and products were needed now and planned accordingly to inform the
development of the UNICEF 2022-2026 CPD. There was a need to coordinate also with the broader
UNSDCF planning process.
The intended audience of the evaluation included the UNICEF Office for the ECA. Other users
included: UNICEF ECA Multi-Country Office (MCO), UNICEF Latin America and the Caribbean Regional
Office (LACRO), UNICEF ECA technical departments, UNICEF HQ, UNICEF donors, and other UN and the
28
government ministries, agencies and staff responsible for planning and financing, education, justice, social
development, statistics and donor coordination in the 12 countries and territories. It also included the
Eastern Caribbean regional organizations, such as CARICOM and the Caribbean Disaster Emergency
Management Agency (CDEMA), and sub-regional organizations such as the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS), the OECS Commission and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), as well as
the University of West Indies (UWI). They played an important role in implementing, facilitating and
supporting UNICEF humanitarian and development initiatives, and in providing guidance and technical
expertise to address development priorities across the region. Finally, the audience included civil society
organizations and the private sector, that have engaged in UNICEF initiatives, which was crucial as they
played an enabling role in promoting and protecting children’s rights within a rights-based framework.
Children (girls and boys of various ages and abilities), particularly vulnerable children had a particular
interest in the effectiveness of UNICEF programmes to ensure that they enjoyed the same rights as other
children.
4. OBJECTIVES OF THE EVALUATION
The objectives of the evaluation remained as stated in the evaluation terms of reference (ToR):
• To assess the relevance, effectiveness, coherence and sustainability of the 2017-2021 UNICEF,
MCP design and implementation with a with a particular focus on relevance and connectedness
and a formative and forward-looking focus on the current and evolving ECA context.
• To take stock of the progress made towards the attainment of the development and humanitarian
results, including effects in addressing disparities and inequities; and identify the most effective
implementation strategies and partnerships for UNICEF ECA to adopt for the next phase of
programme development.
• To determine how UNICEF can most effectively position itself, build on its comparative
advantage, and provide specific recommendations to improve the design and relevance of the
2022-2026 MCP in the ECA and UN-MSDCF.
5. SCOPE OF THE EVALUATION
The evaluation ToR served as the basis for the thematic, geographic and chronological aspects of the scope
of work. This included its three main components, with a deeper dive into the issues of child protection,
violence and resilience, as well as the UNICEF hurricane and migration response, also in relation to the
COVID-19 crisis. In line with the geographic coverage of the MCP, the evaluation had a sub- regional ECA
scope and was strongly informed by the evidence at the national level of the results, lessons and
experiences emerging from the 12 ECA countries and territories. The evaluation identified specific case
studies on the selected themes described above, in three chosen countries, the British Virgin Islands,
Dominica, as well as Trinidad and Tobago. The M-CPE focused on the 2017-2021 UNICEF MCP and cover
three and a half years of implementation from the beginning of the current CPD and UN-MSDF to the
present (January 2017 to June 2020).
The ToC, its results, pathways of change and assumptions, were reviewed based on the evidence generated
and updated accordingly. The ‘theory of change Strawman’ in annex 2 may contribute to the internal ToC
process for the next M-CPD. It did not undergo a participatory, co-creation process as a part of the
evaluation, due to management concerns about overlap and duplication of these processes.

5.2 EVALUATION QUESTIONS AND EVALUATION FRAMEWORK
The overarching evaluation question for the MCP-E was:
To what extent has the UNICEF 2017-2021 multi-country Programme proved successful in its
Programme delivery, strategic choices and approaches, and what implications are there for the
development of the 2022-2026 Programme for UNICEF?
The final evaluation framework included a list of nine Evaluation Questions (EQ).
The original evaluation questions were examined from a gender and human rights perspective, and in
terms of their evaluability. The questions were further refined on the basis of the ToC review, particularly
with a view to the further specification of outputs and short-term outcomes, but also in accordance with
UNICEF priorities, through the effectiveness sub-questions and judgement criteria. The final evaluation
framework included a final list of 9 Evaluation Questions (EQ). The refined questions, together with relevant
32 ALNAP. Evaluating Humanitarian Action using the OECD-DAC Criteria (2006)
31
judgement criteria, indicators and available means of verification, are summarized in the evaluation
framework in Annex 7.
DAC
5.3 INDICATORS
The indicators in the evaluation framework were derived from the MCP results framework and
complemented with additional indicators and judgement criteria through the desk review and
evaluability assessment. The main aim of the evaluation was to use and strengthen existing indicators and
related data collection to support the existing monitoring, evaluation, learning (MEL) system. Hence, there
was strong reliance on existing metrics and data sources.
Additional judgement criteria and indicators were drafted for new results deemed critical for tracing the
pathway from outputs to outcomes. They related particularly to assumptions and change mechanisms
such as advocacy, capacity and partnerships. They were particularly qualitative criteria; to also explore
why and how change happened/did not happen. These are included in the evaluation framework in chapter
6.
The disaggregation of indicators by gender and other characteristics of vulnerability, such as age, socio-
economic status, region and disability was also reviewed. It was noted that existing indicators and data
collection efforts did not always refer to demographic data beyond age, gender and geographical
location. This demographic data was included in the evaluation data collection efforts.
Through the use of the existing indicators, the evaluation also aimed to strengthen the existing UNICEF
and government monitoring efforts, rather than creating parallel structures. It also contributed to
improving the availability of disaggregated data. Careful attention was nevertheless given to data quality
issues and any weaknesses documented (see Error! Reference source not found. on limitations). The
overall strength of evidence underlying the evaluative statements for each of the main evaluation
questions and criteria was also assessed and summarized based on an assessment of the strength of
evidence (3-point scale) for the main findings.
The evaluation framework was detailed in a standard evaluation framework matrix (see above). In
addition to the usual information, such as the DAC criteria, evaluation questions, indicators and data
collection plans, a more detailed matrix also included sub-questions, analytical tools and the sampling
strategy for each data collection tool. The detailed framework also includes all of the outcomes, outputs
and indicators from the UNICEF Results Framework to further specify the evaluation plans for the
effectiveness question.

6. METHODOLOGY
This section presents the detailed methodology used by the evaluation team to carry out the evaluation
process and respond to the objectives, including the approach taken to sampling and data analysis,
including measures to ensure data quality, as well as coverage of ethical issues and safeguards. Where
the evaluation team have needed to make adjustments and changes to the methodology these are
justified, with the suitability of any methodological changes described and explained to show the logic
of the evaluation process supports the achievement of an objective and triangulated response to the
evaluation questions. The section therefore concludes with a summary of limitations and related
mitigation measures.
The section is structured as follows:
• Evaluation design and methods
• Sampling
• Data analysis
• Data quality
• Ethical issues and safeguards
• Limitations and mitigation measures
The methodology concludes with a section on data analysis, and a detailed description of the data
triangulation method.
6.1 EVALUATION DESIGN AND METHODS
The evaluation was both summative and formative. As it was not possible for the evaluation to draw
conclusions from baseline data and non-intervention comparison groups, it relied on a non-
experimental design using mixed methods. Through the use of a participatory approach, the evaluation
sought to ensure engagement of key stakeholders in the planning of the evaluation, as key informants
and in the validation of evaluation findings.
The MCP-E employed contribution analysis to determine the relationship between UNICEF’s
interventions and programme outcomes. This entailed setting out the MCP attribution problem, the
revision of the ToC throughout the evaluation, and iterative gathering of related evidence to test the
different pathways of change across the three main MCP components.
Contribution analysis reduced uncertainty about i) whether the contribution of the different MCP
interventions made to the observed results through an increased understanding of why the observed
results have occurred (or not!) and ii) the roles played by the intervention and other internal and external
factors.
A case study approach was used to understand programme implementation and programme effects of
some representative components of the MCP-E. This allowed the team to cumulatively bring together
findings from many case studies to answer the evaluative questions.
The data collection aimed to capture a variety of perspectives through both primary and secondary data
sources. Secondary sources were included in a desk review that was undertaken in the inception
phase/evaluability assessment of the evaluation. The evaluation used different data collection methods
and tools, which were developed based on the evaluation questions and matrix in consultation with
UNICEF-ECA and stakeholders (government, NGOs, private partners, etc.). A mixed-methods approach
allowed to draw evidence from both qualitative and quantitative primary and secondary data for a
comprehensive assessment of UNICEF contributions in protecting children rights.
33
This evaluation used two main primary data collection tools, the perception survey and key informant
interviews. Full details on the related tools are presented in annex 6.
As the evaluation has been carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic the section on limitations details
out the challenges encountered, their implications to the methodology and the necessary responses
and adjustments made.
Further details on the utilization-focused, theory-based approach, employing contribution analysis and
case-studies can be found in the Inception Report.
6.2 SAMPLING
A non-probabilistic sampling strategy was considered the most appropriate choice for the theory-based,
mixed methods design that also employed case studies on different UNICEF components and ECA
countries/territories. While non-probability samples generally do not allow for the generalization on
conclusions, the inclusion of three themes and three very different countries did factor in some of the
diversity of the entire population.
The criteria for selecting the priority themes were:
• Utility for UNICEF
• Significant, existential contextual challenges (hurricanes and COVID-19)
• UNICEF performance and results
• Data gaps
The UNICEF components or themes drove the case study sample choice, with a particular interest in
serving the utility of the up-coming planning process and urgency of addressing the challenges of the
COVID-19 context. Therefore, the choice of the UNICEF hurricane and migration response as case
studies for further exploration was a natural one. They also allowed for exploring both shifting from a
humanitarian to a developmental mode of operation and mainstreaming versus specific response,
among others.
In addition to being an intransigent problem in the Eastern Caribbean region, violence and child
protection was identified as a “deviant” case where UNICEF simply had not obtained the same
traction, as in, for example, lifelong learning and child survival over the past decades. Addressing
violence also included some of the cross-cutting challenges of crisis response, as well as the perennial
concern of UNICEF service delivery versus systemic policy and behavior change.
The country selection facilitated comparison of the same UNICEF component in different relational
and spatial contexts, with the chosen sample of Trinidad and Tobago, Dominica and British Virgin
Islands, varying in size, economy, population and even potentially culture. Trinidad and Tobago are
relatively large in geography, economy and child population, while Dominica is substantially smaller,
with the lowest GDP per capita and HDI across the portfolio. Dominica was also destroyed by hurricane
Maria in 2017. UNICEF management was keen to include at least one overseas territory in the sample.
The British Virgin Islands are a very small territory, and substantially wealthier than the Eastern Caribbean
average. Neither the British Virgin Islands, nor Trinidad and Tobago belong to the OECS. The themes of
violence and child protection, as well as migration touch all of the selected islands. Despite the size of
the population, there was less data for Trinidad and Tobago, which was addressed by the evaluation to
some degree.
The table below summarizes the final sample of case studies, the perception survey and KIIs/group
interviews.

The Perception Survey extended across all 12 UNICEF countries and government focal points, as well
as key UNICEF staff, focal points at other UN agencies, and donors. It therefore encompassed the
complete target population of international, regional and national agencies working with UNICEF, as
well as its main non-governmental implementation partners among NGOs and the private sector.
The KIIs and group interviews complemented this overall sample, with more details from the same
stakeholders across the sub-region and in the three selected countries.
Inevitably, any sampling strategy had its limitations and potential bias. These limitations were addressed
namely through triangulation between multiple data sources, including existing data.
6.3 MEASURES TO ENSURE DATA QUALITY
The evaluation set high standards for data quality, both its validity (accuracy of measure) and reliability
(consistency of measure). Data quality standards were employed across the whole evaluation design,
including the approach, methods, data collection tools, data analysis and sampling strategy. Inevitably,
each of the choices made also had its limitations (see also Error! Reference source not found. for
limitations).
Overall, the evaluation sought to improve data quality through the triangulation of findings.
Methodological triangulation relied on existing data sources to anchor this approach. The evaluation
35
framework mapped out the different data collection methods, used to answer each evaluation question.
Data was also triangulated across the sample of countries, themes and respondents. Finally, data was
also triangulated through the use of different members of the team during interviews.
The reliability of the conclusions was strengthened through the case study approach. Even with its
limitations, the cases allowed us to test conclusions across diverse themes and contexts. The validity of
the survey responses was increased through the use of existing definitions and measurement scales
(e.g. capacity definitions and assessment).
Careful coordination across the team ensured the harmonization of the data collection and analysis
approach. We increased the reliability of the interview questionnaire by conducting initial interviews
together. Reliability was also increased by the spot review of data analysis by two team members.
Furthermore, we coordinated the evaluation process carefully with the strategic planning process and
the consultant facilitating the latter, which further ensured the reliability of findings and their utility for
the next M-CPD.
6.4 DATA ANALYSIS
The data analysis process used the evidence gathered to answer the evaluation questions through the
ToC review and related contribution analysis. Figure 5 summarizes the process and relationship between
the evaluation questions, ToC and the data collection, analysis and strength of evidence assessment
process, with the evaluation design and framework guiding data collection and analysis efforts, that
ultimately feed-back to further reviewing and verifying the ToC and answering the evaluation questions.
The strength of evidence assessment explores the strength of each main evaluative conclusion,
allowing for the assessment of their relative weight in relation to each other.
Figure 5: Data analysis model
Contribution analysis (steps 3-6) were undertaken in an iterative fashion throughout the implementation
phase, with data gathered and coded along the pathways of change in the ToC. This data collection also
focused on building an understanding of the ‘why’ and ‘how’ of any changes seen in relation to
assumptions made about the change process, including internal implementation and external
contextual factors. These are both treated in the section Error! Reference source not found..
The case studies strengthened the evidence for the cross-cutting violence and resilience themes,
fortifying related pathways in the ToC. Comparison across the case studies shone further light on
contextual factors and assumptions made. Ultimately, they also provided information on the
organizational factors involved.
The data analysis processed and categorized the data gathered based on the ToC and additional
analytical tools, namely capacity assessment, the social engagement ladder, advocacy matrix, as well as
the rights-based and gender analysis in order to populate the ToC contribution story and answer the
evaluation questions. Further detail on these analytical tools can be found in the Inception Report.
36
Data analysis process
Documentation, e-survey responses, as well as interview notes were analyzed, based on an agreed
coding structure derived from the evaluation framework, analytical tools and the ToC. The analysis
was documented in an evidence matrix.
1. Qualitative data were categorized based on these sources as well as the identified analytical
tools, through a coding process.
2. Evidence was used to test the mechanisms and assumptions outlined in the ToC. It was then
reported on the basis of the evaluation questions.
Quantitative data were cleaned and analyzed using standard mathematical and statistical operations,
such as grouping, calculating averages and data spread. The sample was not large enough to provide
strong statistical rigor. Emphasis was placed on graphics tabulations, to ensure well-structured and well-
presented tables and infographics summarizing the data effectively.
Qualitative data was transcribed and coded, based on an agreed coding protocol. Codes were derived
from the ToC and a number of existing analytical frameworks described below. Active efforts were made
to identify deviant cases and to triangulate data across primary (surveys and interviews) and secondary
data sources.
The inclusion of both quantitative and qualitative data addressed identified data gaps and strengthened
the triangulation of evidence. The inclusion of qualitative data also supported drawing out related
learning of utility to UNICEF.
Strength of evidence
In addition to documenting the process of triangulation in the evidence matrix, the evaluation team
assessed the strength of evidence for each evaluation question. This process established whether the
evaluation conclusions were based on a high level of confidence in the data available, and to identify
where available data may not provide a comprehensive picture.
Table 6: Strength of evidence ratings
Evidence Descriptor
rating
High A high level of evidence is characterized by a range of evidence sources to
corroborate findings, including documentary sources, quantitative and qualitative
sources that allow for robust triangulation; or alternatively evidence sources that
may not be comprehensive but are of high quality and reliable.
Medium Medium evidence will have fewer (3-4) corroborative sources of evidence that allow
for reasonable assessment/triangulation but where evidence coverage is not
complete or where quality of the evidence sources varies.
Low A low level of evidence has 1-2 sources of evidence which from a single data
collection stream (i.e. purely interview/survey data) and there is no possibility for
triangulation.
The evidence strength score is included in the overall findings for each of the evaluation criteria and
questions.
6.5 LIMITATIONS AND MITIGATION MESAURES
Inevitably, any chosen approach, methods, sampling strategy and data collection tools have their
weaknesses. A generative approach to causality, theory-based approach and contribution analysis will
37
never be able to isolate the single variable that is essential for change to happen. This was a design
choice and was not mitigated through the use of counterfactual argumentation.
The concerns raised over the availability, quality and periodicity of data, with variation across the
UNICEF themes and particular issues with obtaining data with a sufficient degree of geographic and
demographic granularity, to truly reach the most vulnerable populations remained throughout the
evaluation process. Data was nevertheless presented, for the countries, territories and time periods
available, with note of the observed weakness.
The secondary data used was what was available, whether in relation to the geographic
breakdown, time series or degree of disaggregation. Generally, the data that was available had been
gathered in a methodologically robust way but triangulation was a challenge, as reporting on the same
data varied between different documents, most probably due to data gathering at different points of
time. Data quality issues and gaps are referred to in respective sections of the report. Generally, data
management at ECA therefore was identified as a major UNICEF ECA challenge.
While data was available for some of the indicators in the MCP results framework, it was 1)
fragmented, 2) not always available for all countries, 3) did not always use consistent definitions of
concepts and terminology, and 4) not always available at baseline and across comparable date ranges.
It was also not accessible in a single, safe place, challenging reliability. Data was nevertheless presented,
for the countries, territories and time periods available, with note of the observed weakness.
Data availability was a particular challenge with children, compounded by the ethical concerns
highlighted in section 7.2, and by current constraints imposed by COVID-19 restrictions on data
collection and direct engagement with evaluation participants. The planned social media poll of the
MCP-E was dropped, to avoid evaluation fatigue, as well as these ethical and practical challenges. The
youth engagement work in the framework of the M-CPD preparation provided both an opportunity to
fill this gap and related challenge. While it provided secondary data on children’s actual views, the
geographic and thematic coverage did not fully match the MCP-E design. This data was nevertheless
valuable on issues such as mental health and climate change.
The response to the perception survey, with 40 out of 55 total potential responses was very good.
However, the total population (55) was not very high and even less representative, when broken down
by geography and type of organization. 10 out of 40 respondents also left a number of questions
unanswered. The representation particularly of different government views across the 12
countries and territories was not very high (5 responses). This data was triangulated with other
sources.
Similarly, the coverage of the KIIs/group interviews was very comprehensive across UNICEF staff,
regional organizations, UN agencies and donors. However, obtaining interviews with government
representatives across the three selected countries and territories was extremely challenging 1)
due to the limited and dated initial list of contacts, 2) the limited number of high-level contacts
(predominantly Permanent Secretaries), 3) limited number of contacts in selected themes (e.g. child
protection, justice, DRR). The coverage of civil society organizations was high in Trinidad and Tobago,
but very low in Dominica (1) and non-existent in the British Virgin Islands, despite efforts to identify
relevant contacts through snowballing. Substantial efforts were made to obtain the correct and
additional contact details and the data collection period was extended well beyond the original plans,
also to accommodate the remote nature of the interviews.
Ultimately, therefore, the drafting of detailed thematic case studies, based on information from
the three countries and territories was not possible. However, this data from the countries is reflected
in each of the relevant sections of this evaluation report, where it was available.
38
We are nevertheless confident that triangulating through the use of mixed methods and data
sources and challenging each other across the team during both data collection and analysis,
mitigated these limitations, resulting in evaluation findings that are rigorous enough and “fit for
purpose” in serving the needs of the UNICEF strategic planning process.
6.6 EVALUATION NORMS AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The evaluation was undertaken in accordance with UNEG Norms and Standards for Evaluation33, UNICEF
Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis34, UNICEF
procedures for Ethical Research Involving Children (ERIC)35 and IOD PARC’s Ethical Code of Conduct
(2018), which adheres to UNEG Ethical guidelines for Evaluation (2008), UNEG Code of Conduct for
Evaluation in the UN System (2007), DFID Ethical Principles for Research and Evaluation (2011) and the
ESRC Framework for Research Ethics and Principles (2012).
IOD PARC’s Ethical Code of Conduct is signed by all staff and associates. The ethical code of conduct
for field work is based on international good practice and draws on a guide published by UNICEF. Field
work consists of any activity which takes place outside the office environment and/or involves contact
with any stakeholders, and it duly applies to this evaluation being conducted remotely36.
All engagement with participants younger than 18 years of age was guided by the standards identified
above. We acknowledge our responsibility to respect the dignity of children; for our research to be just
and equitable, and for the benefit of children. We have ensured that children are not harmed through
their participation in the research, and that their participation in our research was based on their
informed and ongoing consent. We have reflected on the assumption, values, beliefs and practices that
influence our involvement of children in the research process and the impact it has on children.[1]
All members of the evaluation team, including UNICEF’s evaluation manager, are bound by ethical
research principles of impartiality, independence, credibility, accountability and avoiding conflict of
interest. To further ensure that the highest ethical standards are upheld, the Inception Report was
subject to an independent ethical review by HML IRB, which specializes in providing research ethics
reviews to a range of clients, including UNICEF and the World Bank Group.
As this evaluation involved primary data collection from adults and children, the overall ethical
safeguards were applied to all data collection processes are as follows:
• Authorization
o Permission to involve UNICEF staff as data sources for the evaluation was obtained from
UNICEF LACRO and the UNICEF Office for the Eastern Caribbean, as relevant.
o Permission to conduct the evaluation was obtained from relevant authorities in the
countries where primary data was collected[2]. This was facilitated by the UNICEF Office
for the Eastern Caribbean and UNICEF Field Offices in the respective countries, as
relevant.
• Informed consent. The engagement of all key informants and respondents in data collection
activities was based on informed consent. This was incorporated at different stages of the
evaluation’s investigation phase, as follows:
o Voluntary participation based on informants’/respondents’ understanding of the
purpose of the evaluation, the reasons and requirements for their involvement, what
the data collection activity entails and the associated requirements or demands, how

the data will be used and what the potential benefits and disadvantages of participation
might be.
Only those who voluntarily agreed to participate were involved, and those who chose not to participate
were not sanctioned or penalized in any way. The value of including children’s voices as part of the data
collection process has been carefully considered and the evaluation team have determined that it is
integral to the validity of the findings that children’s voices are heard. All work with children has been
done in their best interests and under the ethos of “do no harm”.
• Confidentiality. The management and use of information shared by individuals during the data
collection process was explained to them, and their privacy has and will always be respected.
This included explaining that evidence shared or presented in evaluation reports will be
anonymized and non-attributable, and will be used only for purposes of the evaluation. Non-
anonymized information will not be accessible by anybody other than the evaluation team.
Should the publication or sharing of non-anonymized information be required, this will not be
done without permission.
• Safeguarding of children. Informants/respondents were not asked or encouraged to disclose
child abuse during data collection. However, it will be made clear that the commitment to
confidentiality does not extend to issues concerning the safeguarding or well-being of children.
If a disclosure of abuse, harm or harassment had been made to the evaluation team, we would
have been obliged to make UNICEF aware of this.
• Respect. The autonomy of all informants/respondents to contribute freely to the data collection
process was respected at all times. This included respecting judgements, opinions and choices
they may have expressed that are based in their values, beliefs and lived experience. It also
included creating a safe environment where they could freely express those judgements,
opinions and choices without fear of negative sanctioning.
Introductory (consent) scripts for KIIs/group interviews and the perception survey are in annex 6.
The Team Leader ensured that all members of the evaluation team were familiar with the data collection
tools, protocols and ethical considerations before data collection commenced.
Actions taken during the evaluation process.
The IOD PARC evaluation team initiated an ethics review for a planned ‘Social Media Poll’. In discussion
with the UNICEF senior management team the decision was taken to not use the Social Media Poll as
there was a strong overlap with another survey that UNICEF ECA had commissioned and to avoid over-
burdening participants. The IOD PARC Team agreed to take a joint approach with UNICEF in their survey
which had already completed an ethical review process.37
Safe-keeping of documents and data security
All documents and data collected for the evaluation is stored in digital format on laptops linked to IOD
PARC’s remote Virtual Private Network (VPN), which is password protected and encrypted using
government standard AES-256; security permissions on certain files and folders can be and are applied,
where necessary. IOD PARC operates a Data Protection System which includes procedures and
processes to ensure data is secured and backed up. Data related to this evaluation will be kept on IOD
PARC’s central electronic server for a period of three years, whereafter it will be destroyed.

7. FINDINGS
This section presents the findings of the evaluation, responding directly to all the evaluation criteria and
questions. Available data from the MCP results framework indicators is reviewed, and gaps identified.
Additional information is included from the document review, perception survey and KIIs/group
interviews.
The strength of evidence underlying the main findings is considered and incorporated accordingly. Any
limitations in the data are also noted, particularly in relation to the indicators in the MCP results
framework and availability of related data.
7.1 RELEVANCE TO CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE 12 EASTERN CARIBBEAN COUNTRIES AND
TERRITORIES
Evaluation question 1: To what extent did the multi-country programme objectives (including any
adjustment of objectives) and UNICEF-supported interventions remain appropriate and relevant to the
changing circumstances in the 12 Eastern Caribbean countries and territories?
Main findings: While the original MCP objectives and outcomes were well aligned with both sub-
regional and the priorities of the supported countries and territories, based on document review, e-
survey and interview data, to a degree, they had to be set-aside to due to the need to react to the
sudden-onset disasters, whether hurricanes, COVID-19 or most recently, the volcanic eruption in Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines. The MCP was able to adapt and flex to both the specific national
priorities of supported countries and territories, as well as to the more immediate needs imposed by
these disasters, but the nexus between developmental and humanitarian work is not yet fully
integrated, based on a review of the MCP ToC and interviews.
Strength of evidence: High
The MCP was well aligned with the education and social sector objectives of the supported
countries and territories, as well as with those of the OECS. There was strong alignment with pillar
II of the OECS development strategy, in overall education objectives, addressing juvenile justice and
gender-based violence, as well a supporting the multi-dimensional poverty data and strengthening of
social safety nets, particularly as a part of DRR. Particularly early childhood development, child
protection and social protection were well aligned with the development plans that were available and
reviewed from Dominica, and Trinidad and Tobago, social protection being only mentioned in the
latter.38

According to one interviewee, alignment is largely due to close consultation with governments. “Having
a seat at the table” at high level meetings is therefore a critical success factor.
38 The British Virgin Islands are still in the consultation process of their latest sustainable development plan.
41
UNICEF ECA has also demonstrated the ability to adapt UNICEF support to regional and national
priorities. According to one interviewee, “I like their flexibility, their willingness to work with the regional
and countries’ agenda. They shift accordingly”. The main challenge is that the social sectors generally
remain a low government and donor priority (e.g. related government budget allocations). Among
others, none of the support from the European Union is in the social sectors, besides education
infrastructure.
Some concern remained around the pressure to conform to the UNICEF corporate offer, based on
a few interviews. In a number of cases, matching country priorities with those of the UNICEF MCP
required UNICEF staff support. The credibility and influence of UNICEF, especially personal relationships
with decision-makers were key to the alignment of the joint agenda.
The original MCP objectives and outcomes remain relevant and valid, but were nevertheless
challenged by the multi-country nature of the strategy and programme. The multi-country context
directly affected the: (a) implementation arrangement and partnership with the Governments (level of
ownership, governance, accountability) and (b) planning, monitoring and reporting processes, with
related implications for the Paris Declaration principles. The M-CPD and results framework covered the
sub-region and should have been relevant also to the countries’ contexts. Challenges related to (a)
clarity of the convergence areas and cross-cutting strategies of the M-CPD; (b) plausibility of the logic
and results structures for each country; (c) validity and reliability of the indicators; (d) the aggregation
and disaggregation of information at the country level; and (e) mainstreaming emergency preparedness
and DRR39. The COVID-19 crisis posed particular challenges for feasible models for national programme
planning, monitoring and coordination, notably in relation to the imperatives to connect globally (e.g.
tourism) and the need for rapid adaptation and flexibility, within the complex ECA context.
The current MCP objectives were developed to address a number of fundamental challenges in the
context of a complex operating environment, including also the need to adapt to climate change. The
Eastern Caribbean region is the second most vulnerable to the effects of climate change in the world,
experience more intense and frequent storms.

Moreover, most recently, there has been a global need to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, including
eventually also recovery from its devastating economic and social effect, particularly on the most
vulnerable children. It was not possible to foresee and prepare for these external challenges. The section
below addresses how UNICEF ECA addressed these crises and if and how it had to adapt the original
MCP objectives accordingly.
The MCP was able to adapt and flex to these new challenges. More than ¾ of UNICEF ECA and
LACRO staff felt that the office had successfully adapted to the changing circumstances and crises in
the sub-region.40 This was also confirmed by a number of external interviews. UNICEF’s response to
these crises was largely seen as positive and a demonstration of its capacity to provide swift, effective
and timely interventions. Likewise, its ability to adapt and flex to different needs and situations and to
adapt when regional and countries agendas had to shift was generally appreciated by all respondents.
The downside to this flexible approach was that this would result in less attention and resources being
dedicated to the challenging areas of governments priorities, such as the social sectors.
The impact of climate related disasters, migration and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic have
resulted in the original MCP objectives being set aside, to a degree, since the hurricane response in
2017. Across the three main strategic areas programmatic priorities, 1) education, 2) child protection,
and 3) social protection, the emphasis shifted from addressing longer term root causes of these issues
to a Disaster Risk Reduction and Recovery mode. According to one interviewee, “humanitarian response
(e.g. advocacy, communication and responding to immediate needs) may cloud achievements in the
core three areas”.
Clear learning was demonstrated particularly from the hurricane response to the COVID-19
response in the design of specific programming. A number of interviewees highlighted the strength
of UNICEF’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This demonstrated some clear learning of how to
manage a crisis driven response with a development orientation (primarily in its operational modalities).
This contrasts with the more normal experience where linkages from humanitarian to development work
40 Participatory review of draft MCP-E findings, using www.mentimeter.com
43
are not good, with fault on both sides. In UNICEF’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, development
partners noted the application of good planning and execution with strong collaboration (especially
with PAHO and UNESCO) and communication. In a similar fashion, humanitarian responses can (and
should) be seen as an opportunity to build on more systemic reforms such as social protection in the
British Virgin Islands and Dominica.
The challenge that UNICEF ECA faced and is currently facing is the separation of development
and relief/humanitarian work. The current approach emphasizes a focus primarily on one or the other.
To effectively engage in both and work in the humanitarian/ development ‘nexus,’ with crisis as the new
normal, requires a different approach to achieving longer term objectives, in effect re-visiting the
pathways of change, mainstreaming DRR and resilience and addressing the ‘missing middle’ between
programme outputs and results.
7.2 NEEDS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN AND YOUTH
Evaluation question 2: To what extent did the MCP objectives (including any adjustment of
objectives) and UNICEF-supported interventions remain appropriate and relevant to the needs of
children and young people, especially the most marginalized?
Main findings: While the MCP prioritized addressing the needs of the most marginalized and
vulnerable children, UNICEF relied primarily on governments to identify these populations (with the
exception of Trinidad and Tobago) and major data gaps existed on identifying the poorest and
especially ‘invisible’ or ‘unaccounted’ children, based on a review of poverty data, as well as
interviews. The COVID-19 crisis has generated a new group of marginalized children, but again with
limited data.
Strength of evidence: Medium (Low on disability)
The MCP 2017-2021 emphasized the focus on addressing the needs of the most vulnerable
children, but it was not always clear who the vulnerable children were in a given instance. It
identified the most vulnerable and poorest stakeholders as: (a) children of migrants and “left-behind”
ch ildren; (b) out-of-school children, mainly boys, and children who fall out of the education, health and
protection systems; (c) pregnant teens and young mothers; and (d) children from single-parent
households.41 The situation analysis confirmed this breakdown and added children without parental
care, disabled children and/or child victims of violence, abuse or neglect and children living in
economically vulnerable households, as a well as a focus on children at most at risk for multiple
deprivations.
Gaps included an absence of data on vulnerable groups or ‘invisible’ or ‘unaccounted’ children18,
such as migrant children and children under the age of five (especially those without access to structured
services). This was confirmed through at least a few interviews, which were more critical of UNICEF ability
to reach the most vulnerable children, especially un-registered migrant children, living in rural
communities. Most also noted the multi-dimension and dynamic nature of poverty; the latter
particularly pertinent due to the COVID-19 induced new poor.
Most noted that UNICEF depended on governments in the identification of most vulnerable groups,
which was not always reaching those most excluded. However, it was also challenging in Trinidad and
Tobago, where UNICEF worked namely with civil society organizations. There were particular challenges
in reaching un-registered children in more rural settings and newly arrived migrant children. Moreover,
41 UNICEF ECA MCP, 4
44
government systems were not always strong enough to measure vulnerability, especially its dynamic
nature.
UNICEF processes and technologies were also not always adapted to identification of all the most
marginalized populations. The current communication campaigns, focusing on social media may not
be as effective as grassroots engagement (e.g. through civil society organization partnerships) in
reaching the most vulnerable groups. This also applied to some of the other methods employed in
research. The “perceived geographic cap in JECT GIS methodology and poor coverage of community
groups (40 per cent of country) excluded many farmers, fishermen and people working in the tourism
industry”.42
While there was a UN-wide remit to focus on disability, there was limited government interest.
There were more than a million people in the Caribbean living with some form of disability, and an
estimated 250,000 who experience significant disabilities. “Persons with disabilities (PWDs) faced a
range of physical, social, attitudinal and institutional barriers that prevented their full and effective
participation in society on an equal basis with others. As a result, they experienced less favorable
outcomes in health, education, employment and housing”.43 There was a need to ratify and implement
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). With the exception of St. Kitts and
Nevis, all ECA countries and territories have signed the CRPD. However, it is yet to be ratified by Grenada,
Saint Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago. Based on the State of the World’s Children (2013), ECA
supplement, “a great deal more needs to be done to enable persons with disabilities to maximize their
potential to actively participate in society”. This included areas such as early detection, affordable access
to services, quality aids and devices, access to mainstream education, employment opportunities, social
protection, financial aid and welfare services, recreation sport and leisure, transportation, as well as
related legal reforms. Based on the review of documents and consultations, disability has not received
sufficient UNICEF attention. Only one of the government interviewees raised the issue, without
prompting.
There is now a new population of marginalized children resulting directly from COVID-19.
According to interview data, 45-50 per cent of students have not logged onto distance learning across
the sub-region. One interviewee described them as “the “new poor” battling distance learning alone at
home”.
7.3 EFFECTIVENESS
As demonstrated in the section above, the focus of UNICEF ECA and the MCP successfully pivoted to
addressing disasters, first the hurricanes, then the migration response in Trinidad and Tobago, and then
COVID-19 in the sub-region. This however also implied that progress on original MCP outcomes was
mixed, due to the need to shift attention and human resources to disaster response.

Evaluation question 3: What are the major factors influencing the achievement (or not) of the multi-
country programme outputs? (e.g. (a) external factors - political, social, economic; (b) internal factors –
implementation model/structure, quantity, quality, timeliness of delivery). What influence did these
factors have on achievement (or not) of multi-country programme outcomes?
Main findings:
Progress on original MCP outcomes is mixed, based particularly on UNICEF ECA project monitoring
and reporting data. Primarily this was due to the need to recurrently redirect resources to crisis
management, but also due to the highly ambitious and comprehensive MCP, which was not fully
aligned with the means of UNICEF ECA, as indicated through consultations with UNICEF ECA staff in
particular. More progress was made in outcome areas, namely in life-long learning that utilized the
full suite of UNICEF strategies, including evidence-based advocacy for policy change, communication
strategies to influence behavior change and actual service provision, over a long time period. While
some progress was made in the promotion of child protection legislation, actual implementation was
constrained by institutional capacity, as well as deeply entrenched norms that held-back the behavior
change required. The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) demonstrated that the influence of
evidence alone on government strategies and policies was more mixed, with a particular weakness
identified in influencing public expenditure for children. While tracking public expenditure for children
was a key indicator in the MCP results framework, related data was not systematically collected and
analyzed. Generally, monitoring and evaluation, especially data quality remained a concern across the
main outcome areas, with limited adaptation made to these efforts despite the major challenges
posed by the recurrent crises in the region.
The effectiveness questions particularly test the three main pathways of change in the MCP ToC: 1) Life-
long learning, 2) Security and justice for children, and 3) Social equity and child rights monitoring, along
with the external and internal factors both supporting and challenging the achievement of related
results. Cross-cutting change mechanisms, a) evidence generation, analysis and use (e.g. advocacy), b)
strategies to support behavior change and communication, c) effective programme coordination,
(see below for main findings in the three MCP components)
implementation and monitoring, as well as d) cross-sectoral (gender, youth and climate change)
convergence are treated across the three main outcome areas, where relevant and in greater detail

among the internal factors. A more thorough analysis of climate change and gender issues is provided
in relation to the sustainability of the MCP.
7.3.1 Life-long learning
Education remains a key focal area for UNICEF ECA, with an emphasis particularly upon early
childhood education. The role of UNICEF in the education sector was recognized as relevant and
effective, across the conducted interviews, which speaks particularly to its strong recognition and
presence in the sub-region. Almost 80 per cent of the evaluation e-survey respondents felt that UNICEF
was delivering results in access to healthy and safe learning environments, as compared to about 60 per
cent in child and social protection respectively.44

Further progress was made on the availability and quality of early childhood development and
positive behavioral management, the former employing the full suite of UNICEF strategies, from
policy advocacy to the actual provision of related services, but no effect has yet been felt on school
retention rates, especially of more marginalized boys, based on a review of OECS data, the e-survey
and interviews.
While initiatives beyond ECD and positive behavioral management may have responded to real
government needs, they were more piece-meal, based on a review of UNICEF ECA reporting.
Strength of Evidence: High
ECD enrolment has increased. This indicator was included in the original MCP results framework and
was tracked through OECS statistics, which were updated in the latest UNICEF ECA Situational Analysis.
In the ECA, on average, 71 per cent of children aged 3-4 are enrolled in early childhood education,
including 75 per cent of girls and 69 per cent of boys.45 However, only Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis and
St. Lucia met the MCP results framework target of 80 per cent enrolment, based on available data.
Whereas almost all primary school age children are in school, about 20 per cent of early childhood age
children are not enrolled.46 Table 9 below summarizes the ECE enrolment data across the sub-region.

Based on more recent interview information, the sub-region has been reporting that approximately 80
per cent of children in the 3-5 age group and approximately 40 per cent of children 0-2+ are
participating in registered ECD programmes. It is known however that a significant percentage of
children are also being cared for in the more informal home-based care services, which brings the focus
on quality (e.g. care, protection).
There is insufficient, comparable data on the quality of pre-primary education outcomes, including the
MCP results framework indicator tracking progress of ECD aged children in different developmental
domains across the sub-region.
Governments have also made efforts to expand ECD services from largely private provision to
public support, especially in more vulnerable communities. Governments (Barbados, Grenada, St. Kitts
and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Vincent and the Grenadines) either
established or increased the number of government operated ECD Centers to meet the needs of young
children in their vulnerable communities. According to an interviewee, UNICEF has also supported the
provision of materials and equipment to upgrade learning environments to promote active play and
learning.
UNICEF ECA has contributed to the improvement of the quality of ECD, even though the relevant
indicator was not monitored. This included supporting ECD policy, regulation and standards’
development and implementation, curriculum development together with the OECS, knowledge
sharing, workshops, training, including training of trainers. The regional, child-centers curriculum
framework was developed together with the OECS and launched in Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and
Saint Lucia.48 It focused on identifying and responding to developmental delays and to use
communication and play approaches to support holistic development of young children.49 UNICEF also
facilitated the preparation of a White Paper on Teacher Education addressing standards for Teacher
Educators, together with key partners. Knowledge was also shared across the region, at the regional
early childhood research conference held in Antigua and Barbuda in February 2018. UNICEF also
supported the Child Development and Guidance Centre in St. Lucia and the Special Education
Department in Grenada to strengthen the skills of 85 national counterparts in St. Lucia, Grenada and St.
Vincent and the Grenadines in early identification and intervention for children with developmental
delays. This experience will serve as reference in the other countries and territories covered by UNICEF
ECA.50
Arguably, the training interventions have had broad reach across the sub-region. By 2020, across
ECA-programme countries 141,678 children and adolescents from early childhood, primary and
secondary levels, and 8,424 parents, caregivers, education professionals and policymakers benefited
from initiatives implemented within the COVID-19 response plan, School Safety Protocols, Safe School
programme and Care for Child Development frameworks.51 At the same time, efforts have even
extended to single families and parents, as in the case of Nevis.52 Most recently, advocacy has focused
on the “Early Moments Matter” theme.
The training efforts may even have had copying and replication effects, promoting sustainability.
According to an interviewee in Dominica, “there are 800 pre-schools now. Many people trained by
UNICEF went and opened their own schools”. Efforts have also been made to influence related national
policies and budget allocations; though the latter has not yet borne visible results. This included cost-

benefit analysis in the ECD sector in Saint Kitts and Nevis, as well as an assessment of systems available
for early identification and intervention in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Grenada to increase
access and quality of ECD services.53 A budget analysis in the British Virgin Islands and Montserrat
demonstrated the limited investments in ECD, resulting in related advocacy.54 According to one
interviewee, the ECD budget allocation has also increased in some instances. However, it does not
appear that the allocation for ECD in the British Virgin Islands has increased, based on interview data.
Despite being and indicator in the MCP results framework, budget data was not systematically available
across the 12 countries.
There is growing evidence that ECD may also promote school retention rates, which are a major
sub-regional challenge, particularly for boys, though this still needs to be borne out in practice.
“Findings since the 1960s have indicated that preschool programmes can enhance children’s cognitive
skills, literacy and social skills necessary for school success, as well as promoting school achievement in
elementary trades, reducing the need for special education and grade retention, reducing the risk of
delinquency and increasing levels of educational attainment.55 According to a more recent meta-
analysis of 22 high-quality experimental and quasi-experimental studies conducted between 1960 and
2016, participation in ECE leads to statistically significant reductions in special education placement and
grade retention and increases in high school graduation rates.56 Therefore, the UNICEF ECA focus on
ECD has particular merit in addressing the identified problems in the region, whether grade retention
or graduation rates, particularly of boys, though they remain less represented in the ECD enrolment
statistics.
Primary and secondary education
MCP Results Framework Indicators:
Number of countries with gender-and child-responsive social protection and education policies
and strategies
Percentage of children and young people: (a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the
end of lower secondary achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii)
mathematics, by sex
Lower secondary education completion rate, by gender
Percentage of students who are over-age for grade in primary education, by gender
Generally, school enrolment was high across the sub-region, based on education statistics, namely
from the OECS. Whereas almost all primary school age children are in school, 12 per cent are not
enrolled in secondary school.57 The net primary school enrolment rate is the lowest in Dominica and the
British Virgin Islands at 83 and 80 percent respectively, with a slightly higher proportion of boys (4
percent more) enrolled in the British Virgin Islands. Similarly, net secondary school enrolment rates are
also lower in the British Virgin Islands, at 69 percent. Although drop-out and repetition rates are low,
over 60 per cent of these are boys. Data at the outcome level of the MCP ToC on secondary school
completion rates are not available, as defined in the MCP results framework.
Learning outcomes remained a concern, particularly among boys, based on available OECS
education statistics. Only one out of three secondary school students (31 per cent boys, 37 per cent
girls) meet the required level of learning qualifications, measured by ‘pass’ rates of the Caribbean

Secondary Education Certificate examinations.58 For decades, “virtually all education indicators favor(ed)
girls, starting with primary level examination performance and carrying through Caribbean Secondary
Education Certificate (CSEC) sitting rates to tertiary enrolments”.59 Dominica students perform better
than average on standard tests in both English and mathematics. Secondary school students (31 per
cent boys, 37 per cent girls) meet the required level of learning qualification.
However, data at the outcome level of the MCP ToC on learning qualifications, specifically in reading
and math, is not available for grades 2/3, as per the MCP results framework.
There are substantial gender differences in both retention and graduation, with boys being almost
twice as likely as girls to repeat a grade or drop out at the primary and secondary levels. The percentage
of over-age children in primary education has increased (13per cent), rather than reducing (by 20 per
cent) as per the targets in the MCP results framework and gender differences persist. Gender disparities
are evident in education system data on transition from lower secondary to upper secondary (Form III
to Form IV), with male students experiencing significantly higher rates of educational breakdown than
girls. Repetition rates for both primary and lower secondary revealed that 8 per cent of boys repeat a
grade, compared to 4 per cent of girls.60 The ‘Out of School Study’ in partnership with UWI, OECS and
the CDB covering five countries highlighted these issues,61 but UNICEF ECA has not been able to catalyze
related changes.
There has been little change in bullying (at school), with a slight increase (average of 2 per cent across
sub-region) of bullying experienced by girls, rather than the overall target of a 40 per cent reduction, as
per the MCP results framework.
Little to no focus has been given to identifying the skills needs of the private sector and matching
educational support programmes to these needs (e.g. private sector coordination, technical and
vocational training and education). Based on the most recent engagement of children and young people
in Montserrat, the most pressing concerns voiced related to increasing access to vocational and
technical training that opens up job opportunities.62
The main UNICEF focus was on positive behavioral management. It was integrated into the teacher
training curriculum, in collaboration with the University of the West Indies, “facilitating the transitioning
from ad hoc in-service workshops to a more sustainable pre-service approach”.63 Prior to the hurricanes,
58 per cent of primary schools and 39 per cent of secondary schools in eight countries confirmed having
implemented positive behavior management strategies that, directly and indirectly, contributed to
reduced tardiness, truancy, noise levels and use of corporal punishment, as well as improved student
participation and parental involvement.64 45 facilitators (at least three per country) were trained and
committed to replicating the training in their countries. Additional support was provided to assist in this
task and during the last six months of 2018 these facilitators trained an additional 1,182 teachers in nine
countries, impacting 28,300 students. These actions were complemented with other communication for
development (C4D) strategies, contributing to more holistic changes in school practices, student
engagement and ultimately, improved learning and student behavior65.

Initiatives beyond ECD and positive behavioral management, though maybe responding to real
government needs, were piece-meal, with limited data available. Progress was also made in using the
Teacher Simulation Model, strengthening of student councils, delivery of health and family life
education (HFLE), enhanced parental involvement,66 the translation of learning outcome data into
decision-making.67 Generally, beyond ECD and some advances in the spreading skills in positive
behavioral management, UNICEF ECA fell short of its original education objectives, namely as efforts
were overtaken by the management of consecutive crises (see next section).
7.3.2 Security and Justice for Children
Child protection
Main findings:
While UNICEF has a unique mandate and clear value proposition on the promotion of child
protection, there has been limited progress in reducing child abuse and violence against children,
based on available data on child abuse and child protection cases. While some progress has been
made on related legislation (e.g. in Saint Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago), actual implementation is
constrained by institutional capacity, as well as deeply entrenched norms in the small communities,
based on interviews.
In addition to promoting related policy change, UNICEF ECA has particularly utilized communications
for development to promote related awareness among children, youth, caregivers and the broader
population, based on UNICEF ECA reporting and interviews. There are particular challenges related to
the time required for awareness raising to influence behavior and underlying norms, as well as
measurement issues with assessing related behavior change.
Strength of Evidence: Medium
Child protection is a key UNICEF mandate, recognized by all stakeholders. According to Aloys
Kamuragiye, the UNICEF ECA Representative, “compared to 30 years ago (the time of the ratification of
the CRC), children in the Eastern Caribbean enjoy far better their rights to survival and development.
The biggest challenge now is their protection against violence.”68 Over two out of three children are
subject to physical and psychological violent disciplining by parents or caretakers69.
The perceived added-value of UNICEF on the topics of corporal punishment and violence against
children (VAC) are indisputable among all interviewees. According to one interviewee, UNICEF ECA is
extremely active in child protection, corporal punishment and abuse-related issues through human-
rights based programming; all being very serious problems in the Caribbean. VAC, particularly in the
form of violent discipline at school and in the home is endemic in the region. UNICEF has placed
emphasis on strategies for preventing and eliminating VAC in the broader Caribbean and Latin American
region, with a focus on strengthening capacity (both personal and institutional), key partnerships and
the generation of evidence, as well as awareness raising.70 There was greater focus in the UNICEF ECA
sub-region on communications for development type initiatives.

Data on child protection was a major challenge, with limited data available and gathered on the
indicators in the MCP results framework.
MCP Results Framework Indicators:
Number of countries able to ascertain attrition rates in sexual offences and domestic violence
cases by procedural stage (police and courts)
Number of countries in which the number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000
population has decreased
Number of countries with a decrease in the number of women and men reporting experiences of
physical and sexual violence
Percentage of students experiencing bullying, corporal punishment, harassment, violence, sexual
discrimination or abuse
Children (2-14 years) (1-14) who experience violent disciplinary practices by an adult member of
the household
Girls (15-17 years) who have ever experienced sexual violence
Children in detention per 100,000 child population
Children (0-17years) living in residential care, with disaggregated target ages and a specific target
for children 0-3years
Different types of child abuse continue to be prevalent across the sub-region. Around 2,300 cases
of child abuse are reported to the authorities annually in ECA countries and territories, of which 35 per
cent are related to sexual abuse, 34 per cent neglect, 25 per cent physical abuse and 10 per cent to
emotional violence. The table below summarizes cases of violence against children that were reported
to authorities across the sub-region in 2018.

It is challenging to calculate how these data relate to the MCP results framework baseline and target
data, which is expressed in percentages. Taking just the case of Saint Lucia, where data was available
from different sources, the reported cases of physical violence represent about 10 per cent of the
population. In comparison with the baseline data from the MCP results framework, this was substantially
lower than the baseline figure of 67.5 percent of children who had experienced violent disciplinary
practices by a parent. Comparable data was also not available for Trinidad and Tobago. This example
demonstrates some of the data related challenges described across the evaluation report.
Bullying has also increased, notably also among girls. In Trinidad and Tobago, between 2011 and
2017, there was an 8 percent increase in the proportion of children (aged 13- 15) who experienced
bullying in the 30 days prior to the survey. More specifically, there was a 5 percent increase among boys
and a 9 percent increase among girls. Likewise, there was a 7 percent increase from 2011 to 2017 in the
proportion of children aged 13-15 who had been in physical fights in the 12 months prior to the survey
in Trinidad and Tobago. There was an 8 percent increase for boys and a 6 percent increase for girls.
While there is little gender difference in bullying, boys (49 per cent) are significantly more likely to
engage in physical fighting than girls (29 per cent). Children in Barbados and British Virgin Islands were
least likely to experience bullying.
Most ECA governments are working on related policy formulation and the development and
implementation of systems and structures to support the new child justice laws, with some
progress being made. All countries now have new draft legislation in at least one of six agreed priority
areas. Moreover, some countries have approved, and started implementation of, these new laws.72 Eight
of 12 countries now have national child abuse reporting and management protocols and two countries
have justice systems that comply with the minimum standards laid down in the Beijing Rules of Justice,
with another four very close to meeting these standards.73 For example, on 20 November 2018, the
Government of Saint Lucia passed the Child Justice Bill and the Children’s Care, Protection and Adoption
Bill.74

The case studies in Dominica and Trinidad and Tobago also demonstrated progress being made in other
countries and territories. Child justice legislation has been developed in Dominica and is awaiting
Cabinet approval and enactment. In addition, 325 children have been diverted/given alternatives from
arrest or custodial sentences, representing a more than 300 per cent increase in the use of diversion in
Dominica, through a non-governmental initiative directly with the magistrate court. However, there was
no direct UNICEF role in this non-governmental initiative.

Child protection policy and case management: Case study in Trinidad and Tobago
The Child Policy 2020-2030 in Trinidad and Tobago was perceived as ground-breaking in the sub-
region. It was prepared in a highly consultative fashion and has also “emphasized the importance
of inter-agency coordination and efficiency in service provision; establishing timelines for case
management and handling cases from one agency to the other,” according to an interviewee. A
Child Abuse Protocol is under preparation that will further cement these processes.
The success of the Trinidadian Family Court experience and its recognition over the last 12 years
remained the region’s best practice in the administration of family and children’s justice.1 Efforts
have been made for other countries to learn from this experience (e.g. Antigua and Barbuda).
In Trinidad and Tobago, an urgently required upgrade of the case management system is also
under way. Primero™ is an open-source software platform that helps social services, humanitarian
and development workers manage protection-related data, with tools that facilitate case
management, incident monitoring and family tracing and reunification (www.primero.org) There is
also an ambition to roll out the MIS across relevant agencies, though this is still in progress.
Nevertheless, the Children’s Authority still does not have sufficient human resources to manage
the current case load of about 27,000 cases per year. They have the staff to take care of about
10,000, which entails a 60 per cent backlog.
Progress has also been made on the legal ban of corporal punishment. There is no legislation
currently against corporal punishment in the home setting across the sub-region, and very few countries
have banned it in other settings across the sub-region. In St. Lucia, it was abolished fully in May 2020,
with clear, traceable influence of UNICEF ECA in this decision. Among the selected case study countries,
Trinidad and Tobago is the most advanced in the banning of corporal punishment in different settings
beyond the home. In British Virgin Islands, some progress has been made on the banning of corporal
punishment in institutional settings. According to interviews, progress on Child Rights in the OCTs was
driven particularly by pressure from the UK and others. In Dominica, legislation did not yet exist, though
awareness raising has taken place through various activities (e.g. parental workshops, radio
programmes, booklets). According to one interviewee, in Dominica “they will tell you that is rarely
practiced”. According to another interviewee, generally acceptance of corporal punishment has reduced
in public and at the school level across the sub-region.

Having legislation in place, does not mean that it is effectively implemented in practice. At the
sub-regional level, over two out of three children are subject to physical and psychological violent
disciplining by parents or caretakers26. Adults in Trinidad and Tobago (27 per cent) and Grenada (31 per
cent) are the least likely to support the banning of corporal punishment. Parents in Trinidad and Tobago
are also the most likely to use corporal punishment, according to the same data.
The legislation and policies are one dimension of government commitment. Capacity dimensions, such
as political leadership and will, the ability to network and relate, presence and efficiency of
organizational structures and processes, and the availability of skilled human resources are critical
challenges in the Caribbean, not least due to the small size of the islands and their respective civil
services. Shared challenges also include the rapid turnover of civil servants, including brain-drain
abroad, especially in the social sector, resulting in a lack of continuity in staff knowledge and skills.
Interagency coordination is not a given, especially on issues such as violence and social protection,
which bridged several different ministries and agencies. Based on consultations, strong political
commitment to children and equity was at times overshadowed by a deep interest in the elderly as a
critical constituency. Deeper resistance to confronting socially accepted norms, e.g. on violence, is also
a concern.
Actual experience with violence appears to continue. Violence and abuse remain prevalent across
the sub-region, being among the highest in the world, with a substantial risk to increase due to COVID-
19.

Textbox 1: Violence against Women and Girls in the Caribbean
Prevalence of violence against women and girls (VAWG) in the Caribbean is among the highest in
the world. VAWG has proven to be so entrenched and normalized that both men and women have a
high tolerance for its manifestations, particularly when perpetrated in the context of intimate
partner relationships. Across five countries (Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname, Trinidad and
Tobago), on average, nearly 1 out of 2 or 46 per cent of ever-partnered women aged 15-64 have
experienced one or more of the four types of intimate partner violence (IPV) in their lifetime
(physical, sexual, psychological and/or economic violence) and 14 per cent experience one or more
of the three types of IPV (physical, sexual and psychological violence). The intergenerational
transmission of domestic violence paradigm suggests that violence is learned in childhood and
transmitted across generations; thus, exposure to domestic violence in childhood is an important
predictor for IPV in adulthood. Although 70 per cent of victims agreed that domestic violence
should not remain a private matter, few had informed a health professional (13 per cent) or the
police (5 per cent).
(UNICEF. Gender and Children in the Eastern Caribbean Area, 2020)
The prevalence of sexual violence against children, especially girls is high, with 25 per cent of young
women aged 18-29 years having experienced sexual violence by the age of 18 in Trinidad and Tobago28.
About 90 per cent of sexual abuse victims are girls, most in the 12-16 age group. Virtually all
perpetrators are male and known to the victim. According to U-Report in Trinidad and Tobago, 79 per
cent of girls have experienced or witnessed violent crime (as compared to 21 per cent of boys). While
over 70 per cent had reported the crime, in 80 per cent of the cases it remained unresolved. The
resolution of cases has been attributed namely to the police by the U-report respondents.
Sex trafficking is also a problem in Trinidad and Tobago, with traffickers increasingly targeting
vulnerable foreign young women and girls aged 15-21, notably from Venezuela. According to one
interviewee, reporting is up in Trinidad and Tobago, with an increase in emotional abuse cases in
particular. So far, however there is no apparent impact from COVID-19, though reporting may be
difficult”. One of the greatest challenges is that corporal punishment is a socially accepted means of
discipline in the general population. According to one interviewee, “we still believe beating children is
ok. It is not frowned upon. You can beat them, but not abuse them; corporal punishment within reason”.
The negative social norm is further reinforced by the small size of the communities and islands in the
sub-region. According to one interviewee, “the perpetrator is bound to be well known within the
community.”
UNICEF ECA has increased emphasis on communication for development (C4D) specifically on
corporal punishment and VAC, also during the last MCP period. While the Break the Silence campaign
was launched during the previous strategic programming period, related capacity-building workshops
in nine countries and communication efforts continued. This led to heightened media coverage of child
abuse cases in these countries and public calls for improved child protection services. Debate around
the persistent problem of child sexual abuse in the ECA dominated public discourse on social media.
Communication and advocacy therefore have been directed not only at governmental decision-makers,
but also other key stakeholders; though one interviewee felt UNICEF could improve the identification
and use of related entry points beyond government. Continuous efforts have been made to raise
awareness, among children and adolescents, but also teachers and care-givers. Some of the interviewees
felt that UNICEF could do better at reaching-out to relevant civil society organizations and operating at
the community (versus national, legislative) level; also with teachers and parents. There was a need to
“wean them off” of corporal punishment, with greater education and the provision of alternatives. More
58
support may be needed particularly for households and parents (e.g. greater paternal responsibility for
childcare vs. being the “punishers,” greater psychosocial support for families). According to another
interviewee, the related messages were still somewhat top-down, “Don’t beat your children”, which
potentially demonized parents, especially single-mothers. At the same time, according to another
interviewee, frontal confrontation, like the work of some NGOs, may be counterproductive in the region.
Translating these communication materials and efforts into actual behavior change remains a challenge;
also from the point of view of measuring this change.
Prevalent social norms evolve only slowly over time. According to one interviewee, change is a long
process and cannot be achieved in 4-5 years. Each programme cycle builds on the last and slowly
creating a better environment legally, politically and culturally. “It is hard to say that things have change
because they take time”.
Obesity and mental health among children and adolescents are emerging issues. It is estimated
that 10 per cent of children under five are overweight. By the time they reach adolescence, close to 30
per cent are overweight. A contributing factor is lifestyle, as data shows that only one in four adolescents
on average undertake at least an hour of physical activity per day, compared to one in two who are
engaging in sitting activities for 3 hours or more per day77.
On the mental health front, it is reported that 20 per cent of adolescents (24 per cent girls) have
considered attempting suicide.78 Based on recent consultations with children and adolescents, some of
the related challenges include the stigma associated with mental health issues and access to support,
whether through parents, school, church, friends or even social media, though related risks were also
acknowledged. Some key issues facing children and young people included pressure from social and
gender norms, fear of sexual exploitation and economic strains facing families, especially during COVID-
19.79 UNICEF ECA has committed to investing in further understanding these emerging issues in 2020-
2021, with a view to developing ways of addressing them in the next programme cycle.

7.3.3 Social inclusion and child rights monitoring
Social inclusion and child rights monitoring
Main findings:
The flagship data UNICEF data product has been the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), though
its influence, along with other produced data and evidence on government strategies and policies is
more mixed, based on interview data. UNICEF advocacy for the increase of public expenditure for
children is a particular weakness, with also no data regularly gathered on related government
commitments by UNICEF ECA.
UNICEF has been extending its mandate into social protection, especially through the use of its DRR
support as a catalyst for broader policy reform (e.g. British Virgin Islands, Dominica) but its mandate
and added-value, also in relation to that of other UN agencies remains less clear, based on other
evaluations and interview data.

Despite the ambitions of this component to strengthen monitoring of child rights, namely through the
strengthening of data and related national systems, data availability was a major challenge. While overall
poverty statistics were gathered in some countries, also with UNICEF support (see particularly the MICS),
they were not available across all geographies and were frequently out of data. Nevertheless, work on
the measurement of multi-dimensional poverty continued, particularly with the CDB. No data was
available on public expenditure for children, despite it being one of the indicators in the MCP results
framework. Data on the coverage of children by social protection systems was also missing, being
limited to a description of the social protection systems in some countries and territories.
Child poverty
Despite the progress made by ECA countries and territories in the fulfilment of children rights over the
years, there are still several issues children and young people face which negatively affect their
wellbeing, opportunities and life chances. One in three children in the ECA (32 percent) live in poverty,
compared to one in five adults and 3 per cent in extreme poverty.

The child poverty rate in Grenada, at 50.9 percent, was the highest in the region, followed by Montserrat
(46.9 percent), Dominica (38 percent), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (37.6 percent), Barbados (35.6
percent), and Saint Lucia (34.5 percent). The child poverty rate was lowest in Anguilla. The last published
Survey of Living Conditions (SLC) in T&T was in 2005 and recorded poverty at 21.4 per cent and the
level of indigence at 0 percent, but given the age of this data it cannot be compared to the more recent
figures published by OECS for the other countries/territories. This also made tracking change over time,
in line with the MCP results framework a challenge. There was no clear baseline and data was not
available across all 12 geographies for the same time periods, using the same source and methods.
80
The last published survey of living conditions in Trinidad and Tobago was in 2005 and is shown in the table above, though it must be noted that this data is
much older than the OECS data.
61
Child poverty rates varied strongly with the number of children in the household and by the gender of
the head of household to some degree, but not always. A significant number of the vulnerable child
population resided in female headed households, large households and households with migrants81.
Poverty rates were also higher among households from other Caribbean islands (e.g. British Virgin
Islands),82 according to the OECS 2017 report on Child Poverty in the Eastern Caribbean.
Households with four or more children had poverty rates averaging 80 per cent higher than the overall
child poverty rate. In contrast, households with one or two children had poverty rates below or close to
the adult and overall poverty rates. In seven out of the nine countries for which data was available, these
large households accounted for over 40 per cent (rising to almost 60 per cent) of all poor children. In
most countries, children in female-headed households were more likely to be poor than those in male-
headed households. However, this was not always the case, and in several countries, the variation in
poverty rates was small. The three countries with the highest female-male differentials were Barbados,
Grenada and British Virgin Islands.83
Data on children’s rights
The flagship UNICEF data product has been the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS). It has
gone some way in bridging the major data challenges that characterize the region. MICS were
conducted in five countries and territories, with the design of new MICS under-way in Saint Lucia (2nd
MICS) and Trinidad and Tobago (3rd MICS). Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia and Turks & Caicos. Data
collection were adapted to COVID-19 requirements in the latter cases. According to one interviewee, in
some instances MICS has even replaced household poverty data. Ultimately, the objective has been the
mainstreaming of child poverty and young people in national poverty reports (e.g. Grenada, St. Kitts
and Nevis and St. Vincent and the Grenadines). Additional research products, with a particular emphasis
on the disaggregation of data were produced, including the following:
• The multi-country child poverty analysis conducted in collaboration with OECS Commission,
based on a survey of living conditions (2016)
• OECS Education Statistical Digest
• Situational analyses in each of the 12 countries and territories84
• Promotion of CRC reporting
Support for the collection of disability data, never progressed. Generally, there is low demand for
social data, lack of resources (staff, budget, skills) and insufficient cross-sectoral coordination.85 Political
will is also a concern in some contexts (e.g. Trinidad and Tobago)
The influence of data and evidence in government strategies and policies is more mixed. Delays
were incurred in the finalization of surveys and studies, there were continued data inadequacies and a
persistent lack of systematic use of data to inform evidence-based decision-making and allocation of
resources.86 UNICEF advocacy for the increase of public expenditure for children was a particular
weakness. UNICEF ECA and LACRO staff also felt that less results were obtained in this area.87 Eastern
Caribbean countries and territories allocated on average only 4.1 per cent of GDP to education, 4 per

cent to health and just over 1 per cent to social services.88 There was no systematic collection of
expenditure data across the sub-region. Despite direct efforts to conduct budget analyses in the OCTs,
budget allocations have not increased, based on interview data. UNICEF has also been less engaged
with key government partners, such as ministries responsible for planning and especially finance.
UNICEF influence on public expenditure for children has therefore been minimal, based on interviews.
Social protection legislation, policies and systems
UNICEF has been extending its mandate into social protection. UNICEF was active in the
establishment of the OECS Social Protection Technical Committee, which is useful for advocacy and
knowledge-sharing.89 Related legislation was reviewed in Saint Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda and
Montserrat through high-level advocacy in the framework of a UNICEF/UN Women Joint Programme
on Social Protection. Draft bills on social protection for Antigua and Barbuda and Montserrat were
prepared and adopted. The bills are currently pending final inputs from ministers of the respective social
development ministries. One challenge is coordination between the labor and social development
sectors, as the two main ministries involved will have to begin to strategically engage. The evaluation of
the St Kitts and Nevis pilot social protection programme was aimed to support government efforts to
scale up from a pilot programme and reach about 5,690 poor and vulnerable children and families, as
part of efforts to promote resilience.90
These social protection policies and systems are being developed (e.g. in Barbados, British Virgin Islands,
Dominica, Saint Lucia, Trinidad and Tobago) as a spin-off from cash transfer projects of hurricane
response and now for the COVID-19 response. Dominica is working to strengthen delivery of the
country’s public assistance programme – its flagship cash transfer intervention, which covers more than
1,000 children in recipient households. The British Virgin Islands are also attempting to review its social
protection system, as a result of the cash transfer experience during the hurricane response. There is
also a potential opportunity to incorporate a cash transfer component for transport cost of 150 migrant
children to school in Trinidad and Tobago. This may be a way to incrementally integrate migrants into
national social security system over time.
Challenges remain on UN and broader donor coordination. There is an ambition to translate
emergency cash transfer response to more comprehensive social protection reform. However, this has
faltered due to challenges in identifying the specific UNICEF added-value, as well as inter-agency
coordination among competing UN agencies; namely the WFP. Many players are working on cash
transfer and social safety nets, requiring coordination. One interviewee felt there was “competition (on
which UN agency) can provide cash transfers first, rather than a strategic approach in this area”. Other
development partners, such as the World Bank, also have a substantial social safety net footprint in the
broader region. There is also a need to consider cash transfers through a humanitarian-development or
‘double nexus’ lens, i.e.: allowing people to survive and meet short-term, acute needs whilst also
considering longer-term development objectives.
7.3.4 EXTERNAL CHALLENGES TO UNICEF ECA RESULTS
The economic situation and poor fiscal position of the countries and territories in the sub-region
is a major, underlying constraint for achieving all of the results of the UNICEF MCP. The debt-to-GDP
ratio remains high, especially among the small, OECS and tourism dependent economies. The economic
situation has been further exacerbated by COVID-19. All of the interviewees felt that the governments
in the sub-region were not able to assign already scarce resources to social priorities generally and more
specifically to those concerning children. Despite the substantial support provided in the ECD sector,
88 UNICEF Situation Analysis 2019
89 COAR 2016
90 COAR 2017
63
many interviewees still felt that this was not a government priority. There were also insufficient resources
identified for scaling up access to ECD, especially for the most vulnerable children.91 Child protection
was a challenging topic due to the complexity of underlying factors, including the small size of islands
and communities and deeply entrenched norms which all reduced governments willingness to address
the highly sensitive topic, except in cases where individual leaders championed the issue (e.g. Saint
Lucia).
Most notably, the lack of political will was reflected in the stagnant budget allocations for
children’s issues. 24 per cent of the MCP-E e-survey felt UNICEF ECA did fairly or very poorly in
addressing constraints in public finance. In the last European Union financial framework, no country or
territory identified a UNICEF sector for support, with the exception of Anguilla, which sought
infrastructure support for re-building in the education sector after hurricane Irma. However, this was
not the case in all countries. Based on interview data alone, the budget allocations for children’s issues
in Trinidad and Tobago were at a historical high and it was not critical to ensure that the commitments
were actually allocated and spent. There was a particular need to advocate for more cost-effective,
preventative measures, as the allocations for institutionalized care were particularly challenged in
government. Mobilization of programme resources for non-emergency results areas remained a
challenge, despite persistent UNICEF efforts.92
Policy change is hampered by actual implementation of reforms. The lack of political will influenced
particularly the implementation of policy reforms, which ultimately is more costly in both human
resource and budget terms. The case of child justice reform in Trinidad and Tobago is illustrative of this
challenge. While the legal and policy framework is highly ambitious, the implementation of related
reforms, such as the case management system, is much more challenging, due to constraints in human
resources and budget allocation; especially in light of more recent public budget constraints and staff
cuts stemming from the low, global oil and gas price. Based on interview data, there is a real need now
to package reform ideas, with the right messaging, targeted at the right instances, including the Ministry
of Finance. According to another interviewee, UNICEF has not fully grasped the political complexity in
Trinidad and Tobago and there is further need to strengthen efforts to identify reform champions and
advocate for sought changes, especially with the window of opportunity provided by the ambitious
Child Policy.
Due to their income status the countries and territories are also not able to escape the debt trap.
The countries are also not able to obtain concessional finance, with middle-income countries and
territories having substantially less engagement with donors and particularly multi-lateral development
banks.
Economic constraints are closely linked with political will. In the face of limited resources, priorities
do not tend to focus on the social sector. One interviewee felt that there is also less attention given to
children’s issues, due to the power of voting constituencies, where elderly have greater influence.
Priorities may have to shift to social protection during major crises (e.g. Barbados Economic
Recovery and Transformation (BERT) plan, as a result of COVID-19). This may prove to be a window of
opportunity also for the next UNICEF ECA MCP.
The relationship of individual countries with the UN system generally was an issue in some cases.
The small, but relatively wealthy countries and territories are rightfully proud of their sovereignty and
economic achievements. Political will to engage with the UN system has been a particular challenge in
Trinidad and Tobago. The issue remains extremely politically sensitive in the country, though UNICEF
91 COAR 2017
92 COAR 2017
64
has been able to navigate around some of these constraints due to skillful advocacy and strong
networks with reform champions in-country. While all of the countries do want to strongly exercise their
sovereignty and prefer to align any external support tightly with their own priorities (e.g. British Virgin
Islands), others are more amenable and in need of external support. For example, in Dominica, external
assistance, including from the UN and UNICEF is perceived as critical for the post-hurricane recovery
efforts.
Economic constraints are also related to the small size and limited capacity of the countries and
territories. Therefore, the economies of scale across sub-regional efforts are critical (e.g. OECS, CDEMA,
UWI). Size alone was a perceived constraint, though challenged by some research.93 The small size of
the islands definitely influenced the capacity of the government and civil service to pass and implement
reforms. The centralization of decision-making in the cabinet and the position of the Permanent
Secretary is something that characterizes all decision-making in the region, slowing down the reform
process. Continued delays in policy development and approval affected programmes in several
countries.94 The capacity of the civil service to implement reforms is further constrained by the limited
number, but qualified civil servants. There is also substantially high turnover and even brain drain away
from the region. This appears to apply particularly to ministries and agencies operating in the social
sector.
Extreme vulnerability to climate change and more frequent, stronger storms is also a major external
constraint that will only grow in the coming years. According to one interviewee, it is very challenging
to “build back better,” in countries like Dominica, where the government and public purse are still reeling
from the last hurricane, when the next already arrives. The sub-region is also having to deal with other
natural disasters (e.g. major flooding, volcanic eruption). The La Soufrière volcano erupted in March
2021 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The lava dome is expanding and the alert level is now red.95
Apparently, contingency planning was already underway, based on interviews. Finally, the large influx
of Venezuelans to Trinidad and Tobago demonstrates the continuing migration pressures in the sub-
region; also from Haiti.
Finally, deeply entrenched norms also constrained progress in the critical area of child protection,
in particular. Reforms on difficult topics, such as corporal punishment and abuse are challenging and
require time, also due to small size of the communities and entrenched social norms. Notably, about 20
per cent of the MCP-E e-survey respondents felt that UNICEF ECA did fairly or very poorly in addressing
entrenched social norms around corporal punishment and did fairly poorly in addressing entrenched
gender norms through its programming in the sub-region. Therefore, persistent, long-term
communications efforts around awareness raising with children, adolescents, families, caregivers and
other key target audiences remains critical.
7.3.5 INTERNAL FACTORS IN ACHIEVING UNICEF ECA MCP RESULTS
Overall, the perception of UNICEF and its implementation of the MCP is generally positive, though
internal challenges were observed. 20.69 per cent of stakeholders responding to the perception survey
perceived the relevance of services delivered as ‘very good’ and 37.93 per cent as ‘fairly good’. Similar
figures were recorded for both the quality of services delivered (20.69 per cent ‘very good’; 34.48 per
cent ‘fairly good’) and timeliness of delivery (23.33 per cent ‘very good’; 33.33 per cent ‘fairly good’).

model, however; 16.67 per cent rated this as ‘very good’, 23.33 per cent as ‘fairly good’ while 20 per
cent of respondents perceived the model to be ‘fairly poor’.
When asked about the greatest internal UNICEF ECA challenge, UNICEF ECA and LACRO staff felt that
the organizational structure was the greatest challenge, followed by its presence and representation
across the countries and territories across the sub-region.
Figure 7: Perceived Internal Challenge of UNICEF ECA
Source: Participatory mentimeter with 25 respondents
These and other reasons for perceived challenges with the multi-country model are further explored
below.
Leadership
One of the internal factors observed that positively influenced the achievement of MCP outputs and
outcomes was the quality of leadership, which facilitated excellent relationships with partners and at the
highest levels of government across all countries. This came out strongly in interviews with key
stakeholders, as well as in the perception survey, with 10.34 per cent of respondents rating strategic
leadership as ‘excellent’, 20 per cent as ‘very good’ and 34.48 per cent as ‘fairly good’. Key informants
noted that senior leadership was very responsive, open to ideas and proactive, with strong strategic
thinking and an ability to see the big picture in the region. However, it was noted that relationships were
dependent on individuals, rather than an institutional approach.
Internal structure and processes
There were several internal challenges observed with the MCP model. The perception survey
highlighted mixed views on the internal structures and procedures, with 13.79 per cent finding these
‘very good’, 20.69 per cent ‘fairly good’ and 17.24 per cent finding them to be ‘fairly poor’. An equal
number of respondents (6.9 per cent) found them to be ‘excellent’ and ‘very poor.’
A key challenge relates to the fact that the programme covers 12 small island states/territories and
internal resources – human and financial – are spread across these. This affects several areas, including,
66
for example, relationship development and management with governments. This is particularly true in
contexts where it takes longer to build trust to forge strong relationships and build networks. It has also
led to a lack of understanding of specific government needs in certain cases. For example, there is
already a very high level of technical assistance provided to the government in Trinidad and Tobago,
and it would be more effective to assess remaining gaps and propose a more tailored response to this
based on the skills and capacity that are still required. The UNICEF ECA team is composed of 25 national
and international general service and professional staff working together on the implementation of the
MCP. Staff are often also spread too thinly within countries, which can lead to partners coming to them
for all programme-related questions and staff not always having the answers or technical expertise to
support them. Budget resources are also spread very thinly across a broad spectrum of objectives, which
hampers both efficiency and effectiveness of the MCP.
A further challenge noted by several stakeholders relates to the lack of alignment between corporate
procedures and the needs and challenges unique to MCP. This can also lead to a disconnect between
corporate procedures and the culture and capacity of all 12 small island states/territories. The UN
operating system does not allow for the complexity of a MCP. For example, when responding to the
Strategic Management Questions (SMQ) at the end of the year, staff have to answer the same question
12 times. Staff also have to report equally on each country, despite overlap and duplication of effort
which leads to inefficiencies.
It was also noted by both staff and partners that the programmatic approach could be improved.
There are challenges in coordination between the main areas of operation which is strongly felt by many
different stakeholders. The technical teams often work in silos, with a lack of an integrated and cohesive
approach across the areas of social protection, education and child protection. This is reflected in the
results of the perception survey, with 33.33 per cent finding the internal coordination between themes
and staff to be ‘fairly good’ and 16.67 per cent viewing these as ‘fairly poor’; 3.3 per cent perceived
internal coordination as ‘very poor’. The technical officers are seen by partners as leading on the
technical areas, leading to the perception of an individual approach rather than an institutional
approach to programming.
There is also a clear divide between the humanitarian and development teams which could be
improved to promote more of a double nexus approach to programming. For example, there is no
coordinator who understands both the humanitarian and development structures to bridge the divide
and develop mutual understanding on the links between addressing short-term, immediate needs and
longer-term development objectives. This includes issues such as connectedness and the role of
humanitarian cash transfers in a social protection response. There is also a perceived capacity gap
among external stakeholders on UNICEF ECA’s ability to effectively plan and respond to emergencies;
partners report that while UNICEF is excellent at communicating the consequences of crises, they are
less effective at addressing these directly.
Stakeholders also observed that the right balance of skills and staff has not yet been achieved.
First, the number of staff necessary to cover all technical areas across the MCP are not in place and
efforts are not always made to address this. For example, in Trinidad and Tobago, there was a need to
recruit an education specialist who understood the education system and had strong local networks
with education interlocutors. Instead, the office appointed two UNVs from outside the country with no
experience of the local education system, or networks. Secondly, the right technical skills are not always
covered, with generalists expected to cover technical areas that are not aligned with their experience.
Conversely, programme specialists are assigned general administrative tasks that are time-consuming
and could potentially be done by programme assistants or administrative staff. Thirdly, there is a
dependence on individuals to create and maintain positive working relationships with partners; this
should be based on an institutional approach instead.
67
Business model
The operating structures and business model were already an area of concern prior to the pandemic,
with COVID-19 adding an additional layer of challenges to the internal structure and implementation
model. A recent analysis of UNICEF ECA workload96 highlighted that between 2012 and 2014, “UNICEF
did not articulate a specific business model for operating in middle-income small island states while
addressing an upstream agenda” which led to UNICEF ECA adopting an upstream agenda as set out in
the 2014-2017 MTSP without any corresponding changes to the business model.97 This did not consider
several key issues, including, for example, the importance of country-level presence, vulnerability of the
region to natural disasters or the need for an integrated humanitarian-development, or double nexus,
approach with the recruitment of staff with the necessary skills and expertise. Although UNICEF ECA
conducted risk assessments consistently between 2014 – 2020, these assessments did not include a
focus on the need to review the business model. A review of the business model could lead to
improvements of both the efficiency and the effectiveness of the MCP implementation model.
The business model was also not adapted to reflect the evolving context and shift in priorities. Despite
the introduction of UN Reform and the changes in the socio-economic environment in the region, and
the emerging priority areas of complex issues such as migration and climate change, the traditional
business model was retained.
Staffing
A major challenge to relevance highlighted by a number of interviewees was the need for appropriate
level of UNICEF support from specialists who have appropriate experience of the sector. As well as sector
knowledge it was also critical that staff understand the context and have a level of awareness and
credibility from government staff was seen as a major challenge. This is a challenge for UNICEF’s staffing
structure across the ECA sub-region.
Heavy workloads
UNICEF ECA report that heavy workloads can have a negative impact on their ability to sufficiently focus
on implementation of the MCP. Pre-Covid, programme specialists reported spending up to 70 per cent
of their time on administrative tasks and generally, all staff were already spending 5-10 hours a month
on administrative tasks and UN coordination meetings. The time and energy required to complete the
mandatory administrative tasks resulted in less time available for programme implementation and
unmanageable workloads for programme staff. The UN Reform process has also increased workloads
for key staff members, including the Deputy Representative, the M&E officer and the Social Policy
Specialist.
COVID-19 only served to increase the number of (online) meetings that had to be attended and
added to already heavy workloads. The shift from in-person working to virtual, remote working led
to the need for retraining and reframing responsibilities and functions within teams; while this was
reported to have been well managed on the operations side, it was less effective within the programme
section. This compounded existing challenges, including overlap and gaps within job descriptions for
programme staff as well as a lack of consistency and coherence as part of these. Duplication of effort
led to inefficiencies and contributed to unnecessarily heavy workloads. This is reflective of the findings
of the 2020 UNICEF Global Staff survey; globally, 48 per cent of staff reported that “in my office, there
is little duplication of work” and 48 per cent reported “the workload is distributed fairly in my office”.
ECA staff responses were not nearly as positive; 27 per cent of ECA staff reported “in my office, there is
little duplication of work” and just 23 per cent reported that “the workload is distributed fairly in my
office”.

Monitoring and reporting
Unsurprisingly, the hurricanes and global pandemic affected the original MCP objectives, and plans and
targets were set aside due to the crisis. While objectives and activities were adapted, indicators and
targets were not adjusted accordingly. UNICEF contribution and additionality are also not always clear.
The quality of both the monitoring system and the way that data is collected, managed and
analyzed is limited. The original MCP indicators, baselines and targets were not revisited, either with
updated data or with shifting priorities. While research is conducted (e.g. MICS, various perception
surveys) usually with a sufficient degree of rigor, the overall quality of data across the sub-region
remains very weak and data is not accessible and managed adequately to allow for accountability or
learning. Similar weaknesses have been observed at the UN level across the sub-region98. Formal
reporting is focused on the annual COAR reporting, which nevertheless does not systematically relate
to the results framework, especially its indicators and targets. While adapting to changing
circumstances, especially frequent crises is required, these adjustments also need to be reflected in the
related monitoring systems, with a view to accountability and particularly, rapid decision-making and
learning loops to continue improving interventions along the way.
Several challenges were observed in relation to monitoring and reporting beyond the adaptations
required due to the ongoing pandemic. Ongoing monitoring and subsequent reflection of what is
working well and less well at both the output and outcome level could be improved. For example, the
Note Masters system for the migrant children’s education programme was adopted by UNICEF based
on the assumption that this linked with the Caribbean Examinations Council. However, the system did
not deliver as planned but this was not picked up early enough. Staff noted that there needs to be more
systematic reflection built into the institutional culture that would allow these challenges to be identified
earlier, saving time later on and leading to greater overall efficiency and effectiveness.
Partners reported difficulties with reporting due to rigid and inflexible reporting requirements.
For example, the reporting period begins when funds are requested from UNICEF, but these funds often
take time to get through to the implementing partner and the context may have shifted slightly by the
time funds are received. However, UNICEF still requires 3-month reporting, which partners noted as
challenging. The reporting process is also quite demanding for some partners whose own internal
monitoring systems are not aligned with UNICEF’s systems and the technical and time-consuming
nature of UNICEF reporting requirements has also led to partners needing to hire extra support just to
cover that area of work. Partners also stated that in some instances, UNICEF’s own monitoring data
tends to focus on successes, but fails to also highlight challenges.
In summary, while evidence generation and particularly its use in advocacy was a key UNICEF ECA
mechanism of change, the strongest evidence was generated in the education sphere, notably with
OECS leadership. The influence of the evidence, notably on ECD and gender disparities nevertheless was
not reflected either in UNICEF ECA strategies, which continued to focus on ECD or on actual
performance and retention in the school system, especially of boys. While strategies to support behavior
change were utilized in the life-long learning component, notably in the British Virgin Islands, among
the case study countries, they were the most prominent in the security and justice for children
component. Efforts there were focused directly on adolescents and children, as well as caregivers and
teachers to address particularly entrenched norms and values relating to violence. Nevertheless, related
changes will require a time period well beyond the life-cycle of a single MCP. The monitoring of
children’s rights was a key focus of the social inclusion and child rights monitoring component, notably
through the MICS. Nevertheless, in this component, as among the others, data availability across the 12
countries and territories, its periodicity and quality remained major concerns.

7.4 COHERENCE
Evaluation question 4: What is UNICEF’s added value in the 12 Eastern Caribbean
countries/territories – particularly in comparison to other UN agencies? Are these strengths a result of
UNICEF corporate features or are they specific to the multi-country Office?
Main findings:
The M-CPD and ToC did not sufficiently capture UNICEF added-value, especially the interlinkages and
synergies between upstream and downstream approaches and between inside-track and outside
track advocacy; the latter being closely linked to the UNICEF established “brand” and excellent
communications, which are among its global assets, based on the e-survey and interview data.
Strength of Evidence: Medium
UNICEF Added-value
UNICEF is most known for its exclusive focus and dedication to children, especially around child
protection and also on access to education. This was clear in the structure of the MCP, its ToC and it
was confirmed unequivocally by all interviewees. Of the MCP-E e-survey respondents, 88 per cent felt
that UNICEF provided added-value, through its focus on children. According to one interviewee, “the
value of UNICEF is the awareness that they create around children, the sense of feeling and empathy
toward children”.
There is also no other organization that is focusing as closely on child protection issues. On
education, UNICEF has an established position, recognized competence and a close presence in the
sub-region (e.g. in comparison with UNESCO). UNICEF has strong competencies in education and is a
“known brand”. Meanwhile, on social protection, UNICEF does not have an exclusive mandate and needs
to work with partners, including other UN agencies (e.g. WFP). DRR efforts are also conducted in close
coordination with partners. Some interviewees even felt that UNICEF had a predominant role in DRR,
namely due to the focus on hurricane response and now COVID-19. UNICEF capacity to organize
emergency responses and interact and define communication strategies with the communities was
greatly appreciated.99 According to one interviewee, “the value of UNICEF is the awareness that they
create around children, the sense of feeling and empathy toward children”.
UNICEF added-value is also closely linked to its established “brand” and excellent
communications. This was almost as frequently mentioned among all different groups of interviewees,
as was the identification of UNICEF through its exclusive focus on children. Likewise, 84 per cent felt
that UNICEF communication was part of its added-value. UNICEF ECA and LACRO staff also agreed that
results had been particularly achieved in raising awareness on children’s rights.100 Strong capabilities in
communications also reflected in UNICEF advocacy. One interview called UNICEF “half UN agency, half
civil society organization”. Many interviewees enumerated visible UNICEF campaigns (e.g. backpacks to
demonstrate COVID-19 impact on students). UNICEF expertise on communication was also considered
a big opportunity to address any “hesitation around COVID-19 vaccination, to provide advice,
coordinate approaches on vaccine communications and logistics, with their tremendous experience on
child vaccination”.
However, some did suggest that due to the strong communication focus, at times it also became the
predominant driver of UNICEF engagement, at the cost of actual implementation of impactful

70
interventions on the ground or even the rigor of research, according to one interviewee. The fundraising
incentive was frequently connected with this more critical view on UNICEF communications. One
interviewee noted that “high visibility also poses responsibilities and challenges, both with governments,
as well as other UN agencies.” It is clear that the strong visibility and communications of UNICEF raises
the ire of other UN agencies in particular.
UNICEF is therefore known for its “blended” approach to advocacy. Based on the MCP-E e-survey,
as many respondents appreciated the inside-track, quiet diplomacy and policy advice, as well as the
“out-side track” activism and related communication efforts of the organization. 42 per cent of survey
respondents felt that UNICEF activism (e.g. direct action to support children’s rights) was excellent or
very good, with 16 per cent considering it excellent, compared with 36 per cent who thought similarly
of UNICEF advice to governments. The two approaches, which are often considered diametrically
opposite, both characterized UNICEF advocacy.
Inside track diplomacy
UNICEF is also known for its good relationship with the government and inside-track diplomacy.
Relationships are fostered by both leadership and staff. According to one interviewee, UNICEF enters
relationships with the government “through the backdoor”. A number of UNICEF staff mentioned that
different ministers in the region had them on “speed dial,” and that UNICEF staff had very personal,
valued relationships with government officials, which differentiated them from other agencies. “By
being a trusted partner UNICEF can influence policy over time and get positive results, though concrete
attribution of these results is difficult”, according to one interviewee. Another mentioned that UNICEF
was considered “sensitive and politically astute”. Qualities of individual staff were highly appreciated by
all respondents. One interviewee termed it a “heart thing” very much linked to individual relationships
with UNICEF personnel. However, the flip side was that the strong dependence on individuals was
insufficiently institutionalized in UNICEF structures and procedures.
The key was being available and identifying concrete areas where UNICEF can provide
government assistance. Often, this was small initiatives, instead of large budget commitments.
According to one government representative, “they add value, because they are hands on”. Examples,
such as the St. Lucia case on child protection demonstrate that UNICEF staff understand what
governments need and can provide it when required. According to another interview, “this sounds very
downstream. We get caught up in the upstream, but it is practical support which is required, not
intellectual policy level discussion. That is what sets UNICEF apart”.
Inside track diplomacy seemed particularly well suited to the sub-region and its capacity needs. One
interview termed it a “post-colonial hiccup”. According to another government official “UNICEF do not
over power us. They always build capacity”. Of the MCP-E e-survey respondents, 77 per cent felt that
UNICEF influenced policy change, 62 per cent felt UNICEF contributed to government system
strengthening and 68 per cent on training.
Some, though fewer also mentioned how UNICEF generates technical knowledge, through consultants
and research. According to one government respondent, “they have assisted us beyond their expected
scope, through advice, sharing best practice from other countries. reviewing documents, technical
recommendations and lending expertise in initiatives; technical expertise and time. Far fewer mentioned
the data generated by UNICEF, notably the MICS.
UNICEF may nevertheless not be using all of its influence channels, as it works less through civil society
organizations and the private sector. “One stream of advocacy is giving ammunition to others that can
use it to hold the government to account – UNICEF is not doing this well,” according to a civil society
representative.
71
UNICEF Partnerships
Evaluation question 5: To what extent were meaningful partnerships or coordination mechanisms
established with other key actors e.g. government at national and local levels, civil society, NGOs,
academia, other UN agencies etc. to avoid duplication of efforts, miscommunication and clearer
accountabilities?
Main findings:
While relationships and partnerships were well established with government and other UN agencies,
they were not yet fostered with all potential like-minded organizations (e.g. donors, IFIs, civil society
organizations, private sector), based on the e-survey, whether for joint advocacy (e.g. to review
structural challenges in data, government budgets, government capacity and implementation
challenges, quality of services) or for leveraging additional financing, including more innovative
financing solutions.
UNICEF is committed to UN reform and joint programming (e.g. COVID-19 response), though roles
and operating procedures are not always fully clear, especially in relation to requirements imposed on
implementing partners, based namely on interview data.
Strength of Evidence: Medium
A participatory stakeholder analysis process was initiated during the inception phase, with a view to
identifying who needed to change, and how, to achieve UNICEF objectives. After a desk review and
brainstorming on key stakeholders for the design of the evaluation, they were discussed and plotted on
a 2X2 interest and influence matrix during a participatory session (see Figure 8 below). The analysis was
further complemented through the desk review and bilateral design discussions with key stakeholders.
A more detailed stakeholder analysis was conducted for the selected case study countries as a part of
the sample development for the data collection tools.

The stakeholder analysis was updated throughout the evaluation process. The final list of interviewees can be found in annex 4
UNICEF ECA has been particular successful at fostering its relationship with regional organizations, notably the OECS and CDEMA, in addition to working closely
with government. According the UNICEF ECA and LACRO staff, while governments ranked as the first partner, during the dynamic assessment, the partnerships
with regional organizations were also considered highly important. While some considered donors also central, they eventually slipped to rank five, as did other
UN agencies to rank four in the participatory exercise. While civil society organization partnerships were ranked third, this was not reflected by the other evidence
gathered by the MCP-E. Private sector retained the lowest rank in the participatory ordering of UNICEF partnerships.
75

External partnerships
It is clear that UNICEF ECA implements its programming namely through government
partnerships. All interviewees felt that the government was its main implementing partner. 75 per cent
of MCP-E e-survey respondents felt UNICEF ECA was good or excellent at advising governments (e.g.
through policy briefs). Some of the programming results also demonstrated the success of these efforts
(e.g. Child protection legislation and policy in Saint Lucia) including the effects of training at scale, such
as in the case of ECD. However, in other cases, efforts to influence policy changes have been less
successful (e.g. overseas countries and territories (OCT) public expenditure review), which have been a
question of either missing political commitment or capacity to implement proposed reforms. While
there is close cooperation, for example on the preparation of legislation, monitoring is namely
conducted for accountability purposes in the form of reporting for funding provided. A number of sub-
region wide learning events have also been held (e.g. best practices in cash-transfer), which are
considered valuable opportunities for knowledge sharing by participants.
Unique due to the multi-country context, UNICEF ECA also works extremely closely with the
relevant regional organizations, namely the OECS and CDEMA. The cooperation with the OECS has
various benefits, including legitimacy and political influence, as well as impact at scale across the sub-
region (e.g. in common curriculum standards, model legislation, shared case management practices,
coordinated DRR). Apparently, UNICEF is very flexible and has adapted to the OECS agenda and its
members’ needs. UNICEF is the only UN agency which regularly attends the annual OECS Council of
Ministers meeting, according to an interviewee. However, as in the case of government, monitoring is
namely conducted for accountability purposes in the form of reporting for funding provided. Cross-
government learning is an inherent function of the OECS, which makes it a valuable partner also in
knowledge exchange.
There has been a shift of programming from civil society to government partners, also in Trinidad
and Tobago, where civil society has been a major implementation partner on migration-related issues.
While UNICEF has worked predominantly with the Living Water Community, it has also explored
cooperation with a variety of other civil society organizations. There appears to be substantial frustration
among these organizations on tight and reducing financial resources, lack of eligibility of operational
costs, as well as substantial financial management issues. While U-report was initially designed and
planned to be implemented in cooperation with a civil society partner in Trinidad and Tobago, the
platform is now housed in the Office of the Prime Minister.
76
Donors generally are less aware of UNICEF in the region, even in cases where funding has been
provided to joint-activities and/or where similar support is provided across the sub-region.
Communication mainly takes place in the established donor coordination structure, including its sector-
specific working groups, which meets only sporadically. The frequency and quality of these meetings
varies substantially from one group to another. The poverty group co-chaired by CDB and UNICEF meets
1-2 times per year. Joint activities and projects are limited, due to different priorities, as well as the
prevailing MIC/HIC status of the countries and territories. There is particularly limited engagement with
multi-lateral development banks, notably the IDB, which is the preferred partner, for example, in
Trinidad and Tobago. This is particularly due to the inability of IFIs to provide concessional finance to
middle to high income countries. According to some, trying to establish a relationship with the MDBs
required a lot of effort, for limited returns.
Despite original ambitions in the MCP, there has been little to no engagement of the private
sector. This remains a joint challenge for the UN. Some efforts were made to leverage private telecom
companies in the C4D efforts, also on addressing the COVID-19 challenge (e.g. Flow communication).
UNICEF has also reached out to Massy supermarkets, but this is only a very recent effort. UNICEF has
not engaged chambers of commerce or other businesses directly, despite clear relevance in areas like
education and skills development. UNICEF has also not leveraged the private sector in its government
advocacy efforts.
Internal Partnerships
UNICEF is also committed to UN Reform and the promotion of closer coordination among
different UN agencies, including joint programming. According to one interviewee, UNICEF ECA is
“playing by the rules, but challenging business as usual”. Nevertheless, coordination among often
competing UN agencies remains a major issue in the sub-region. While not formally under the MCP,
the Spotlight initiative, funded by the EU, has demonstrated the challenges in UN and broader donor
coordination. This includes its governance and management structure, as well as operational procedures
that must comply with demanding EU requirements. Based on interview data from multiple individuals,
interagency politics poses a challenge for the most minute decisions during the implementation of
Spotlight. Some also now consider the issue of GBV and VAC is now “saturated” with funding, though
only Spotlight only focuses on Grenada, as well as Trinidad and Tobago.
Textbox 2: COVID-19 and UN agency coordination
The joint approach to COVID-19 is considered a success story in UN-coordination. All of the
UN agencies agreed to come together for a joint approach under the umbrella of the UN
Framework for the Immediate Socio-economic Response to COVID 19 and the COVID-19 Multi-
Sectoral Response Plan for the Eastern Caribbean Funding Appeal.101
In addition, the SDG Fund Joint Programme for Universal and Adaptive Social Protection in the
Eastern Caribbean, is being implemented by 5 UN Agencies
(WFP, ILO, UNDP, UNICEF and UNWomen). The challenge for Caribbean countries is how to
transition from COVID-19 response to more medium to long-term shock responsive
strategies.102 According to interviews, there is a good division of labor and the agencies have
worked well together on mobilizing resources.
The definition of an adequate agreement and the collaboration instrument and mechanism
between organizations is critical. This was done in the joint UNICEF WFP cash-transfer support to
Dominica after the hurricane. “VNA was a good inter-institutional and interagency agreement between
101 United Nations. COVID-19 Multi-Sectoral Response Plan for the Eastern Caribbean Funding Appeal. (2020)

77
GCOD, IOM, UNICEF, WFP, OCHA, and UNDP, which enabled a rapid shift from the provision of blanket
assistance during the emergency response phase to the protection of food security and livelihoods of
the most vulnerable population affected by the hurricane during the recovery phase”.103 However, issues
with harmonizing results and financial management procedures remain. Therefore, truly “joint”
monitoring and learning still requires some joint UN effort.
The figure below summarizes the level of engagement with different types of stakeholders across ECA.

7.5 SUSTAINABILITY
Evaluation question 6: To what extent have UNICEF cross sectoral strategies (capacity building,
evidence generation, communication, advocacy, Innovation, South-South and triangular cooperation
and partnerships, gender and climate change) enhanced the potential for government replication and
scalability in the future? What are the major factors which influence the achievement or non-
achievement of sustainability of the UNICEF programme?
Main findings: UNICEF ECA has emphasized the promotion of systemic change in legislative and
policy frameworks, with a view to generating sustainability, though there has been less measurable
effect on public expenditure in its core intervention areas. Implementation of policy reforms remains a
major challenge, The sustainability of UNICEF interventions over time is a major concern. Both
sustainability and scale require working through national systems and committing government
resources. UNICEF ECA is well-placed, with its close government relationships to catalyze related
reforms, but too frequently they are still limited to individual, finite project interventions or to working
with the same, government counterparts (e.g. at the ministries for education and social affairs).
Likewise, monitoring and evaluation still remains oriented to ensuring accountability of individual
projects or programmes.
The mainstreaming of gender, youth and climate change are also critical sustainability factors and have
been insufficiently integrated into the MCP.
Strength of evidence: Medium
UNICEF ECA has tried to improve the sustainability of its interventions particularly through an
emphasis on promoting systemic change in legislative and policy frameworks, as well as
government capacity to implement reforms. There has been a corporate push for more normative,
upstream policy advocacy. In-side track advocacy (e.g. policy advice, draft legislation, prepared speaking
points) has been critical in achieving sought policy changes, with the greatest success demonstrated
where real country needs and reform champions were identified and engaged.
UNICEF has not yet managed to fully influence the dedication of public finances to children’s
priorities. While efforts have been made to analyze public investment in children, as well as to support
child and gender sensitive budgeting (e.g. Saint Lucia, Montserrat, British Virgin Islands), also through
related training,104 there are no demonstrable effects on actual increases in related allocations in core
UNICEF intervention areas, whether to education, child or social protection. While the latest national
development plan of Trinidad and Tobago mentions children, especially in the context of violence
against children, despite efforts to analyze social sector expenditure patterns it remains difficult to
actually trace concrete allocations beyond anecdotal evidence. According to one interviewee, the
current budget has made the greatest, historical allocation for children’s issues. According to another
government interviewee, “We don’t do a good job at continuity. We drop the ball”.
UNICEF ECA has contributed to reaching greater scale through influencing policy reforms in some
instances across all three areas of strategic emphasis, ECD, child protection and social protection,
though advances in child protection have been slower and the social protection space is a relatively
recent area of emphasis. UNICEF ECA and LACRO staff felt overwhelmingly that the greatest impact had
been through the Safe Schools Initiative, which was catalyzed by the hurricanes and now has leverage

support well beyond UNICEF. Likewise, it was felt that ECD and child protection had improved
sustainability through copying and replication effects and policy reform, respectively.105

At the same time, governments (and some UNICEF ECA staff) demand for operational support
and direct service delivery, not least due to a lack of related human and financial resources. According
to one interviewee, “stopping service delivery is (simply) wrong.” The small size of the islands and
respective populations also makes service delivery possible (e.g. cash-transfer pilots).
The assumption that high- and middle-income status entails that basic institutional capacity is in place
for implementation of proposed reforms and service delivery is not always true. There are particular
challenges in the SIDS context and substantial variation between contexts. For example, there are major
capacity challenges in Dominica due to its vulnerability to natural disaster. All of the countries and
territories struggle with a sufficient number of civil servants to dedicate to tasks. Often, “one person
carries several hats”, according to an interviewee. The fiscal situation of most economies also does not
allow for sufficient expenditure in the social sector.
Support to capacity-building, including additional staff placements, is therefore essential.
According to one interviewee, “capacity development and creating conditions for capacity to be
operationalized is essential”. The front-line presence of UNICEF staff and hired consultants has been
critical in both DRR (e.g. Hurricane response in the British Virgin Islands and Dominica), as well as longer-
term programming, such as in the case of child protection and migration response in Trinidad and
Tobago.
At the same time, greater ownership and assigning government budget to the reform efforts is
required. Development partners do not have endless resources. Whether the immediate, post-
hurricane cash-transfer support or the education support to migrant children in Trinidad and Tobago
(see section on social protection and DRR), there is a need to ensure that government ultimately
improves the resilience of its own social protection systems and that migrant children are integrated
into the regular, public school system. The continuing costs of these interventions are clear, as was
proven by UNHCR pulling its funding for the facilitators of the migrant education programme. UNICEF
stepped in to pick up these additional costs, but a longer-term solution is required.

While some see a shift in UNICEF emphasis from so-called “direct service delivery” to policy advocacy,
most feel that both are necessary to catalyze the required changes in the sub-region. There is a need
for a mix of approaches, according to key interviewees. Limited service delivery can provide an entry-
point to more comprehensive reform. According to one interviewee, “you buy small stuff, to keep you
at the (decision-making) table”.
Often, concrete service delivery was required to catalyze a broader reform agenda. This was the
case in ECD, where UNICEF initially paid for coordinators of individual centers. Now, ECD is growing in
the government budget, for example, through the establishment of public child care centers in more
vulnerable communities and standards exist for private ECD providers, which still dominate the sector.
Disaster response, such as the cash transfers provided in the British Virgin Islands and Dominica
provided an entry point for social protection reform in both countries. However, it is yet completely
clear if these reforms will proceed and what role UNICEF will play in the process, if any.
Ultimately, service delivery is required to improve the lives of children and adolescents. According to
one interviewee, “there is a lack of follow up on beautiful policies. We need support in implementation.
It is more critical. We need to give teeth to what we say”. For example, the Children’s Authority in
Trinidad and Tobago is still challenged by funding, staff and building systems for implementation, based
on interview data.
There is some concern also about the sustainability of selected technological solutions. While the free
PRIMERO information management system is more financially sustainable than competing options that
cost upward of USD 200,000 based on an open procurement process, concerns still remain on if other
government departments and agencies are willing to use the same solution.
‘Ensuring connectedness between humanitarian and development programming’. An important
learning for UNICEF has been the ‘development driven’ response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Applying
a development oriented ‘handwashing/good hygiene’ messaging programme as a preventive measure
has demonstrated the place and effectiveness of building the humanitarian – development nexus from
a development perspective. The learning for UNICEF is that building resilience can be more effective
and therefore sustainable if it is built into development programming.
7.6 GENDER, YOUTH AND CLIMATE CHANGE
The extent to which gender is effectively mainstreamed across the MCP is limited, with scope for
improvement across programme design, implementation, monitoring and reporting. Gender is a cross-
cutting policy and programme objective underpinning the ECA MCP, which is aligned with the Gender
Action Plan (2014-2017). This is coherent with the integration of gender within the UNDAF-MSDF, which
states that “issues of gender equality, women’s empowerment, and empowerment of youth will be
integrated throughout the priority areas,106” and the MCP itself includes an overarching focus on
addressing “key barriers and bottlenecks that prevent girls and boys, particularly the marginalized, from
enjoying their full rights.” The MCP document included a focus on gender both in the document itself
and in the associated results framework. However, the extent to which this focus was carried through in
programme implementation was less clear.
Gender issues in the ECA were frequently generalized as somewhat exceptional, due to the particular
vulnerability of adolescent boys to lower school performance, dropping out, substance abuse and
violence. Nevertheless, women and girls remain disadvantaged in many areas, such as equal pay for
equal work, teenage pregnancy, domestic violence and poverty107. Deeply entrenched and gendered
role expectations remained in schools, the workplace and within the home. There was also social

81
acceptance and tolerance of violence against women and girls. Emergencies, whether hurricanes,
migration or COVID-19, exacerbated gender equality and empowerment of women (GEEW) issues.
The UNICEF GAP II framework (2018–2021) identified the following common barriers and bottlenecks
which apply to the ECA sub-region, that need to be overcome to move towards gender equality:
• Negative femininity and masculine ideals and expectations
• Lack of safety and mobility
• Limited access to knowledge, information and technology
• Lack of resources and decision-making
• Gendered division of labor between men and women, girls and boys
Textbox 3: Prevalence of Violence Against Women (VAWG) in the Caribbean:
Prevalence of violence against women and girls (VAWG) in the Caribbean is among the highest in the
world. VAWG has proven to be so entrenched and normalized that both men and women have a high
tolerance for its manifestations, particularly when perpetrated in the context of intimate partner
relationships. Across five countries (Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago), on
average, nearly 1 out of 2 or 46 per cent of ever-partnered women aged 15-64 have experienced one
or more of the four types of intimate partner violence (IPV) in their lifetime (physical, sexual,
psychological and/or economic violence) and 14 per cent experience one or more of the three types of
IPV (physical, sexual and psychological violence). The intergenerational transmission of domestic
violence paradigm suggests that violence is learned in childhood and transmitted across generations;
thus, exposure to domestic violence in childhood is an important predictor for IPV in adulthood.
Although 70 per cent of victims agreed that domestic violence should not remain a private matter, few
had informed a health professional (13per cent) or the police (5 per cent).
(UNICEF. Gender and Children in the Eastern Caribbean Area. (2020)
The main issues identified in the End of Year Results Summary Narratives related to gender-based
budgeting (2016), the Out of school study (2016, 2017), Gender based issues in disaster (2018) and
migration response (2017), including GBV and GBV and Spotlight (2019). The 2019 Gender
Programmatic Review conducted by UNICEF “efforts need to be intensified to eliminate the sexual and
physical abuse of young women and further reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancies. For boys,
focus should be on addressing issues of inferior educational performance and combating their
heightened propensities to delinquent and criminal behavior, and non-consensual sexual activity
towards females. For boys and girls alike, issues which significantly pertain to both are poverty, obesity,
violent disciplining and bullying.” UNICEF ECA and LACRO staff also felt that less results were
demonstrated in the mainstreaming of gender across the MCP.108
Interviews with several partners also indicated that UNICEF ECA is perceived as weak on gender as a
cross-cutting theme, particularly on mainstreaming gender throughout the programme and project
cycle. The findings of the Gender Programmatic Review found that while there was clear overlap
between sectors and programme focus areas, more could be done in practice to strengthen the
achievement of cross-cutting gender outcomes.109 Although progress has been made in some instances
due to capacity strengthening in this area, gender responsive and gender transformative programming
is still a weakness. Gender is not yet systematically integrated in programme and project
conceptualization, design, development, implementation and reporting.

109 Gender Programmatic Review, (2020)
82
It was also observed that data is not always analyzed with a gender lens, particularly around social
protection and child protection. In education, the prevailing understanding of boys facing challenges
often undermines the continuing discrimination of girls, also in educational institutions, according to
one interviewee. Although the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of UNICEF ECA does collect sex-
disaggregated data, this is not analyzed strategically to understand why outcome-level changes are
occurring or not, and what intended and unintended changes are being achieved. As a result, the
potential to course correct to address key gender barriers and enhance programme effectiveness in
relation to gender is limited.
A strong focus on engagement with government through the Ministry of Education and the Ministry
of Social Development was observed both generally and in terms of addressing specific issues such as
corporal punishment; the main entry point for child protection in ECA is clearly through government.
Although this level of engagement is important for creating an enabling legislative environment that
addresses key issues, including corporal punishment, it is equally important to engage civil society
organizations, which can often be more effective at facilitating behavior change at the community,
household and individual level, addressing norms around corporal punishment and social protection.
The more substantial focus on government stakeholders, with less engagement with civil society,
can limit programme effectiveness, including the effectiveness of gender mainstreaming.
There is also scope to work more collaboratively with other UN agencies with specialist expertise
in complementary areas. Although there are examples of joint programming, for example the
Spotlight Initiative with UN Women, UNFPA and UNDP (see Textbox 4: The Spotlight Initiative),
implementation was observed to have been in silos, with little evidence of genuine collaborative co-
implementation, but rather a division of responsibilities and activities implemented separately. This lack
of a joint approach to implementation is a missed opportunity to bring together multi-sectoral technical
and thematic expertise on gender, child protection and social protection in a harmonized way to
increase the effectiveness of UN coordination and collaboration, as well as programme implementation.
Regional Spotlight Initiative: “Strengthening Regional Cooperation to Prevent and Respond to Family
Violence in the Caribbean”
Textbox 4: The Spotlight Initiative
Launched in 2020 and jointly funded by four UN agencies – UNDP, UNICEF, UN Women and UNFPA –
the Spotlight Initiative is a regional partnership between the UN and the EU in collaboration with
regional partners and civil society. It seeks to address family violence in all its forms and promote
gender equality and women’s empowerment. The three-year initiative also seeks to contribute to the
scale, sustainability and visibility of progress in the prevention of and response to violence against
women and girls. Despite positive progress in some areas, it was observed that the initiative is largely
implemented in siloes, with each agency focused on their own areas of responsibility under the
initiative and not always open to genuine collaborative approaches, co-implementation of activities
and cross-learning.
Climate change was originally not adequately represented in the MCP (1). However, significant
progress has been achieved to prioritize it, and increase programs and operational capabilities.
This was initially a direct output of UNICEF ECA’s response to the 2017 hurricane season, which had
devastating impacts on the sub-region, across sectors. In September 2018, the office representative
initiated the process of mainstreaming climate change (2), which first translated into an evidence-based
Climate Landscape Analysis for Children (CLAC) in 2019 and the prioritization of climate resilience
mainstreaming in the SIM. From September 2019, a dedicated human resource was recruited to
implement the CLAC action plan and develop a climate resilience mainstreaming strategy. Major
achievements have included technical support to countries to incorporate children’s needs into national
climate policies, youth engagement in climate action, access to climate finance (with a focus on the
83
education sector) and progress in the area of shock-responsive social protection. A detailed climate
resilience mainstreaming strategy was completed in March 2021, paving the way for the inclusion of a
dedicated output into the new MCP.
Based on a UNICEF youth survey conducted in 2019, in partnership with the OECS and Caribbean Youth
Environment Network, 67 per cent of respondents felt that climate change and environmental issues
were priority issues for children and youth in their respective countries and territories, though alongside
other issues, such as education, employment, crime, sexuality and psycho-social well-being. While over
85 per cent felt that their government was not doing enough to inform and educate young people
about climate change, 72 per cent were willing to act. 110 In its new strategic plan, UNICEF will prioritize
efforts to address climate change and environmental degradation…would then outline that there is a
clear opportunity to do so in the new MCP-E… “At-scale programming across all areas of our work,
supported by advocacy, partnerships, innovation and other key strategies, will promote environmental
sustainability, mitigate climate change and environmental degradation, and address its impacts on
children and communities
8. CONNECTEDNESS
A key evaluation interest, as already seen under the relevance criteria questions was the connectedness
of emergency response with longer term objectives and inter-connected issues of the MCP. More than
three quarters of UNICEF ECA and LACRO staff agreed that results were demonstrated in DRR.111 This
section therefore explores the extent to which UNICEF’s contributions to humanitarian response during
2017-2020 have been connected to its regular country programme priorities, namely the three main
component of the MCP, as well as the experience and lessons that can be gained.

Evaluation Question 7: To what extent did UNICEF respond effectively to emergencies during the
period being evaluated (measured against the benchmarks set in the Humanitarian Action for
Children and Response Plan)?
Main findings:
Work on DRR was effective in partnership, notably with CDEMA, among other humanitarian actors.
The focus was on the initial emergency response, notably on psychosocial recovery, safe schools,
including critical pedagogical and recreational materials, access to information on good hygiene,
safety and protection, as well as cash-transfer schemes, based on evaluation, related reporting, the
perception survey and interviews. However, as demonstrated by the Child Friendly Spaces for
migrant children in Trinidad and Tobago, frequently emergency measures were not sustainable over
time and required more systemic reform, in this case, for the government to change its policy and
admit migrant children into the regular public school system.
Strength of evidence: High
Evaluation Question 8: To what extent is Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) mainstreamed in UNICEF’s
multi-country programme?
Main findings: DRR and the MCP did not fully incorporate the humanitarian and development
nexus, based on document review, e-survey and interview data.
Strength of evidence: High
Evaluation Question 9: How can UNICEF ECA ensure that its response to COVID-19 is anchored
coherently within its longer-term program in the next M-CPD?
Main findings: While the initial focus of the COVID-19 response was on life-saving awareness raising
about hygiene measures, as well as support for distance learning, a number of issues will remain
longer term concerns, such as the longer term implications for the newly and most vulnerable
children and social protection for a much larger portion of the population, as a result of the
pandemic. While topics such as blended learning have received a lot of attention, immediate needs,
such as addressing inevitable learning gaps, especially for the most vulnerable who did not have
access to digital devices and distance learning opportunities need to be addressed; also in the
context of already existing gender differences in school retention rates.
Strength of evidence: Medium
Education and DRR
Efforts to strengthen education sector emergency preparedness and response were already prioritized
in 2016 but grew to dominate the strategic period of the MCP.112 UNICEF ECA aimed to work with other
sector actors, specifically CDEMA, on prioritizing DRR into the education system including the
mainstreaming of DRR policies, plans and curriculum and increasing the engagement of youth and
adolescents in addressing the impact of climate change.113 UNICEF ECA entered into a partnership
agreement with the CDEMA. A CDEMA-led emergency simulation exercise was held in Antigua and

Barbuda. The ‘Return to Happiness’ psychosocial recovery programme for children aged five to 12 years
was implemented.114
An ongoing major challenge for the current MCP are the capacity gaps, especially those relating to data,
in the relevant ministries. A critical ‘lesson learned’ from the previous MCP was ‘the limited availability
of quality, timely and disaggregated data as a challenge affecting effective planning, monitoring and
budgeting for children as well as advocacy and resource leveraging efforts.’115 Despite efforts to address
the issue it has continued to be highlighted in numerous assessments and evaluation reports. UNICEF’s
Policy Brief ‘Caribbean Children Facing the Climate Crisis (2019)116 highlights the key issue of children
being largely overlooked in key regional and national climate and environmental strategies, policies and
legislation in the ECA. Critically the report notes that this omission ‘is exacerbated by and contributes
to the paucity of disaggregated data and child specific information in this area, hindering decision-
making and the ability of interventions to effectively target children and meet their needs.
This was confirmed most recently by the 2021 MSDF evaluation, which noted weaknesses in the
availability and quality of data, including disaggregated data, at the regional and national level, as well
as the capacity of agencies to collect and manage data in related results frameworks, which remained
weak and incomplete.117 This challenge is also recognized by CDEMA in its 10-year Strategy (2014-
2024) with the first of its four priorities focused on the need for ‘Strengthened Institutional
Arrangements for Comprehensive Disaster Management’. These systemic weaknesses have resulted in
weak mainstreaming of DRR in sector plans. The impact is seen in delays and data inadequacies and a
lack of systematic use of data to inform evidence-based decision making and allocation of resources.118
UNICEF’s ‘Safe Schools Initiative (part of the Worldwide Initiative for Safe Schools – WISS) was officially
launched in 2017. A key pledge from the Caribbean Road Map on School Safety was that ‘new and
existing educational infrastructure and school facilities should be fully accessible to all, including people
with disabilities.’119 The CEELAC study again reiterated the challenge of children being overlooked in key
regional national, climate and energy related CEE strategies, policies and legislation in the ECA. A key
point of this report, highlighted in the executive summary, noted “this omission is exacerbated by and
contributed to a paucity of disaggregated data and child specific information in this area, hindering
decision-making and the ability of interventions to effectively target children and meet their needs”.
Action points recommended for UNICEF are relevant as they highlight the need for action to be both
internal and external and for DRR and Climate Change/Emergency (CEE) work to be integrated:
a) Work with governments to be able to capture and use disaggregated data;
b) Use disaggregated indicators in results frameworks;
c) To work on specific points in DRR and climate emergency situations.
With the region being hit by two category five hurricanes (Irma and Maria) in 2017 UNICEF
prioritized its work on more on operational/downstream emergency response; also into 2018. For
education in emergencies this included working on strengthening and increasing the knowledge of
stakeholders on their roles, responsibilities and accountabilities and to increase commitment to safe
schools programming. Based on summary UNICEF humanitarian achievements, a 19,444 out of a
planned 25,069 children were able to attend school with critical pedagogical and recreational materials
and 26,501 out of a planned 38,987 were able to get access to information on good hygiene, safety and

protection. Work was also carried out in Dominica on updating ‘School Safety Plans’ and then rolled out
to other countries in the sub region (Antigua and Barbuda, Nevis and St Kitts and St Lucia).120
Other work on incorporating DRR into education included:
• Support to the OECS (in 2019) on a review of the Regional Education Sector Plan to incorporate
disaster risk management (UNICEF provided technical assistance to develop education sector
contingency plans in national emergency response mechanisms for health and child protection
sectors);
• Project Connect. Mapping Schools to Improve Connectivity and Learning Environment in the
Caribbean. This helped to identify gaps, vulnerabilities and risks and to optimize service delivery
and emergency preparedness.
Education of migrant children
UNICEF and various partners, including other UN agencies have been providing education for migrant
children in Trinidad and Tobago through Living Water Community, among others. As the government
was not willing to admit migrant children into the public schools, a parallel system was created through
the so-called Child Friendly Spaces, which nevertheless did not replace formal education. Three Child
Friendly Spaces in highly migrant populated towns as safe places for psychosocial support and access
to learning, socialization and play for children on the move.121 Over 500 children are accessing these
spaces, based on interview data. However, during COVID-19 restrictions, this has often only been 50 per
cent of the total. There was a need to reassess the CFS and indeed, the curriculum was under revision
and the delivery mechanism now also includes pre-taped (not only live) events.
The Catholic Church has incrementally also been able to identify places for migrant children in the
Catholic schools. Based on interview data, so far 180 children have been integrated into the 20 schools,
but approximately 2000 children need places. Government acceptance was also required in this case.
Places are available only for registered migrant children of primary school age. Secondary school places
are simply too competitive and sought after.
UNICEF, together with partners has not been able to advocate the government, namely the Ministry of
National Security, to shift its policy to admit migrant children into the public school system. There is a
need for a plan, if the migrant children are never admitted. Financing the CFS is simply not sustainable,
according to one interviewee. There is also global evidence that CFS have an impact on the psychosocial
well-being of younger children in crisis situations, but not in other areas (e.g. protection) and not on
older children (above 16).122
COVID-19 and education
COVID-19 required an immediate shift from face-to-face, to blended learning in spring 2020.
Overall, a blended approach was the most frequently used format with 46 per cent of teachers reporting
this was being used at their school. Still, a substantial proportion also stated that they were only teaching
face-to-face classes (39 per cent).123
UNICEF ECA was particularly involved in immediate communication and messaging around good
hygiene practices. According to a recently completed survey, the most easily recalled message was to
engage in frequent hand washing and sanitizing with 76 per cent of regional students remembering

this message in the countries assessed. Regionally, comparable proportions recalled the messages
relating to mask wearing and physical distancing. An important factor to learn from this is that the
hygiene messaging given as a core element of the ‘emergency COVID-19 response’ had a very clear
development/preventive focus- ensuring that good hygiene was practiced to safeguard against and
minimize risks from potential COVID-19 outbreaks. This contrasts with the ‘norm of humanitarian
responses’ where the response is focused on addressing problems/ damage etc. that have occurred as
a result of a disaster such as a hurricane.
The UNICEF ECA focus on education is shifting from the immediate COVID-19 response to
consideration of blended learning. The UNICEF ECA Annual Report for 2020124 highlighted the
significant challenges related to managing, delivering and accessing online and face to face education
through a ‘blended approach’. The challenges focus around:
• Gaps in teacher capacity. Recognizing the different skills need to teach in a mix of online and
face to face settings;
• Sufficient quality and reliability of access to devices and internet services in both schools and
homes
• Adjustments to school/class settings to permit safe opening of schools. Key here was the
recognition that moving to a ‘shift’ approach would bring additional safety issues;
• The challenge for schools, ministries, and parents to manage, communicate and operate in a
more flexible yet structured and safe environment.
Based on the most recent, direct consultations with children and youth, it is important to keep in mind
that while some students enjoy on-line learning, others struggle. About half of the parents of primary
school children acknowledged that their child did not have the skills necessary to navigate online
learning on their own. Further to this, only 43 per cent of primary school parents had the time and
flexibility to help accommodate this format of learning125. 50 per cent of students at both levels and
across territories had access to adequate internet.126
While on-line learning can be a stepping-stone for future digitalization, students still benefit from face-
to-face interaction for their academic performance, but also emotionally and socially.127
While there has been some progress over the MCP 2017-2021 period on DRR in education, it is clear
that addressing these challenges effectively will require strategies and approaches that link operational
responses to upstream policy work.
A potential approach would be to take a more demand driven approach and to focus on collecting and
managing disaggregated data at local levels that is then used as both a driver and model for upstream
system strengthening. It will also require greater collaboration with other UN and government
stakeholders to ensure coherence in approach to planning and implementation of response, as well as
a more integrated humanitarian-development nexus approach to designing operational responses.
Child protection and DRR

There were differences in figures reported among various sources, which made accountability a
challenge. In the recovery phase, psychosocial support was provided for children through child friendly
and safe spaces, reopening of early childhood development facilities, establishing temporary learning
spaces and supporting the return to school. Safe environments were rehabilitated for the most
vulnerable children (e.g. Chances Home, Dominica and British Virgin Islands Rainbow Children’s Home
and Autism Centre) This included the Return to Happiness Programme and the Creative Learning and
Arts Programme in British Virgin Islands. 1,656 psychosocial support facilitators were trained and 13,042
children received mental health and psychosocial support.128 300 parents and caregivers were trained
in child protection concepts and principles, as well as child abuse prevention. A child protection officer
was deployed for one year to Dominica to support these efforts. The water distribution system in
Dominica was also rebuilt.
CDEMA was the main regional partner for leading these efforts. There were nevertheless substantial
concerns about the ability of UNICEF to manage the distribution and logistics of emergency assistance,
as well as its targeting and monitoring, to ensure that it reached those most in need, based on a number
of interviews. UNICEF ECA also helped CDEMA integrate child protection in the organizations own
policies, along with related capacity building, including training for CDEMA staff. A guidance document
on child protection in emergencies was also prepared.
Similarly, the migration response also had a strong focus on the protection needs of children on
the move, though the sustainability of these initiatives is a challenge. The 2020 Action Plan was
designed. Support included Child Friendly Spaces and psycho-social counselling.

Child protection in crisis: Case of the migration crisis in Trinidad and Tobago
More than 500 children accessed these Child Friendly Spaces. 160-190 children were given individual
support and 3000 children were in group counselling. 139 unaccompanied minors required foster
care. Efforts were made to reduce the process of 6 months to 6 weeks, but so far, only a few of these
children have been placed in foster care. The Childline app was developed by one of the civil society
organization partners and launched in Oct 2020, with 800 downloads by spring 2021. These efforts
have also been extended to the host community, forging links between all children.
The immediate COVID-19 response focused on providing lifesaving health information. The
effects of COVID-19 on violence against children remain a major risk but tracking actual cases is difficult
under continuing restrictions. In Trinidad and Tobago, more than 12,000 migrant and host community
families were reached to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and keep migrant children safe. There
are great concerns that COVID-19 will result in growing frustration and increasing tensions between
parents and children, which in turn could entail an increase in the violent disciplining or child neglect.
Levels of domestic violence and sexual abuse may increase. However, so far, the number of abuse cases
remains consistent, with slightly higher reporting of emotional abuse in Trinidad and Tobago, though,
with the continuing restrictions, those most vulnerable may not be able to report.
DRR and Social Protection
With the hurricane response, the immediate needs of affected families were addressed through
cash-transfer. Both Dominica and the British Virgin Islands benefited from cash transfer programmes,
where UNICEF provided support particularly to households with children.
Post-disaster cash transfer: the case of Dominica
In Dominica, after a Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), the Joint Emergency Cash Transfer
(JECT) programmes implemented with the WFP targeted 8,000 of the poorest households in the
country, including 6,000 children. Ultimately, 6,153 vulnerable children and their families were
reached with cash transfers. It was the first of its kinds for UNICEF, and the first globally to run
together with WFP.1 Nevertheless, the division of labor and coordination among UN agencies,
especially with the WFP remained a challenge, with a number of interviewees questioning the
UNICEF mandate in cash transfer. There were also some delays in the actual transfers, namely due
to the technology used. The effort was supported by a UNICEF presence on the ground during six
months.
The British Virgin Islands also benefited from an emergency cash transfer programme supported by
UNICEF. With a view to meeting related, longer term needs across the sub-region, the OECS is preparing
a model on strengthening shock responsive systems in the face of climate change.
A small opportunity for cash-transfer also existed in Trinidad and Tobago, but had not yet been
taken up by UNICEF. In relation to the migration crisis, over 1,000 children and their caregivers benefited
from early learning, education, stimulation, nutritional counselling and care packages/food vouchers.
Civil society organizations were also promoting cultural exchange and social integration between
migrant and local children, for example, through regular summer camps that both communities could
attend. One of the interviews also suggested that cash-transfer could be used to cover the school
transportation costs of migrant children. The system could then facilitate the later integration of migrant
90
households into the regular social support programmes in the country over time, when politically
possible.
COVID-19 and social protection needs
Social protection needs will grow substantially, as an effect of COVID-19. The poverty impact of
COVID-19 is expected to be severe in the sub-region, with a projected six-fold increase in severe poverty
from under 2.5 percent to over 16.5 percent. The average unemployment rate for the countries included
in the analysis will increase by 26 percentage points from 8 per cent before to 35 per cent as a result of
pandemic. 129 There has also been an impact on school feeding programmes, due to school closures.
UNICEF, together with other UN agencies has mobilized also to address the resulting social
protection issues. For example, a microsimulation model on COVID-19 impact on household and child
poverty in St. Lucia was prepared. The risk of politicization of government support was noted by one
interviewee.
9. CONCLUSIONS
The findings of the MCP-E reflect both evidence on the accountability for the performance of the
previous MCP, as well as providing g useful lessons-learned for the MCP currently under development.
The main, overall conclusions are outlined below. Ultimately, these conclusions and the
recommendations in the final section should support the design of the next MCP.
Conclusion 1: While the MCP was aligned with the needs and priorities of the 12 countries and
territories, key sub-regional organizations, as well as the needs of the most vulnerable children, it did
not sufficiently capture UNICEF added-value, including its close relationship with governments and sub-
regional organizations, in promoting more resilient education and addressing violence against children,
as well as employing the synergies between upstream and downstream approaches and between inside-
track and outside track advocacy.
Conclusion 2: The MCP did not sufficiently capture the nexus between humanitarian and development
objectives, as was required in the disaster-prone sub-region.
Conclusion 3: While stronger than that of many other UN agencies, the UNICEF ECA presence in the
sub-region, especially through direct in-country engagement remained a challenge for the MCP.
Conclusion 4: The highly ambitious and comprehensive MCP, especially its need to adapt to recurrent
crises, was also not fully aligned with the means of UNICEF ECA, including those for monitoring,
evaluation and learning, which remained focused on accountability for planned project delivery.
UNICEF ECA structures, procedures (e.g. more adaptive programming and flexible, learning oriented
monitoring, evaluation and learning), as well as staff competencies and technical skills did not fully align
with the need for multi-sector programming, a greater focus on advocacy for systemic change and
integrating the humanitarian-development nexus.

Lessons-learned were identified as a part of the evaluation process, notably through the revision of the
MCP ToC, as well as by exploring the external and internal assumptions underlying the pathways of
change. This section summarizes the main lessons-learned; many cutting across outcome areas and
challenging existing UNICEF ECA operational modalities.
1. Adapting and flexing to changing circumstances, such as the 2017 hurricane response,
migration crisis and now the COVID-19 response and relief efforts required leadership and
flexibility from previous objectives, standard operating procedures, including on monitoring,
evaluation and learning, as well as staff roles, alignment with national needs and close
coordination among relief agencies, notably CDEMA, IFRC and PAHO, among others. These
coordination efforts worked better in the COVID-19 response than previously and should
influence the next MCP, as it integrates climate change and the development/humanitarian
nexus in both the MCP objectives, ToC and operational modalities, including the results
framework and related processes.
2. Reliance on governments in the identification of the most marginalized, in the context of multi-
dimensional and dynamic poverty, did not always reach those most excluded. More grass-roots
approaches, relying on support from local government and civil society organizations may be
more effective (e.g. in identifying recently arrived migrant children, or migrant children in
remote, rural settings, those requiring cash transfers) and should supplement government
guided efforts, where relevant and feasible.
3. While policy change is possible (e.g. ECD, child justice and protection, social protection), it
requires politically astute advocacy and excellent, personal relationships with key government
representatives. Policy implementation remains the main challenge, due to lack of resources.
Here as well, advocacy for increasing attention on children’s issues and particularly allocation
of public budget to key areas, such as ECD, education, child protection and social protection
programmes is required. Advocacy for increasing related public expenditure and using carefully
targeted programme resources for direct service delivery in areas that can catalyze reform and
demonstrate the importance of public funding are required. Advocacy requires efforts well
beyond individual, finite project interventions, and should therefore also be reflected in ECA
operational modalities and resourcing, including staff roles.
4. While UNICEF began its work on communications for development during the MCP period,
influencing deeply engrained social and gender norms (e.g. corporal punishment and violence
against girls) requires great effort and particularly time.
5. UNICEF added-value, especially the synergies between upstream and downstream approaches,
the development/humanitarian nexus and between inside-track and outside track advocacy
were insufficiently understood and represented in the MCP, the ToC and UNICEF ECA
operational modalities, including organizational structure and staff competencies. Greater
attention needs to be given to these synergies, as well as other cross-cutting issues, namely
climate change and gender; all requiring greater coordination and collaboration across the MCP
outcomes and pathways of change, as well as UNICEF ECA structures, processes and resources.
6. UNICEF has not yet sufficiently identified its own particular added-value (e.g. on social
protection) and how it can best leverage partnerships (e.g. donors, IFIs, civil society
organizations, private sector) to increase its impact at scale around key objectives (e.g. ECD,
VAC, data, social protection). Stronger partnerships among UN agencies (e.g. on COVID-19) as
well as leveraging existing work of donors, especially key IFIs (e.g. CDB, IDB and World Bank) in
areas such as increasing public expenditure on children and social protection need to be further
explored. Partnerships with civil society organizations need to be further fostered, particularly
to identify and reach the most marginalized and vulnerable groups (e.g. migrant children in
Trinidad and Tobago) Engagement with the private sector can also generate substantial effects
at scale.
92
7. Mainstreaming of DRR and further exploration of the humanitarian/development nexus is
required to shift from an emergency response, to a more preventative, resilience mode, not
least due to the effects of climate change in the sub-region.

FINAL REPORT
EVALUATION
11. RECOMMENDATIONS
The recommendations below were developed in a participatory manner with UNICEF ECA and LACRO
staff during a virtual workshop, which validated overall findings and co-created related recommendations
in smaller break-out groups. The consultant facilitating the strategic planning process was also closely
engaged in the design and implementation of the consultative process, which then seamlessly extended
into the design of the next MCP. The recommendations were ultimately consolidated and prioritized,
being summarized below, in order of priority based on the design and eventual implementation of the
next MCP.

Design of the next MCP
1 Define clearer, more specific and achievable objectives, with a UNICEF ECA,
focus on advocacy for policy change, in a limited number of UNICEF LACRO,
geographies and themes, along with a related results UN agencies, UN
framework in the new MCP reflecting: RCOs
- UNICEF’s specific added-value on ECD and more
resilient education, reduced violence and child protection, in
line with a related theory of change, resources and capacity to
consolidate VAC
- proportionality and relative size of problems faced,
population of children and size of countries and territories (e.g.
Trinidad and Tobago).
- flexibility in related change pathways, including the use
of both service delivery and advocacy for sustained impact
- Leveraging of partnerships e.g. CDEMA, Caribbean
Public Health Agency (CARPHA), IFRC, donors, EU/ECHO,
relevant UN agencies, as well as civil society organizations;
particularly in the identification of the most vulnerable and
marginalized children and their families, including those with
developmental delays and disabilities
2 There is a need to improve the humanitarian-development UNICEF ECA
nexus, to ensure that activities of a short-term emergency
nature are carried out in a context that takes longer-term and
interconnected problems into account.
For the next MCP it is critical for UNICEF ECA to understand
their ‘value addition in this critical area and to further embed
this through developing clear pathways from the desired
developmental outcomes back to the current humanitarian
situation and needs. Applying a clear ‘resilience lens’ to the
development of objectives, pathways and activities as well as
monitoring indicators will be critical to support this.
