ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This report provides an independent formative evaluation of the Teacher Training Curriculum Model (TTCM)
project conducted by CERD and UNICEF from 2017 to 2021 in order to transform in-service training for public
school teachers.
The evaluation was commissioned by UNICEF Lebanon Country Office in consultation with CERD, produced by
CAYAMBE and relied upon consultation and input from a wide range of stakeholders. The evaluation team
wishes to thank every contributor for their valued input and support.
Appreciation goes first to the CERD at the central, regional and local level, with particular thanks to the PITB for
their time and commitment.
Throughout the assignment, the CAYAMBE team benefitted from the continuous support and guidance of
UNICEF and its implementation partners; in particular, MEHE officials, DOPS and other field stakeholders as well
as other donor organizations. Their input was instrumental for the overall fieldwork organization and access to
information.
We would like to give a special thanks to the following individuals who allocated a significant amount of time
and support to the organization and follow-up of this evaluation: Dr Ghinwa Itani, Education specialist; Mr.
Justus Kawesigye, Evaluation specialist and Dr Tamara Nassereddine, Evaluation officer; Mr George Haddad,
Planning, Research, Innovation, Monitoring & Evaluation specialist at UNICEF Lebanon; Mrs Rania Ghouassoub,
Head of Pre-service and In-service Training Bureau (PITB); Mrs Farha Wehbe, training coordinator; Mrs Rima
Gedeon, Financial manager at CERD; and Mrs Hilda Khoury, Director of DOPS at MEHE.
Our gratitude also goes to all school directors in the surveyed governorates for having largely facilitated the
organization of site visits and class observations at the sub-national level in the difficult context of the COVID-
19 pandemic and fuel crisis.
Finally, we would like to recognise all other Development Organizations who also committed part of their busy
schedule for this evaluation, for their valuable input concerning competency-based teaching and learning in the
RACE II context.
The CAYAMBE team as a whole, including the evaluators, offers its most sincere thanks to all those who
contributed in varying degrees to this evaluation. In the context of ongoing education reforms, we hope that
this report can offer an objective picture of the significant work carried out to allow every child in Lebanese
schools to fully enact their right to quality education and open new perspectives for future improvements.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The context of the Teacher Training Curriculum Model (TTCM) and its objectives
The multi-layered crises facing Lebanon (Syrian refugee crisis, political unrest, economic collapse, COVID-19
pandemic, Port of Beirut explosion) have further challenged the capacity of the Ministry of Education and Higher
Education (MEHE) to maintain a highly qualified and well-trained teacher corps.
In 2017, CERD partnered with UNICEF to re-design the national teacher training curriculum in accordance with
the recently adopted competency frameworks for teachers, trainers and other education staff. Given the
fragmented teacher education system, and the lack of clear understanding of the competency-based teaching
and learning approach among main education stakeholders, the rationale of this partnership was to adopt a
global curriculum approach to teacher professional development.
The TTCM was meant to provide a national theoretical backbone and a common framework for the planning of
training modules in all training centres under the Pre-service and In-service Training Bureau (PITB) in Lebanon.
The design process allowed to clearly link each module, face-to-face on online and self-paced, to a teacher
competency or competency component of the 2017 framework. A Training Management System (TMS) was
also developed for data-sharing among relevant education stakeholders (inspectors, coaches, administrators)
that supports efforts to build a coherent and uniform teachers’ professional development structure at the
national level.
In its preface, the TTCM Teacher Training Handbook, describes the objectives of the TTCM project as follows: i)
to Improve the quality of the training design to target the competency framework for teachers and transfer to
classroom practices, to respond to the specific needs of teachers and address attitude towards cross-cutting
themes in education; ii) to improve the capacity of the PITB to track and disseminate attainment of competency
building per teacher and attitude change towards cross cutting educational themes; iii) to improve the quality
of teacher training to address the specific needs of new teachers in the public schools system; iv) to improve
the competencies of trainers; and v) to improve the quality of training within the training centres.
Maximized transfer of acquired competencies into teachers’ routine professional practice was targeted
through the adoption of a specific instructional planning approach called “Understanding by Design (UbD)”. As
teacher training takes place outside of the school environment in Lebanon, the expert committee set-up for the
project adapted this school-based approach to national teacher training institutions practices and culture.
Objectives of the evaluation
The evaluation of the joint CERD-UNICEF Teacher Training Curriculum Model (TTCM) project was entrusted to
CAYAMBE in June 2021 and took place over a seven-month period between July 2021 and January 2022. The
purpose of this evaluation is contributing to the evidence generation around the -based adaptation of the TTCM
in order to increase its use and effectiveness within Lebanon’s new competency-based teacher training vision.
This evaluation is expected to generate recommendations that will help the Government of Lebanon and its
partners to build upon the major achievements and successes of TTCM while identifying necessary
improvements and further actions needed to maximize its impact on teacher quality.
Evaluation scope
The evaluation covered activities and developments of the TTCM project since its adoption in 2017 to 2021
leading to an overall cost of 3,074,357 USD, with activities still ongoing after this date. Its scope included existing
TTCM methods, materials and measurable outcomes, namely:

/ The Process adopted for TTCM design, training delivery and co-construction;
/ The Content of the TTCM materials1 and their adaptation into self-paced modules; and
/ The Results of the implemented training. No Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability and Learning
(MEAL) guidelines, indicators and an agenda of activities were however initially set out in a logical
framework, so results could not be assessed according to fixed targets.
The general approach used in this evaluation
This evaluation was formative and process-based. It was conducted using a human rights and gender approach
with focus on the right of every child to quality education, with unequivocal regard to gender equality, equity
and inclusion in public schools. It adopted a mixed method approach, using qualitative and quantitative data
collected at national and sub-national levels in cooperation with a wide range of education sector stakeholders,
including MEHE, CERD, education experts, school teachers and staff, UNICEF staff and donor agencies. The
evaluation’s field visits took place between mid-June 2021 and the end of January 2022.
Two complementary evaluation approaches were used: The Beneficiary Assessment and Outcome Harvesting.
These approaches helped the evaluation team find their way within the relatively complex set of TTCM
documentation, addressing the main challenges of the evaluation and overcoming the limitations of the context
(pandemic and social crises, fuel crisis, strikes, etc.). The pandemic and social crises made it impossible to
perform randomized controlled trials (RCT) based on an experimental group in order to estimate the net impact
of TTCM training on teachers or students. Therefore, the team focused on retrospectively identifying emergent
impacts of these trainings by collecting evidence on what teaching practices have changed (step1) and then, by
working backwards, determining if and how an intervention has contributed or not to these changes.
Main findings
• Relevance
The evaluation team concludes that the TTCM project was relevant, with general objectives established based
on a preliminary identification of stakeholders’ needs, including teachers, trainers and indirectly students. This
preliminary identification of needs, although conducted informally, singled out areas of focus that broadly
respond to recognized transversal teachers’ needs such as differentiated instruction, blended learning,
classroom management and competency-based teaching and learning. The roll out of training modules on
Teaching with Technology (TwT) and remote/online training approach played an important role in overcoming
the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, yet a limited number of teachers enrolled and completed
the self-paced modules. The study reveals an overall positive perception by various stakeholders (teachers,
principals, trainers, Guidance and Counselling Directorate (DOPS), experts) over the relevance of TTCM training.
The TTCM project established a twofold innovation: a new competency-based approach to training on the one
hand addressing the competency framework, a “new instructional framework” (UbD) on the other hand,
targeting improved transfer. This double change rendered the training design process more complex and
somehow less relevant for the trainers and training development and implementation more difficult with
several confusing misalignment of teachers vs trainers tools and approaches.
• Effectiveness
The TTCM project was effective, achieving most of its expected general objectives. The proposed modules and
content successfully addressed the national competency frameworks adopted in 2017, as recognized by more
1 As per ToR, the content includes 5 Core training modules (TWT, LAC, CP, Inclusion and Gender), Teacher Training Induction Curriculum design

than 86% of trainers. The Training Management System (TMS) was designed to be a purposeful and modern
tool for monitoring teachers’ professional development from a lifelong learning perspective. The TMS provided
the trainers with a holistic view of attendee profiles, the prerequisites for attending the training, the content
material, and successfully supported the design and implementation of training sessions. However, it was not
fully operational over the project implementation period due to power cuts and the inability to turn on the
servers. Among the challenges that emerged were the time needed for trainers to plan performance tasks (key
evaluation tool according to the TTCM), the inability of the trainers to follow up on attendees in their classrooms
as well as the limits of the TMS for archiving lessons for future reference. Approximately 20% of trainers
considered that the allocated time for the training was not sufficient. Most of the trainers stated that the five
core modules developed were clear, helpful to improve the quality of education and valuable for tackling
important challenges in Lebanon (forced shift to online teaching as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Syrian
refugee crisis). The Teacher Induction Curriculum (TIC) for novice teachers was not tested, making it impossible
to perform an effectiveness analysis.
• Efficiency
The average unit cost of training one person under the TTCM over the five years of the project is 96 USD per
person (USD 3.07 million / 32,162 trainees). However, this average is to be interpreted with precaution as it
combines both the average cost of the online training (during 2020 and 2021) and the in-person training (during
2017-2019). The unit cost for 2017 was approximately 645 USD, but this high unit cost is mainly explained by
the inclusion of the development costs associated with the TTCM framework and training modules that meant
only the trainers were attending training sessions during this first year. Moreover, the sessions mainly consisted
of Training of Trainers (ToT) and coaching workshops, which are usually considered as relatively more expensive
than teacher training. The unit costs in 2018 and 2019 are more representative of the average cost of teacher
training (112 USD and 93 USD respectively) and the teachers accounted for more than 96% of the training
population. In comparison to other international in-service teacher training initiatives, this cost is reasonable
and close to the expected cost of 100 USD per teacher foreseen in the RACEII logical framework.
• Impact
No formal macro- or meso-level impact assessment was conducted between 2017 and 2020, so the evaluation
focused on micro-level impact of the DIFA module and interpretation of meso-impact level on teaching
practices. The team observed lasting impact of the training on teacher behaviours and practices to varying
degrees. Significant change was observed in teacher behaviour towards inclusion and child protection issues.
For example, trained teachers implemented the key concepts of the child protection module in all the classes
observed. The modules concerning inclusion and differentiation were observed as being generally applied in
classes containing learners with academic difficulties or special needs. Regarding teaching with technology
(TwT), certain teachers attributed their weak use of ICT to the lack of technological tools in their schools and
others mentioned power cuts as a major barrier to teaching with technology. 76% of trainers asserted that the
TTCM improved the quality of the training but stated that refresher training is essential to ensure a long-lasting
impact. Concerning the most important hallmarks of the TTCM design, the UbD tools (performance tasks,
rubrics, backward design) seemed to be considered more impactful by the trainers than the competency-based
approach.
• Sustainability
In terms of sustainability, the TTCM proved notably adaptable to considerable unforeseen circumstances
including health, political, and socio-economic crises. However, the vital role of external technical experts holds
potential for concern, considering the highly theoretical and conceptual complexity of most methodological
documents. The project triggered promising partnerships between CERD-PITB and MEHE-DOPS since some of
18/03/2022 –Evaluation of the TTCM project (2017-2021) and its impact on the quality of teacher learning and
11
practice in public schools
the DOPS were also trainers with the PITB. However, coordination and alignment issues were perceived among
donor-supported initiatives targeting education quality. Better understanding and coordination of pre-service
teacher training is also recommended. The TTCM team purposefully studied the potential for coordination
between TTCM and pre-service training offered in universities, but unfortunately this aspect of the study was
not used for action. Two concerns were regularly raised by the beneficiaries of the project: the need to carry
out post-training follow-up and the need for a system of recognition or motivation for the trainees.
Conclusion
Undoubtedly, the TTCM project was pioneering in the implementation of a new vision for teacher continuous
training in Lebanon, following-up on the modernization process triggered by the adoption of the teacher
competency framework. It fostered new tools and new approaches for teacher training quality with an explicit
aim to ensure a real shift from teacher training quality into efficient teaching practices in the classroom. This is
a highly important step to advocate for improved and more frequent impact assessment practices in teacher
training. In order to ensure sustainability of the results and further improve the process, four key points should
be kept in mind, and these four key points were used to frame the strategic and operational recommendations:
1) The successful teacher training modernization process confirmed by the TTCM leads to a better
understanding of the teacher competency framework as key leverage to foster quality education. However,
teachers’ classroom practices cannot be deeply and sustainably changed if the different components of the
school curriculum are not coherent and competency-based (curriculum, teacher pre-service and in-training,
evaluation guidelines); 2) Such a reform process should seek to preserve diversity among teachers’ classroom
practices, therefore training approaches ought not to be limited to the socio-constructivist paradigm. Teachers
remain free to choose the best teaching methods and approaches, including transmissive pedagogies, to adapt
to the needs of a specific class or pupil. Irrespective of the benefits of direct transmission, constructivism, active
and passive teaching strategies, the effectiveness of any teaching practice depends on how teachers implement
it in the classroom; 3) The adaptation of the UbD model to adult learning and teacher training institutions raised
several methodological and pedagogical issues to be addressed before further development; and 4) The present
evaluation paved the way to anchoring impact assessment as a key feature of training design and development
at CERD learning from existing evidence.
Overall, the collected evidence is suggestive of the TTCM project being a factor associated to inclusive
Education. Therefore, the project contributes to the fulfilment to children rights to education reflected in the
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The DIFA module particularly addressed the needs of
marginalized children through a rights-based approach. It succeeded in providing teachers with new tools and
approaches to differentiate their teaching and better address children’s heterogeneity.
Strategic recommendations:
REC #1: The Government should seek permanent coherence and generalized reference to competency-based
teaching and learning, especially in a context of revising the Lebanese curricula, targeting increased coherence
in education (teacher training (both initial and in-service), curriculum, assessment methods for teachers,
exams).
REC #2: CERD and UNICEF should revise and simplify the TTCM framework and tools and extend the present
tools to teaching practices outside of the socio-constructivist paradigm. Teachers to remain free to choose their
pedagogies, including transmissive ones. Unnecessary complexity should be avoided in professional and
methodological documents. Assessment tools should not be limited to project-based approach.
REC#3: PITB and UNICEF should consider referring to a Lebanese backward design approach based on
performance tasks rather than to an international registered trademark and make sure that intellectual
18/03/2022 –Evaluation of the TTCM project (2017-2021) and its impact on the quality of teacher learning and
12
practice in public schools
property issues regarding UbD are taken into consideration if the decision is taken to maintain official reference
to UbD (Memorandum of Understanding, official authorization for example).
REC#4: MEHE and CERD should pursue improved collaboration and unified effort of PITB & DOPS, bringing
together to avoid redundancy and/or duplicated effort (e.g. currently two separate management systems) and
allow for a better return on work and investments, with the coordinated support of their technical and financial
partners.
REC#5: UNICEF and CERD should ensure provision for project quality assurance, quality control and MEAL for
the next phases of the TTCM, including quality plan and MEAL guidelines
REC#6: UNICEF and CERD should conduct a Needs Analysis (NA) as a foundation for the “redesign” and re-
deployment of next phases of the project. The proper structure, mechanisms and processes for a sustainable
Need Analysis with a continuous and agile monitoring and evaluation system are yet to be defined. The TMS,
as it is today, cannot be considered as contributing to the NA.
REC#7: CERD and its partners should provide PITB with further Capacity Development with actual targeted and
customized capacity development plan for CERD’s PITB permanent staff. In fact, this is the main enabler if not
the major success indicator for long term impact and for the desired institutionalization of the process. It should
entail revised internal and external communication flows, tools and mechanisms.
Operational recommendations
The report also formulates operational recommendations aiming at ensuring better internal quality control and
tools, correcting major inconsistencies and building on lessons learned, for instance hybridization. The need for
training follow-up is also mentioned. A continued effort of including human rights based and gender sensitive
approaches in teacher training is recommended.

2 The TTCM does not consist of a defined set of costed activities. These figures are therefore reconstructed by the evaluation team.
3 These numbers underestimate the total output of the TTCM, since one person might have attended more than one training session. Thus, in order to
accurately reflect the number of beneficiaries, we calculated the total number of persons attending trainings under the TTCM (example: one person
attending 4 trainings is counted here as 4).
4 When the 2021 indicative budget is included (to contain training on Mawrid-e Plan, ADAPT, CLASSERA and Back-to-school material), the total number
of persons trained and coached under TTCM reaches 32,162 persons, the teachers representing around 93% of this total number of trained persons.

1.2. Brief socio-economic and political context
1.2.1. A Challenging Socio-economic context
With accumulating inefficiencies and underinvestment5 in education over the last two decades, teaching in
Lebanese public schools has significantly deteriorated6. Even before the Syrian crisis, 30% of Lebanese students
attending public schools were experiencing relatively high rates of failure and dropout, compared to those in
the private sector. The multi-layered crises facing Lebanon (Syrian refugee crisis, political unrest, economic
collapse, COVID-19 pandemic, Port of Beirut explosion) have further challenged the capacity of the Ministry of
Education and Higher Education (MEHE) to maintain a highly qualified and well-trained teaching corps.
Large-scale international programs were launched to support the Lebanese government’s goal of ensuring
quality education for Syrian children, following MEHE’s decision to open its public schools to refugee children
to ensure their right to formal education in 2013. Thus, as part of its Reaching All Children with Education (RACE
I and RACE II) plans, the MEHE has received support from international donors (UNHCR, UNICEF, UNESCO, the
World Bank and other donors) to provide free education to all children in basic education up to 9th grade (EB9).
The support is organized through three pillars: improved access to education opportunities (Pillar I); improved
quality of education services (Pillar II); and improved education systems (Pillar III). Output 2.2 under pillar II
targets training of teachers, personnel, and educators to be coordinated by CERD. The UNICEF-supported
TTCM project is embedded into this framework. Other donors supporting Pillar II of Race II were USAID and
World Learning through the QITABI 2 Project, the World Bank and UNESCO. Worth noting is also the “inclusive
school” pilot program launched in thirty schools in 2018 by MEHE with the support of UNICEF.
According to 2021 government estimates, Lebanon hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees and half of Syrian children
(3-18 years) benefit from formal education, either entering public school during the morning shift (known as
the first shift), or in the afternoon school classes opened for refugees (known as the second shift)7. The number
of school-age Syrian refugees exceeded the 332,126 Lebanese children enrolled in public schools in 2018-20198.
The share of enrolment of Lebanese children in private schools for general education is 64%9.
After school closures began in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic seriously undermined the stability of the
2020-2021 academic year. Lebanon experienced major uncertainties related to compounded crises, particularly
after the severe fuel and electricity shortages at the end of the summer 2021. Schools and universities, like
other businesses and working spaces, suffered from severe rationing of electricity. Private generators, usually
used as a substitute to the standing EDL network, were non-functional following the significant decrease in the
country’s fuel imports. Public and private schools were left with an unsolvable dilemma; they could not
accommodate their students in face-to-face settings due to both COVID-19 restrictions and the significant
increase in transportation fees, yet they could not ensure online teaching due to the permanent state of the
electricity crisis.
Under these challenging circumstances, the social climate quickly deteriorated; an exponential increase in
transportation fees was the last straw, leading to a teacher strike in the fall of 2021. The academic year was
delayed to November 2021 and continues to be subject to turmoil and uncertainty from teachers strikes.
5 In the last 3 budget laws, the education budget (budget of MEHE) fell from 2,091 billion Lebanese pounds in 2018 (i.e. 1.4 billion US dollars, calculated
at the exchange rate of 1507 pounds to 1 dollar at that time, or 2, 8% of GDP in 2018), to 2,085 billion in 2019, to drop to 1,953 billion pounds in the 2020
law.

1.2.2. Key institutional players in teacher training
In Lebanon, responsibility for education is shared between CERD and other institutions or departments under
the leadership of MEHE. CERD has the primary responsibility for the development and review of the national
curriculum, learning assessment, research and evaluation, the issuance of yearly national statistical bulletins on
education as well as developing and rolling out training for teachers and school personnel. CERD was
established by Decree # 2356, dated 10 December 1971, as a public institution having a juristic personality
enjoying administrative and financial autonomy. CERD reports directly to the Minister of Education and Higher
Education who acts as a custodial authority. The MEHE is in charge of administration and policy making,
including planning, data systems and teacher management. As noted by the World Bank in 2021, “close
coordination between CERD and MEHE are critical for the achievement of (key) milestones” in education10.
Since the adoption of the present curricula in 1997, CERD and PITB both oversaw the implementation of
continuous training for public school teachers. Following the implementation of Law 344 dated August 6, 2001,
a university degree became a prerequisite for a tenured teacher contract. As a result, the pre-service training
was transferred from PITB to universities. Nevertheless, the PITB conducted pre-service training and
certification of teachers of all subjects between 1973 and 2002, graduating 13,111 teachers during this period.
Work started on the Continuous Training Project early in the school year 2003-2004 within the framework of a
joint agreement between the Lebanese and French governments. Six resource centres (RC) were established in
the Lebanese governorates, where new positions of teacher-trainers were created.
PITB currently contracts around 200 trainers of various areas of specialization. Training sessions are conducted
by contractual trainers in PITB’s thirty-three training centres across Lebanon. According to PITB statistics, public
school teaching corps account for 40,000 teachers approximately, 40% of which are contractual teachers11.
Similarly, around 25,000 teachers (58% of the teaching body) and education personnel are trained per year on
various academic, administrative, pedagogical and technological topics. On average, 2000 training sessions take
place every year across the Lebanese territory. Such sessions are all the more necessary considering two laws
adopted in 1985 and 2002 that allowed the recruitment of “contractual teachers” (teachers paid “by the hour”),
yielding an “over-supply of under-qualified teaching staff in public schools for basic education12” (RACE II). This
increase in under-protected jobs in the public sector has led to a decrease in the quality of the teaching body
and raised new challenges related to informality, underpayment, and under-recognition. It also created
prominent discrepancies within the teaching population in Lebanese public schools.
The “Département d’Orientation Pédagogique Scolaire” (DOPS) at MEHE is mandated to monitor and coach
teachers during instruction. PITB and MEHE DOPS, given their mandate, are key players in many of the
interventions under the RACE 2 Pillar II “Improved quality of educational services.13”

1.2.3. The unfinished Lebanese reform towards competency-based education
The evolution towards competency14-based teaching and learning has been recognized worldwide as a new
paradigm of education since the late 1990’s. As demonstrated by Halasz and Michel (2011), the need to view
the curriculum and learning outcomes in terms of competencies, that is to say as a combination of knowledge,
skills, attitudes and values, is seen as an evolution rather than a revolution.15 Teacher competency frameworks
are often considered as the cornerstone of such evolutions: they influence greater consistency between
entrance requirements for initial teacher education, certification examinations, teacher evaluations,
professional development and career progression.
In Lebanon, this evolution is not yet completed. In 1995, a New Framework for Education in Lebanon was
designed by CERD as a basis for new curricula originally developed in 199716. The CERD-UNICEF technical
committee has underlined the importance of adopting a training approach that fosters the teacher
competencies of inquiry and reflection while relying on diversified and active training methods. However, the
national curriculum is still mainly content-based17. Official government sources recognize that “the curriculum
lacks basic skills and is not as learner-centred as international standards require18”. The Competency
Frameworks Supporting Quality Teaching in Lebanon (2017) were therefore a turning point. The frameworks
defined the required professional attributes along four domains.
This framework was set to serve as a practical

training, recruitment procedure and

(274 in total).
Through the TTCM project, in-service teacher training was pioneer in spreading a competency-based practice
and culture in Lebanese basic education.
14 In this report the evaluation team shall use the term “competency”, thus aligning with the Lebanese terminology. However, the evaluation team notes
that in many cases, the term “competence” is privileged. Such a distinction allows a clear understanding of the difference between competency,
considered as a skill needed to do a job and therefore more linked with adult learning, and competence, which is used as the ability or set of skills
possessed by an individual in a lifelong learning perspective. In the recent literature, both terms have become increasingly interchangeable.

1.3. The TTCM project
1.3.1 Rationale for a Teacher Training Curriculum Model
The TTCM captures the essence of the CERD-UNICEF mission to enhance the quality of teacher training. Under
RACE II, a committee19 for enhancing the quality of training was established by UNICEF with financial support
from the Canadian government with the objective of consolidating the procedure that establishes the yearly
regional training plan among all CERD resource centres. The committee included in its plan the mission of
institutionalizing the new work processes and references at CERD. The Issam Fares Institute at the American
University of Beirut was commissioned to conduct a situational analysis of the public-school teacher.
In 2017, CERD partnered with UNICEF to re-design the national teacher training curriculum in accordance with
the adopted competency framework. Given the status quo context of the fragmented teacher education
system, the rationale was to adopt a global curriculum approach to teacher professional development. Indeed,
the design process was based on the six major components of a curriculum according to Demeuse20:

defined role within a harmonious and coherent system”21. It focuses on infusing the principles of child-centred
pedagogy, active learning, differentiated instruction, and inclusive education into the teaching practices of
public schools’ teachers.
As teacher training takes place outside school context in Lebanon, the TTCM design team chose to experiment
with a specific instructional planning approach, the “Understanding by Design (UbD)22”and adapt it.
What is UbD ?
Understanding by Design, or UbD, is a tool utilized for educational planning at the school level focused on "teaching
for understanding". The emphasis of UbD is "backward design", which is the practice of looking at the outcomes in
order to design curriculum units, performance assessments, and classroom instruction.
UbD target student understanding and transfer of learning (i.e. the ability to effectively use content knowledge and
skill in mathematics, writing, and other subjects in real life situations). Understanding is revealed when students
autonomously make sense and transfer their learning through authentic performance tasks.
Initially, the model addresses the needs of teachers for lesson planning at the school level and student’s learning. It
is not oriented towards teacher training institutions and adult learning. The TTCM Handbook therefore provided the
necessary adaptation according to three stages (desired results=>evidence and proofs=>training / learning plan).
The UbD framework was designed by recognized US educators, Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe in 2005.
Understanding by Design® is a registered trademark of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development
("ASCD"). In Lebanon, UbD has been tested in several higher education institutions and international schools;
however, the evaluators did not find documented evaluation of the UbD at school level, at national level or for adult
training purpose.

1.3.3 TTCM Theory of Change
The Theory of Change (ToC) for the TTCM project responds to these key objectives:
- Improve the quality of the training in order to target the competency framework, taking into account
the lack of a clear understanding of the competency-based teaching and learning approach among main
education stakeholders. For this purpose, the design process aligns with the competency framework,
linking clearly each module to a competency or competency component;
- Respond to the specific needs of teachers, with special attention to novice public school teachers, by
addressing key themes in education such as child protection, inclusion, learner centred instruction,
gender issues, sustainable development and peace education; and
- Maximize the transfer of acquired competencies into meaningful teachers’ routine professional
practice. This particular objective was targeted through the adaptation of the UbD framework to
national teacher training institutions practices and culture.
The evaluation team proceeded to reconstruct the ToC leading to the following scheme:

1.3.4 TTCM project timeline
The TTCM was meant to provide a national theoretical backbone and a common framework for the
planning of training modules in all training centres under PITB in Lebanon. A Training Management
System (TMS) and self-paced modules for TMS teams were also developed under the TTCM. TMS is a
platform for data-sharing among relevant education stakeholders (inspectors, coaches,
administrators) that supports the effort to build a coherent and uniform teacher professional
development structure at a national level. Training portfolios for teachers hosted on the TMS were
designed to enable tracking of the continuous construction of professional skills for teachers and
trainers, as documented in the initial software design document.
Implementation was slowed down by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the political and economic
crisis in Lebanon after October 17, 2019. In addition, important changes interfered in the higher
management at CERD in August/September 2020. As documented in multiple KII, PITB had to change
its TTCM-TMS capacity building strategy for trainers and instead developed online training modules
for teachers on Microsoft TEAMS. The PITB developed self-paced remote interactive training modules
to support teachers in public schools learning how to implement blended learning modalities, online
platforms and tools, and the curation of appropriate content. A synchronous online module provided
clear guidance to teachers on how to complete the self-paced modules and the performance task
required at the end. Although attending this training was mandatory for all public school teachers, only
approximately 1,300 teachers enrolled. The economic situation and the lack of internet or appropriate
devices at home were quoted as major barriers preventing teachers from enrolling (KII, Focus Group
Discussion (FGD)). Notwithstanding, it continued to be offered to teachers throughout 2021.
For the 2020-2021 school year, following MEHE’s decision to adopt blended learning, teachers were
requested to provide remote support to children online and offline while working from home. As a
result, no training took place in the first 9 months of 2020. An extra-module for Microsoft teams was
designed and delivered by CERD teams to teachers in response to COVID-19 restrictions after the
forced transition to online courses.
Since the TTCM/TMS was not fully implemented, PITB reverted to “MAWRID-E” training, which is a
two hour synchronous workshop that targeted specific subjects related to online learning and
teaching.
As part of the continuous quality improvement process for the Pre-Service and In-Service Training
Bureau (PITB) at CERD, a Teacher Training Handbook was developed and published in 2020. The design
of this Teacher Training Handbook was motivated by the desire of CERD to further enhance the quality
of teacher training and support an ongoing shift towards competency-based teacher training.
Therefore, this evaluation assignment was commissioned within challenging project circumstances and
had to adapt to these unexpected developments.

2. OBJECTIVES AND USERS OF THE EVALUATION
2.1. Objectives of the evaluation
The evaluation of the joint CERD-UNICEF Teacher Training Curriculum Model (TTCM) project was
entrusted to CAYAMBE in June 2021 and took place over seven months between July 2021 and January
2022.
It illustrates the direct and indirect effects that the introduction of the model has had on trainers and
teacher learning and practices in public schools through comprehensive analysis.
The purpose of this evaluation is to contribute to the evidence-based adaptation of the TTCM in order
to increase its use and effectiveness within Lebanon’s new competency-based teacher training vision.
As per the Terms of Reference (ToR), the evaluation’s objectives were:
/ Generate evidence of the impact of the TTCM on the learning of public-school teachers as
well as their practice;
/ Generate evidence of the perception of public-school directors, DOPS-DGE
coaches/counsellors and teachers of the impact of TTCM on teaching and learning;
/ Issue recommendations to modify the design and implementation of the training modules
as needed;
/ Issue evidence-based recommendations for policy development to improve the quality of
education; and
/ Issue recommendations for further research to measure the effect of the TTCM approach
on the quality of education.
2.2. Users and uses of the evaluation
This evaluation was expected to generate recommendations that will help the Government of
Lebanon, and its partners (see Table below), to build upon the major achievements and success of
TTCM and identify necessary improvements and further actions needed to maximize its impact on
teacher quality.

4. APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY
4.1. Evaluation criteria
Criteria included in the matrix are presented in the evaluation matrix at Annex 2. They include five
OECD/DAC24 criteria: Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Impact and Sustainability. Since detailed
financial statements and yearly “actual vs. planned budgets” were provided to the team, Effectiveness
and Efficiency were evaluated separately and the Efficiency analysis was based on a detailed tracking
of all expenditures, while linking costs to tangible outcomes and retracing the evolution of unit costs
on yearly basis.
It is important to note that coherence was excluded from the initial evaluation framework. Even
though it was not explicitly included in the ToR, our team of evaluators considered that the Coherence
criteria is instrumental to inform decision-making at all levels. Thus, Coherence was specifically
addressed by the team as a key dimension for future policy making, leading to several key
recommendations, coupled with the “Relevance” dimension.
Gender mainstreaming and human rights dimensions are integrated into all evaluation criteria.
4.2. Evaluation questions
Following the initial desk review phase, the initial Key Evaluation Questions (KEQ) from the ToR have
been adjusted to improve their relevance to the current implementation status of the TTCM. For
example, knowing that many teachers were not able to implement their newly acquired practices in
the classroom during the school closure period, the evaluation team considered it useful to also assess
their level of readiness for the implementation of these initiatives during the class observations.
Likewise, in some instances, sub questions were added to the main overarching Key Evaluation
Questions in an effort to unpack the evaluation topic. The list of KEQ organized per criterion are listed
below and detailed with corresponding sub-questions, sources and indicators in Annex 2.

perception in the role and place of in-service teacher training and the consideration of their
needs?
4.3. General Approach
More broadly, this evaluation adopted:
▪ A participatory approach, ensuring wide communication and full stakeholder participation.
This involvement occurred at all stages of the evaluation and was facilitated by the local
expert’s facilitation skills and commitment to consider insider perspectives. CERD was also
given a substantive role during the whole process and at all stages.
▪ A policy-making approach, bearing in mind the consequences of future policy choices for the
systemic improvement of teacher training in Lebanon.
▪ A child-centred and rights-based approach fundamental to safeguarding and promoting the
welfare of every child. This means focusing on the role and the effects of the teacher with

focus on vulnerable students. It also means putting emphasis on the ethical framework
underpinning data collection, in line with UNICEF standards.
▪ A systematic approach targeting simple communication and clear messages in an already
complex setting.
This evaluation adopted a mixed method approach, combing qualitative and quantitative data
collection methods: quantitative information collected from secondary source such as the TMS and
available financial data for efficiency considerations, qualitative and quantitative primary data
collection.
As part of the inception report, a reconstructed ToC was produced. The team also reconstructed the
achievements of the TTCM implementation in the absence of consolidated narrative progress reports.
For the purpose of this evaluation, two complementary evaluation approaches were used: The
Beneficiary Assessment and Outcome Harvesting. These approaches helped the evaluation team find
their way within the relatively highly complex TTCM documentation, addressing the main challenges
of the evaluation and overcoming the limitations of the context (pandemic and social crises, fuel crisis,
strikes, etc.).
▪ Beneficiary Assessment: the evaluation team focused on assessing the value of TTCM
intervention as perceived by the (intended) beneficiaries, thereby aiming to give voice to their
priorities and concerns (trainers, teachers, students).
▪ Outcome Harvesting: this evaluation was initially designed to focus on the impact of the TTCM
project on teaching practices. Unfortunately, the pandemic and social crises made it
impossible to perform randomized controlled trials (RCT) based on an experimental group to
produce an estimate of the mean net impact of TTCM training on teachers or students.
Therefore, the team focused on retrospectively identifying emergent impacts25 by collecting
evidence on what has changed then, by working backwards, determining if and how an
intervention has contributed or not to these changes.
The evaluation was fully gender balanced, performed by a gender-balanced team (100% women
regarding the field data collection) and committed to the full participation of women in education
quality efforts. The desk review and data collection operations put emphasis on active implementation
of gender-responsive classroom interaction as well as on gender-equal teaching strategies.
The research was also sensitive to vulnerable populations such as refugees and pupils with special
needs. Moreover, the participatory approach and the increased stakeholder involvement helped the
evaluators engage with the participants in open and transparent discussions.
25 We provide further methodological considerations and lessons learned on impact in chapter 6.4. The study concentrated on micro and
meso impact and was not designed to provide macro-level impact information using a randomized control group.

4.4. Data collection methods
The data collected for the purpose of this evaluation combined qualitative and quantitative sampling
and analysis techniques generally used in mixed-method studies. The starting point was desk research,
including an extensive literature review and an exhaustive review of the project’s documentation and
platforms, as well as a detailed analysis of all the training modules. Primary data was collected between
September and December 2021, using a survey that targeted a population of 193 trainers concerned
by the TTCM design (with a response rate of 56.9% and a sample size of 110 respondents), as well as
in-depth interviews with fifty key participants and five focus group discussions with various
stakeholders (the detailed lists are given on the next table, cf. “Table 2: Data Collection Methods”
below). Finally, primary data was harvested through field visits and class observations conducted in
fifteen nationally representative schools, covering all regions in Lebanon (cf. the mapping of schools
and centres, in section 3.2- Geographical Scope). The main intention of the field visits was to perform
class-observation using an evaluation grid that was specifically designed to capture the impact of the
TTCM on teacher practices, while observing their interactions with the ultimate beneficiaries of the
project, i.e. the students and the learners. It is also worth noting that the field visits allowed the
evaluation team to conduct on-site unstructured or informal interviews with teachers and school
principals as well as administrative staff.
4.4.1. Secondary data
An important set of secondary data and documentation was also analysed as part of the desk review
and is listed in annex 6. The desk review also included a detailed comprehensive analysis of all training
modules, presented in annex 7.
4.4.2. Primary data
The evaluation team organized primary data collection according to the following methods:

4.4.3 Sampling strategy
Sampling was based on the lists of all trainers and trainees shared by CERD. The database was
composed of a list of seventy-six schools (spread over the eight governorates) whose teachers received
TTCM training. The sample size was set at fifteen schools with two schools specifically recommended
by CERD. Selection of the remaining thirteen schools was carried out through a non-probabilistic
sampling method known as “the quota method,” taking as primary quotas the governorate (and
districts) and the TTCM training modules attended by each school’s teachers.
The final selection of schools based on the above-mentioned quotas is summarized in Annex, as well
as sampling strategy for teachers, trainers and DEN, scattered across the Lebanese territory.
The evaluation team conducted a quantitative and qualitative analysis of existing data using a gender
lens and carefully and deliberately examined all the implications of the project in terms of gender. The
data were disaggregated by gender. The sampling methodology using the quotas method tried to
reflect the gender composition of public school teachers, by including a ratio of 80% women and 20%
men in our sample. This human rights-based and gender sensitive approach enabled gender balance
in the KII selection, as well as in focus group composition.

4.5. Data analysis and triangulation strategy
In this study the evaluators followed a mixed research methodology, in which results obtained by one
method complement those obtained by another27. This included a trainer survey using “Likert Scale”
type questions with an increasing 5-point scaling system, which allowed evaluators to measure and
quantify several situations, close-ended questions (single answer and multiple answers) and semi
open-ended questions. The data analysis was performed by using the statistical software IBM SPSS 26.
The evaluation team’s findings are supported by at least three different and independent primary data
sources, namely Key Informant Interviews, Focus Group Discussions, and a Trainers Survey. Other
sources of data were also collected from the school visits and the classroom observations.
The analysis was completed with a systematic review of the training Modules through a detailed
assessment grid that considered how they addressed the competency frameworks as well as
international teacher training standards. The team considered both ergonomics and presentation (Part
I) and content (Part II). Content analysis took into consideration the TTCM design, formulation of the
educational objectives, didactic and epistemological orientations of the TTCM, compliance with the
competency framework, adequacy with the topics addressed, relevance of the activities and their
conformity to the needs of the teachers, variety and prioritization of activities, contextualization to the
socio-professional environment of teachers, interdisciplinary, presence of activities or instructions that
lead to discussions or debates, reflective and creative scheme of the approach, assessment and self-
assessment tools and final project / performance task.
As for efficiency, “Expenditure Tracking” or “Follow the Money” was the evaluation team’s proposed
methodology tracing all expenditures associated with their outputs and estimating the likelihood that
these outputs produce intended or unintended outcomes. This approach systematically and
exhaustively scans an intervention for operational efficiency improvement by searching for cost
minimization or yield maximization potential with maximized outputs and outcomes28. Specifically, the
methodology followed here consists of measuring all the direct and indirect costs involved in the
design, development, delivery, and maintenance of the project.
This triangulation among multiple sources of information is used to support and strengthen the quality
and credibility of the evidence, including abundant desk review and international benchmarks.
The reconstruction of the ToC provides the framework for the triangulation strategy and the
triangulation exercise benefited from the complementary expertise of our multidisciplinary teams,
combining quantitative and qualitative data sources, as well as content analysis of modules.

28 The Follow the Money approach is a pragmatic yet exhaustive way of identifying efficiency improvement potential. In the Follow the Money
approach, all expenditures connected with an intervention are tracked and the resulting outputs are recorded. In a second step, these outputs
are assessed according to their magnitude and quality, as well as their likeliness for triggering intended or unintended outcomes. While
“following the money” through the system, the evaluator searches for cost minimization potential (could the same result be achieved in a
less costly way?) and for yield maximization potential (could more result be achieved based on the same costs?) BMZ WP (2003), Tools &

4.6 Limitations and mitigation measures
One of the major challenges of our research was the compounding effects of the energy crisis, the
strikes and the school closures. These uncertainties imposed a number of constraints on the data
collection for this project.
These constraints were all predicted among main risk factors during the inception phase, and
contingency plans were already foreseen by our team, in accordance with UNICEF and PITB. Hence, a
provision was made for the observation of recorded courses, and a teacher’s survey was drafted and
validated by CERD in order to be used as a substitute to actual classroom observation, which mitigated
the risk of the prolonged shutdown of public schools.
Fortunately, after the schools reopened their doors to students, our team was able to conduct the
fieldwork as initially planned. Therefore, the teachers survey was no longer needed since the school
visits included one-on-one interviews and/or informal discussions with teachers and the focus group
discussion included teachers in various settings, such as FGD with teachers and mixed GGD with
teachers and trainers. All planned school visits and classroom observations were conducted during the
short period of school opening. Interviews with teachers, principals and RCR also suffered significantly
from delays. Nevertheless, our team succeeded in reaching the target of 50 KII, and even succeeded in
performing several face-to-face and on-site data collection operations.
The evaluation team’s research is intended to cover a long period of five years (2017-2021). Some of
our targeted participants were already retired, some have shifted to other jobs and some have left the
country or were not willing to cooperate. Hence, the list of Key Informant Interviews was slightly
adjusted with the help (and in accordance with) UNICEF and PITB.
Finally, only 54% of the trainers responded to the trainer’s survey, which could generally be considered
as a satisfactory response rate. Yet, taking into account the nature of the TTCM, with its wide range of
modules and components, and considering that not all trainers were trained on all modules, the survey
couldn’t answer some important research questions, including the evaluation of some modules due to
missing data. Therefore, other sources of data were used to mitigate this lack of information, especially
the trainer FGD.
However, the main limitation was the post-COVID-19 context. School closures kept teachers away from
their classrooms for an entire school year and this exceptional circumstance undoubtedly had an
influence on the medium- and long-term impacts of the TTCM training received by teachers. The
evaluation team adjusted its investigation methods to account for this specific context, using
qualitative and wide observation methods that were confirmed whenever it was possible during
interviews with teachers.
To summarise, some of the evaluation questions could not be totally answered, and among them:
Question 2.1 relating to effectiveness: the project was not conceived as a set of costed activities. No
Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability and Learning framework and indicators were formulated from
the start, therefore effectiveness considerations are rather based on achievements than on expected
results.
Question 2.3 relating to the effectiveness of the TMS: The TMS ceased to function shortly after its
creation because of the fuel crisis, making it impossible for the evaluation team to gather data and

32
learning and practice in public schools
evidence. Almost all stakeholders agreed on its importance but could obviously not report on its use.
Results were collected from stakeholders who had the opportunity to use it before it was stopped.
Question 3.1 relating to the efficiency: for the same reason as 2.1 above, the efficiency evaluation of
the TTCM was complex in the absence of planned output variables. The team could only rely here on
the number of staff actually trained (this number was organically increasing despite the challenges
from strikes, economic crisis, electricity and internet shortage, Covid 19, etc. ; and in 2021 CERD added
additional trainings (such as Classera, back-to-school, etc.). In response to this challenge, the
evaluation team chose to link expenses to the outputs (the number of beneficiaries specifically the
number of teachers and trainers trained). Thanks to this approach, the efficiency evaluation is not
mainly focusing on the unit costs. It is oriented toward distinguishing between capital investment and
administrative expenditures. Since all expenditures are tracked, expenditures that cannot be
connected to any activity or output automatically surface. The “unit cost” approach was used to
compare online training and face-to-face trainings (as requested in the TOR), since this distinction also
refers to two different phases (pre- and post- 2019 financial collapse).

Question 5.1 related to the potential for the project to be scaled up without new donor funding was
not addressed either. Within the deep crisis context going on in Lebanon, Donors are still highly
mobilized to provide CERD with financial support, and long-term vision about Lebanese public finances
was not available.

5. FINDINGS AND PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS
5.1. Relevance
This first section analyses the relevance of the TTCM project including global TTCM design, training
process and modules delivered. It considers the adequacy of TTCM in meeting the needs of the target
audience (mainly teachers and trainers, but also indirectly students) and to the Lebanese context and
education system, including the 2017 teacher competency framework.
5.1.1. Relevance of TTCM framework and modules to the needs
The relevance of TTCM framework and modules to the needs responds to the following question: How
is the TTCM framework and the designed modules relevant to the needs of the teachers / children/
trainers in the Lebanese public schools taking into consideration gender, inclusion, diversity and
children’s rights?
Response to teacher’s needs
1. The TTCM project was based on pre-identified needs collected from various national and
international sources, including the TALIS report. Several stakeholder consultations were
carried out. CERD regularly collects reports from school principals on their needs. The Faculty
of Education at Lebanese University was consulted formally to co-define the major needs. (cf.
KII and desk review). Student needs were also taken into account and the benefits of
competency-based approach and inclusive education were considered.
2. Nevertheless, no formal teacher and trainer Needs Assessment (NA) was conducted in a
systematic manner for the selection of the module topics (KII, desk review). Some of them
(gender, child protection) were proposed by UNICEF based on their international expertise.
However, as teachers were kept away from methodological design of the TTCM, they were not
fully considered as reflexive practitioners.
3. Both trainers and school principals felt they were well placed (and entitled) to help identify
and prioritize teacher needs but indicated that they did not feel involved in the needs
assessment (cf. KII, FGD, school visits and excerpts below). The directors were unanimous in
their lack of awareness of the TTCM project. Some principals mentioned regular contact with
the CERD to report on the training needs of their teachers; however, for the TTCM project or
design, they were not interviewed and had little or no role. They felt unable to genuinely
respond to the adequacy of the modules related to the needs of teachers, even if they believed
any training was useful. Some others noted the weakness of the practical side of the training
compared to that of the theory. (KII, schools’ visits).
4. The topics, the content and the suggested activities of the modules are considered to be
completely relevant by most teachers and trainers and are in line with the pedagogical
approach adopted for the TTCM project, but with notable differences from one module
training to another (CF. Analysis of Modules in annex 7). The DIFA module was particularly
relevant within the context of the 2018 inclusive school program piloted by MEHE in thirty
schools (cf. KII, FGD, school visits and excerpts below). As confirmed by the trainer survey,
75.9% of the respondents considered that the TTCM had filled a need in the trainers’ practices
and more specifically that the TwT and MS Team modules helped tackle the forced shift to
18/03/2022 –Evaluation of the TTCM project (2017-2021) and its impact on the quality of teacher
34
learning and practice in public schools
online teaching as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, while DIFA and CP helped tackle
important issues, particularly in the context of Syrian refugee crisis. (cf. KII, FGD, Survey).
''The “needs data” comes from the schools’ directories whether primary, secondary, coaching and career guidance
centres, they send the data to CERD [...] I don’t interfere in the data collection process; we received a report
containing: coaching and career guidance visits to schools and teachers for example and they noticed the following
needs (…) plus at CERD we receive teachers’ needs from the academic sections, we receive feedback from our
trainers at RCR '' KI, PITB
''The needs were looked at from two different aspects: there is on a yearly basis a collection of needs that was
happening outside this project anyhow between CERD and the ministry at regional level so they have these
committees at the region level that would include the coaches from DOPS, the directors of école normale, so
directors of the training centres [...] We conducted a needs assessment and the theoretical assessment based on
the data that is out there, we didn't go out there and collect additional data […]''Content for training was
responding to an imminent need! that's why we selected, for example differentiated instruction as one of our “core
modules”. they are actually the “pilot modules”. […] they were responding to a need because there was the
inclusive schools pilot project.'' KI, External consultant
''Of course, it wasn’t the only project CERD was working on, there were USAID and QITABI but they were smaller
projects such as Arabic language training or Active board training. TTCM project was more global aiming at
enhancing the trainings quality of Lebanese teacher in the public sector. [...] we looked in different areas, asking
ourselves what are the other projects of the Ministry of Education, what are MEHE’s needs, what MEHE is asking
us to train. Then we looked at the global orientations for education and we also looked at the faculty of pedagogy
until we had a clear idea of the topics.'' KI, PITB
Response to trainers’ needs
5. 75.9% of the trainers considered that the training filled a need in the trainers’ practices while
19.3% did not (cf. KII, FGD, Survey). PITB confirmed that the project increased internal capacity
to adapt and fully own training contents prepared by external experts (KII).
Adequacy of the conceptual and theoretical framework
6. The desk review confirmed that TTCM conceptual framework was supported with an abundant
theoretical literature review mixing various internationally recognized approaches concerning
school-based teacher practice, adult learning strategies, competency-based teaching and
learning and teacher professional development. Above all, these approaches and topics
reflected the capacities and the experiences of the group of experts and CERD staff who
developed them. (cf. KII, FGD, literature and documentation review). However, the very widely
documented theoretical baseline also brought complexity and to some extent, confusion (KII,
desk review, trainers’ survey). It is built on the assumption that the socio-constructivist
paradigm is “the best way” or “the only way”, which is not backed by research evidence.
7. Based on classroom observations and analysis of training modules, the needs of learners
particularly the most vulnerable, were taken into account indirectly through the themes
adopted (DIFA, TWT, CP…), and correspond to internationally recognized standards to address
inclusive education issues. The whole project was highly gender responsive and gender wise,
considering the needs and circumstances of people of all genders.

35
learning and practice in public schools
Adequacy of the modules to quality standards for training design and development
8. The TTCM modules have been designed and improved based on the comments received by
the RCR; the excessive reliance on the RCR, especially for reviewing the content and the design
of the modules, is considered challenging to the quality control process in the context of their
busy agenda. (cf. Study of Modules, KII). Stakeholders confirm that there is still room to
improve the TTCM design with the TMS workflow, the adaptation of modules to online training
and the use of the TMS for teacher training tracking purposes were identified as the most
important components that require improvement (cf. Trainers’ Survey).
9. Despite this control, the evaluation team identified several areas for improvement in the
modules and a lack of proper citation of sources, in particular regarding illustrations, eager to
raise intellectual property issues. Areas for improvement were also identified to ensure
internal consistency of the modules with the TTCM design framework and recommendations.
Important differences in the internal organization of the modules were also noted, as well as
several cases of confused terminology for which specific recommendations are formulated in
this report. The evaluation team noted that some references are not backed up with solid
evidence, for example the “multiple intelligences” theory29, and should therefore be presented
with more precaution. A more unified table of contents is also missing as well as global
presentation standards for training modules. Other areas for improvement include,
assessment of the types of exercises, summary points to anchor the concepts, functional /
heuristic diagrams and mind maps, table of contents, self-assessment tools, and a multilingual
glossary, in particular. Adequacy of several skills / objectives and criteria of the competency
framework and the theoretical framework of the TTCM with the training modules was also
identified as challenging and more detail is provided in Annex 7. Above all, terminology and
theoretical concepts are still significant and should be more balanced with practical
methodological and didactic approaches and concepts (cf. Study of Modules, KII). This finding
is also supported by the trainer survey. Indeed, despite the generally positive perceptions of
the UbD framework as an interesting innovation, the trainers considered that they are the
most challenging components when delivering the training.
''The modules depended on those who made them, and each trainer had them as he could according to his abilities
and experiences.». Trainer
Relevance of the selected topics for the modules
10. The topics covered by the core modules (especially differentiated instruction, inclusion,
literacy, gender, child protection) were relevant to tackle COVID-19 constraints and especially
when dealing with the challenges of the inclusive education program and the Syrian crisis
context. The TTCM ensured compliance of methodological guidelines and content regarding
29 This theory developed by Gardner (1983) resonates for teachers, but the scientific community is far from unanimous considering that this
theory mixes talents, personality traits and abilities. In 2016, Gardner himself recognized that this theory did not rely on scientific
substantiation.
18/03/2022 –Evaluation of the TTCM project (2017-2021) and its impact on the quality of teacher
36
learning and practice in public schools
all aspects of child rights with an emphasis on the right to education. Although not directly
linked to a need expressed by teachers, the child protection module brought additional tools
and efficiently supported the upsurge of more inclusive practices in several cases, especially
when faced with the evolving requirements of children with special needs. Teachers who
followed these modules stated unanimously that they were better equipped to identify and to
bring basic supports to children in psychological distress (cf. FGD, KII). The trainers (some of
them are also DOPS) adapted their content to other needs of their audience (especially for
psycho-social support and awareness). The gender mainstreaming module raised strong
awareness among male trainers more than female, with 100% of male respondents
considering that the GM module raised strong awareness among teachers .
“Because in the public sector we do not have technology infrastructure, so there was a need to introduce
teachers to the programs especially Microsoft Teams. It is very good but teachers cannot use it suddenly
without any training”' Trainer
Relevance of the modules to TTCM design
11. Most objectives of the training modules appreciated at varying degrees the pedagogical,
didactic and epistemological orientations prescribed by the Teacher Training Curriculum
Model (TTCM design). They generally follow the principles of the TTCM design in the majority
of its planned dimensions, as well as the teacher training policies in the Lebanese education
system. (see Analysis of the modules in appendices). Moreover, according to the trainer
survey, 86.7% of the respondents considered that the TTCM design allowed them to better
target the newly adopted competency frameworks that supported the quality of teaching in
Lebanon (cf. Literature and documentation review, Analysis of the modules, international
benchmarks, Survey).
12. Nevertheless, the trainers that were interviewed unanimously agreed that this new TTCM
approach was difficult, complex and time consuming, and this was confirmed further in the
survey and FGD. For many of them it was a rather theoretical approach and the architecture
was difficult to adapt and apply. In the trainer survey, around 25% of the respondents
considered the time allocated for the training was insufficient and 1 out of 5 trainers
considered that the training did not fill a need in their daily practice, with women being slightly
more unsatisfied than male trainers. One can therefore conclude that although relevant, the
approach was not fully effective due to this complexity (cf. FGD, KII, Survey).
13. As stated in the Handbook, the change in teachers’ practices according to UbD principles was
an important expectation of the TTCM and a very welcomed objective according to most
trainers. Yet there was no evidence to support that this target was achieved, since it was
impossible to identify traces of the “backward design” in the teachers’ practices. Even though
the external consultants assumed that the way training modules are designed should influence
the way teachers design their own lesson plans, there was no supporting evidence found
during our research (cf. KII, FGD, Classroom observations, excerpts below). Several
stakeholders even assumed that the way the modules were designed was not to be shared
with teachers (see finding 15).

''So, in order to improve the work of all trainers, we found that the TTCM was the answer for this need. [...]
Teachers prepare a primitive planning; they prepare a unit or a lesson, when to cover an activity, in this unit,
on this page. Instead of having a holistic planning aiming to cover short-term and long-term learning outcomes.
This cannot be achieved without understanding this new architecture. This is our aim in the trainings to change
the strategies and ways of thinking '' RCR''
“It was a turning point at the time that was much needed, because we had to come up with a designing
approach that unified everyone's way of preparing training modules, because every centre was working
separately, for designing their own training modules (…)we're making sure that these modules are of course
up to the standards, but we did not have a common way to design them. [...] Yes. So basically, the way we
design our training modules should influence the way teachers design their lesson plans. And this helps them
achieve their curricular aims because if you start looking at the final goal, and then planning backwards to
achieve it with your students, then you would be able to achieve it.'' RCR
5.1.2. Relevance of TTCM design to Lebanese context and standards
The relevance of TTCM design to Lebanese context and standards responds to the following question:
To what extent is the TTCM design relevant to the Lebanese institutional and policy context regarding
teacher training and teaching standards as well as priorities set by CRDP and MEHE?
The adequacy to the Lebanese context was assessed mainly within the adoption of a competency
framework for teachers and trainers in 2017, as well as the regulatory framework and professional
culture of these actors. Adaptability to the specific national crisis context was also analysed. The
research instruments used in this evaluation aimed to validate the consistency of the TTCM with the
content and approach of initial teacher education. This relevance analysis adopted a comparative
approach (Mawrid-e, initial training programs, qitabi, former in-service trainings not aligned to TTCM).
Consistency of the TTCM design with the contents and approach to pre-service teacher training
14. As stated under finding 21, the TTCM is consistent with the competency-based approach in
Lebanon; however, this approach is not yet adopted in initial teacher training. A study was
carried out to analyse existing references to competencies in initial teacher training programs
in Lebanese universities, but this study was not used for further coherence-building strategies.
Coherence of UbD instructional design used for the TTCM with initial training programs could
not be assessed as part of this evaluation.
15. As confirmed by key TTCM decision makers30, the teachers are not aware of the TTCM design
and the innovations it supports (competency framework and UbD). Therefore, the TTCM
principles and “backward design” methodology do not fully reach teachers or initial teacher
trainers, which creates a discrepancy in training approach.
''The teachers are not aware of the TTCM design, and do not know we have changed our architecture.
When a teacher is teaching their students, he does not inform them about the strategy adopted in his
teaching (backward design, competency-based, etc.), he just explains the lesson. Same case for the
training.'' KII with members of the technical committee

Adaptability of the TTCM with Lebanese context and recent external constraints (COVID, security
problems, logistical and infrastructure problems...)
16. Online training and self-paced Microsoft Teams modules helped the teachers in the context of
the COVID-19 pandemic (cf. KII, Classroom observations, FGD). In the trainer survey, only 30%
of respondents stated that they followed training sessions in TwT. Among the group of
respondents who attended the TwT training, 80% considered that it was clear and useful, and
almost the same proportion considered that it was helpful to tackle the forced shift to online
teaching and training. Moreover, only twenty-three respondents stated that they followed
training sessions in LAC. Among the group of respondents who attended the LAC training, 60%
considered that it was clear and useful, and almost the same proportion estimated that it was
helpful to tackle the challenge of the forced shift to online teaching and training. The Gender
mainstreaming module was considered as tackling a key challenge in Lebanon. Female trainers
are more likely to strongly agree than men regarding the importance of this module to tackle
key issues in Lebanon, and to the level of awareness that it helped raising
17. Nevertheless, when delivering online training, some trainers stated that they were not always
able to apply the TTCM design as planned. For them, face-to-face training is more effective
since the TTCM design requires infrastructure and equipment that are normally lacking in
public schools in Lebanon, especially in the current socio-economic crisis context. This issue
raises questions regarding the effectiveness of these modules, since most trainers stated that
they faced difficulties to adapt for online training (cf. KII, FGD, also see our effectiveness
analysis).
''With the pandemic and the deteriorating situation and in Lebanon, the needs and challenges have multiplied
and the TTCM must take them into account and adapt. [...] Continue the TTCM project and re-evaluate this
project to revise, further simplify and improve it.'' Trainer
Overall consistency of the TTCM design with the various training offers in progress and carried out
in the last three years
18. Compared with other ongoing training projects and programs, the TTCM design approach with
its three stages (desired results=>evidence and proofs=>training / learning plan), was
considered to be more complex (great number of competencies and indicators are targeted,
many steps were involved in the design such as performance tasks, rubrics, etc. and a
complicated (and sometime unnecessary) theoretical apparatus was needed (facets of
understanding, GRAPS, Where and Why, Hook and Hold, Equip, Rethink, Reflect and Revise,
Evaluate, Tailor, Organize (WHERETO) for example). Yet, the TTCM represented itself as a
global project based on a whole new approach and was a pioneer in systematizing references
to the competency framework.
19. This transition to the TTCM was reported as more difficult than traditional approaches
adopted. For many trainers the theoretical base was too complex and the architecture was
considered difficult to adapt and apply (KII, FGD, international benchmark).

Enthusiasm and motivation
20. The respondents all showed enthusiasm and motivation for this project and its new approach.
Despite some coordination issues between the Ministry (DOPS) and the CERD (PITB), the
current momentum seems to be relevant and appropriate to ensure better coordination and
better institutional ownerships within MEHE. (KII, literature and documentation review)
“We usually send CERD on an annual basis our recommendations concerning the needs that must be
tackled. We noticed that CERD have started taking our recommendations into consideration. […] we are
ready to collaborate" MEHE

5.1.3. Relevance of TTCM framework and modules with national competency
framework
The relevance of TTCM framework and modules with national competency framework responds to the
following question: To what extent is the TTCM framework and the designed modules successfully
targeting the national teachers” competency framework?
Correspondence and Complementarity of Documents: TTCM Framework, the designed modules and
the national teachers’ competency framework
21. The TTCM design introduced the UbD approach, in addition to the newly adopted competency-
based approach, which meant that trainers and teachers were required to adapt to both
concomitant innovations. Once this adaptation was successful, additional complexity arose for
teachers accustomed to teaching by objectives according to the current Lebanese curricula (cf.
KII & excerpts below, FGD, Survey). The trainers consider that the most important hallmarks
of the TTCM design are the performance tasks (17.8%), the rubrics (12.9%), the understanding
by design and the backward design (10.8%), which tend to prove that UbD concepts were more
valued than technical references to the competency framework (12.2%). This result is also
consistent with the question regarding the most used components in the training
development, when the competency-based approach (14.7%) ranked behind the use of
performance tasks (30.5%) and rubrics (17.9%), these two components of the Ubd ranking first
and second respectively.
''For me the TTCM program is like a road map for my training course. It is very well organized. It has a logical
order from the beginning till the end. Its stages are clear. [...] The planning in the TTCM design requires a lot
of time. [...] The whole process is still not steady. [...] Unfortunately, the books we use in the public sector do
not cover the needs of the learners nor the needs of the teachers to implement the TTCM. Individual
implementation of the TTCM will create a mess because it will not be systemized. The CERD is working on an
advanced level, and they prepared the guidelines for competencies for teachers, trainers, coordinators and
others. [...] But again, as long as the program is simplified it can reach all the trainers and teachers and lastly
the students '' Trainer
22. Based on the analysis of the modules, the evaluation team noted several issues of internal
inconsistency between the objectives of the training modules and the different activities

40
learning and practice in public schools
designed. The adequacy between TTCM design, the Competency Framework and the
objectives of the Training Modules were in some cases only declarative, which meant several
skills / objectives / competencies announced at the start of the modules were not broken down
into activities and/or performance tasks. The analysis also identified several cases of
methodological dysfunction and misalignments. Some content seemed to be designed for
children rather than for teacher trainees. For example, the evaluation team expected the IMPI
module to provide teachers with authentic and real-life based case studies based on
professional teaching situation (images and videos of inclusive schools or methods or strategies
of classroom management that include children with special needs. Particular: dysphasia,
dyslexia, learning disorder / difficulty, attention disorder, behavioural disorders). Instead, some
of the examples proposed seemed unadaptable to adult learning standards and rather
referred to their pupils’ real-life situations. As an example, (IMPI, p.59-30), Document 2
addresses trainers’ recommendation to name the vegetables with a green colour from the list
presented above. There are undoubtedly much more age-appropriate resources that could be
used and exploited to meet the needs and expectations of teachers.
Preliminary conclusions regarding Relevance
REL 1: The TTCM project successfully responded to major needs of Lebanese education stakeholders. Although
the needs assessment was not formalized, the TTCM project was based on pre-identified needs by various
sources such as a wide range of stakeholders and education sector decision makers and ongoing projects.
Trainers, School Principal, DOPS, teachers etc. did not feel systematically involved in the needs analysis but
were convinced that the proposed topics were relevant. More specifically, the TTCM has filled a need in
teacher and trainer practices and helped them tackle the forced shift to online teaching during the COVID-19
pandemic, while addressing important issues, particularly the Syrian refugee crisis.
REL 2: The TTCM met the trainers’ need to create a common training design and strategy as well as a
standardized model that could be adapted and adjusted to various topics and audiences. Therefore, the TTCM
increased trainer ownership of modules prepared with international experts. The whole design is globally
consistent and most modules respect the TTCM framework. Most trainers showed motivation and
enthusiasm. Internal consistency of the modules could be improved with no unified table of contents as well
REL 3: The TTCM design duly responded to the teacher’s competency framework and the ongoing shift of
Lebanese education towards competency-based teaching and learning. This finding was fully relevant for
trainers. However, the relevance of the TTCM for other actors, in particular teachers, is challenged by existing
inconsistencies within the Lebanese education system (curricula by objectives, initial training only partially

41
learning and practice in public schools
competency-based and not designed backward, competency-based assessment framework for pupils still
causing difficulties).
REL 4: The TTCM design process succeeded in mobilizing a wide range of lessons learned from research in
regard to adult learning and teacher professional development.
REL 5: The TTCM project introduced two concomitant innovations: competency-based training and backward
design following the UbD model. Great acceptance was noticed of the UbD principles; however, the project
did not equally shed light on competency-based training and learning. Further improvement is required to
make sure competency-based teaching and learning is fully adopted and understood by all education
stakeholders as a pre-condition for next curriculum reform.
Rel 6: The change in teacher practices according to UbD was not supported by any evidence, since it was
impossible to identify traces of the “backward design” during classroom observations.
5.2. Effectiveness
The objective of this section is to highlight the extent to which the TTCM objectives were achieved, or
are expected to be achieved, in terms of enhanced trainers’ competencies, adequacy of assessment
framework and tools to assess the level of competency building and attitude change of teachers, and
effectiveness of the TMS in monitoring the quality of teacher training
The TTCM offered a wide range of training, Training of trainers and coaching. The beneficiaries of
training and coaching activities are: public-school teachers, CERD trainers, as well as CERD technical

23. A feeling of general satisfaction clearly emerges in the interviews from many different
stakeholders. Teachers are satisfied with the training received and are more motivated
(mentioned in FGD) and by headteachers during school visits, brought up in four interviews
(DEN, RCR, trainer and KII). In the DIFA teachers’ feedback report, more than 80% of teachers
agreed on the trainer’s competencies and mastery of the training subject as well as the trainer
responsiveness to teacher needs. The trainers find the new training more consistent ad
effective to target the competency framework, with no significant gender difference:
Trainers considered that the TTCM allowed them to
better target the newly adopted competency
framework.
Trainers considered that the training has filled a
need in the trainers’ practices
Trainers considered that they can better adjust
their trainings to the competencies that are most
needed by the teachers
0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%100%
24. However, some trainers indicate that the planning (the three stages) can be time consuming
or too theoretical and should be simplified. Among the group of respondents who attended
the CP training, 73% of the valid answers estimated that it was helpful to tackle the challenge
of the Syrian refugee crisis. Among the group of respondents who attended the IEM training
and the GM training, the percentage of valid answers that estimated they were helpful to
tackle the challenge of the Syrian refugee crisis was 50% and 60% respectively (cf. KII &
excerpts below, FGD, Survey).
“The child protection training was very beneficial, and the trainer was excellent […] There must be more
motivation within the trainings, this depends on the trainers’ teaching style. Most of them are theoretical and
do not tackle the practical part.” FGD – teacher
"Trainers and trainees liked the work, and the activities were interactive. They sensed the difference between
this training and the previous traditional ones. So of course, it is better to continue the TTCM trainings." DEN
“In 2018 and 2019, immediately before COVID. We received a lot of positive feedback from teachers, they were
able to notice the difference in the way we designed our training, and they were able to see that this helps
them achieve their goals better if they follow the same way though we did not train them on TTCM, it was
implicit within the training" RCR
“The first time I worked using the TTCM, I set two competencies and I was very excited to do the work, but
when I reached the third stage it was very annoying especially that it is also linked with the assessment. Then
I set only one competency to be able to minimize this challenge. Because if you do any activity that it is not
linked to your outcomes, you are required to go back and add or edit your activity. This is a bit frustrating for
me. This is what I have also heard from my colleagues, they have the same opinion […] But again, as long as
the program is simplified it can reach all the trainers and teachers and lastly the students. Later on, we can
add more details, but first we need to simplify it”. Trainer

5.2.2. Adequacy of assessment framework and tools in assessing the level of
competency building and attitude change of teachers
The adequacy of assessment framework and tools in assessing the level of competency building and
attitude change of teachers responds to the following question: How adequate are the TTCM
assessment framework and tools in assessing the level of competency building and attitude change of
teachers per training module, online and face to face?
With the backward design approach
adopted by the TTCM, assessment tools
are designed early in the training process,
and are meant to focus on transfer into
classroom practices. They rely mostly on
“authentic performance tasks” and based
of “Rubrics” with theoretical background
explained in a 24-pages framework
document. According to the TTCM, the
effectiveness of the competency building
process for teachers is to be considered by
trainers during the whole training process.
process thanks to the design of
performance tasks and other assessment
tools (quiz, observations, other activities).
Consistency of the Framework and assessment tools face-to-face with the competency framework
and the TTCM
25. Consistency between the newly adopted competency framework and the TTCM approach was
fully noticeable when reviewing the modules and corresponding assessment tools
(performance tasks), despite some incoherence between training objectives and targeted
competencies. The modules and their corresponding assessment strategies are gender-
responsive and child sensitive, as requested by TTCM. The complexity of the teacher
competency framework (high number of competencies and components, confusing coding
system) constituted one of the major constraints for the trainers, who were faced with an
overwhelming number of competencies to be assessed in their training design (cf. KII, FGD,
Survey, Module analysis). The evaluation team also noted some misalignments affecting the
effectiveness of performance tasks like for example the description of possible performance
tasks in the handbook (p. 71) with unexpected products for adults (painting, sculpture, collage,
poetry reading, song…). The same misalignment can be found in the assessment framework,
where the online references suggested for rubric formulation target teacher-made rubrics to
assess their students’ project, and therefore cannot concretely inspire trainers creating rubrics
to assess a teacher’s project. for children. However, globally, the design process and proposed
assessment strategies early in the training design process effectively address expected teacher
competencies building process during the training.

44
learning and practice in public schools
“There is a close relationship between the competency framework, the training modules and the
targeted skills but the networking between the objectives and the skills of the modules TTCM with the
competency framework is a very complex task. It will have to be simplified further to be more effective
by being satisfied with the concepts with the highest priority as he found it very difficult as it requires
a lot of effort from the trainers. Focus group – Trainer
26. In its “basic” design i.e., in a face-to-face training setting, the framework and assessment tools
allow:
- The constant adaptability of training and connection to teachers through a pre-training
assessment (see KII and desk review),
- Good evaluation of the effectiveness of the training provided through the performance
tasks and other assessment tools according to KII and FGD. However, teachers were
evaluated based on the performance tasks, without knowing that their activities could be
“graded” by some trainers. As stated in one mixed focus group, trainers and trainees did
not have the same representation of the performance tasks. For the former they are part
of the assessment process while for the latter it is only used as a demo (see trainers’ KII
and FGD). This discrepancy is also confirmed in various KII, when one consultant stated
that the performance tasks are instrumental to grade the trainees, while another CERD-
PITB staff considered that they are only used as part of a formative assessment and they
are not used as part of a grading process. Nevertheless, none of the teachers were aware
that the performance tasks were effectively used for assessing the training, and they
thought they were only used to illustrate a potential assessment for future training. This
discrepancy was probably due to the absence of a proper training on the assessment of
the performance tasks during the first four years, since this training only took place in 2021
(cf. the 2021 Budget).
27. However, some remaining challenges were raised:
- The assessment framework and tools are considered as complex, time consuming and not
always practical (KII).
- The assessment framework focuses only on project-based learning and assessment, with
the wide use of “rubrics”, and is not adapted to other pedagogical strategies, for example
transmissive pedagogies
- Five trainers considered that the assessment tools can be improved. Indeed, training on
the assessment tools was already planned and conducted by CERD during 2021 in order to
fill-in this gap.
- Finally, since this responsibility belongs to the guidance office from the Ministry of
Education (coaches), the impossibility to carry out follow-ups in class is seen as a shortfall
by both trainers and trainees. (cf. KII, FGD, see verbatim below). Indeed, according to
TTCM conceptual documents, performance tasks require participants to apply their
knowledge in authentic situation which means that ideally, they should be assessed in
class.

45
learning and practice in public schools
"I believe that the performance task is a good measurement tool to see if the trainees acquired the knowledge,
skills and competencies as this was the main concern: how to apply and use those competencies." DOPS
"Other than the performance test, there are other evidence that trainers need to collect during the training. It
resembles formative assessment that we use with our students the same idea, these quizzes asking questions,
doing some kind of group work activities, mentoring, observing and so on. These help trainers make sure that
everything is acquired before reaching the performance task. So by the end of the training the performance
task becomes a complete work and also trainees present their work and they get feedback from trainers, and
they have the chance to improve their work. " RCR
"What I like about the TTCM is the performance task. It synthesizes everything that was covered during the
training course. It can also be used by the trainees as a self-assessment to check their acquisition of what was
covered during the training." Trainer
"Very few teachers did the performance tasks. This is because most of our work is ready. It is good and not
good at the same time. Sometimes it limited the scope of our work unlike previous trainings, the scope was not
that well defined. We used to give the training based on the needs and not based on what (competencies) must
be covered […] In certain stages, before reaching the performance task, we felt that there were some
repetitions or in other places there were a lot of details as information or activities that could have been
skipped. For instance, we have 5 hours’ trainings. Instead of doing 3 or 4 activities in which teachers need to
reach a synthesis or create a product. During the child protection training, every 10 or 15 mins you need to
start a new activity in order to cover everything you have in the training. This is to make sure that when you
reach the performance task everything was covered, and all the competencies were covered” Trainer
Consistency of the Framework and assessment tools online with the competency framework and the
TTCM
28. Overall, teachers and trainers considered that face-to-face training was more effective than
online training. Being short in duration (2 hours), online training did not allow the TTCM
methodology to be fully applied and did not encourage the use of assessment tools such as
performance tasks. In addition, the evaluators noted the difficulties of several teachers to
access the internet, electricity or computers in a context of deteriorated school infrastructure
(some teachers follow the training from their phone). Moreover, 20% of the trainers
considered that the TTCM face-to-face training had improved the teachers learning, and 18%
of the trainers considered that the TTCM online training had improved the teachers learning.
(cf. FGD, KII & excerpts below)
“We cannot reduce this gap unless we go back to the face-to-face trainings. I cannot do a performance task
for 2 hours in an online training session. It cannot be guided or evaluated or use the rubrics. We do not have
enough time to do all of this. Besides we face internet issues that waste some of the time allocated for the
session (using the links, not being able to join the sessions…). “ RCR
Online training does not make it possible to pass all the objectives of the TTCM training, especially since most
teachers work on their smartphones and not on their computers. Even the assessment is “fuzzy” and cannot
be done well. Trainer

“The workshops were only two hours long and to be honest we were using more like the traditional
methodology, setting a plan for the workshops from the first activity till the last one. We did not include a
performance task because the time was limited. My last activity was always Q&A” Trainer
5.2.3. Effectiveness of the TMS in monitoring the quality of teacher training
The effectiveness of the TMS in monitoring the quality of teacher training responds to the following
question: To what extent does the Training management system (TMS) including data collection, data
building, the training actually delivered, implementation of TTCM and tracking effectively monitor the
quality of the teacher training.
29. The data collection confirmed 2 major findings reflected in the survey as follows:
74%of the respondents Around 69% of the respondents
considered that the TMS is estimated that the TMS is
crucial to ensure full compliance paramount to support PITB in
of the modules with the tracking competency-building
competency-based approach for teachers
“Our main problem was, when we started using the TTCM project, the petrol and diesel problems began, so
the TMS is down. Unfortunately, this is the situation, and we cannot ask teachers to enter the TMS for training
and the software is shut down because of power cut.” KI – PITB
“I got trained on the TMS but we did not use it yet. It is not working yet. We were not able to implement
everything in the TTCM because the TMS platform is still not working.” DEN
“We have tested TMS, but today we are waiting because we have electricity issues, and the server is down. We
are facing many problems. But we have tested TMS software, and we have tried to build a new module as a
training module, that was tested approximately by 2,000 teachers. Of course, like any other software we have
some bug” KI – ICT consultant
30. The designed (but poorly used) TMS purposefully mixed a twofold objective: an automation of
the module design process for trainers; and the creation of e-portfolios for trainees. In many
countries, e-portfolios are considered to be a powerful tool to monitor and follow-up on
teacher professionalization from a lifelong learning perspective. Trainers also had the
opportunity to plan training content according to the portfolio of each teacher. The TMS could
provide an opportunity for both the MEHE and the CERD to plan large-scale training courses
by identifying the common gaps to different teacher profiles. However, all these expected
results still require concrete experimentation. As the CERD TMS is still down due to electricity
shortages, the evaluation team did not have the opportunity to compare the CERD TMS with
the DOPS management system and ensure they are fully complementarity.
18/03/2022 –Evaluation of the TTCM project (2017-2021) and its impact on the quality of teacher
47
learning and practice in public schools
31. TMS users reported areas for improvement and required targeted training. For example, one
trainer stated that the TMS automated some processes, but kept the same number of
procedures and signatures needed for each phase, thus introducing more complexity for the
validation process. However, it was impossible for the evaluation team to draw a conclusive
image of the TMS.
“Yes of course, if we go back to the TTCM, what I know that every trainer must prepare a module. To prepare
a module and to propose it, he or she must follow a procedure. And TMS has automated the steps to facilitate
the creation of a new module and the official approval of this module. So, I can say here that TMS must
facilitate this process.” KI – ICT consultant
“the TMS has created the workflow, now the difference is that everything is documented it was there also
before having this newer. So this is where the TMS has added value, huge added value with respect to access
and readability of that data, again and the invitation for in depth analysis of this data.” KI – TTCM expert
"It is very good but teachers cannot use it suddenly without any training.” Trainer “As a platform, it is very
beneficial: firstly, it introduced the teacher to the competencies, the majors of the curriculum, this is what we
call the backward design. We set up the curriculum based on the competencies, so this platform is very useful
because it exposed all the details related to competencies, to skills, to capacities and so on.” DOPS
Preliminary conclusions on Effectiveness
EFFEC 1 – Objective of Enhanced trainers’ competencies: Overall satisfaction with enhanced trainer
competencies. Most stakeholders are satisfied, whether it is the target audience (teachers and headteachers
are satisfied with the training received) or supervisors such as DEN or RCR with the training of trainers.
EFFEC2 – Adequacy of the assessment framework and tools in assessing the level of competency building
and attitude change of teachers: Most of the stakeholders believe that the TTCM respects the newly adopted
competency framework. Although, the process is reported as time-consuming in both the planning / creation
of activities and teacher evaluation for trainers. The possibility to carry out a follow-up in the classes following
the training sessions appears to be a deficit in the process of the TTCM evaluation process.
EFFEC 3 – Effectiveness of the TMS in monitoring the quality of teacher training: Taking into account that
the TMS is down, the TMS appears to be a purposeful and modern tool for monitoring teachers’ professional
development from a lifelong learning perspective, it provides the trainer with a holistic view about the
attendees and their profile, the prerequisites to attend the training, the content material, etc. and creation of
training modules / sessions.
TMS has automated the steps to facilitate the creation of a new module and the official acceptance of this
module. However, it could also benefit other stakeholders, such as DOPS or even teachers. The actors indicate
that the platform could be simplified both in terms of IT skills and the time it consumes. It should be noted
that due to the current situation, the TMS does not work and that these remarks come from the first tests
carried out on the software. Contingency plans should be carried-out to mitigate such predictable challenges,
especially those linked to the deteriorating infrastructure
In conclusion, the TTCM project expected five results (see below):
- R1 Improve the quality of the training design to target the competency framework for teachers and
transfer to classroom practices, to respond to the specific needs of teachers and address attitude
towards cross-cutting themes in education: The proposed modules successfully addressed the national
18/03/2022 –Evaluation of the TTCM project (2017-2021) and its impact on the quality of teacher
48
learning and practice in public schools
competency frameworks adopted in 2017. However, such an approach is not yet adopted in initial
teacher training and was not considered as essential by most trainers.
Coherence of UbD instructional design used for the TTCM with initial training programs could not be
assessed as part of this evaluation. The TTCM proposed a twofold approach, which addressed these two
objectives, but in the end, it tended to focus more on content rather than teaching methods.
- R2 Improve the capacity of the PITB to track and disseminate attainment of competency building per
teacher and attitude change towards cross cutting educational themes: The project has created the
TMS tool for monitoring teacher training, but it was not fully operational over the period.
Also, teachers’ attitude change is noted, but causality not necessarily proven (trainers do not have access
to the classroom and cannot provide follow-up).
- R3 Improve the quality of teacher training to address the specific needs of new teachers in the public
school system: The teacher training induction curriculum exits, but was not tested.
- R4 Improve the competencies of trainers: satisfaction from all stakeholders, including trainers and
teachers, teachers seem satisfied with the training received and more motivated.
- R5 Improve the quality of training within the training centres: Taking into account the enhancement of
the trainers' skills and the overall satisfaction of the stakeholders, the quality of training within the
training centres has improved but left aside the modernization of the training process and involvement
of school directors.
5.3. Efficiency
The purpose of this section is to highlight results and to efficiency within a given budget showing how
they enhance the quality of training and ultimately students’ learning outcomes
The yearly spending is analysed according to two categories:
1) Development costs (including cost for developing the training modules and for
implementing and delivering the training sessions); and
2) Current spending or “administrative and operational costs” (including, on one hand, the
wages and salaries of coordinators, external consultants and support activities for CERD
and on the other hand, coordination and preparation meetings, as well as accounting,
management and administrative coordination).
This expenditure classification follows the economic classification of public spending and the “Golden
Rule” of public finance, distinguishing between current and capital spending, in order to assess
productivity as well as “the composition, performance (effectiveness) and efficiency of public
expenditure” of public administrations31. The economic classification considers the final use of the
expenditure, such as investment, current consumption (e.g. intermediate consumption and
compensation of public employees), or transfers (e.g. social benefits).
In the case of the TTCM, the “development costs” could be divided into two types of spending, both
referring to “investment in human capital”:

Similarly, current spending or “administrative and operational costs” could be divided into two types
of spending, both referring to wages and salaries allocated for administrative or managerial tasks, as
well as ad hoc consultancies that are not linked to tools, modules or platform development (such as
External Auditors, advisors, etc.)

For 2021, the budget showing the planned vs. actual spending was not available when the evaluation
was conducted (between November and December 2021). Since CERD was still proceeding in closing
the financial year of 2021, and since the planned vs actual budget was not yet available, CERD shared
an excel file that reflected all the payments that will be made till end of 2021 and their details, and the
amount requested from UNICEF in order to be able to proceed with the payments. For example, the
2021 budget planned to train more than 10,000 teachers on the online modules and Mawride training
on online teaching and learning, yet it is difficult at this stage to retrace the actual spending as well as
the effected training, since the financial statements for 2021 were not finalized when the evaluators
conducted this analysis. Therefore, the cost-efficiency and cost-effectiveness analysis will be mainly
based on the 2017-2020 budget period, and the expenditures of 2021 will be analysed separately,
using a more descriptive methodology, since the closing of the financial year of 2021 was still in process
at CERD. The inclusion of the 2021 budget will mainly serve to illustrate the future decrease of the unit
costs, when a greater number of trainees are involved in future training in the coming years.
Costs-effectiveness of the online training
32. Number of trainers trained online in 2020 and 2021: Sixty-two CERD trainers were trained on the
Microsoft Teams module by an expert in 2020. 193 trainers were trained on the TTCM design32.
Moreover, 1,027 people had also attended online training for trainers in 2020 and 2021.
33. The overall cost of the year 2020 was 240,431 USD and the actual spending in 2021 amounted
to 253,315 USD. Thus, the overall expenditures for 2020 and 2021 amounted to 493,746 USD.
Since the training was mainly conducted remotely during this period, the evaluation team
32 Excel sheet “Liste des formateurs (trainers) qui ont suivi la formation au TTCM design”

50
learning and practice in public schools
assumes that the overall cost of the online training conducted between 2020 and 2022 is
493,746 USD.
34. The operational, technical assistance and administrative costs (sub-total 3 & 4) amounted to
154,800 USD in 2020 (representing 64% of the total expenditures of 2020) and to 97,925 USD
in 2021, representing 39% of the total expenditures of 2021. Therefore, the costs of the
administrative staff and external consultants as a percentage of the overall cost of the online
training for both years is around 51%. This percentage could be considered high, but it is
expected to decrease significantly in the future (as it already did in 2021 compared to 2020,
falling from 64% to 39% in 2021) since the fixed costs related to external consultancies and
development cost will not be included in future budgets.
Costs-effectiveness of the face-to-face training
35. In 2018, 11,245 people attended teacher training or coaching sessions on core and non-core
modules, especially DIFA, TWT, LAC, IST, CP. In 2019, 7,594 teachers (5,976 training slots) were
trained nationwide on teaching with technology, differentiation, formative assessment,
inclusion: MTSS policy and implementation, inclusion: MTSS screening tools and decision
making and child protection. Thus, the total number of teachers attending face-to-face training
between 2018 and 2019 is 18,839. 867 people (trainers, CERD staff, DEN, RCR) attended
training or coaching sessions (on DIFA, TWT, LAC, UbD) in 2017. 422 people attended training
and coaching sessions in 2018. Moreover, 30 CERD trainers were also trained on IST in 2019.
The total number of trainers and CERD staff attending training before 2020 was 1,319 persons.
36. The total expenditures between 2017 and 2019 were 2,580,601 USD. These expenditures
allowed the development and delivery of training attended by 20,158 people. The average cost
for training one person face-to-face was 128 USD (compared to 155 USD for the online training
in 2020). This is due to the significant costs of administrative and operational tasks in 2020.
37. In 2017, 867 people were trained using a budget of 559,572 USD, with an average cost for
training one person at around 645 USD. This could be explained by the nature of the training
(mainly training of trainers), but also by the importance of the administrative and operational
costs of 310,740 USD. Yet 2017 remains an exceptional year since it includes all the preparation
work before the launching of the teachers training.
38. In 2018, average cost for training one person was around 112 USD, which is lower than the
yearly average, due to the massive training of teachers and trainers, and to the relatively lower
administrative and operational costs (representing only 14%). Finally, in 2019 the average cost
for training one person was around 93 USD, which is the lowest in three years, mainly due to
the quasi absence of costs related to developing new modules.
39. This suggest that, compared to 2019, the cost of online training in 2020 seems to be relatively
high. However, the 2021 budget already shows a significant decrease in the unit cost of training
due to the lower volume and percentage of administrative costs and operational costs.
40. The operational and technical and administrative costs (subtotal 3 &4, all costs other than the
cost of developing and delivering the modules, the platform, the training and coaching)
amounted to 310,740 USD in 2017, representing 55% of total spending in the 2017 budget.
The lowest operational and technical cost before the crisis was reached in 2018, representing
16.5% of the total expenditures of 2018. In 2019, this ratio increased to 30%, which was slightly
higher than the average ratio of 29% for face-to-face training between 2017 and 2019. The
total expenditures for the three years amounted to 741,127 USD.

Preliminary conclusion on Efficiency
EFFI 1: Regarding the budget of the TTCM training, an annual budget has been drafted between 2017 and
2020, which represents the progress of spending for each year and shows the actual versus the planned
expenditures for each rubric. This facilitates the tracking of expenditures and allows for better transparency.
EFFI2: The actual spending shows a tendency to save money whenever possible and the actual spending is far
below the planned budget, especially for content development and for the cost of training delivery. In both
cases, the CERD-PITB maintained their regular daily rates normally used for their trainers (even after the
devaluation of the Lebanese Lira). When the indicative budget for 2021 is included, the total expenditures
will amount to 3,074,347 USD.
EFFI3: Evolution of spending between 2017 and 2021: Decreasing unit costs with time.
The highest output was reached in 2018 (11,667 people trained), but it was also the year with the highest
actual spending (more than 1.3 million USD). Conversely, the lowest spending was in 2020 (240,431 USD), yet
the number of trained persons was also very low in 2020, due to the dire economic conditions facing Lebanon
and public schools during this period.
Therefore, the efficiency analysis is based on the ratio of the total yearly cost to the number of trained persons
as shown in the Line C in Table 6.
The actual total spending between 2017 and 2021 amounts to 3.07 million USD, while the total number of
people trained was 32,162 (cf. section 2). Therefore, the average unit cost of training one person under the
TTCM for the five years is 96 USD per person (3.07 millions / 32162 persons attending training).
Nevertheless, this average is not significant in itself, since it mixes the averages of the online (2020 and 2021)
and the face-to-face training (2017-2019).
Between 2017 and 2019, the training was entirely conducted in the traditional face-to-face manner. The unit
cost for 2017 was around 645 USD: this training was limited to trainers and mainly consisted of ToT and
coaching workshops. Yet 2017 remains an exceptional year since it includes all the preparation work before
the launching of the teachers training. The unit costs in 2018 and 2019 are more representative of the average
cost of teachers training (112 USD and 93 USD respectively) since the teachers counted for more than 96% of
the trained population. This cost is close to the expected cost of 100 USD per teacher foreseen in the RACEII
logical framework.
EFFI 4: the average unit cost of face-to-face training for the period 2017-2019 is 128 USD and the cost of
online training is expected to drop with time due to return-on-scales
In 2020 and 2021, the training was conducted online and most of the trainees were teachers following the
self-paced modules of Microsoft Teams in 2020 and teachers following the Mawrid-e training on online
teaching, learning and back-to-school material in 2021. The unit costs for 2020 and 2021 are around 155.7
USD and 24 USD respectively. Hence, when combining the output of 2020 and 2021, the average unit cost of
online training is 45 USD, showing a significant decrease in the cost of training due to the exploitation of the
scale effect.
The higher unit costs for 2020 are mainly explained by the importance of the administrative and operational
costs as shown in the previous sections (cf. section 6), yet this average remains reasonable, and in any case
lower than the expected cost of 100 USD foreseen in the RACEII logical framework. Moreover, online training
is usually more cost-effective when the number of trainees increases, and/or when the number of
sessions/years increases due to the return on scale.

learning and practice in public schools
5.4. Impact
Impact evaluation and measurement of a teacher training operation is a complex task. Further
methodological conclusions on impact in teacher training are presented in the conclusion. This section
shall focus on both the micro (desk review, KII, FGD) and the macro (class observation, KII) dimensions.
It also builds upon a teacher satisfaction survey conducted after delivery of the DIFA module in 2018.
The triangulation of these different data sources made it possible to visualize the effect of TTCM from
different angles to complement and validate the results obtained. Impact is measured regarding
teacher learning and the analysis also explores the question of transfer of acquired skills into classroom
practices.
5.4.1. Improvement of teacher learning online and face to face
The improvement of teacher learning online and face to face responds to the following question: To
what extent did the TTCM trainings improve teacher learning online and face to face?
Observed traces of TTCM training in the classroom
41. In spite of the entire school year spent outside the classroom in 2020, the teachers did not lose
all traces of the training. However, the evaluation team can say that the visible impact of the
training could only be observed at the level of marginal practices. Indeed, the CP module has
been generally applied well. TwT related practices were less observable (three out of fifteen
schools). DIFA and Inclusion (IMPI, IST, ...) were applied at “level 1” that is to say, class
observations brought to light interest and constructive encouragement toward learners with
academic difficulties and some differentiated practices. The team did not observe in-depth
change in teaching practices and there were no differentiated medium or content for them.
Hence, more specialized training and follow-up sessions are still needed to complete the
"awareness" training already carried out. (cf. KII, FGD, observations).
42. There were no systematic impact study, follow-up or class observations after the training
because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Beirut Port Explosion.
We have been teaching online for almost two years. Online classes are different. And we cannot follow up with
the teachers to check if they have implemented what they acquired during the trainings in their classes.''
Trainer
Results of assessment of teachers’ capacities and skills before and after the training
43. The assessment was generally done, but not systematized. Often the trainers did not have time
to assess, especially for online training. Although required by the TTCM guidelines, previous
knowledge assessments were not always carried out (cf. KII, FGD) and did not seem to be fully
understood as a necessary step for training delivery (KII, focus groups).
44. The CERD survey on Differentiated Instruction and Formative Assessment Feedback35 specified
that during the months of May and June 2018, 26 inclusive schools and 669 teachers were
trained on the DIFA module. To assess the impact of this training, 380 teachers responded to
35 Training of teachers 2018, Report on the Differentiated Instruction and Formative Assessment Feedback
18/03/2022 –Evaluation of the TTCM project (2017-2021) and its impact on the quality of teacher
55
learning and practice in public schools
the electronic feedback survey designed by CERD and the TTCM expert team with fourteen
quantitative questions and eight qualitative questions. Qualitative and quantitative data
analysis was conducted on MS Excel (Differentiated Instruction and Formative Assessment
Feedback, p.3). However, after examining the survey’s results, the evaluators noticed that the
interpretation of some results was ambiguous and to a wide extent exaggeratedly positive. For
example, only 9% of the surveyed teachers considered the module on formative evaluation
“immediately transferable”, although this represents 50% of essential questions within the
DIFA module. Only 22% of teachers think the DIFA module changed their perception of
differentiation. Less than half of the attendees (42%) agreed on the usefulness and
applicability of the module, which is presented as a “very positive result.”
“Teachers found difficulties understanding most of the terminology. Everyone needs more training, starting
from the trainers to the trainees. [...] We need training to remind us the stages of TTCM, Because we did not
implement it sufficiently to acquire it very well and we were not able to communicate with each other or
exchange our work.'' Trainer
Behavioural change (motivation, confidence, tutoring)
45. Many precautions should be taken when referring these findings to changes driven by the
TTCM. The evaluation team is not in a position to confirm a direct causality between teachers
changing practices and the TTCM modules they followed. Nevertheless, according to school
principals and some DOPS interviews, there were significant changes and development for
teachers, especially in terms of behaviour, during training and after. They have become more
flexible, especially on issues of inclusion and child protection (KII, schools visits). The feedback
received by the directors following the TTCM training was rather positive. Many of them noted
a significant change in teacher behaviour, particularly when dealing with pupils with special
needs or learning difficulties.
5.4.2. Transfer of acquired competencies into classroom practice
The transfer of acquired competencies into classroom practice responds to the following question: To
what extent does the TTCM-based training achieve its objectives in terms of transfer of acquired
competencies to the classroom practices of teachers?
Convincing results of a qualitative study on the performance of teachers
46. There was no qualitative study of teacher performance. The classroom observations
conducted by the team showed that teachers kept a good record of the training. As
documented in the observation grids and confirmed during FGD, teachers sought to apply
what had been acquired, particularly through the followed module (s). This finding mainly
applies to CP and to some extent DIFA, although differentiation is not generalized, less to TwT,
used by only 20% of observed teachers (cf. Classroom observations, KII & excerpts below).
Also, the modules relating to inclusion (IST, IMPI, etc.) and differentiation (DIFA) were
generally applied in classes where learners with academic difficulties or special needs. This was
observed in 68% of teachers adopting a positive attitude toward them and 71% of teachers
18/03/2022 –Evaluation of the TTCM project (2017-2021) and its impact on the quality of teacher
56
learning and practice in public schools
surveyed with cases in class, facilitated the integration of learners with special needs or
learning difficulties, by a spatial distribution that allows them to participate, communicate and
be autonomous. In most cases, these learners received additional guidance and constructive
encouragement. The interviews with school principals and trainers confirmed that the attitude
and behaviour of teachers changed significantly after the TTCM training. They became more
eager to accept the presence of special needs children in their classes. Their perspective had
also changed vis-à-vis learners with learning difficulties (interviews with directors and
trainers). However, no transfer occurred regarding UbD principles and backward design
approach, as the teachers were not informed of the new design process.
''We did not really apply the TTCM project on the ground. Have we had the time to practice and work on it,
we could have probably seen some results with the teachers in terms of motivation, knowledge transfer,
competence acquisition, etc. sadly we cannot judge the efficiency of the program on the trainers and the
teachers'' DOPS
''I noticed some progress. But I don’t remember the details'' School Director
''TTCM trainings have been very effective in teaching teachers the different ways of dealing with special cases
and struggling learners'' School Director
"I wish we can also push teachers to prepare the classes on TTCM. It should be a full-fledge program whereby
teachers can access and insert their class material. This would help us as DOPS observers to evaluate the
teacher and directly add our feedback on their work and their competencies if acquired or not […] personally,
I never saw the involvement of both CERD and DOPS on the TTCM in the same time. There was no presence for
both of them together. Again, I was only exposed to the TTCM as a trainer from CERD and not as a coach at
DOPS. DOPS
“Upon our observations, we noted an improvement in the teacher’s competencies, and we noticed a change in
the behaviour of teachers who attended the trainings; they are more motivated, posing questions, and even
trying to change their way of teaching in their classrooms. The design of the trainings had an indirect impact
on them.” MEHE
Concluding reports by trainers or other actors in education
47. There was no official follow-up or impact assessment.
Quality and good performance of teacher portfolios
48. No formal impact study has been done. TMS is a promising tool, but it has not been used and
could therefore not be assessed.
''The TMS for example is important but not everyone has been trained in its use." Trainer
'' The Teachers' Portfolio has helped organize and target certain training courses. [...] I tell you again, we didn't
follow up” Trainer
''I was unable to make face-to-face class observations with her teachers as schools were closing due to the

57
learning and practice in public schools
Preliminary conclusion on Impact
IMP 1: The teachers have not completely lost all traces of the training followed, but the evaluation team can
say that the traces found remained at a superficial level of practice. The twenty-five class observations carried
out allowed the evaluation team to conclude that the TTCM training modules (CP, DIFA, G, IST, MIPI, TWT)
were not without effect on the professional practices of teachers, but to varying degrees. The teachers were
not using technology during the observed classes.
IMP 2: There was an observable change in teachers’ behaviour, during training and afterwards, toward
inclusion and child protection issues (observations, KII).
IMP 3: No follow-up or class observations after the training allowed for a refresh of the acquired competences
after the COVID-19 shutdown nor within the interrupted 2020-2021 school year. CERD trainers usually do not
perform school-based training or follow-up. This situation is regretted by most stakeholders.
5.5. Sustainability
The purpose of this section is to highlight the extent to which the TTCM project is sustainable,
specifically the ability of key stakeholders to sustain intervention benefits beyond donor funding to
rely on locally available resources. The focus will be on the capacity of the project to be scaled up and
continuously refined to meet the changing needs of teachers, to continuously track and respond to the
competency building of trainers and to be able to contribute to a change of perception in the role and
place of in-service teacher training and a consideration of their needs.
5.5.1. Potential for scaling-up for teachers with no additional donor funding
The potential for scaling up responds to the following question: To what extent can the TTCM approach
can be scaled up and continuously refined to meet the changing needs of teachers as collected through
the training management system, with no additional donor funding?
Communication, coordination and reporting on teachers’ training needs and developments
49. Regular reporting was ensured by the project's main expert deployed at CERD. Mutual trust
between UNICEF experts and CERD staff was reported and documented in the verbatim below.
There was an attempt to create a committee to include other stakeholders, but ultimately, this
was not the case.
“[The expert] was the UNICEF representative at CERD, so yes of course there was an alignment with UNICEF.
We also requested people from the general directorate and inspectors to be within the committee, but the
request was not fulfilled, and we couldn’t wait anymore. So, we kick started the project and we reported to
them what was being done and all the findings. The steering committee included representatives from UNICEF
and CERD. There was always this look between both entities the UNICEF and CERD to supervise all the work
that was being done. Firstly, to compose the annual workplan, for the minister’s approval, then for the
implementation there were many meetings to oversee how it implemented. We had a decree about it for
CERD. UNICEF also was present in most of the meetings and if not available we would update them by reports.
But we had weekly status meetings” KI – PITB KI – PITB
“I never saw the involvement of both CERD and DOPS on the TTCM in the same time. There was no presence
for both of them together. Again, I was only exposed to the TTCM as a trainer from CERD and not as a coach
at DOPS. I felt the TTCM was adopted by CERD and not shared fairly with the rest of the units. It was not
cascaded down to the coaches nor the teachers. I don’t think the TTCM was given its rights to all the
stakeholders to be used fully as it should be” KII - DOPS

58
learning and practice in public schools
Identification of initiatives implemented or to be implemented at the institutional level
50. Conditions are favourable to set-up a partnership between the DOPS and the PITB with the
trainers overseeing the continuous training of the teachers and the DOPS overseeing the
follow-up of the teachers in class. Staff members from both institutions agree on the high
readiness of staff and decision-makers to enhance this collaboration, while underlining the
improved ties and collaboration in previous years. Despite some past information and
communication shortages, new initiatives are on track most notably for the implementation
of a single software or two compatible software solution for monitoring teachers’ professional
development (see KIIs, excerpt below). In the meantime, However, new funding was raised for
CERD to develop more training activities and donors are still highly mobilized to support
teacher training.
“We usually send CERD on an annual basis our recommendations concerning the needs that must be tackled.
We noticed that CERD have started taking our recommendations into consideration. […] we are ready to
collaborate" KII – MEHE
51. The TTCM project team supported its new vision for educational content with a set of
proposals compiled in a policy brief aimed at the upsurge and adoption of a new regulatory
framework for teacher in-service training and increased teacher participation though
regulatory changes (mandatory sessions for example) and/or financial incentives. The policy
brief also recommended to systematize impact assessment. However, the policy brief remains
a short document and was not widely diffused nor discussed. The potential for the
recommendation of the policy brief to be further developed and implemented without donor
funding are scarce in the present Lebanese context with ongoing poor visibility about public
finances. However, the project leaves interesting remote learning modalities eager to be used
with no additional costs, provided internet access is granted.
52. Donor coordination within the “quality” pillar of RACE 2 was rather rare globally. Most donors
reported that they had heard or consulted little about the project. Some of them reported the
existence of newsletters as an initiative to keep partners informed. The evaluation team had
no access to these newsletters, and this practice was not reported by TTCM stakeholders (see
KIIs, excerpt below).
Introduction of a system of continuous remediation or possible adjustments
53. The needs assessment and the impact evaluation are reported as two key components to
improve and conduct on a regular basis to capture teachers and trainers’ evolving needs.
However, an operational training management system (TMS) is necessary and was still lacking
when the evaluation was completed.
54. Due to the various crises that are going throughout Lebanon, most activities are at a standstill,
but the various stakeholders have expressed the desire/need for new training and/or
retraining sessions. In order to guarantee the sustainability of the TTCM project, it must
demonstrate its ability to capitalize and appreciate its effects in order to adjust and regulate
itself regarding future reforms.

learning and practice in public schools
“Other than the performance tasks, there are other evidence that trainers need to collect during the training.
It resembles formative assessment that we use with our students the same idea, these quizzes asking
questions, doing some kind of group work activities, mentoring, observing and so on. These help trainers make
sure that everything is acquired before reaching the performance task. So by the end of the training the
performance task becomes a complete work and also trainees present their work and they get feedback from
trainers, and they have the chance to improve their work." KII – RCR
"Since we did not continue with all the training sessions based on the TTCM, they might have forgotten it. […]
But once face-to-face trainings become feasible, we planned to do 45 training sessions for induction curriculum
that were not actually implemented especially for teachers on contract basis and high school teachers who
recently graduated" RCR
"I am able to use the TTCM but the refresh is always important. Just like the students now, we need to remind
them of the classroom practices. Also, both trainees and trainers need this refresh. I like to use the TTCM in
my next training taking into consideration my feedback and the feedback of my colleagues concerning the
part that requires a lot of time and we reach the same results." Trainer
Adaptability of the TTCM to all circumstances (sanitary, safe, economical, …)
55. TTCM proved its great adaptability to different circumstances. Notably, the evaluation team
can mention the creation of Microsoft Teams and training sessions that have been given
online. However, this has negative consequences such as cessation of certain activities or
reduced efficiency, reduced training duration, impossibility of applying the training evaluation
framework and tools, etc. (KII, FGD).
“We all know that during online training, you cannot have full attention from the participants for more than 2
hours or 2 hours and a half. This led us to stop planning based on the TTCM due to this limited period of time.
Because any training session planned following the TTCM must last for at least 2 training days which are
equivalent to 10 training hours. So, there was a gap, we were not able to implement the TTCM as we wanted
to do […] We cannot reduce this gap unless we go back to the face-to-face trainings. I cannot do a performance
task for 2 hours in an online training session. It cannot be guided or evaluated or use the rubrics. We do not
have enough time to do all of this. Besides we face internet issues that waste some of the time allocated for
the session (using the links, not being able to join the sessions…). " RCR
Coordination and involvement of all actors and stakeholders
56. There is a lack of coordination and involvement of other stakeholders such as MEHE/DOPS,
inspectorate, school principals, other donor organizations, parents, etc. despite the attempt
to create a committee as previously stated. This lack was reported by trainers, DOPS, as
reported below. This can be explained by the important design and research work carried out
during the preparation phase with many trainer-oriented activities carried out (KII).
"It is the DOPS responsibility to go to schools and follow-up, and by not involving them within the training
project, the TTCM project will not attain its desired outcome. […] But again, as a DOPS coach, how am I able
to evaluate the teacher without being myself introduced to the TTCM? Hence the need for DOPS to be involved
within the TTCM trainings should not be disregarded. […] DOPS

5.5.2. Potential for scaling up for trainers
The potential for scaling up trainers responds to the following question: To what extent can the TTCM
approach be scaled up to continuously track and respond to the competency building of trainers? This
section has mainly been supported by the KIIs, school visits and FGDs and confirmed by the presence
(or not) of appropriate documentation
Presence of training follow-up
57. There was no particular follow-up on the field after the sessions:
- Trainers did not have access to the classroom;
- School directors were not considered as key stakeholders for training follow-up purposes
despite some very interesting innovations like school-based training; and
- The DOPS and inspectors were not aware of this new training and have not been trained
in it themselves. Therefore, none of these actors can support or attest to the
implementation of classroom training with the exception of DOPS who are also trainers.
This lack of training follow-up was mentioned as a regret/shortfall among most of the actors
interviewed at all levels (KIIs, school observation, FGD).
"The problem was that we did not get the targeted results. There was not enough time to cover all the
information and we did not follow up with them to know the challenges they have faced in practice. I think
that the trainers must follow up on a monthly basis with the trainees to check the challenges or gaps they
faced in practice […] I do not think there were any follow- up with the teachers. The follow up was basically
done by school supervisors, but not all of the supervisors were interested or willing to do so." DEN
Introduction of a recognized certification or any other motivation
58. Currently, no form of recognized certification or any other type of formal motivation was
introduced. The success of the TTCM project and the intent to pioneer competency-based
teaching and learning may raise new questions that challenge the present regulatory
framework for global coherence purposes (KII, FGDs)
“This is again, this is why believe institutionalize it although it has been institutionalized at CERD, CERD alone
is not enough, it needs to be institutionalized at the ministry’s level because this will entail developing policies,
to make training mandatory, developing policies related to teachers’ appraisal model that is not there, improve
their salary scale one step at a time every two years like, you know, the traditional way. There's no certification
of teachers, etc.” KI – UNICEF
Development of strong communication with teachers
59. Teachers were not considered as real partners within this global change in teacher training. In
particular, they were not informed about:
- The adoption of a new architecture;
- The key concepts and methods associated with TTCM with the ambition for teachers to
reproduce them in class, in particular the backward design; and
18/03/2022 –Evaluation of the TTCM project (2017-2021) and its impact on the quality of teacher
61
learning and practice in public schools
- The aspects of the evaluation in which they are subjected and assessed.
The initiative to strengthen communication with teachers via Whatsapp was undertaken by many
trainers, making it possible to develop better communication and reinforced support.
"I'm sure, they would welcome it, but we need to communicate it to them. And this was not something that
we have achieved maybe because of COVID, okay, because the pandemic started in the middle of the process,
or towards the end of it. So we were working on it, we reached the school principals, teachers, all the
administrative stuff, and so on, the next step was parents, and we could not actually reach it, because maybe
it's not that common to train parents in Lebanon, this is step forward we need to be working on, we need to
work on engaging parents in their children's learning. And hopefully, this will be part of the coming plans […]
Most of the teachers that were involved in the trainings accepted this approach. They were aware of the three
stages but they did not acquire an in-depth understanding of how they were designed" RCR
5.5.3. Change of role and place on INSETT
The changing role of INSETT is assessed by responding to the following question: To what extent the
establishment of the TTCM has been able to contribute to a change in perception in the role and place
of in-service teacher training and the consideration of their needs?
Change with regards to continuing planning training operations
60. The RCRs, DENs, trainers and DOPS interviewed and involved in the TTCM project are
convinced of the added value of the project, including its components, and are waiting to
resume activities through more effective involvement and communication with certain actors
such as teachers, other TFPs, local supervisors, etc.
We always dream about unifying the educational system in Lebanon, unifying all the parties. Now, we cannot
wait until all parties are unified, we need to proceed with the work and allow others to join forces to build a
system worthy of the entire nation.” KI – PITB
Preliminary conclusion on Sustainability
SUST 1 – Potential for scaling-up teachers with no additional donor funding: The TTCM proved its great
adaptability to different circumstances. Notably, the evaluation team can mention the creation of Microsoft
Teams and training sessions that have been given online. However, this has negative consequences such as
cessation of certain activities or reduced efficiency, reduced training duration, impossibility of applying the
training evaluation framework and tools, etc, but it should be remembered that the current context remains
very difficult. Several beneficiaries expressed the need for new training or refresher training and for some
form of recognition or motivation for the trainees within a revised regulatory framework.
SUST 2 - Potential for scaling up trainers: The project was able to adapt to different contexts and to develop
a training approach promoting trainers’ constant adaptation. However:
• There is no training follow-up, which does not allow trainers to observe the impact of their training
on the trainees, and to adapt their training if necessary. Accordingly, in consultation with the DOPS
– mostly marginalized within the framework of the project and unfamiliar with the TTCM theoretical
framework – It is necessary to carry out a post-training follow-up.
• No recognized certification or other professional motivation exist,
18/03/2022 –Evaluation of the TTCM project (2017-2021) and its impact on the quality of teacher
62
learning and practice in public schools
• Communication with teachers is still poor, preventing trainers from discussing with their trainees to
adapt training and determine the skills they need to strengthen.
SUST 3 - Change of role and place of INSETT and the consideration of their needs: most of the stakeholders
interviewed and involved in the TTCM project are convinced of the added value of the project and its
components and are waiting to be able to resume activities with more effective involvement and
communication with certain actors. Indeed, there is a lack of coordination and involvement of many
stakeholders such as MEHE/DOPS, inspectorate, school principals, other donor organizations, parents, etc.
but new upcoming quality-related initiatives could trigger new collaboration opportunities.
In conclusion, the sustainability of the project is questionable. On the one hand, the project has been able
to demonstrate its ability to adapt to different contexts and to develop a training design theoretically
allowing constant adaptation for scaling-up. On the other hand, several challenges remain:
- First, the project does not seem to have sufficiently involved all stakeholders, in particular teachers and
school principals, but also other donors involved in teacher training as well as the DOPS who monitor
teachers in class,
- The inconsistency between pre-service and in-service training approach remains an obstacle. Training
should be the "red thread" of a teacher's career and be part of a continuum.
- Spaces for exchange and dialogue between stakeholders, follow-up, monitoring and methods of
capitalization were not identified during this assessment, making it difficult to produce knowledge with a
view to adjustment leading to the sustainability of the approach.
Under the present institutional settings, the TTCM approach does not make it possible to monitor and
respond to the competency building of trainers in a participatory and global manner. The policy brief is a first
step to think institutional reform of teacher training in a more systemic manner allowing better sustainability
of the TTCM.
5.6. Human rights and gender equality
61. The TTCM project is part of the RACE II program, which addresses human rights and fosters
inclusion of all refugee children. It targets better integration of these children into Lebanese
public schools by addressing key topics such as differentiated education and child protection.
Addressing education personnel’s attitude towards cross-cutting themes in education (child
protection, inclusion, learner centred instruction, gender issues, sustainable development,
peace education) is recognized as a key TTCM expected outcome.
62. The TTCM project significantly contributed to the fulfilment of children rights to education and
more specifically, marginalized children. For this reason, findings and analysis of this report
are directly related to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (commonly
abbreviated as the CRC.) The TTCM training was conceived within the framework of the
inclusive school project that aimed for basic education to ensure equitable access to quality
education through a rights-based approach and promotion of a child-friendly environment in
schools.
63. Several TTCM instruments explicitly refer to a right-based approach:
• The teacher induction curriculum for novice teachers includes the development of
openness and acceptance of otherness in all its forms as a key professional activity for
teachers under the category “Professional relations” (PR.SCHL) and explicitly mentions
inclusion, child protection, human rights, children’s rights, cultures, gender equality,
environments, contexts as key areas with related modules; and
18/03/2022 –Evaluation of the TTCM project (2017-2021) and its impact on the quality of teacher
63
learning and practice in public schools
• The child protection module provides trainers and teachers with full information and new
skills about children’s rights.
64. Gender issues are fully addressed within the modules. For example, the DIFA module includes
instructions for teachers to consider learners characteristics according to their gender or
culture. The gender module equally supports better consideration of a gender lens into
Lebanese public schools. Several modules under the induction curriculum address gender
discrimination and measures to fight them.

6. LESSONS LEARNED AND FINAL CONCLUSIONS
The adoption of the teacher’s competency framework in 2017 targeted an improvement in the quality
of teachers and teaching in Lebanon. This instrument is recognized worldwide as a “the main
integrating element to improve teacher quality.” 36 In many countries, the adoption of a teacher
competency framework has led to new challenges, including debates on how to define a teacher and
teaching quality. The effect of competency frameworks is maximized if they can influence entrance
requirements for initial teacher education, certification examinations, teacher evaluations, continuing
professional development as well as career progression within a defined national context.
The Teacher Training Curriculum Model (TTCM) project was undoubtedly a pioneer in promoting and
implementing a new vision of teacher continuous training in Lebanon, following-up on the
modernization process triggered by the adoption of the competency framework in 2017. It fostered
new tools and new approaches for teacher training quality with the aim to ensure a real shift from
teacher training quality into efficient teaching practices in the classroom. Definitely, this is a highly
important step to trigger improved and more frequent impact assessment practices in teacher training.
Of course, the project only addressed in-service teacher training as a first step for a deeper
transformational process. There is still a long road ahead, and the research on teacher’s initial training
adequacy with the competency framework performed within the TTCM project is an important step,
although with limited use and effect during the project implementation period.
The global relevance and coherence of the TTCM was analysed according to both Lebanese and
international standards and more broadly, the objective to improve teacher quality in the country
following a policy approach. International policy research highlights important challenges in defining
teacher training quality across countries and notably:
• It is generally difficult to create a general consensus on the priority of education goals;
therefore, the main duties, responsibilities and roles of a teacher37;
• There is not a single type of teacher job, although it is possible to identify common professional
teacher competencies. Teaching is not the same in a disadvantaged suburb or in a privileged
district and those discrepancies may require some specific knowledge, attitudes, abilities and
values; and
• The quality of an individual teacher may be influenced significantly by the learning
environment. Therefore, it is useful to analyse teacher effectiveness in close relationship with
actual school environment and pupil characteristics.
The evaluation team would like to underline four main lessons learned:
(1) the successful teacher training modernization process triggered by the TTCM;
(2) the importance of preserved diversity among teacher classroom practices;
(3) some methodological issues linked with the adaptation of the Understanding by Design (UbD)
framework for teacher training institutions and policies; and finally,

(4) an update on existing evidence in regard to systemic impact assessment within teacher training
reforms.
6.1. The TTCM allowed deep progress towards a modernized and competency-
based teacher training system
The TTCM project was highly successful in introducing new and modern tools and approaches for
competency-based teacher training, namely:
• Adopting a holistic training curriculum approach based on a coherent set of pedagogical
components;
• Building on professional competency frameworks (both for trainers and for teachers);
• Providing a unique framework for training design and planning related to the competences to
be acquired by trainees;
• Setting-up a specific tool to follow-up teacher training and monitor quality following a lifelong
learning perspective;
• Building on in-service training to promote collaborative work among teachers and facilitate
the exchange of ideas to create professional learning communities;
• Designing a specific model for new teachers with poor initial training; and
• Measuring the impact of the training on teacher practices.
The TTCM design framework was designed in close collaboration between CERD and UNICEF experts;
therefore, it led to improved ownership of the training by Centre for Educational Research and
Development (CERD) trainers who shall no longer accept “ready-to-use” training modules prepared by
external consultants.
This new vision for educational content was supported with a set of proposals (policy brief) aimed at
the upsurge and adoption of a new regulatory framework for teacher in-service training and increased
teacher participation though regulatory changes (mandatory sessions for example) and/or financial
incentives. The TTCM team also appeals for changes in teacher training provision allowing better
training follow-up; in particular, modifying the CERD mandate according to which trainers are not
allowed to visit the classrooms.
The results and impact of the project also suggest a need for improved coherence in the Lebanese
education system, in particular when the Lebanese government intends to carry out a wide curriculum
reform. Curriculum for students learning (presently being reformed with the support of the World
Bank), student assessment or teacher initial education are to be consistent to foster quality education.
The whole process partly failed to tackle the role of school-based training within this whole
modernization process, where school directors should be considered (and internationally they are
more and more valorised) for training and pedagogical leadership purposes. This approach should also
include reforms in training processes and channels in addition to content and design, offering school-
based refresher training in collaboration with school directors and allowing teachers to apply their
learning in authentic situations in the classroom. In addition, by choosing to train teachers in methods
and concepts as advocated by TTCM design, the project would benefit from making Lebanese teachers
reflexive practitioners who are not limited to the application of successful recipes.

66
learning and practice in public schools
6.2. The project adopts the socio-constructivist paradigm as “unique” reference
The TTCM conceptual framework is based on the assumption that the socio-constructivist paradigm is
the best or only way to address the challenges of competency-based teaching and learning. Its
assessment framework insists on project-based learning and assessment, with the wide use of
“rubrics”.
This assertion is not considered today as demonstrated by evidence; on the contrary, research tends
to show that there is not “one best way to teach,” but different effective pedagogical approaches
according to the profile and preferences of the teacher, the context of teaching and the attitudes and
heterogeneity of students. Most specialists adhere to socio-constructivism to define competency-
based learning from a student perspective.
However, the best adapted approach to effective teaching is not unanimously defined, with experts
still questioning the differences between complex subject-based competencies acquisition
(“apprentissages scolaires”) and life skills (also referred to as transversal skills), requiring different
approaches. In other words, while everyone agrees on the need to promote high-quality teaching, the
debate on what constitutes good practice is far from over and does not conclude that socio-
constructivism is the only “right” approach. The evaluation team can safely say that there are two
clearly defined orientations rooted in philosophies of education and empirical research, and that none
of them has been proven “superior”:
• Direct instruction/explicit teaching (teacher’s role is to communicate knowledge in a
clear and structured way), based on behaviourism, defending objective-based learning
at least for subject-based competencies requiring specific subject-based knowledge.
They recommend moving progressively from simple to complex; and
• Constructivism (students should act as participants in the process of acquiring
knowledge). Constructivist approaches generally privilege problem-based and project-
based learning in order to stimulate reasoning and cooperation within students. Socio-
constructivist approaches generally recommend starting with complex situations.
OCED analysis on teacher practices and abundant research show that virtually, most teachers will rely
on both approaches at some point in their teaching, moving between the two depending on the needs
of a specific class and the objectives of various stages of lessons. In most countries, teachers are free
to choose the teaching approach corresponding to the needs of their pupils and there is no universal
teaching method for all pupils and all situations.
Notwithstanding the benefits of direct transmission and constructivism, active and passive teaching
strategies, the effectiveness of any teaching practice depends on how teachers implement it in the
classroom. Research shows that to address the numerous challenges they face, teachers should
develop reflexive practices, eager to support their permanent adaptation.
In addition, project-based activities and assessment are widely recognized as a powerful tool to
develop transversal skills, however, it is exaggerated to consider it as the only effective method for
competency-based teaching. The assessment framework of the TTCM, mainly based on “rubrics”, only
applies to project-based teaching and therefore tends to be widely based on this untrue assumption.

learning and practice in public schools
6.3. The adaptation of UbD to adult learning leads to increased complexity and
generates confusion
The Teacher Training Curriculum Model (TTCM) is not only a competency-based teacher training
project; it also refers to the experiment of an international curriculum design framework, the
“Understanding by Design (UbD)” framework according to Wiggins and Mc Tighe (2005)38, adapted for
adult learning and more specifically, teacher professional development outside the school. This
approach is presented as “the best” or even “the most effective” one by many TTCM experts, decision
makers and documents, leading to the conviction that UbD-based socio-constructivist approaches are
the most adapted to competency-based teaching and best suited to maximize impact on classroom
practices.
As presented in Australia39, the UbD model is mainly used in the world as a framework for designing
a sequence of lessons for pupils at the school level, addressing the equivalent of competency
referenced as “T.SPP.PLAN”40 within the Lebanese competency framework. The evaluation team found
no existing or assessed experiment of the UbD at the systemic level or for teacher training institutions.
The TTCM handbook intended to transfer the logic of UbD from the school level into a global strategy
for teacher training, where the trainer is the teacher and the teacher is the pupil. In this case, the
required backward design is based not on the school or national curriculum, but rather on the
teacher competency framework. It is a very valuable exercise of isomorphism, based on the common
idea among TTCM stakeholders that if the trainer adopts UbD, the teacher will tend to adopt UbD.
This shift led to huge adaptation work and theoretical research by the TTCM team, including some
highly complex theoretical considerations and new terminology (facets of understanding, Goal, Role,
Audience, Situation, Product or Performance, Standards (GRASPS), Big ideas and essential questions,
where to guideline for lesson planning) generating confusion between teacher competencies and
student competencies. For example, if “backward design” is viewed as an approach for teacher
training, it is described as a teaching method in the glossary of terms (Annex C)41. Bearing in mind that
the 2018 teacher feedback reports overall confusion around the notion of
competency/attitude/knowledge (“Some confusion remains, however, between knowledge,
competencies and attitudes », page 6), questions arise over the introduction of many new concepts at
the same time being too ambitious. Wiggins and Mc Tighe question the attempt to implement too
many initiatives simultaneously (e.g., UbD, Differentiated Instruction, Curriculum Mapping, Marzano’s
“Strategies” etc.) as sometimes problematic. As they draw lessons learned from the field, the fathers
of UbD recommend, “think big but start small and smart”, bearing in mind the theoretical complexity
38 Handbook, p18.

teachers/refining-practice/planning-a-sequence-of-lessons
40 The 2017 competency frameworks organise competencies according to a coding table stating 4 professions, 4 domains and 12
competencies. T.SPP.PLAN is to be understood as follows: T stands for Teacher (profession), SPP stands for Specialised Professional Practices
(domain), Plan stands for “Plan for the teaching and learning process” (Competency).
41 « Many teachers begin their unit design with the means—textbooks, favored lessons, and time-honored » activities— rather than deriving
those from the end—the targeted results, such as content standards or understandings”.
18/03/2022 –Evaluation of the TTCM project (2017-2021) and its impact on the quality of teacher
68
learning and practice in public schools
of the model42. Announcing that, “UbD is the official way to plan all lessons from here on” is also not
recommended.
The UdB model adopts an approach based on backward design, i.e. designing assessment tools
together with training objectives. The importance and impact of formative evaluation early in the
training design process are no longer debated in adult learning theories and all “training engineering”
approaches. Since the TTCM design was focused on the adaptation of the innovative educational
framework proposed by UbD, some essential phases of training engineering were even neglected. For
instance, it failed to capture needs assessment and evaluation/follow-up/impact assessment as
essential parts of the process. Although included in the theoretical model, the “Previous knowledge
assessment” phase of the TTCM was not enough taking into consideration the preparation of TTCM
modules; therefore, it partly failed to capture the strong heterogeneity of public school teachers during
sessions.
6.4. The TTCM triggers renovated debates about impact analysis of in-service
training on teacher learning and practices
The initial core subject of this evaluation targeted impact measurement in teacher training, and the
TTCM project brought this topic as an important element of the teacher training approach. This is key
to develop any “modern” training engineering approach, be it in accordance with UbD or not, which
should design impact measurement strategies and tools early in the design process.
The proposed figure shows this process, and demonstrate that this “classical” training engineering
approach is fully compatible with existing TTCM principles:

18/03/2022 –Evaluation of the TTCM project (2017-2021) and its impact on the quality of teacher
69
learning and practice in public schools
However, the TTCM team did not go far enough in the integration of impact measurement. Of course,
be it formative or summative assessment, impact measurements are a complex operation and each
education system must create its own relevant reference framework. The crisis context was not
favourable to an ambitious impact evaluation envisaged from the beginning, with relevant baseline
data.
However, the project shed light on interesting practices on ex post evaluation of teacher training
impact, building on qualitative and quantitative data on 2 of the 3 dimensions usually considered for
impact assessment:
/ The Micro dimension, building on immediate impact on teacher outcomes. Outcomes
refer to evidence of total or partial acquisition of new professional skills. These results are
measured against the objectives. It builds on the appreciation of the beneficiaries "on the
spot" of the added value provided by the training and the ability to reinvest in the new
skills acquired. Related data can be collected through questionnaires or interviews. The
TTCM organized such a survey for the DIFA module with success.
/ The Meso dimension, considering the transfer of learning outcomes into new classroom
practices. It relates to the capacity of the trainees to transfer the learning outcomes into
a change in professional practices on a daily basis. In this case, through classroom
observations, evaluators shall observe the direct and observable effect of training on
professional practices. The TTCM project tended to systematize this approach through the
generalization of performance tasks referring to authentic professional situations.
However, as mentioner before, the performance tasks were not realized in professional
(classroom) context, because teacher training in Lebanon is mainly done in training
centres. Preferably, evaluators shall include a pre-test and a post-test to assess, according
to a purposive sampling method.
/ The Macro dimension, considering the impact of such training on education quality
assessed through student learning outcomes. This third dimension requires more time and
more theoretical and methodological consideration. The link between teacher training and
student outcomes is not yet considered as unequivocal and this uncertainty is linked with
the difficulty to objectivize impact on students. Therefore, this third dimension shall be
considered with all required caution and evidence-based approaches and was not taken
into consideration in a scientific manner within the framework of the TTCM project.
In all cases, specific precautions are necessary to systematically consider training content and the
conditions underpinning the delivery process, as well as monitoring strategies, but impact assessment
are now considered as essential for any teacher training reform process. Of course, it should be
contextualized to the peculiarities of the learning environment. The impact of the training may differ
depending on the trainers’ individual abilities and practices. Therefore, impact measurement must
consider the context of the training, including its material and economic parameters. Measurement
recommendations are suggested in the next chapter.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.1. General remarks that are used for framing the recommendations
The Teacher Training Curriculum Model (TTCM) project was not designed “backward,” first defining
quantified objectives, together with expected outcomes and their indicators, then planning all the
steps backwards. Activities were conceived annually, and results measured, but without a clear
reference framework. The reconstruction of the ToC permitted the elaboration on objectives and
targets set forth in the Handbook, but no clear Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning framework was
provided from the beginning.
According to RACE II, Teachers enhanced capacities was the major need for public schools in Lebanon
(output 2.1). The TTCM Handbook defined this “effective professional development” strategy as,
namely: “(1) developing a global curriculum framework for teacher professional development
including training, (2) encouraging teacher engagement in curriculum-focused training and
collaborative learning activities, (3) developing strategies to monitor the quality of the training
delivered to teachers and its impact on classroom practices in alignment with national standards, and
(4) ensuring that teachers who have not completed initial training are exposed to high quality
continuous training.”43.
The evaluation team provides the following recommendations with the hope that they can be useful
in such a challenging context.

a) The Lebanese curriculum is not competency-based, it is structured by
objectives and follows a rather strict subject-based approach. Still, teachers
need solid support to plan the sequences of lessons efficiently, in accordance
with the objectives and progression set forth in the curriculum. Further
reforms should continue with the introduction of competency-based
teaching and learning in a coherent way.
b) The 2017 competency frameworks adopted a complex structure (high
number of competencies and competency components, confusing coding
system - as for example T.SPP. PLAN mentioned in the report). As this
structure is now better understood by stakeholders, it is probably too early
to change it but education authorities should take this complexity into
account and target simplification at a later stage.

increased coherence in education (teacher training (both initial and in-
service), curriculum, assessment methods for teachers, exams);
d) TTCM design / framework / approach to be clearly defined and agreed

a) Avoid “tabula rasa” approaches and do not discredit transmissive
15, 21-
pedagogies, allowing teachers to smoothly and progressively adapt their
24, 27 practices;
b) Revise the assessment framework in order to refer to activities which are
not necessarily project-based and rubrics
c) Develop an impact assessment method to be implemented within a clear
and re-defined MEAL framework
d) Target transmitting methods more than content and consider teachers as
reflexive practitioners; and
e) Simplify approaches and concepts and avoid unnecessary complexity
within TTCM documents. (e.g. simplify the handbook to focus the approach
on effective teaching practices, with theoretical references in annex).
In ref. to REC#3 Refer to a Lebanese backward design approach rather PITB and High
findings than to an international registered trademark and make sure UNICEF
8-9 that intellectual property issues regarding UbD are taken into
consideration if maintained official reference to UbD in public
documents.
While fully respecting the deep theoretical research and work carried out by
the TTCM team, it seems possible to refer to backward design as a Lebanese
approach. Most modern “training engineering approaches” recommend
evaluation strategies and tools be prepared early in the training process.
Most tools used within the TTCM, for example performance tasks or essential
questions, could be considered as part of this Lebanese approach. A simpler
approach in terms of needs analysis=>training design and assessment
tools=>training implementation=>impact assessment is recommended.
Should official reference to UbD be maintained, discussions should be
organized with the owner of this international registered trademark, namely
ASCD, taking the form of an official authorization or MoU.
UdD is not the only approach/tool and it might be dangerous to present it as
“the best way” (as per any other singular approach).

a) Bring together, in a common taskforce, the Guidance and Counselling
Office (DOPS) with the Pre-service and In-service training Bureau (PITB) to
avoid redundancy, and/or duplicated effort (e.g. currently two separate
management systems) and allow for a better return on work and investment;
and
b) Donors and donors’ representatives or supporting entities should follow-
up on future efforts dedicated to mediation between DOPS and PITB. It
should not be left to each specific project to deal with this issue separately.

c) Use this common framework to develop the policy brief and make it a
consensual MEHE document on the future of teacher training.
Even if there are challenges to ensure buy-in of some stakeholders, this is to
be part of any next step, be it donor-funded or not.
In ref. to REC#5: Ensure provision for project quality assurance, quality UNICEF + High

Learning (MEAL) for the next phases of the TTCM.
The global QA package should be composed at least of the following
components:
a) Quality Plan;
b) MEAL Plan and tools and clear ToC;
c) MEAL resources not allocated to the project;
d) Communication and dissemination plans defined in the preparation
phase prior to full design and ultimately development; and
e) External review & Quality Assurance (QA) of project deliverables not
defined.

findings “redesign” and re-deployment phase , and impact analysis CERD

55-57 needs change and the trainings are revised based on
feedback from teachers and trainers
a) Funding streams secured and a metaplan for the revisited project to be
embedded in CERD’s Strategic Planning
b) Needs Analysis to become a process that includes all concerned
stakeholders (RCR, DEN, Trainers, as well as MEHE DOPS, teachers), including
non MEHE actors such as Educational Inspectorate (central inspection);
c) The proper structure, mechanisms and processes for a sustainable Need
Analysis with a continuous and agile monitoring and evaluation systems are
yet to be defined. As to the TMS as it is today, it cannot be considered as
contributing to the NA;
d) Training and tutoring system to be endorsed if these needs are driven
from the future need assessments
e) Development of a sustainability plan and exit strategy.
In ref. to REC#7: Provide PITB with further capacity development CERD-PITB, High
findings Donors
a) Empower internal PITB resources and improve internal coordination to
54 to 57
involve existing staff. Although the evaluation team recognises that CERD-
PITB are understaffed, some of its staff were not fully involved in the TTCM
project. Instead, there was a high coordination with external experts and
consultants and not all PITB permanent staff had the opportunity to benefit
from an upscaling of their competencies.
Any new design will have to look into an actual targeted and customized
capacity development plan for CERD’s PITB permanent staff. In fact, this is
the main enabler if not the major success indicator for long term impact and
for the desired institutionalization of the process;
b) The feedback provision model is to be reviewed since it is not sufficient or
meaningful enough to send emails to “trainers or teachers” requesting their
feedback on a document or by responding to a survey without clarity on the
full process, what every specific milestone informs, their role in it and (most

learning and practice in public schools
importantly) the outcome of their feedback, and the adopted
decision/document and the next steps (in line with recommendation #3);
c) Communication (both internal and external) requires more attention as it
is an intrinsic part of creating clarity and receiving proper feedback as well as
creating a community of practitioners. Such a community is recognized as
key to teachers’ motivation, engagement, impact and high performance;
d) Stakeholders’ engagement. Trainers and teachers are to be actively
engaged in any revision process: revised needs analysis and assessment,
global process, quality control, revised assessment guidelines. Other
stakeholders equally including but not limited to other CERD departments,
students, experts;
e) Designing the whole project with six overloaded RCR (major team players)
from the system requires a more robust plan, resources, and a stakeholder
engagement strategy. RCR were involved in almost all the stages of the
TTCM, which is a double edge sword. One suggestion could be to support
staffing the sub-entities and providing technical assistance to the regional
centres.
