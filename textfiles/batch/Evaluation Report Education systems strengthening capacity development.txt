Executive Summary
Overview of the intervention, Purpose, Objectives and Scope of the Evaluation
1. The project ‘Systems building and capacity strengthening of the Ministry of Education (MoE) and its sub-national
Directorates of Education for effective delivery of quality education outcomes’ was implemented by UNICEF in
close collaboration with a linked UNESCO project, as well as with the Government of Iraq. The project targeted
teachers at governorate level, as well as education planners, statisticians, and other relevant staff in the MoE
at central and governorate levels. The indirect Rights Holders are the students and pupils visiting Iraqi schools,
including vulnerable school children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Teachers are secondary Rights Holders
in this context. The project had a budget of EUR 5,094,577.95 and was implemented over a period of 46 months,
from August 2019 to May 2023. The project was implemented in a subset of governorates and general
directorates, namely Baghdad (Rusafa 2 and 3, and Karkh 1 and 3), Najaf, Anbar, Basra, Thi-Qar, Missan,
Muthanna and Qadissiyah. It was focused on downstream project implementation and planning development,
and had three strategic objectives (SO):
• SO1: to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of education through roll-out of the Education
Management Information System (EMIS) and increase capacity of education planners, statisticians
and educators at governorate level: UNESCO (national level), UNICEF (governorate and school
levels).
• SO2: to strengthen the capacity of the MoE at the central and governorate level to improve
education services delivery: UNESCO (National Level), UNICEF (governorate level).
• SO3: to enhance the quality of teaching and learning by operationalising the capacity development
plan and developing teachers’ capacities at central and governorate levels: UNESCO (national
level), UNICEF (governorate and school levels).
2. The purpose of the evaluation is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the outcomes of UNICEF’s
activities to strengthen the education system in Iraq and to identify areas for improvement. The evaluation is
both formative and summative in nature and aims to generate insights that are useful for the design and
implementation of future initiatives on systems strengthening in education and in Iraq more particularly, as well
as to foster accountability for the performance of the intervention and the results achieved. The objectives of
the evaluation were i) to assess the achievement of results, their sustainability and how valuable the results
were to the intended targeted groups; ii) to understand how the design and implementation strategy could be
improved; iii) to examine how well the intervention has adapted to changing contexts and to other factors
influencing the achievement of the results, and how well the monitoring system of the intervention supported
adaptive management decisions; iv) to identify lessons learned and good practices useful to inform future
programming and policy decisions; and v) to provide actionable recommendations.
3. The evaluation’s scope at geographical level covers the project’s activities across all the target governorates
for the project1 and at temporal level covers the entire implementation period of the intervention, including
the 10 months of the no-cost extension that was granted in July 2022 with the total period being 46 months,
from August 2019 to May 2023.
4. The key users of this evaluation are the UNICEF Country Office, the Ministry of Education in Iraq at both the
centralised and decentralised levels, and the wider group of education stakeholders, including the Education
Sector Group in Iraq and the main donor, the Delegation of the European Union to Iraq.
Evaluation Methodology
5. This evaluation applied a theory-based approach rooted in contribution analysis of the causal linkages based
on the project’s Theory of Change (ToC), which was developed during the inception phase. The evaluation’s
approach drew on the principles of outcome harvesting, by gathering data about the targeted outcomes, then
working backwards and, guided by the results framework, determining the extent to which the interventions
contributed to changes (if any) and particularly any unintended/unplanned effects.
6. The Evaluation Team used a mixed-methods approach of data collection, including primary qualitative data
from Key Informant Interviews (KII) and Focus Group Discussions (FGD), secondary qualitative data from the
review of relevant documents as well as primary quantitative data from an online perception survey covering
1 Baghdad (Rusafa 2 and 3, and Karkh 1 and 3), Najaf, Anbar, Basra, Thi-Qar, Missan, Muthanna, and Qadisiya. Not all output
activities were implemented in all of these governorates alike (see table 3 for details).
7
key stakeholders of the intervention purposely sampled across three governorates. The evaluation utilised
appreciative inquiry for shaping its data collection tools, in order to help interviewees and FGD participants
uncover existing strengths and opportunities, as well as to explore challenges and issues in a constructive way.
The approach to data analysis incorporated a realist evaluation approach, as this approach is designed to
understand how and why interventions work in a given context. The evaluation design and tools received ethical
clearance from an Ethics Review Board, prior to the beginning of the data collection. Taken together, these
approaches helped to ensure the rigour of the data gathered, and thus the strength of the evaluation findings.
Key Conclusions on Findings
7. The project was overall successful at achieving results, particularly output-level results, and this in the face of
some significant challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This success has to be balanced against weaker
results related to achieving outcomes, due to the longer-than-the-project timeline for achieving them, as well
as due to underestimating organisational change, which is a key element for achieving the outcome-level
results. The project’s overall success is attributed to a partnership approach that worked well, particularly in
collaboration with UNESCO, though areas for improvement exist in engendering ownership and enhancing
stakeholder engagement, especially with the Ministry of Education and local Directorates of Education. The
project benefits however from the support of its stakeholders, which is an essential enabler for ultimately
achieving the outcome-level changes. The key challenge is how to capitalise on that stakeholder support and
commitment to build upon and consolidate movement towards project outcomes. These key themes are
elaborated in what follows.
Output-Level Results Achieved, Outcome-Level Results not (yet) achieved
8. The project was overall successful in achieving its targeted output-level results, despite significant challenges
related to the COVID-19 pandemic. A project design that was strongly in line with the needs of target groups
and with the context, plus an adequate monitoring mechanism for activity and output-level results, were
important factors that contributed to the strong achievement of output-level results. The key factor to this
success however was the partnership approach, which worked well.
9. While the project demonstrated success at the output level, uncertainties linger regarding outcome-level
results. Deep-rooted project design issues, including an extended timeline for outcome achievement and
delayed activity implementation, contribute to this uncertainty. The intricate nature of organisational change
processes within a large institution like the MoE adds further complexity. The usage of newly developed
capacities and planning tools also requires organisational-level change, including appropriate incentivisation
and ownership building measures in order to facilitate the move towards data-driven decision-making and
planning and thus the achievement of the outcome-level results. This is also relevant for SO3’s e-learning, not
including measures to amplify the capacity building beyond the core group of teachers trained, via
institutionalisation. A further observation is that the project’s SOs were relatively siloed from one another. This
reduced their ability to create synergistic change, which is particularly relevant given how an effective EMIS
system should support governorate-level planning guided by a GESP and stronger staff capacities. The overall
conclusion then is to call into question the project’s implicit assumption that individual-level capacity building
and the creation of sophisticated planning tools will on their own produce organisational-level change and
ultimately system-level change (in Iraq’s education system). It also underlines the need to manage the
expectations given the large changes aimed at, including with the donors and with implementing partners.
Strong Adaptive Management and Stakeholder Commitment
10. A key strength of the project lies in its efficient execution of output results, attributed to robust adaptive
management strategies and a high level of stakeholder commitment and coherence, particularly between
UNICEF and UNESCO. Effective coordination mechanisms facilitated collaboration, allowing timely adjustments
in timelines and resource sharing. However, this success has heightened expectations on the Ministry of
Education (MoE) for sustained progress. The project now stands at a critical juncture, where continued
engagement and follow-up with the MoE are imperative to capitalise on achieved successes and to ensure
sustained momentum.
Use of Theory of Change and Outcome Monitoring
11. The project’s Theory of Change did not fully grasp and address the complexity of the change process it was
aiming to achieve. This is reflected in some linkages and assumptions not being sufficiently clear or strong. A
more detailed ToC could have supported the movement from output- towards outcome-level results. This is
also reflected in the strong monitoring of results at the output level, but weaker monitoring at the outcome
level. Process indicators related to linkages between outputs and outcomes, stronger outcome-level
8
monitoring, as well as feedback loops would have informed analysis of what was working and what was not
working in the move towards outcomes. This could in turn have informed a stronger response to improving
those results through adaptive management approaches.
Highly Functional Partnership between UNICEF, UNESCO, and MoE
12. The project's success is attributed, in part, to a highly functional partnership between UNICEF, UNESCO, and the
Ministry of Education (MoE). Effective communication and coordination mechanisms, both between the
organisations as well as with some of the local-level stakeholders, fostered capable adaptive management
strategies and skilfully navigated implementation opportunities and challenges. However, while strong
horizontal connections between UNICEF, UNESCO, and the MoE were evident, weaker vertical feedback loops
hindered quick communication of challenges up the line from local-level stakeholders from Directorates of
Education (DoE) to the upper management level. This potentially contributed to delayed decision-making, thus
impeding the achievement of the targeted outcomes.
Ownership Can Be Increased
13. The evaluation revealed a need for enhanced stakeholder ownership, particularly within the MoE. Insufficiently
specific tasks assigned to the MoE diminished its ownership of the project, which underlines the importance of
substantive engagement and clear roles. Strong ownership, coupled with the adoption of capacity building
measures on EMIS within the MoE, could strengthen the project's sustainability. Hence, the need for continued
engagement and follow-up with the MoE, in order to build on existing successes and ensure sustained
commitment.
Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Measures lacking
14. The context in Iraq is particularly prone to climate-related fragilities, with potential impacts on education for
example through population movements but also by virtue of the need to increase young peoples’ awareness
and to encourage their informed efforts to help combat it. Climate change mitigation and adaptation measures
were not foreseen in the design of the project which is a significant weakness of the project given the context
of Iraq and given the conceptual room to integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation measures in the
design of the project.
Integration of gender/JfWMGB Principles across the Project
15. The integration of gender principles across the project varied, with explicit attention given to SO2 and more
implicit considerations in SO1. Despite gender-disaggregated data inclusion and analysis, there was a lack of a
differentiated approach in terms of programming for boys, girls, men, or women. The monitoring system did
not thoroughly address gender/JbWMBG issues, with gaps in articulating how gender would be prioritised and
implemented across project components. While there is potential for gender considerations in the EMIS
system’s future use, explicit strategies were absent.
Lessons Learned
Partnerships
16. The evaluation underscores the pivotal role of strong partnerships in achieving robust project results. A
successful partnership involves aligning roles with organisational strengths, establishing clear communication
and feedback loops, and fostering long-term ownership. The project’s success, particularly in navigating
challenges and tight timelines, highlights the importance of assessing partners’ strengths, reputation, and their
ability to bring stakeholders onboard. The lesson learned is to conduct a thorough evaluation of partners’
capacities and reputations in the national/sub-national context, facilitating the achievement of project results
and ensuring successful collaboration.
Project Design and Implementation
17. A critical lesson emerges regarding the significance of a well-constructed project design rooted in a realistic
Theory of Change (ToC). While individual-level capacity building and planning tools are vital, they alone do not
guarantee organisational or system-level change. Collaborative efforts at the concept note and proposal stage
are crucial, in order to ensure a strong and realistic ToC. This collaborative process helps articulate assumptions,
appraise mechanisms realistically, and foster commitment from higher management. The lesson emphasises
the importance of using the ToC to inform implementation and to adapt the project as needed, leading to
realistic and achievable outcome-level results.
Gender, Equity, Human Rights, and Climate Change
18. The project highlights challenges in incorporating gender equity, human rights, and climate change elements
due to a weak understanding of their integration. Mainstreaming these elements across all project components
is crucial, yet the evaluation reveals a tendency for them to be somewhat lost in the approach or only
9
superficially integrated. Proactively addressing this weakness at the design and implementation stages is
essential. The lesson learned is the importance of specifically reviewing and prioritising gender equity, human
rights, and climate change elements throughout project development and implementation, leveraging expertise
from UNICEF’s specialists.
Project Monitoring
19. The evaluation identifies the importance of robust monitoring at both the output and outcome levels, coupled
with effective feedback mechanisms. Weaknesses in outcome-level monitoring data and linkages between
outputs and outcomes were observed. The lesson here is that strong outcome-level monitoring and feedback
loops are crucial for adjusting the project’s approach and facilitating progress towards outcomes. This includes
monitoring organisational change-related outcomes using appropriate indicators, especially in contexts where
adjustments to the project are likely to be required. Without such mechanisms, the chances of achieving
outcomes are diminished, particularly in fragile or conflict-affected contexts.
Key Recommendations
Recommendation 1: Maintain and Expand Work on Focus Areas of the Project
20. UNICEF and its partners should plan for and implement further work on the focus areas of the project, to build
upon its promising yet incomplete results. This should be done in the near-term, especially as the project’s
achievements will weaken/become progressively more outdated over time.
Recommendation 2: Revise and Fine-tune Theory of Change and Project Design at Large
21. To address challenges in design and implementation, UNICEF and its partners should revise and update the
project’s Theory of Change (ToC). This includes building the capacity and will to use new tools, plans, and
capacities for organisational capacity building, system strengthening, and fostering ownership by engaging the
MoE actively. Recommendations further emphasise involving the MoE in project design, ensuring widespread
coverage of the EMIS system, creating stronger linkages between project components, and enhancing
monitoring at output and outcome levels.
Recommendation 3: Strengthening the Project’s Partnership Approach
22. The partnership between UNICEF, UNESCO and the MoE has been a key strength of this project, incorporating
strong linkages between upstream and downstream components and capitalising on many of the institutional
strengths of each partner. Furthermore, this partnership approach is in line with institutional commitments
made in the UN Cooperation Framework for Iraq. The approach should thus be continued for future work
projects.
Recommendation 4: Maintain Sensitivity to Shifting Needs of Target Populations in a Volatile Environment
23. UNICEF is advised to ensure the appropriateness of all components in future projects based on needs analysis
and project proposals. While acknowledging that the thematic focus of this project’s SO3 on e-learning was
influenced by the COVID-19 crisis, the project should conduct regular needs assessments to inform decisions.
This includes responding to shock events, while mitigating negative impacts on the project’s longer-term
objectives.
Recommendation 5: Include Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Measures
24. Future project iterations should integrate robust climate change mitigation and adaptation measures,
particularly in education-related projects. The vulnerability of Iraq to climate-related challenges underscores
the importance of embedding such measures into policy and learning. Recommendations emphasise
mainstreaming climate change components into GESPs, the EMIS system, and capacity-building measures for
key stakeholders. This involves adhering to UNICEF’s institutional commitments related to climate change and
incorporating appropriate measures into project design despite the challenging local context.

1. Introduction
25. This final report presents the findings, conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations resulting from the
evaluation of the intervention ‘Systems building and capacity strengthening of the Ministry of Education and its
sub-national Directorates of Education for effective delivery of quality education outcomes’, also referred to as
the ‘EU-funded intervention on education systems strengthening’. This is also called ‘the project’ in the rest of
the report.
26. This evaluation report provides an overview of the context and background of the intervention in Iraq, as well
as its objectives. It also shines a light on the purpose, objectives and scope of this evaluation. Moreover, the
evaluation framework is presented, as well as the evaluation approach and methodology. Finally, the report
outlines findings, conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations. These are aimed at informing relevant
key stakeholders and decision-makers about the performance of the intervention. A further aim is to generate
insights and support learning about possible future initiatives on strengthening Iraq’s public education system
for effective delivery of quality education outcomes.
1.1. Context and Background
27. The education system in Iraq was considered one of the best in the Middle East up until the early 1990s, with
strengths including a strong track record on combating illiteracy. However, the country has experienced a series
of conflicts since then, including the first Gulf War in 1991, the Iraq War from 2003 to 2011, and the fight against
the insurgency of the ‘Islamic State’ from 2014 until 2021.
28. These various conflicts caused significant numbers of deaths and widespread suffering, destruction of
infrastructure, large flows of internally displaced persons (IDPs) – compounded by hundreds of thousands of
refugees from the civil war in neighbouring Syria – as well as very significant economic disruption. The resulting
impacts upon the education system in Iraq have been significant: a drastic decrease in operating schools, a lack
of qualified teachers, and an overall lack of appropriate investments and financing for the system. Indeed,
government expenditures on education declined from just over 5 per cent of GDP in 2009 to only 3.9 per cent
ten years later.2
29. This situation has had a strong impact on the country’s student population. Evidence of this is the several million
students who have been out of school for often long periods of time, as well as the large number of damaged
schools and the need for multiple shifts in many schools. There has also been a significant decline in learning
levels in the country, varying school completion rates between girls and boys (with 5 per cent more boys than
girls completing primary school versus 6 per cent more girls than boys completing upper secondary school),
declining pass rates in national leaving exams between 2009 and 2017, and clear evidence of weak reading skills
as well as low maths and science levels. Moreover, these various impacts have been compounded by the effects
of population growth as well as by the long school closures and economic disruptions linked to the COVID-19
pandemic: according to UNOCHA, school closures in Iraq were some of the longest in the world, lasting up to
63 weeks and affected some 11 million children.3
30. The impacts have also been significant in terms of further entrenching vulnerabilities, especially in the poorest
population quintiles of the project Rights Holders (primary-school-age children from the poorest quintile are
significantly more likely to be out of school than children in the richest quintile); and, girls in rural areas (only
80 per cent of girls aged 6 to 10 are in school, as compared to 90 per cent of rural boys). Furthermore, school
closures related to COVID-19 aggravated the situation of vulnerable children and especially girls.4 Likewise, the
IDPs in the country were also impacted by the many schools damaged due to the conflict (the number of IDPs
remained over a million in 20235), while children with disabilities were disproportionately impacted by the
overall deterioration of the education system and were more likely to be out-of-school.6 Importantly, it is

presumed that intersecting identities exacerbate these exclusions and vulnerabilities (e.g. being a girl with a
disability from a rural area).7
31. In response to this situation, the Government of Iraq has prioritised improving the education system. Areas of
focus from the 2011-2020 National Education Strategy include raising the quality of education in the country,
by better supporting schools and teachers and by enhancing the professional development for teachers. The
National Development Plan 2018-2022 included a focus on improving enrolment rates; building thousands more
schools and renovating thousands of damaged schools; improving the quality of teaching such as by building
teacher capacities and modernising curriculums; and improving the management of education information as
well as the capacities of education administrators. These various efforts are within a larger context, where the
country is transitioning from being a conflict- and post-conflict state to a more stable and development-oriented
one, and thus where work localised around the triple nexus of humanitarian-development-peace is ever more
important.8
1.2. UNICEF in Iraq
32. UNICEF has been working in Iraq since the mid-1980s, focused on humanitarian needs and emergency response
from the early 1990s to the late 2000s, including in the area of education. Beginning in 2009, the agency shifted
its response to focus on working with the government to develop child-friendly social policies, modernise its
institutions, and improve the nationwide delivery of basic services critical to the future survival and
development of children. From 2019, UNICEF’s agenda was focused on supporting the Government of Iraq to
achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, which is to ensure an inclusive and equitable, accessible,
quality education and lifelong learning for all. The Government of Iraq emphasised these goals in its Second
National Voluntary Review Report on the Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (p. 62).9 This was
to be done by: supporting the strengthening of the education systems in policy development, coordination,
planning, budgeting and monitoring; supporting the generation of new strategic data for evidence-based
advocacy; and, supporting the strengthening of systems and policy development including to decentralise
education management, as well as the integration of life skills into the education system. UNICEF was also
advocating for equitable and efficient allocation as well as use of resources to ensure equitable school access
and to enhance quality education for children and particularly for girls.10
33. UNICEF’s vision in Iraq is that “by 2024, children, adolescents and women in Iraq are better protected and have
more equitable and inclusive access to quality basic services.”11 The outcome statement on education is that “…
by 2024 children and adolescents, especially the most vulnerable, benefit from equitable access to quality and
inclusive education.”12 There are multiple specific areas of focus for UNICEF, including strengthening the
capacity of the Ministry of Education to effectively plan, budget, implement and monitor equitable delivery of

quality education services, especially at governorate levels. Other areas of focus are curriculum revision, teacher
development and training, and ensuring inclusion of the most vulnerable children. Additionally, drawing on the
Country Programme Document’s underlying Education Programme Strategy Note 2020-2024, the areas of focus
are: (i) systems strengthening, (ii) access to basic education,13 and (iii) quality learning.14 All three outputs
contribute to the education outcome on equitable access for all children and adolescents to quality and inclusive
education. Furthermore, gender/JbWMGB is mainstreamed throughout the programme, with a particular focus
on addressing gender-based violence. With the project that is the focus of this evaluation (see section 2), UNICEF
aims to support the Government of Iraq in implementing this vision, as well as by continuing to work with other
partners including UN agencies. This is part of a larger cooperative effort to address factors that hinder Iraq’s
broader progress towards sustainable development under the United Nations Sustainable Development
Cooperation Framework IRAQ (UNSDCF).15
1.3. Teacher Training, EMIS systems and Governorate-Level Education Sector Plans (GESPs)
Teacher Training
34. A quality curriculum and effective instruction are key elements to ensure successful teaching and learning in
schools. The main drivers of successful teaching and learning are teachers. Hence, quality teachers who can
perform their responsibilities with commitment are prerequisites for successful and excellent education.16 This
underlines that continuous learning and development among teachers is a necessity, and by extension that
teachers who stop learning after their pre-service training will fail to fulfil their roles effectively. In turn this will
lead to children not learning effectively. Importantly, teachers must remain reflective and continue to innovate
in their teaching, based on evolving understanding of best practices and new developments. The alternative –
of annually repeating the same experience, approach, knowledge and skills garnered and practised at the
beginning of their careers without reflection and innovating – will produce weaker results for students. So
teachers must adjust their teaching practices to ensure that they can produce students who are creative, critical
and innovative, and thus able to meet the demands of the day.17
35. Teacher capacity development is especially vital in countries like Iraq, where instability and conflict have
fragilised the education system in many different ways. Since 2013, there have been strong efforts to promote
teacher capacity development and inclusive education in Iraq. One method of striving towards inclusivity has
been to enhance teachers’ knowledge, skills and attitudes.18 To facilitate this, the Ministry of Higher Education
(MoHE) has promoted the nationwide development of pedagogical training and academic development centres
for teaching staff, in order to learn about innovative, competence- and student-centred teaching and learning
processes. The project intends to build on these initiatives and those of other development partners, by
enhancing teacher capacity to teach effectively.
EMIS Systems
36. Education Management Information System (EMIS) can be defined as all the operational systems and processes,
increasingly supported by digital technology, that enable the collection, aggregation, analysis, and use of data
13 SDG 4) Target 4.1: “By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary
education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes.”
14 SDG 4) Target 4.c: “By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international
cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing
States.”

and information in education, including for management and administration, planning, policy formulation, and
monitoring and evaluation (M&E). This definition insists on the systemic nature of EMIS – a fact that is often
overlooked in efforts to reinforce government information systems.19
37. A comprehensive EMIS is defined as not only including administrative and graduates’ destination data. This
information should be available both at the individual and aggregate level and it should be used for policy-
analysis and formulation, planning, monitoring and management at all levels of an education system.20 “It is a
system of people, technology, models, methods, processes, procedures, rules and regulations that function
together to provide education leaders, decision-makers and managers at all levels with a comprehensive,
integrated set of relevant, reliable, unambiguous and timely data and information to support them in
completion of their responsibilities.”21
38. Under Specific Objective 1 of the project (see section 2.3), UNICEF, in partnership with UNESCO and with funding
support from the EU, has been working to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of education through the
development and roll-out of the EMIS, and to increase the capacity of education planners, statisticians and
educators at central and governorate levels.22 The establishment of an effective EMIS will be a key step to
addressing planning and management inefficiencies in the sector; it will also help evidence-based decision-
making at school, directorate and national levels. Data and reports derived from the EMIS should also support
Governorate-level Education Sector Plans (GESPs) and facilitate other planning and administrative needs at the
sub-national and national levels.
Governorate-Level Education Sector Plans (GESPs)
39. Planning is part of a hierarchy that ultimately
determines how an education system functions. A typical
hierarchy of the relationships between different education
planning concepts and directives is shown in the figure to the
left.23 An Education Sector Plan is a tool to effectively describe
the inputs, processes and resulting outputs, outcomes and
impacts for the education system as a whole. Sector Plans
assist Ministries of Education and involve stakeholders in
prioritising and planning the progressive implementation of
legislative mandates, policies and programmes in the sector.
Strategic Plans are important for effective management –
including planning, budgeting, implementation, reporting,
monitoring and evaluation. Plans should indicate the likely
sequencing of implementation in the period ahead. This is
Figure 1: The hierarchy of relationships between planning
important for guiding implementation and assessing
concepts
progress.24
A Governorate-level Education Sector Plan (GESP) should
include the activities for education development within each governorate. It should also include activities of
development partners and non-government providers, so as to provide a whole-of-sector ‘story’. The GESP
should align with Iraq’s National Education Sector Plan and the National Education Strategy 2020-2030, which
is being supported through UNICEF, World Bank, UNESCO and the International Institute for Educational
Planning (IIEP). Ideally, the Strategic Plan should not simply represent the forward work plan of the Ministry of
Education, but also account for the roles of other actors in the sector. GESPs enable three to eight-year plans
for governorates: they can also have a major impact on planning in environments where resource allocation
and support to schools is the responsibility of governorates.

40. Education Sector Planning at national and decentralised levels is a new area for the Iraqi Ministry of Education.
So there are considerable capacity and organisational development needs to consider, such as the formation of
Governorate Education Sector Coordination mechanisms/Groups (GESCGs). GESPs should ideally be supported
by annual work plans for implementation and monitoring of progress towards planned results. UNICEF has
supported the generation of first-generation GESPs for 11 Governorates and the General Directorates of
Education (GDoE). The GESPs are required to provide support to plan, implement and coordinate for an entire
annual planning and monitoring cycle, in line with the national plans. GESPs should also be supported by robust
monitoring and review mechanisms to support their implementation, including joint sector reviews in
collaboration with education partners and donors at national and decentralised levels. The development of
EMIS should run concurrently with development and monitoring of GESPs, in order to enable plans to be
informed by and monitored using robust empirical data.
2. Object of the Evaluation
2.1. Description of the Intervention
41. The project ‘Systems building and capacity strengthening of the Ministry of Education and its sub-national
Directorates of Education for effective delivery of quality education outcomes’ was implemented by UNICEF in
close collaboration with a linked UNESCO project, as well as with the Government of Iraq. The project targeted
teachers at governorate level, as well as education planners, statisticians and other relevant staff in the MoE at
central and governorate level. The indirect Rights Holders are the students and pupils visiting Iraqi schools,
including vulnerable school children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Teachers are secondary Rights Holders
in this context. The UNICEF project had a budget of EUR 5,094,577.95, consisting of direct costs of EUR
4,754,710.06 and indirect costs of EUR 339,867.90. It was implemented over a period of 46 months, from August
2019 to May 2023, which included a 10-month no-cost extension that was submitted in May 2022 and granted
in July 2022. The project was implemented in a subset of governorates and general directorates, namely
Baghdad (Rusafa 2 and 3, and Karkh 1 and 3), Najaf, Anbar, Basra, Thi-Qar, Missan, Muthanna and Qadissiyah
(see maps in Annex 10). It was focused on downstream project implementation and planning development, and
had three main specific objectives, outcomes as well as linked outputs (see table below):

42. In the following section, the Theory of Change for the project is reconstructed. Then the three specific objectives
are described in further detail – including their rationale, intended Rights Holders, implementation status and
locations, as well as their key stakeholders. Regarding their implementation status, what is presented is based
on the monitoring data and should not be seen as an evaluative statement.
2.2. The Specific Objectives in more detail
43. While the rationale for the project is linked to the context outlined in section 1 of this report as well as UNICEF’s
organisational priority areas of work, there are also more specific, objective-level rationales. These are detailed
below along with descriptions of each of the Specific Objectives (SOs), their intended Rights Holders, their
implementation status, their implementation locations, and their key stakeholders. The formal logical
framework of the project is also contained in Annex 2. The project’s financial information is examined in the
sub-section ‘Overview of Project Financial Information’ below, in this section of the report.
Specific Objective 1: Functional Education Management Information System (EMIS) established and rolled out
44. The rationale for Specific Objective 1 is linked to the Ministry of Education’s historical reliance on decentralised
systems that held summary information about schools, with school data about facilities, academic and
administrative staff counts as well as student counts being paper-based and collected annually. That data were
aggregated and sent to the Directorates of Education at governorate level for data entry, and then sent on to
the MoE for consolidation into one database, and subject to analysis and reporting. These systems meant a
reduced degree of accuracy of forecasts for staffing schools, providing adequate facilities, and preparing school
materials, supplies, and books. The systems were also insufficiently responsive to the dynamic and changeable
environment in the country, and were not able to account for all children. Specific Objective 1 then is part of an
effort to ensure more timely data through the provision of a robust, modern, and efficient information
management system supporting harmonised and timely collection, processing and dissemination of data.
16
Description of Specific Objective 1
45. This specific outcome involved providing EMIS training for school personnel as well as for instructors and staff
at Illiteracy Elimination Centres (IECs) and monitoring training of data entry users, with UNESCO’s upstream
work involving procuring equipment and services,
developing training programmes and training master
trainers, as well as undertaking capacity building of
key MoE personnel responsible for maintaining and
updating the EMIS programme. The MoE also played
a more managerial role, including ensuring leadership
and ownership of the EMIS solutions, assigning
responsibilities, ensuring timeliness, developing
supporting policies and guidance, identifying school-
level end-users for training, as well as maintaining the
EMIS platform.
Intended Rights Holders of Specific Objective 1
46. The direct intended Rights Holders of this objective
are staff in the targeted governorates, including
teachers and administrative staff who are able to use
the EMIS system. The specific numbers of Rights
Holders targeted and reached, as well as their
geographical locations, are detailed in the table in
Annex 3. The ultimate (indirect) Rights Holders are

specific objective’s work.
Key Stakeholders and their contributions for this
specific objective
47. Table 2 (below) outlines the key stakeholders for the specific objective, including the implementing agencies,
development partners, duty bearers and Rights Holders. A brief outline of each stakeholder’s contributions is
also incorporated into the table, with the detailed outline of this role contained in the earlier sub-section
‘Description of Specific Objective 1’.
Specific Objective 2: Developing Education Capacity Development Plans at National and Governorate Levels
48. The rationale for Specific Objective 2 was linked to
Figure 3: Geographic Scope at Governorate level of SO2
the Iraqi education system’s lack of capacity to effectively
activity ‘Development of Capacity Development
Implementation Plans’ (highlighted in blue) deliver quality education programmes responding to needs.
This capacity gap was linked to the lack of a systematic
approach to evidence-based policy-making and to a
capacity deficit among the education system staff at
multiple levels. The Government of Iraq therefore asked for
support in the development of a new education strategy,
and it was determined that this plan’s strategic priorities
should be linked to assessments of capacities, so that there
would be sufficient necessary capacities to implement the
plan. Furthermore, the government has prioritised
decentralisation of service delivery in the education sector,
with DoEs at governorate level responsible for overseeing
the implementation of education policies and plans, the
management of human resources, supervision of schools,
and the management of educational infrastructure, etc.
through their own planning departments. Those planning
departments are supposed to coordinate the development
and implementation of education plans, in consultation
with the Ministry of Education. Yet capacities at the
17
governorate levels were found to be weak and needed strengthening, and it was found that Governorate-level
Education Sector Plans (GESPs) were required. Specific Objective 2 is therefore part of an effort to strengthen
the human capacity of MoE at central and governorate levels, in order to improve education services delivery.
Description of Specific Objective 2
49. This specific outcome involved supporting the development of GESPs, as well as capacity development and
implementation plans. It also involved working collaboratively with UNESCO and MoE to ensure alignment
between the national education strategy and GESPs, and between national and governorate capacity
development plans. UNESCO’s upstream work involved supporting the development of the national capacity
development and implementation plan, as well as undertaking the collaborative work just described. The MoE
had to focus on leadership and ownership of the process
Figure 4: Geographic Scope at Governorate level of SO2
to develop national capacity development and
activity ‘Development of GESPs and capacity
development plans’ (highlighted in blue) implementation plans. This involved supporting the
processes for developing governorate-level sector plans
and capacity development and implementation plans,
identifying all relevant stakeholders to participate in the
processes, and disseminating the capacity development
plans to all relevant stakeholders.
Intended Rights Holders of Specific Objective 2
50. The direct intended Rights Holders of this objective
are MoE staff at central and governorate levels targeted by
the capacity building efforts.25 These staff will eventually
use the GESPs, with UNICEF’s contribution concentrated
on key actors at the governorate level as well as support
for harmonisation with the work done by the two other
project partners (UNESCO and MoE). The specific numbers
of Rights Holders targeted and reached, as well as their
geographical locations, are detailed in the table in Annex
3. The ultimate (indirect) Rights Holders are the children
who will eventually benefit from the specific objective’s
work.
Specific Objective 3: Enhancing teachers’ capacities in service delivery at central and governorate levels
51. The rationale for Specific Objective 3 was linked to a determination that teachers needed capacity building in
order to improve learning outcomes, specifically related to training on child-centred methodologies, activity-
based learning, positive discipline, psychosocial support, etc. Relatedly, it was determined that there was a need
for coherent and coordinated teacher training plans to be designed and implemented at both national and
General Directorate levels, including for the development and piloting of new training courses and delivery
mechanisms that could help to bridge immediate skills and knowledge gaps. Specific Objective 3 is therefore
part of an effort to enhance the quality of teaching and learning, by developing teachers’ capacities.
25 The information team could not identify reliable data on the exact number of MoE staff or their predominant gender, due
to the administrative nature of SO2’s intervention.
18
Description of Specific Objective 3
52. This specific objective involved rolling out a pilot training programme to selected teachers in Baghdad (Rusafa
3), Basra, Qadissiya, and Thi-Qar, with UNESCO’s upstream work involving support for the design of the pilot
training course, development of materials, and training of master trainers. The MoE was in turn tasked with
designing the pilot training course and identifying participants for the master training, as well as supporting the
roll-out of the training at the governorate level. It should be underlined that the training programme was
Figure 5: Geographic Scope of Implementation of SO3 by focused on e-learning – a choice taken within the context
Governorate of COVID-19 and related limitations on movements – and
not the broader set of capacity building measures
identified in the rationale paragraph above. This fact is
commented on in the findings of the evaluation report.
Intended Rights Holders of Specific Objective 3
53. The direct intended Rights Holders of this objective
are the teachers and master trainers whose capacities were
to be built as part of the specific objective, with UNICEF’s
contribution concentrated at the governorate level and in
supporting harmonisation with the work of UNESCO and
the MoE. The specific numbers of Rights Holders targeted
and reached, as well as their geographical locations, are
detailed in the table in Annex 3. The ultimate (indirect)
Rights Holders are the children who will eventually benefit
from the specific objective’s work.
Table 2 (below) outlines the key stakeholders for the
specific objective, including the implementing agencies,
development partners, duty bearers and Rights Holders. A
brief outline of each stakeholder’s contributions is also
incorporated into the table, with the detailed outline of this role included in the earlier sub-section ‘Description
of Specific Objective 3’.
2.3. Key Stakeholders
54. This section outlines the mapping of the range of stakeholders involved for the whole intervention, across its
entire implementation period.
55. There is a range of stakeholders to consider, including: the EU as the funder; UNICEF, UNESCO and the MoE as
project implementers/partners; service contractors (Developers of EMIS and of the GESPs); DoEs in targeted
governorates (Basra, Qaddissiya, Thi-Qar, Missan, Muthanna, Anbar, Najaf, and Baghdad); provincial and local
government institutions; teachers; and, Rights Holders. The stakeholders include multiple duty bearers (the UN
agencies as well as the Government of Iraq and its representatives, primarily at the local level) and Rights
Holders being the students in Iraq as well as their teachers as secondary Rights Holders.
56. As will be detailed in later sections of this report – see the evaluation matrix (section 6) as well as section 7
(evaluation approach and methodology) – data collection for the evaluation, including for gender/JbWMGB as
a cross-cutting area of analysis, focused on all the key stakeholders with the exception of students. The rationale
for not targeting students is included in section 6, sub-section ‘Brief evaluability assessment’.

2.4. Overview of Project Financial Information
57. The initial proposed budget for the 36-month UNICEF project was EUR 4,613,639.91, of which EUR 4,250,000.00
was sought from the EU, with UNICEF to contribute EUR 363,639.91.26 The EU agreed to this proposal and
proposed budget, and so the final proposed project budget was: EUR 4,613,639.91. A 10-month, no-cost
extension was granted in July 2022, bringing the total time of the project to 46 months. Co-financing by Germany
and Global-Education Thematic provided an additional EUR 963,820.92, consisting of direct costs of EUR
894,189.47 and indirect costs of EUR 69,631.45.
2.5. Theory of Change
58. The project’s Theory of Change (ToC) (see Figure 2 below) was developed on the basis of the short TC included
in the evaluation’s Terms of Reference – which was insufficiently detailed to guide a theory-based evaluation.
So the ToC was further developed in the inception phase by the Evaluation Team – as well as the project design27
and preliminary discussions with key stakeholders during the inception phase. This ToC was validated during
the inception phase by the Evaluation Steering Committee as part of the inception report. The ToC reflects the
objectives and modalities of the project, and has been used as a framework to help visualise relationships
between the different contributions towards its desired outcomes. A more detailed description of the project’s
ToC is included in Annex 9, and a graphic representation of it are included in Figure 2 below.
59. The Project Results framework aligns with the ToC and provides a basis for monitoring progress towards
outcomes. The results framework gives a thematic breakdown of outputs and outcome areas; it also details the
baselines, targets and means of verification (MoV) for each output. The overall objective of the project is to
provide improved learning outcomes as well as equitable and inclusive education for all girls and boys in Iraq
(see the detailed Outcomes described in Table 1 above). The ToC highlights the main activities required to
achieve each outcome. The ToC lists the causal assumptions, which present the underlying logic to bring about
the changes in the ToC. If these assumptions are not realised, they may have an impact on the project’s
performance. However, unlike external assumptions, causal assumptions can be changed by the project
management, e.g. based on the results of monitoring and evaluations. An example of a causal assumption is
that ‘National government and governorates are willing to take on increased responsibilities and leadership’. If
they cease to show commitment, then the project management can review the situation and adjust the
approach, e.g. through capacity building, to ensure commitment is strengthened. The external assumptions can
be decisive for the project performance, if they are not realised. They present a given critical context that must
be fulfilled, if the project is to take place as planned. An example of an external assumption is ‘Continued ability
to be able to operate within the regions selected’. The key external assumptions for the project logic are shown
in the ToC, and they may be determined on the basis of the project modalities and funding.
60. Gender equality/JbWMGB, disability and social inclusion (GEDSI) is mainstreamed through all activities,
inputs and approaches for the project. Moreover, a gender/JbWMGB lens is applied to all outputs and
outcomes, including development of the EMIS and of EMIS reports, planning documents, training, and
participation in all capacity building activities. A particular focus is applied to gender-based violence,
commitments to sustainable development, as well as gender equality/JbWMGB and disability rights.
61. The barriers, challenges and constraints are highlighted in the ToC. They are colour coded to match the outputs
and outcome they most align with. Some are coloured white, indicating that they are general barriers,
challenges and constraints affecting the whole project. Not shown in the ToC but also likely to be significant
risks are: climate & disaster vulnerability, including epidemics and pandemics other than Covid-19 that risk
disrupting the development pathways. An example is the 2017 earthquake of 7.3 magnitude, which occurred
32 km from Ḩalabjah, Iraq.28

62. In the move from outputs to outcomes, the ToC shows strong synergistic causal linkages. The key assumption
underlying those linkages is that capacity building and improved information – including plans and the EMIS (at
the output level) – will lead to improved capacities and the deployment of those improved capacities in stronger
decision-making and teaching informed by better data (at the outcome level). Similarly, the linkages between
the outcomes and overall objective are strong, with the key assumption being that the outputs and outcomes
lead to national-level change for all girls and boys in Iraq. This implies a strong and sustainable roll-out of the
project activities nationally and the addressing of any inequities or exclusions, e.g. for particular target groups
or geographical regions. Finally, the project is linked to one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).29
63. SDG 4 – Quality Education. The project’s three SOs are linked to SDG 4, with SO3 most directly linked by virtue
of focusing on strengthening the quality of teaching and learning, which is in line with the target of substantially
increasing the supply of qualified teachers (target 4.c). SOs 1 and 2 are also linked by virtue of strengthening
data and planning related to the education system: so they ultimately support multiple targets, including that
all girls and boys enjoy complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education (target 4.1); and,
eliminating gender disparities/JbWMGB in education and ensuring equal access to all levels of education and
vocational training for the vulnerable (target 4.5). However, due to the intermediate nature of the three SOs’
interventions, this evaluation could not realistically assess the impact of the project on the relevant indicators
of SDG 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.5.1 and 4.c.1.30
64. Lastly, it is worth noting the degree to which the project conforms with the United Nations (UN) convention on
the rights of the Child.31 The project upholds the general tenets that everyone is entitled to all the rights and
freedoms, “without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status” (Article 2). This tenet is upheld through the
capacity development in all SOs, as is Article 28 concerning the right of a child to education and Article 29
concerning child development. SO1 has considered Article 8, in which “States Parties undertake to respect the
right of the child to preserve his or her identity, including nationality, name and family relations as recognized
by law without unlawful interference,” through protection of data privacy. S03, in the development of e-learning
materials, has considered Article 13, in which the child shall have the right to freedom of expression, Article 17
concerning access to information and material from diverse national and international sources, and to a lesser
extent Article 23 concerning self-reliance for CWD, by being able to access learning materials at home.
29 Besides SDG 4, the project also had a minor indirect linkage with SDG 13 (Take urgent action to combat climate change and
its impacts; target 13.3, indicator 13.3.1.(c)). The project did not directly plan to integrate SDG13 in its intervention
design, hence, the project’s performance in this regard is addressed in Finding 15.

2.6. Gender Analysis
65. The project proposal positions gender equality/JbWMGB and empowerment as a cross-cutting issue in the
project, alongside other cross-cutting issues (environmental considerations; human rights; conflict sensitivity).
As per the Government of Iraq’s request, gender is referred to as ‘Justice between women and men, girls and
boys (JbWMGB)’.32 From the evaluation’s perspective, there has been inclusion of evaluation questions focusing
specifically on gender (EQ 15) as well as on GEDSI (Gender Equality, Disability, and Social Inclusion) across
evaluation questions as appropriate. Furthermore, gender has been included in the Theory of Change as a cross-
cutting issue that is in line with the theory-based approach to the evaluation, and has guided the Evaluation
Team’s work. Evaluation data were gathered in a manner that prioritised understanding if/how/to what extent
gender was incorporated into the project, including via direct questions and by ensuring disaggregated data
gathering (male and female FGDs; disaggregation of survey respondents by gender) and analysis. Overall, the
evaluation was guided by the principles of UN-SWAP in its approach to analysing gender.33
3. Evaluation purpose, objectives and scope34
3.1. Purpose
66. This final evaluation will serve an accountability and learning function, and this evaluation has both a formative
and a summative component:
• Formative: it aims to generate insights and learning that can inform the design and implementation of
UNICEF’s future initiatives aimed at strengthening the public education system for effective delivery of quality
education outcomes, relevant to the education context in Iraq and the UNICEF approach on systems
strengthening in education.
• Summative: it aims to hold UNICEF accountable for the performance of the intervention and the results
achieved in terms of systems strengthening for effective delivery of quality education outcomes.
67. The evaluation is intended to be used by key users as follows:
• For UNICEF, the evaluation helps to strengthen understanding of the contributions of systems strengthening
to quality education outcomes, and will inform its programme strategy on education in the next Country
Programme for Iraq. It will also inform its work to support the design and implementation strategy of its
system strengthening interventions, as well as to support advocacy on system strengthening for quality
education outcomes.
• For the Ministry of Education in Iraq, the evaluation helps to strengthen understanding of the contribution
of systems strengthening to the effective delivery of quality education outcomes, and to suggest priorities for
future action.
• For the Delegation of the EU to Iraq, the evaluation helps to provide insights on the performance of the
intervention and thus to inform assessment of the EU support to quality education outcomes through
education systems strengthening in the country.
• For the Education Sector Group in Iraq and the wider group of education stakeholders, the evaluation helps
to improve understanding of how outcome-level change happens and to inform adaptation of mental
models/narratives on how to achieve better quality education outcomes through a systems strengthening
approach.
32 In this report, the acronym JbWMGB (Justice between Women Men Girls and Boys) is therefore systematcially used
together with Gender.

68. Overall, the purpose of this evaluation is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the outcomes of
UNICEF’s activities to strengthen the education system in Iraq, as well as to identify areas for improvement to
better serve the needs of students and educators and the governing bodies of Iraq’s education system.
3.2. Objectives
69. There are five objectives for the evaluation based on the ToR, many of which can be linked to specific evaluation
criteria and are thus incorporated into the evaluation matrix (see Section 9 of this report). The five objectives
are:
• Assess to what extent output and outcome-level results have been achieved, how well achievements are
expected to last, how valuable outcome and output-level results were to the intended targeted groups and
to what extent unintended results have been produced (positive and negative).
• Understand how the design and implementation strategy could be improved, by examining what worked well
and what did not work well in the intervention’s design and in its actual implementation strategy – especially
on the linkages between the output and outcome-level results and the linkages with the other implementing
actors including UNESCO.
• Examine how well the intervention has adapted to changing contexts and to other factors influencing the
achievement of the outcome-level results, and how well the monitoring system of the intervention supported
adaptive management decisions.
• Identify lessons learned and good practices useful to inform future programming and policy decisions.
• Provide actionable recommendations that are logically linked to the conclusions and findings of the evaluation
and that draw upon lessons learned as identified through the evaluation.
3.3. Scope
Intervention Scope
70. The evaluation focuses on the aspects of the EU-funded project ‘Systems building and capacity strengthening
of the Ministry of Education and its sub-national Directorates of Education for effective delivery of quality
education outcomes’ that were directly implemented by UNICEF (based on the intervention description and
results framework). It also gives consideration to upstream/non-UNICEF components, to the extent that these
inform understanding and assessment of the UNICEF project. Moreover, the evaluation’s focus ranges from
project inputs to activities and outputs to outcome-level results, and covers the role of the key-actors involved
in implementing the programme (MoE and DoE), and the influence of the work addressed by the upstream work
by UNESCO and MoE on the downstream work and vice versa.
Temporal Scope
71. The evaluation covers the entire implementation period of the intervention, including the 10 months of the no-
cost extension that was granted in July 2022. Thus, the total period is 46 months, from August 2019 to May
2023.
Geographical Scope
72. The evaluation’s geographical scope covers all the target governorates for the project in the Federal
Government of Iraq. These are shown in Figures 1-4 in Section 1.3. The eight governorates as well as the specific
general DoEs targeted by the intervention are also listed in the table below, for each of the project’s three
specific objectives as specified in the Terms of Reference. See the maps of the governorates of implementation
of the intervention in Section 7.

3.4. Deviations from the Terms of Reference
73. There were no deviations from the Terms of Reference for the evaluation.
4. Evaluation Approach and Methodology
4.1. Evaluation Design
74. The evaluation was guided by UNICEF’s revised Evaluation Policy (2018),35 the United Nations Evaluation
Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards for Evaluation (2016),36 UNEG Guidance on Integrating Human Rights
and Gender Equality in Evaluation (2014),37 UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation (2020),38 UNICEF
Procedure for Ethical Standards and Research,39 Evaluation and Data Collection and Analysis (2021) and
UNICEF-Adapted UNEG Evaluation Report Standards (2020).40 Moreover, the evaluation has taken into
consideration the issues of equity, gender equality/JbWMGB (see footnote 32) and human rights. It has also
considered triangulation, sampling, ethical considerations (including ethical clearance) as well as
methodological limitations and mitigation measures.
75. The overall approach for the assignment, in line with the ToR for the evaluation, is a theory-based approach
rooted in contribution analysis.41 A main tool was the ToC, which was developed during the inception phase.
The evaluation’s approach also drew on the principles of outcome harvesting, by gathering data about the
targeted outcomes, then working backwards and, guided by the results framework, determining the extent to
which the interventions contributed to changes (if any) and particularly any unintended/unplanned effects.
Taken together, these approaches helped to ensure the rigour and collective ownership of the data gathered,
and thus the strength of the evaluation findings.
76. The evaluation utilised appreciative inquiry to help participants uncover existing strengths and opportunities as
well as to explore challenges and issues in a positive way. This helped to ensure the evaluation was constructive
and inclusive, in addition to promoting ownership of its findings, conclusions, lessons learned and
recommendations. The approach to data analysis also incorporated a realist evaluation perspective, alongside
mapping of causal paths.42 Key to the realist approach is the assumption that nothing works everywhere or for
everyone, and that context is critical for project results. This requires a good understanding of the context,

41 This approach focuses on understanding the contribution(s) made by the intervention under assessment relative to the
observed results, through an improved understanding of why the observed results have or have not occurred and the roles
played by the intervention as well as other internal and external factors.
42 The realist evaluation approach sets out to explain what works, how, why, for whom, to what extent, and in what
circumstances. It assumes that programme effectiveness will always be conditional, and it is designed to improve understanding
of the key contexts and mechanisms contributing to how and why interventions work.
27
which has been ensured through a comprehensive context analysis to frame the analysis of the initiative,
including giving consideration to the various conflicts as well as the impacts of Covid-19 during the period of the
project. The evaluation also drew on the COM-B model for behaviour change in analysing the project’s weak
movement towards outcomes (the model is explained in the relevant finding). Finally, the evaluation
incorporated a strong human rights-based approach (HRBA) approach throughout the evaluation process, to
ensure rigorous consideration of gender/JbWMGB, equity and human rights. The approach is incorporated into
the tools used for data collection (Annex 6: Draft Data Collection Instruments and Protocols). Moreover, the
approach is detailed under the section on data analysis and the section on Ethical Considerations,
Confidentiality and Data Protection.
4.2. Evaluation Matrix
77. To ensure consistency during the data collection and analysis, an Evaluation Matrix was developed. This was
based on the key questions presented in the ToR, and it provided the relevant evaluation criteria based on the
OECD-DAC criteria of relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability.43 Accordingly, the
Evaluation Matrix contains an overview of the evaluation questions, key assessment criteria, main sources of
information, and main data analysis collection and analysis tools. The full matrix is included in Annex 5.
4.3. Evaluation Methodology
78. The methodology for the evaluation has been mixed methods, including both qualitative and quantitative
elements. Such a methodology helps to ensure the rigour of the evaluation’s findings, lessons learned and
recommendations, by virtue of incorporating multiple types and layers of data.44 The evaluation’s
methodological approach to data gathering and data analysis are outlined below.
a) Literature review of background documents and other relevant data, including a literature review of project
reporting and monitoring data, implementing partner reports and financing and design documents. Literature
referenced is contained in the footnotes to this report, and a full bibliography is contained in Annex 7.
b) Semi-structured key informant interviews with a variety of key stakeholders (listed in the table on the next
page). See also Annex 6 for the precise protocols and data collection tools.
c) Focus group discussions with teachers trained on EMIS, with teachers trained on the e-learning module, and
with master trainers (listed in the table on the next page). See also Annex 6 for the precise protocols and data
collection tools.
d) Two online perception surveys aimed at gathering a wider set of data focusing on the understandings,
experiences and perspectives of respondents. One survey focused on teachers who had received EMIS
training, the other focused on teachers who had received e-learning training, and the third focused on MoE
administrative staff who are end-users of the EMIS system and who received EMIS training.45 See also Annex
6 for the precise protocols and data collection tools.
e) Field Observations included visiting sites of project implementation (particularly training centres, including at
DoEs), to help understand the contextual conditions and challenges faced. These were combined with FGDs
and/or KIIs to most efficiently use the Evaluation Team’s time in the field. There were no classroom
observations, due to the evaluation’s data gathering phase relative to when students are back in class. Field
observations were done by the team leader and the national evaluation experts.
f) Review of the external environment influencing the project, including other partner programmes and reports,
government initiatives and the external environment and education sector data.
43 This evaluation will not evaluate the project’s impact since this was not requested in the ToR given the low evaluability of
this criterion.

45 For EMIS teachers, the survey concentrated on their perceptions of EMIS, including the quality of the training they received,
and ease of use/challenges faced. For e-learning teachers, the survey focused on their perceptions of the teaching capacity
building activities that they were exposed to, including their quality, what worked well and what did not work well, and
if/how/to what extent it is or will impact on their teaching. For MoE administrative staff, the survey concentrated on their
perceptions of EMIS, including the quality of the training they received, and ease of use/challenges faced.
28
Sampling Strategy and Primary Data Collection
79. Primary data collection involved Key Informant Interviews (KII), Focus Group Discussions (FGD), field observations and the perception surveys as shown in the table
below. The qualitative tools and data collection instruments and protocols can be found in Annex 6. The sampling for primary data collection was purposive, ensuring
appropriate representation of each respondent group and Rights Holders benefiting from each output area for the project.46 A table outlining the detailed sampling
approach per Specific Objective can be found in Annex 11. As agreed with the evaluation steering committee during the inception phase, Children Rights Holders and
other vulnerable groups were not sampled in this evaluation. That is because their relationship with this project is very indirect and it was unlikely that the data
collected from them could have provided useful insights on the project’s evaluation criteria.
The following table shows the number of respondents by gender for each data collection method and type of respondent.47

Grand Total 110 133 243 51 62 113 835 568 1403 996 763 1759
46 Purposive sampling criteria included: I) A mix of locations in central and in southern Iraq for each SO, to ensure that similar and different contextual conditions and implementing
conditions in each region were captured; ii) Two different directorates within a governorate where feasible; iii) A mix of teachers from higher performing and lower performing schools
for KIIs and FGDs; iv) A mix of locations where implementation was relatively smooth and where it was relatively more challenging, based on the following factors: degree of local
political support for the project; level of accessibility for the project team; quality of facilities and strength of capacities (linked to wealth of location); quality of infrastructure (e.g.
Internet).
47 Some of the respondents amongst the principals and teachers surveys did not specify their gender (42 respondents out of the total of 1388 respondents). If multiple KIIs were
conducted with the same person, they were only counted once and so are shown as one KII in the table. Note that data given in this evaluation is not in relation to ratios in the total
population.
29
80. Overall, the Evaluation Team ended up conducting a total of 26 FGDs with 243 (110 women, 133 men)
participants consisting of secondary duty bearers (mostly school principals and teachers). Furthermore, the
team members conducted 113 KIIs with a total of 51 women and 62 men across all levels of stakeholders: these
included staff and representatives of UNICEF, UNESCO, the EU, Cambridge Education, the Government of Iraq,
the Ministry of Education as well as 89 principals and teachers (40 female, 49 male). With the online perception
survey, we reached a total of 1403 respondents (835 female, 568 male), of which 1346 were school principals
and teachers (808 female, 538 male) and the remaining 57 were government or DoE staff (27 female, 30 male).
Data Analysis and Triangulation
81. To facilitate rigorous data analysis including between different team members, the software Dedoose48 was
used. Analysis of quantitative (survey) data was done in MS Excel and involved linking the data to evaluation
questions to detail the perceptions of respondents (coding). The approach was primarily descriptive and aimed
to seek out how many and to what extent respondents felt a certain way about particular questions, including
seeking out patterns that could inform the evaluation’s responses to the evaluation questions, e.g. through
disaggregation by geographical region and gender.
82. Triangulation was used as a key tool for validating and analysing findings. In response to the realist evaluation
approach mentioned above, the analysis included: contribution analysis, involving a systematic analysis of the
results observed relative to the Theory of Change, while also giving consideration to any unintended results;
analysis of data about the outcomes observed and determining if/to what extent the project contributed to
them (informed by outcome harvesting principles and the COM-B Model of behavioural change). The Evaluation
Team also used financial process and cost-effectiveness analysis in analysing secondary data.
Risks, Limitations and Mitigation Strategies
83. The risks, limitations and mitigation strategies for this evaluation included:
a) The risk of limited access to information due to staff turnover was addressed by implementing contingency
plans, such as reaching out to former UNICEF staff for insights. Additionally, mixed methods and triangulation
were employed to help validate data and mitigate recall bias.
b) The challenge of insufficient monitoring data was tackled by developing a comprehensive Theory of Change
and emphasising the use of mixed methods as well as a robust data gathering plan. Ensuring the collected
data reflected intended results was crucial, along with transparently acknowledging evaluability limitations.
c) Concerns about reporting bias were met with culturally appropriate data collection protocols, and emphasis
on anonymity and confidentiality, triangulation, and the application of the Appreciative Inquiry Approach
to address bias in a non-threatening manner.
d) The risk of compromised data quality or timeline delays due to resource constraints and a small team was
mitigated by selecting an expert team based on competence and availability. Close management support, a
detailed workplan, and early engagement for ethical clearance contributed to efficient timelines.
e) Seasonal availability issues during summer were addressed by early engagement with stakeholders for
scheduling flexibility, regular updates with UNICEF, and clear communication about limitations. Alternative
strategies were developed where possible.
f) The volatile security context in Iraq necessitated comprehensive security assessments, regular monitoring,
clear communication channels, and contingency plans. These included alternative data collection sites or
methods, planning for possible remote data collection via secure channels, and adherence to security
protocols and procedures. Fortunately, the Evaluation Team experienced no security challenges during the
data collection process.
g) The tight timeframe for the data collection (largely in the month of August, with some further data gathering
in September) and for the conduct of the evaluation was mitigated through strong coordination with UNICEF
and in particular the evaluation focal points, e.g. via weekly update meetings.
48 Dedoose makes it possible to code different types of qualitative data to the questions in the Evaluation Matrix and then to do queries on
those questions that draw together the different relevant data sources. This process helps to increase the depth and rigour of the data
analysis. Source: https://www.dedoose.com/

84. The detailed description of the identified risks, limitations and their mitigation strategies that ensured the
evaluation findings’ robustness can be found in Annex 12.
Quality Assurance of the Evaluation Process
85. The Quality Assurance process was tailored to the specific needs of the evaluation at hand and the ethical
frameworks followed by UNICEF, as well as of the key stakeholders and their organisations or customs at a local
level. To ensure high quality and effective evaluation, Cowater undertook the following measures:
a. Hiring of a seasoned expert team leader as internal quality assurance expert who reviewed all
deliverables before submission to UNICEF.
b. Detailed study and interpretation of UNICEF’s evaluation policy as well as the UNICEF-adapted
Evaluation Report Standards and the UNICEF GEROS Handbook applied in accordance with the
requirements of this evaluation.
c. Clear allocations responsibilities for the QA process: the QA expert was responsible for the technical
validity of all deliverables and the project manager was in charge of overseeing contractual and ethical
compliance of the commitments made to UNICEF.
d. Creation and following of Quality Assurance and Ethical Compliance Check Lists.
e. Regular communication with UNICEF Stakeholders, to ensure a clear understanding of the needs of
the users of this evaluation.
4.4. Ethical Considerations, Confidentiality and Data Protection
86. Throughout the evaluation and in close consultation with UNICEF and all relevant stakeholders, Cowater
ensured adherence to all ethical considerations, in line with the UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in
Research, Evaluation and Data Collection and Analysis and the UNEG ethical guidelines.49
87. The following measures were taken in order to adhere to these principles (described in more detail in Annex
14):
a) Vetting for Conflict of Interest: the Evaluation Team was vetted for potential conflicts of interest, and none
turned out to have worked in essential roles related to the project prior to the beginning of this evaluation:
hence no conflict of interest could be detected and all Evaluation Team members were approved by the
UNICEF evaluation managers.
b) Basic Ethics Training: Evaluation Team members completed UNICEF’s Agora online course on ethics to
familiarise themselves with all ethical aspects of the evaluation.
c) Personal and Professional Integrity: the team signed the ‘UNICEF Pledge of Ethical Conduct in Evidence
Generation’ and respected confidentiality.
d) Informed Consent and Voluntary Participation: participation in this evaluation was voluntary and participants
were fully informed, signed permission forms in the case of KII and FGD participants, and were clearly told
that they could withdraw consent at any time without penalty.
e) Avoiding Harm: mechanisms were in place to address health and safety risks, including those related to Covid-
19. For example, by informing all participants in this evaluation on reporting channels about any instances of
risks to the health and safety of children and personnel involved in the intervention. (See Annex 14 and
consent forms in Annex 6.)
f) Sensitivity to Social and Cultural Environment: the data collection protocols and tools considered cultural
differences, discrimination, and gender/JbWMGB issues. This was ensured also by the support of two local
Evaluation Team members (male and female). Details on that can be found in Annex 14.
g) Dealing with Sensitive Issues: protocols were in place for reporting instances of sexual harassment, abuse, or
violence: none were reported.
h) Communication of Reporting Channels: clear reporting channels for misconduct or unethical behaviour were
communicated on all data collection tools. (See Annex 6.)
i) Protection of Confidentiality: the authors of this document made sure that sensitive information is not
traceable throughout this report to any individuals, and that data storage follows UNICEF’s protocols. Only the
Evaluation Team members know the answers of individual respondents in interviews. The data is stored in a
safe password-protected Tresorit Cloud Drive and will be handed over to UNICEF after the end of this
evaluation. Our own copies of the raw data will be destroyed. Details on this point can be found in Annex 14.
49 United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG).
31
j) Ethical Review Mechanisms and Ethical Clearance Process: the evaluation’s inception report and all data
collection tools underwent an ethical review, and prior clearance was sought and obtained from UNICEF and
the Ethical Review Board.
k) Permission and Acknowledgment: the Evaluation Team has committed to not communicate evidence or
publish the report or any other information related to this evaluation without explicit permission from UNICEF,
including acknowledgment of UNICEF in sharing findings.
88. The Evaluation Team did not encounter challenges to its independence, impartiality, or conflicts of interest
during the implementation of the evaluation exercise.
4.5. Timeline of the Evaluation Process
89. This evaluation process was launched after the signature of the contract on 31 May 2023. A kick-off meeting
involving the key users of this evaluation took place on 30 May 2023. The first draft of the inception Report was
submitted on 5 July 2023. The Steering Committee Meeting to approve the Inception Report took place on 20
July 2023. Ethical Approval was requested and received by the UNICEF ERB on 6 August. The Field mission data
collection in Iraq began on Monday 7 August and was concluded on 18 August, apart from a few remaining
remote interviews. The preliminary findings workshop to share the first insights of the evaluation with key
stakeholders took place on 12 September. The first draft of the final evaluation report was submitted on 1
October 2023. The Validation Workshop with the key stakeholders on the Recommendations of the Final Report
was held on 26 November 2023, in Baghdad: this was followed by the finalisation and approval of the Final
Report by UNICEF.
5. Findings
90. This section presents the findings of the evaluation. The findings were guided by the questions and criteria from
the Evaluation Matrix, which is contained in Annex 5. The findings draw on the evaluation’s data collected and
the team’s analysis of that data, as detailed earlier in this report. The findings are organised by the evaluation
criteria: relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and gender/JbWMGB, human rights, and
climate change.
5.1. Relevance
This section analyses the extent to which the intervention design was sensitive to the actual needs in the specific
context of Iraq and remained so under changing circumstances. The sensitivity in the design of the downstream
work to the upstream work and vice versa, is an additional focus of this section. The sensitivity of the intervention
design of the downstream work with the upstream work and vice versa is addressed under the evaluation criteria
of coherence.
This section addresses the evaluation questions EQ 1 and EQ2 (see Evaluation Matrix in Annex 5):
Finding 1 (relates to EQ1): To what extent was the intervention design sensitive to the actual needs of the
target groups and to the context of Iraq at governorate and school level?
91. The project’s design was overall sensitive to the needs of target groups and the context. This is because the
EMIS system and the capacity to use it (SO150), as well as the GESPs and the capacity to implement them
(SO251), were strongly in line with those needs, including from the perspective of GEDSI. The two SOs were
also in line with the overall objective of improving learning outcomes and equitable and inclusive education
for all girls and boys in Iraq. This was similarly true of the building of teachers’ teaching capacities (SO352),
with the caveat that the longer-term relevance of e-learning to doing this is more ambiguous.
92. Appropriate needs assessments about the context in Iraq, and how to strengthen its education system,
contribute to the overall objective of improving learning outcomes and equitable and inclusive education for
50 To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of education through roll-out of the Education Management Information
System (EMIS) and increase capacity of education planners, statisticians and educators at governorate level.

32
all girls and boys in the country. This emerges clearly in the project proposal. It was also validated in evaluation
interviews with multiple UNICEF respondents, who corroborated the proposal’s description of the design and
what fed into its development. The proposal appropriately analyses the relevant context in Iraq as part of the
rationale. This includes describing an education system that has been in decline since the 1990s due to multiple
conflicts and their effects, compounded by declining investment and financing over that period. The result has
been a decrease in learning levels in the country, and a decision by the government of Iraq to prioritise
education as a sector. As the proposal argues, part of addressing the issues identified is related to stronger data
for planning, capacity building to use that data, and more general capacity building to strengthen the quality of
teaching.53 This analysis can be broken down further, by considering the various project components.
93. The EMIS system and related capacity building to use it (SO1) is aligned with the needs identified, including
because it builds on previous work on an Iraqi EMIS system that has been ongoing since 2013. Several key
informants familiar with the evolution of the system since 2013 also underlined that while it proceeded in stops
and starts, it generally sought to adapt to changing needs based on feedback loops with end-users and in line
with the evolving context. This helps to reinforce EMIS’s alignment over time. EMIS systems, which were defined
in detail earlier in this report, enable the collection, analysis, and use of information in education. These uses
include for management and administration, planning, policy formulation, and monitoring and evaluation. The
relevance of such a system is clear, given Iraq’s usage of a decentralised, often paper-based planning system
that faces many challenges in responding to the complex and contextually dynamic demands of the country’s
education sector. Also relevant is that the system includes gender disaggregated data, data on other
vulnerabilities including learning difficulties or disability status or challenges faced by particular students, and
a socio-economic profile that could be used as an indicator of potential vulnerabilities such as the likelihood
of dropping out of school early. Interviews and FGDs with master trainers, teachers and UNICEF staff – as well
as online perception survey results in all regions – also made clear that levels of computer skills among the
teachers that would input data to the system were overall relatively low. This underlines the relevance of
incorporating linked capacity building as part of SO1.
94. Regarding survey data on the EMIS system, as can be seen in Figure 7, 92 per cent of all teacher respondents in
Baghdad, Basra and Qadissiyah indicated that they either fully or somewhat agree that the EMIS trainer
designed the training appropriately to their levels (T-EMIS 2). A survey among government staff revealed
equally high numbers of satisfaction: 92 per cent agree or somewhat agree that the design of the EMIS training
was appropriate to their capacity level (S-EMIS 4). And 98 per cent of respondents also agree that the EMIS
system focuses on questions that could help to inform stronger education planning to allocate teachers more
optimally according to real needs (S-EMIS-2). Open-ended feedback on the EMIS system training from
Figure 7: The online survey showed that government staff (n=56) largely agreed that EMIS is a system that is highly relevant to inform stronger
education training (S-EMIS 2), however, their impression of the appropriateness of the EMIS training turned out to be a bit lower (S-EMIS
4) than as it was perceived by teaching staff (n=918) (T-EMIS 2).

the teachers indicated concerns about the short duration of training, the complexity of the system for some,
and issues related to Internet access. What this survey data underlines then is the perception among

Delivery of Quality Education Outcomes’, UNICEF Iraq Proposal to the European Union. Submitted by UNICEF Iraq, February
2019.
33
respondents of the high degree of relevance of the EMIS training, though with a strong interest in further
training to continue to enhance capacities.
96. The GESPs and the capacity building plans linked to them (SO2) are relevant, given the Government of Iraq’s
decision to implement a new National Education Strategy that includes a commitment to decentralised
planning. This commitment means that the strategy must be translated to the governorate level, as part of
appropriately adapting it to the different governorates. Also relevant is that SO2 assessed what capacities
would need to be built to ensure the effective implementation of the GESPs, through the capacity building
plans. A further dimension of the relevance of SO2 is the strong inclusion of gender disaggregated data in the
GESPs, with their analysis giving good consideration to the particular vulnerabilities of and disparities between
girls. They also incorporate strategies for improving access and equity, including for children with special needs
and for children outside the formal education system.
97. The project’s focus on capacity building of teachers (SO3) was relevant, given the overall goal of improving
learning outcomes and the capacity levels of teachers reported by multiple key informants – especially master
trainers in evaluation KIIs and FGDs. Moreover, the e-learning module that was rolled out under this specific
objective was highly relevant, given the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and related quarantines and limits
on movement. But it is less clear that this module will remain as relevant in the longer term with the aim of
strengthening teacher capacities and thus learning outcomes. The observation being made here is that it is likely
that there were other thematic areas that could have been focused on for capacity building. These would have
had greater longer-term relevance, because they are core areas of teaching expertise and so are more directly
linked to improvement of learning outcomes. To quote from the project proposal, “…teacher capacity needs
continuous strengthening in terms of pedagogical skills, subject matter content, and pastoral care for students,
as well as duration and quality of contact with student. Thus, teachers need to be trained on child-centred
methodologies, activity-based learning, positive discipline, psychosocial support, etc.” This list of identified
needs remains unaddressed through the project, other than the component on duration and quality of contact
with students. The decision made upstream by the Government of Iraq to focus on e-learning as the priority
module, has affected the ability of UNICEF to address the initially targeted results and thus the relevance of this
project component.
98. The survey data on the e-learning was also very positive, with 93 per cent of respondents fully or somewhat
agreeing that the teacher training was at an appropriate level to build their capabilities (T-E-Learning 1), and 95
per cent of respondents agreeing or somewhat agreeing that the E-Learning teacher training focused on the
right issues to help improve their quality of teaching (T-E-Learning 3). This strengthens the earlier observation
that e-learning was relevant to needs.
Figure 8: The online survey showed that that teaching staff (n=572) participating in E-Learning training sessions largely agree that the teacher
training is relevant (T-E-Learning 3) and at an appropriate level to strengthen the teachers’ capacities (T-E-Learning 1)

Finding 2 (relates to EQ1): To what extent was the intervention design sensitive to the actual needs of the
target groups and to the context of Iraq at governorate and school level?
99. The design had weaknesses in terms of planning for the usage of the EMIS and to a more limited extent of
the GESPs. This is because the project did not build in mechanisms to facilitate fostering of organisational
34
change processes to support their usage, and did not address the implementation of the capacity building
plans or the broadening of SO354 capacity building beyond the core group of trained teachers.
100. The overall strength of the design from a relevance perspective as outlined in Finding 1 is somewhat tempered
by some weaknesses in terms of anticipating how movement towards the project’s specific objectives would
be achieved.
101. As regards SO1, the decision to implement the EMIS system in multiple Directorates of Education, and partially
in many governorates, meant that the system could not and still cannot be used for governorate-level planning
processes. This is because governorate-level planning would require all the schools in the governorate to be
included – yet as multiple key informants from UNICEF, UNESCO, the MoE, DoEs, as well as teachers and others
underlined, no governorate has complete coverage.55 In turn this means that a valuable opportunity for a
‘demonstration effect’ about how the system can facilitate more effective planning was lost; there was
therefore also a lost opportunity to engender greater interest in and commitment to the system. More
fundamentally, the move towards a nimbler, data-driven planning process within the Ministry and the
Directorates of Education requires more than simply putting in place a strong system with up-to-date data.
Because ensuring usage of the system, and thus movement toward the SO’s aim of improving the effectiveness
and efficiency of education, would require fostering of an organisational change process, as in any other
organisation moving away from an entrenched way of working. Moreover, such a change process is not explicitly
articulated in the project, underlining a weakness in the relevance of its design.
102. Turning to the GESPs, the project’s design did foresee governorate-level sector coordination mechanisms to
help to bring together key actors involved and thus to facilitate their implementation. Yet it is not clear now to
what extent these mechanisms are aimed at fostering the sort of deep organisational change processes required
to shift towards the complex and more data-driven planning processes envisioned by the GESPs. This
observation is somewhat muted by the capacity gaps assessments and development plans undertaken as part
of this specific objective, to help to ensure the effective implementation of the GESPs. The reason is that such
assessments and plans could potentially help to foster such deep organisational change processes. But the
challenge is that a clear strategy for actually implementing these plans was not agreed, including about who
would take the lead in implementing them.
103. Regarding the teacher capacity building (SO3), the previous finding made clear its relevance in terms of
contributing to the aim of enhancing the quality of teaching and learning at governorate and school levels. But
the weakness at a design level is, as multiple teachers and trainers underlined in KIIs, seen in foreseeing
capacity building amplification measures. Here the observation is that there was no formal plan for having
teachers who trained under the project subsequently train others at their schools. Nor was there a formal
plan to ensure that school heads would be committed to supporting such amplification measures by getting
their buy-in to the e-learning. What resulted then was that some teachers took the initiative to train others, but
most did not.
104. What these various observations point to is weaknesses in the ability to reach the larger specific objectives,
unless there is either a follow-on project to implement the measures needed to achieve them or some other
mechanism by which they would be achieved of their own accord. This is a weakness in the project’s relevance
from a design perspective.
Finding 3 (relates to EQ2): Did the intervention design continue to remain sensitive to the needs of the
target groups and to the context of Iraq under changing circumstances?
105. The intervention design remained relevant to needs, both by continuing to focus on those needs that did
not change despite shifting circumstances and by adapting to those that did, with the latter particularly visible
in SO3’s56 focus on e-learning during COVID quarantines.
54 To enhance the quality of teaching and learning by operationalising the capacity development plan and developing
teachers’ capacities at central and governorate levels.
55 The analysis here is about governorate-level planning. Yet it should be noted that Rusafa 3, which is a directorate that is
part of the governorate of Baghdad, did have all schools entered into the EMIS system (with funding from the EU and the
German government). Yet it was not able to demonstrate significant progress in data-driven planning and thus to
produce a demonstration effect.
56 To enhance the quality of teaching and learning by operationalising the capacity development plan and developing
teachers’ capacities at central and governorate levels.
35
106. The design of the project remained relevant to needs, given the continuing relevance of the initially assessed
needs as well as new needs that arose over the period from when the concept note was first drafted in 2018 to
its implementation from 2019 to 2023. This is most visible in the decision taken to prioritise the e-learning
module as part of SO3, once the COVID-19 pandemic had started. That area of focus showed a pro-active
response to the quarantines and resulting limitations on movement within the country, since students could
still be connected with teachers: this enabled some continuity in student learning.
107. More broadly, the changing circumstances in Iraq during the period of the project did not fundamentally alter
the underlying needs that the project sought to address, in term of strengthening the education system through
capacity building and data-based planning tools. Given this, the project’s ongoing focus on addressing these
needs shows that it continued to remain sensitive to the needs of the target groups and to the context.
5.2. Coherence
The section on coherence analyses the extent to which the intervention was compatible with other
interventions in Iraq, the objectives established by development partners, as well as the objectives of the
Government of Iraq for the Education sector. The evaluation focuses on internal coherence, which is the
extent to which synergies and linkages have been established between the upstream and the
downstream work, and the extent to which they have contributed to achieving outcome-level results or
hindered the achievement thereof. Reference is also made to external coherence being the consistency
of the intervention with other actors’ interventions and objectives, with emphasis on those of the
Government of Iraq.
This section addresses the evaluation questions EQ 3 and EQ 6 (see Annex 5):
Finding 4 (relates to EQ3 and EQ6): How was the intervention design of the downstream work sensitive
to the upstream work and vice versa, and to which extent did synergies and linkages between the
upstream and the downstream work contribute to achieving outcome-level results or hinder the
achievement thereof?
108. The internal coherence between the upstream and downstream work was overall good, though weaker in
terms of linkages between downstream components. Regarding the upstream-downstream dimension, there
was strong accounting for the necessary steps to carry out each SO’s activities, and good alignment between
roles assigned and the areas of expertise/strengths of UNICEF and UNESCO, with some weakness in terms of
assumptions and fostering ownership by the Ministry of Education. The internal linkages thus supported
movement towards outcome-level results, as project design realistically aimed at these. The project was also in
line with the UN Cooperation Framework for Iraq, and with multiple SDGs.
109. The design of the intervention was notable for strongly linking upstream work with downstream work, with
the former feeding into the latter. If we take SO1 as an illustrative example of this, design of and technical
support for the EMIS system, procurement of computers and designing of training for implementing it by
UNESCO were all done at the upstream level, which then fed into UNICEF’s work at the downstream level to
implement the training about the system on the provided computers. This was complemented by the MoE
helping to ensure coherence, assigning responsibilities, identifying end-users for training, as well as ultimately
maintaining the EMIS platform as part of its ownership role. From a design perspective, these components fit
together well and so can facilitate movement towards the outputs aimed at by the specific objective. The
weakness from a design perspective can be seen in the assumption that producing a strong system or plan and
building capacities will lead to the usage of those systems and plans and deployment of those improved
capacities in stronger decision-making and teaching informed by better data. This weakness is discussed further
in the effectiveness findings.
110. There were also generally good coordination mechanisms between project partners responsible for the
upstream and downstream work, marked by regular meetings and communication and with UNICEF leading at
the governorate level as envisioned in the design. That said, some UNICEF, MoE and UNESCO KIIs highlighted
examples of bilateral meetings between the MoE and UNESCO focusing on upstream components, and the
MoE and UNICEF focusing on downstream components. This was characterised as reducing the ability of the
project partners to operate as coherently as they might have, especially given that the upstream and
downstream components were so strongly linked together from a design perspective.
36
111. It is also relevant to consider internal coherence between the downstream components. Here, a weakness
of the design is the linkages between the project SOs. The observation is that horizontal linkages between the
EMIS and related capacity building, the GESPs and related capacity building, and the e-learning were relatively
siloed. This means that the EMIS work was not designed to feed into and thus to strengthen the development
of the GESPs, with the result that the groundwork for the ultimate usage of the system/plans would not be laid.
Consequently, the various capacity building components of all three SOs were not linked together: if they had
been linked, this might have amplified their results. This is a lost opportunity then for the project overall.
112. Furthermore, and as was emphasised by multiple interviewees at UNICEF, UNESCO and the MoE, the design
assigned roles to partners that were in line with their particular areas of expertise and experience. For UNICEF,
this was particularly its strong relationships and network at the sub-national level across Iraq, and its strong
capacities in terms of organising training that especially focused on education as a thematic area.
113. Regarding roles, ownership by the MoE is a more complicated area. If we are to take ‘ownership’ as
understood in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (“Developing countries set their own strategies for
poverty reduction, improve their institutions and tackle corruption.”57), then the ownership role was strong
from a design perspective. This is because the MoE was and is strongly in favour of this project and its
components at a theoretical and policy level. But ownership should also be understood more broadly, a point
that was underlined in several key KIIs during the evaluation. This is especially true, given that the design
assumed the government would ultimately take on the various components and run them (EMIS) and use them
(GESPs and having its staff put into practice their acquired teaching capacities). Here, the observation is that a
further dimension of strong ownership typically comes from actively participating in designing and
implementing project components and thereby becoming progressively more committed to them and their
success by virtue of experiencing them as (at least partially) one’s own. But from a design perspective, the
MoE’s role was less active, with most components done by the UN partners and relatively few irrevocable,
concrete commitments along the way by the MoE. This has the effect of decreasing the MoE’s active ownership
of the project. This partly explains some of the observations in later findings, e.g. related to weak project
sustainability.
114. There is also some internal incoherence regarding planning and funding priorities between the MoE and the
DoE that several DoE, UNICEF and MoE interviewees remarked on this. This incoherence is linked to the push-
pull within the government between decentralisation and centralisation, and it could hamper the future
achievement of project outcomes. This issue is somewhat exacerbated by the project’s division of
responsibilities for the national and governorate levels between UNICEF and UNESCO, because they map onto
and thus reinforce the Ministry’s own internal divisions.
115. The UN Cooperation Framework for Iraq emphasises the need for strong partnerships, including between UN
agencies and with national partners. The partnership approach adopted for the project is strongly coherent with
this framework.
116. Lastly, the project is coherent with multiple SDGs at a design level. As already mentioned in section 2.5, for
SDG 4 – Quality Education, SO3’s focus on improving the quality of teaching and education was in line with the
target of increasing the supply of qualified teachers. As a result, SO1 and SO2’s strengthening of data and
planning were in line with the targets that all girls and boys should enjoy completely free, equitable and quality
primary and secondary education; they were also in line with eliminating gender disparities/JbWMGB in
education and ensuring equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable. The
three SOs are somewhat in line with SDG 5 – Gender Equality, since they aim to mainstream effective female
inclusion. But this is not seen in specific activities, outputs and outcomes undertaken by the project. Moreover,
the overall project is indirectly in line with SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals, particularly the target of
enhancing the global partnership for sustainable development through multi-stakeholder partnerships that
mobilise and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources by virtue of its partnerships and
collaborative approach between the Government of Iraq, UNESCO and UNICEF. However, there are no specific
activities, outputs and outcomes addressing SDG17.
5.3. Efficiency
The section on efficiency analyses the extent to which the intervention design delivers, or is likely to
deliver, results in an economic and timely way. This section examines how far the inputs have been
57 https://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/parisdeclarationandaccraagendaforaction.htm
37
converted into output and outcome-level results in a timely way across all strategic objectives of the
project, and to what extent the project considered cost when making technical choices.
This section addresses the evaluation questions EQ 4 and EQ5 (see Annex 5):
Finding 5 (relates to EQ4): How well have the inputs been converted into output and outcome-level results
in a timely way?
117. The project was ultimately efficient in converting inputs to outputs from a timeliness perspective,
overcoming very significant bottlenecks and slowdowns (especially those related to COVID and more
predictable challenges such as Internet access) with the help of a 10 month no-cost extension. It was also
fairly efficient in moving towards outcomes, with limitations linked to project design.
118. The efficiency of the project from a timeliness perspective must be seen through the lens of the time period
in which it was implemented: this observation was underlined by multiple interviewees within UNICEF, the MoE
and DoEs, as well as others. Because although the initial transfer of funds from the EU proceeded in a timely
manner, work was largely suspended in early 2020 when the COVID pandemic caused government offices to
shut and slowed down work at UN offices as staff adjusted to remote working.
119. Regarding the EMIS (SO1)-related components, UNICEF, DoE and other KIIs made clear that by the time work
properly restarted months later, many of the tenders were out of date and so had to be re-advertised. When
s the project eventually began to move forward again, there were challenges in terms of sourcing supplies and
particularly laptop computers – due to global supply chain disruptions – though also some slowdowns in the
training of trainers. These upstream challenges had cascading effects on downstream work, though they were
ultimately overcome by the UNICEF project making a very strong push in its latter stages. More particularly,
significant staff resources were dedicated to this push in those latter stages. Furthermore, project funds that
had been used at a low level earlier in the project began to be used much more heavily, with non-EU funding
also brought in to cover the increased costs of laptops linked to COVID supply chain issues. Also important were
the upstream efforts made to overcome these issues, e.g. by speeding up the purchasing process of computers
as much as possible (several interviewees said that implementing partners proactively reached out directly to
suppliers on this). The project had also anticipated free Internet access for teaching staff to input data to the
EMIS system. Yet this access was not made available, which slowed down data entry. The problem was
overcome by teachers making a significant effort to enter the data through their personal Internet connections,
and by working in the evenings, since staff time for data entry was not given during the working day period.
120. This push to ensure overall timeliness was helped by the 10 month no-cost-extension, granted by the donor.
This, along with the additional budgetary support, also made it possible to add about 200 more schools to the
EMIS system and to train about 400 more teachers. From the perspective of efficiency, this is a positive
outcome, as it will contribute to a greater critical mass for the EMIS, which is currently only active in selected
schools in the various governorates.
121. However, it should be noted that there are risks associated with placing the training and roll-out of EMIS
near the end of the project. Without a new phase to the EMIS, follow-up support and training will be dependent
on the MoE, whose capacity by the end of the project was not sufficient to independently support it. This issue
was particularly linked to the late start on training in the project cycle. But it is also due to the high levels of
training required, given the complexity of the system training, which requires significant time and effort. It is
also worth noting that the concurrent development and roll-out of the GESPs and EMIS meant that the GESPs
could not be fully informed by data derived from the EMIS. This set of observations underlines the challenges
for moving towards project outcomes, which is discussed in more detail further below in this finding.
122. The process was somewhat different with SO2. UNICEF, DoE and other KIIs made it clear that the GESPs were
slowed down initially by COVID-related interruptions. Yet once work got going again, many sessions took place
online during the quarantines, but also because the contracted company leading on the GESPs could not travel
to federal Iraq for security reasons. These sessions were deemed less efficient by participants, given the
limitations of the online format for complex data gathering and planning processes, building the relationships
to support these, as well as Internet access challenges in Iraq. Longer-term contextual factors also contributed
to these slowdowns, as was underlined by several of the interviewees. The point they made is that decades of
instability and related underinvestment in capacity development and planning in Iraq had weakened the bases
38
for the core collaborative work, at the governorate level, that SO2 was aiming to accomplish. This in turn
impacted on the timeliness of the SO’s roll-out. However, like with SO1, interviewees at UNICEF, the MoE as
well as several DoE respondents made it clear that these challenges were ultimately overcome by the
concerted work of the various stakeholders, especially near the end of the project period, and including efforts
made by the contracted company.
123. SO3 was similarly slowed down by COVID. Once work started on SO3, UNICEF, UNESCO, and DoE KIIs
underlined that new timeliness-related challenges arose when selecting trainers, because many of those
initially selected did not have the required technical (information technology) skills. This meant that many new
trainers had to be selected. A review of the module and training manuals was also somewhat slowed down,
partly due to COVID staffing issues and partly due to approval processes within the Ministry. These in turn had
cascading effects on the timing of UNICEF’s project. Once training did begin, COVID also impacted on timeliness,
since large numbers of teachers could not be gathered together because of the need for spacing to reduce the
risk of infection: this observation was made by many teachers to the Evaluation Team. The lack of Internet
access also slowed down implementation: those trained could not easily practise what they were taught. Yet
despite these various slowdowns, the previously noted dedication of significant staff resources – together with
the 10-month, no-cost extension that was granted by the funder – meant that the project completed work on
this SO within the timeframe.
124. While this finding has painted a picture of many delays for the three SOs, it has also underlined that the key
dimension – COVID-related measures – was one that could not reasonably be predicted. Furthermore, it has
highlighted how the project adapted to the evolving context by making up for time lost due to COVID-related
measures and ultimately achieving results within the adjusted timeframe (see Finding 7). In so doing, it was
ultimately efficient from a timeliness perspective in converting inputs into outputs.
125. But the movement towards outcomes was complicated by the design issues and the fact that the outcomes
would ultimately require more time to be fully achieved (this is discussed in the Relevance findings). So even
though there was movement towards outcomes (as discussed further in the Effectiveness findings), from an
efficiency perspective, inputs have not been converted into outcome-level results in a timely way.
Finding 6 (relates to EQ5): To what extent was cost a consideration when making technical choices in the
project?
126. The project’s overall cost efficiency was good given the challenges faced, with significantly higher than
anticipated spending on some project components linked to the late push to achieve project results and
covered by lower-than-budgeted-for spending on other budget lines as well as additional funding sources,
thus reflecting appropriate overall financial management.
127. The various timeliness challenges faced by the project, as outlined in the previous finding, are in many ways
reflected in its efficiency from a cost perspective.
128. The bar chart below shows that the majority of disbursements of the EU grant component (total amount: USD
4,200,928) took place in the last two years. This underlines the observation made in Finding 5, about the higher
than anticipated intensity of activities in the latter part of the project’s implementation period, and a linked
burn rate. Table 15 in Annex 4 – ‘Overview of Project Financial Information’ also indicates that the majority of
the funding (79 per cent, or USD 3,324,089 of USD 4,200,928) contributed to the EMIS roll-out (Activity 123
and 124) which took place during 2022 and 2023. The explanation given for this was that, in the case of EMIS,
the software had to be developed, with computers procured for MoE, DoE and Schools, and training of master
trainers all needing to occur prior to roll-out. Thus the funds were spent on project activities that were carried
out in the last two years: this means the burn rate was reasonable, given the contextual slowdowns described
earlier.

129. As indicated by the table below, more than 80 per cent of the total budget was provided by the EU
(highlighted in white in the table). Almost 20 per cent of the total budget was co-financed by Germany and
Global Education Thematic (highlighted in grey in the table). This indicated a broad commitment amongst
project partners and enabled an increase in the project’s reach, e.g. being able to equip and train more schools
in the EMIS. The co-financing arrangement also helped to support the no-cost extension, which allowed the
project to complete the roll-out of EMIS and development of the GESP (as discussed in the previous finding).

130. Table 15 in Annex 4 – Overview of Project Financial Information’ also shows the planned budget against actual
expenditure for all main expenditure items.59 The table highlights many areas where actual expenditure
exceeded planned expenditure. For most activities, the amount exceeded was manageable, with several
exceptions. The most notable areas where planned budget was exceeded included: Training of school-level
EMIS users, in which the original budget amount was EUR 1,053,204 and actual expenditure was EUR
1,933,493.93 (184 per cent); Conduct teacher training on pilot course in which the original budget was EUR
440,000 and actual expenditure was EUR 529,983 (120 per cent); and, Technical Assistance (consultancy to
develop governorate education plans) where the original budget was EUR 400,000 and actual expenditure was
EUR 541,702 (135 per cent). Some areas where budget was underspent and realigned included:
production/printing and dissemination of governorate sector plans in which EUR 600,000 was budgeted and
58 Spreadsheet on overall expenditures of the EU grant, exclusive of the cost recovery and pending activities.

only EUR 451,954 disbursed (75 per cent); and, Education Sector Analysis (Cost of Assessment and capacity
building workshop during the sector analysis phase) in which EUR 240,000.00 was budgeted and only EUR 9,898
spent.
131. However, the Evaluation Team’s analysis finds that spending for the different project components is
reasonable despite some activities exceeding budget. This is because, as noted above and in the previous
finding, many of the changes were because of Covid, which incurred greater costs on procurement of laptops
and computers. It is also a result of the need to reassess some activities, e.g. expanding the number of schools
receiving laptops and teachers receiving training in EMIS. Finally, this spending was compensated for by savings
in other budget lines, as well as by agreed-upon new money linked to the extra activities and COVID-related
challenges.
132. One of the things remarked on by multiple UNICEF interviewees was the formal process of changing budget
lines. More specifically, they noted that limitations on moving funds from one budget line to another affected
the efficiency of the project, by causing delays and administrative burdens. The issue was compounded
because the role of EU grant supervisor in Iraq was not filled for a critical period during the last phase of
project implementation, so there was no one in-country during that period with whom staff could specifically
liaise to request changes. For example, staff noted that it would have been useful to procure additional laptops
with some of the savings made on other parts of the project: but that would have required time-consuming
discussions with donors, so was avoided.
133. Cost efficiency was also demonstrated by staff during Covid. For example, adjustments were made to
workshop modalities for the GESP to accommodate Covid restrictions. Moreover, the online sessions
organised between Cambridge and staff members helped to save money. The decision to focus SO3 on e-
learning also showed flexibility in adjusting to the Covid situation. But as noted in other findings, this decision
also raises questions as to how effective the component might be in a post-Covid environment and whether
teachers have had their capacity strengthened to deliver classroom lessons. Staff also demonstrated cost
efficiency in sharing costs with project partners. For example, the EU grant couldn’t cover all the computers for
Rusafa 3, so UNICEF agreed to support UNESCO to procure an additional 1,063 laptops to support the EMIS
trainings.
5.4. Effectiveness
This section analyses the effectiveness of the project, taking into account the relative importance of the
objectives or results. This section provides an aggregate measure of the extent to which an intervention
has or will be expected to achieve relevant and sustainable impacts, efficiently and coherently, with
specific consideration for the target groups of the intervention. The extent to which the changes achieved
are valued by the targeted groups is analysed, as well as whether there are any unintended results,
either positive or negative. The section also examines which factors were most necessary for the
intervention to achieve its intended output and outcome-level results and how well the project has
monitored its progress toward the results.
This section addresses the evaluation questions EQ7, EQ8, EQ9, EQ10, EQ11, and EQ 12 (see Annex 5):
Finding 7 (relates to EQ7): How well has the intervention achieved its intended outcome-level results for
the different targeted groups and under which circumstances?
134. The project achieved its output-level results for all three specific objectives – with the quality of outputs
good – and facilitated movement towards, though not achievement of, outcomes. There is weak evidence of
capacities and planning tools being comprehensively put into practice.
In assessing the project’s achievement of outcome-level results, it is useful to begin by looking at outputs as the
precursors to achieving outcomes. Thus the evaluation has found that all three SO’s outputs were achieved.
These are fully detailed, including with numbers achieved by year of the project and total numbers reached, in
Annex 3 – Implementation Status Tables for Specific Objectives. The Annex draws on final monitoring data
provided by UNICEF and triangulated where possible with data from the evaluation. They are also summarised
in this finding.
41
135. SO1’s output of establishing and rolling out the Education Management Information System (EMIS), included
multiple indicators: development of the EMIS system; call centre for the EMIS established and operational; staff
capacity in the targeted governorates enhanced (54,824 training days for 5,328 staff) achieving a total of 7,019
trained staff (3,538 female, 3,481 male – see Figure 9 below) thereby reaching 132 per cent of the target value.
A total of 3,529 schools and literacy centres were entered onto EMIS, which was also 32 per cent more than the
targeted number of 2,664; and 376 statistical reports were generated, which is more than seven times the
targeted number of 50. This output and all of its indicators were achieved based on monitoring data and also
KIIs with UNICEF staff, DoE staff, and others, as well as a review of the EMIS system by the Evaluation Team.
However, notably for the literacy centres, KIIs with UNICEF staff made clear that the number of centres entered
onto EMIS ended up being lower than initially anticipated in the project proposal (84 achieved out of 368
targeted). This was primarily due to significant slowdowns in the upstream work and some inefficiencies in
coordination with the literacy commission’s executive board.
136. Furthermore, KIIs and FGDs with participants indicated that they found the training sessions to be strong,
even if many felt that follow-up training would have been useful, not least because of the frequent updates
to the EMIS system. Survey data (see Figure 10 later in this finding) also showed that 80 per cent of 918 teaching
staff tended to agree with the statement that the EMIS system is user-friendly and easy to use (T-EMIS 1).
However, in Qadissiyah, only 66 per cent of the respondents agreed with that statement.
137. 86 per cent of respondents said that they need further training, suggesting that the trainings they have
participated in are not experienced as being sufficient (T-EMIS 10). Of respondents to the staff survey, levels of
agreement are similarly high (93 per cent) with the statement that the EMIS system is user friendly and easy to
use (S-EMIS 1), with 91 per cent saying that they could use further training on the system. While the sample is
relatively small for the staff survey with only 56 respondents, the high levels of approval to both questions hints
that the potential of the EMIS system is recognised, but that the training sessions that have been offered are
not yet sufficient. Challenges highlighted by both surveyed groups are continuous updates to the software as
well as their own weak basic computer literacy skills. Many of them thus struggle to remember the procedures
for various functions of EMIS, such as entering, managing and updating data. Some have as a result suggested
creating tutorial videos for these various steps to refresh their memory on these procedures (T-EMIS 10) Open);
S-EMIS 10) Open).
Figure 10: The online survey showed differences in the perception of user friendliness of the EMIS system between government staff (n=56) (S-
EMIS 1) and teaching staff (n=918) (T-EMIS 1) with the latter thinking that the EMIS system is far easier to use for teachers than it appears
to be for government staff. Yet, 86 % of teaching staff agree that they could use some follow up training (T-EMIS 10)

138.
Evaluation KIIs and FGDs also found that the ability of teachers to use the system was facilitated by the
WhatsApp and Signal groups that many trainers set up: these were actively used for exchanging challenges and
the solutions to them. As touched on ealier, one issue was the poor Internet access, due to the project’s
component of providing Internet access never being realised. A further challenge was that the teachers made
responsible for entering EMIS data were not assigned specific work time to do it and they were not given a
reduction in their overall teaching workload. Teachers compensated for this by often entering data in their
own time from home, which also allowed them to take advantage of their private Internet connections. Yet this
was problematic, since teachers are not allowed to bring student records home, even though some school heads
do give informal permission to do so. Overall however, this solution reflects the strength of commitment of
teachers to achieving the outputs.
139. Regarding SO1 outcome-level results, the evidence from interviews and FGDs with key stakeholders (UNICEF,
MoE and DoE) indicates some movement toward them but not achievement. This is partially a design issue,
42
rooted in how such outcomes would be achieved (this is also discussed in the Relevance findings). It is also an
implementation issue, reflecting how a reworked design would be put into practice. It is also an issue related to
the project’s outcomes being optimistically expressed, by comparison with the project’s scope and timelines.
Yet there is weak evidence of SO1’s outcome being achieved (“improved capacity to identify gaps in access and
quality of education using reliable and frequently collected EMIS data and to allocate appropriate resources,
including qualified teachers, to address them”). This is because achieving this objective would require having
improved capacity to actually use the EMIS system, as part of a wider organisational change process for the
MoE and DoEs; such capacity building has not been implemented yet. Furthermore, EMIS data are not usable
yet given that planning is done at DoE or governorate levels and that in all of the implementation locations
other than Rusafa 3, coverage is not complete. This is not to deny that there are isolated examples of the EMIS
data informing decision-making – yet these are not part of a comprehensive process. The effectiveness of the
EMIS trainings, however, was deemed to be quite valuable. This is highlighted by the fact that overwhelming
majorities of survey respondents felt that the EMIS training led to strong capacity building (T-EMIS 4) and was
conducive to strong learning outcomes (T-EMIS 3). However, when teaching staff practically apply their learned
skills and knowledge, their motivation to use EMIS is frustrated by a lack of opportunities or sufficient time to
effectively use EMIS (T-EMIS 7): only 45 per cent of the respondents tend to agree that they have sufficient
opportunities or time to access the EMIS system (see Figure 11 below). This situation can be attributed to a lack
of access to the internet or equipment, as was mentioned earlier.
Figure 11: The online survey showed that while the training content (T-EMIS 4) and delivery (T-EMIS 3) appears to be highly appreciated by
teaching staff, the majority of them have trouble using the EMIS system in practice (T-EMIS 7).

140. SO2’s output of Developing Education Capacity Development plans at national and governorate levels included
multiple indicators: the 5-year National Education Capacity Development plan developed at central level;
number of Governorate Education sector plans and capacity development plans developed at selected
governorates; 3-year capacity development implementation plan developed at central level; and, 3-year
capacity development implementation plan developed in four governorates. This output and all of its indicators
were achieved based on project monitoring data and based on evaluation data (review of the plans and KIIs
with UNICEF and DoE staff).
141. More specifically, interviews with UNICEF, the DoEs, and others indicated that the Education Section Plans
(GESPs and capacity building plans) are available at governorate levels in the targeted governorates, and they
lay out a clear process to develop capacities and even somewhat for implementation (without clear funding
strategies, which are not however specifically mentioned as part of the output). Based on analysis of the plans
as well as feedback from key informants in the sampled areas for the evaluation, the plans are strong because
they can guide work at the governorate level. They also included good consultations with key stakeholders, as
well as strong tailoring to the particularities of context and inclusion of GEDSI-related issues, e.g. including
gender-disaggregated/JbWMGB analysis. Here too, strong commitment by stakeholders is what allowed these
plans to achieve their output-level results.
142. Regarding SO2’s outcome-level results (“Capacity of education planners, statisticians, and educators to make
timely and accurate decisions at central and governorate levels is increased, improving the effectiveness and
efficiency of education and improved capacity to develop and implement policies at central and governorate
43
levels”), the evidence from interviews and FGDs with key stakeholders (UNICEF, MoE and DoE) indicates some
movement towards them but not achievement. As with SO1, this is partially a design issue rooted in how such
outcomes would be achieved, as well as an implementation issue in terms of how a reworked design would be
put into practice. It is also an issue related to the project’s outcomes being optimistically expressed, by
comparison with the project’s scope and timelines (see above, SO1 outcome-level results). But more specifically,
the reason is that the capacity building plans linked to the GESPs are not being implemented and are not
funded for future implementation. Without those capacity building plans, implementation of the GESPs
themselves – and therefore more timely and accurate decisions to improve education and to develop and
implement policies – is reduced. Thus while there are isolated examples of the GESPs informing some decisions,
these are not part of a comprehensive process.
143. Finally, SO3’s output of enhancing teachers’ capacities in service delivery at central and governorate levels
also included multiple indicators: pilot training materials developed; number of Master trainers trained on
developed materials; and, number of teachers who participated in developing the capacity building plans and
teachers training. This output and all of its indicators were achieved on the basis of project monitoring data and
were based on evaluation data (review of the pilot training materials). Feedback from trainers and teachers
who received the training also showed that the trainings were overall good. The training included an
appropriate mix of software, in line with the goals aimed at by the SO, and good training methods employed
during the sessions, even though Internet access remained a challenge for many.
Figure 12: The online survey showed that teaching staff that participated in E-Learning training sessions (n=572) largely agree that the ideas
from the teacher training can benefit their colleagues (TE-Learning 7) and even more so themselves (TE-Learning 6) to improve their
teaching.

144. As regards survey data (see Figure 12), the 572 teachers who participated in the e-Learning survey
overwhelmingly agreed (85 per cent) that they feel capable of applying the ideas of the teacher training in the
classroom (T-E-Learning 6) and 77 per cent also had the sense that their colleagues were capable of doing so (T-
E-Learning 7). Of the 56 staff respondents to the e-learning survey (see Figure 13), 94 per cent agreed that the
EMIS trainer’s delivery of the trainings was conducive to strong learning outcomes (S-EMIS 5) and 98 per cent
agreed that the EMIS training helped to build their capacities to use the system (S-EMIS 6). However, they felt
44
that their colleagues’ understanding had been enhanced only slighly less than their own (S-EMIS 8) which
confirms the impression of a wide adoption rate of the teachings.
Figure 13 The online survey showed a contrast of perceptions among government staff (n=56) regarding their colleagues’ capacity to use EMIS
after the training (S-EMIS 8), the EMIS-training’s impact on their own capabilities (S-EMIS 6) as well as the trainer’s performance in
conveying the skills and knowledge (S-EMIS 5).

145.
In the open comments to some of the questions (T-EMIS 2 – Open; T-EMIS 3 – Open; T-EMIS 10 - Open), teaching
staff often suggested that the training periods were insufficient and should be prolonged or that the quality of
the training sessions should be improved. This view was also prevalent in the open responses of teaching staff
that participated in the e-learning training sessions: they said that trainings should be more numerous and more
in-depth (T-E-Learning 3 – Open). This opinion was shared by DoE staff respondents, who also suggested
increasing the quantity and duration of trainings (S-EMIS 4 – Open; S-EMIS 5 Open). Many of the open answers
to these questions suggested that there are a lot of teachers struggling with basic computer literacy skills, and
that this is an additional area where more training would be useful so as to support using the EMIS system.
This impression is formulated by open text responses like “[t]here are some trainees who are not proficient in
working on computers and do not have any knowledge of the subject” (T-EMIS 2 – Open), while typical open
text responses to the question, “[w]hat areas would you need more training on?” were answered along the
lines of “[t]rain[ing] employees to use computers” (S-EMIS-10 Open).
146. Regarding factors affecting the achievement of SO3’s output-level results, several teacher and trainer
interviewees mentioned that trainings were given during the summer months, possibly because project
slowdowns meant that there was little flexibility for when to hold them. This meant that for some people it was
difficult to concentrate, given the intense heat and lack of air conditioning due to frequent power outages.
Some interviewees felt this negatively impacted the ability of participants to learn as much as they might have
from the sessions. Some respondents also noted that more days would have been useful to strengthen the
training, with several of those – including trainers – also mentioning that an initial computer literacy orientation
course of a few days would have strengthened the capacity building sessions. As with SO1, WhatsApp and Signal
groups were a key way that trainers stayed in touch with trainees, in order to answer questions and try to
overcome ongoing challenges. Yet many WhatsApp and Signal groups did not seem to be active, when the
Evaluation Team tried to reach out to potential survey respondents through them. This could indicate that fewer
groups were in fact set up or had remained active than interviewees had indicated. But overall, the evaluation
found that capacities have been built and that many trainees are capable of demonstrating the e-learning tools.
147. While the output monitoring data for SO3 clearly highlight that all three targets have been achieved (Training
Materials have been developed (T1), 24 of 24 Master Trainers have been trained (T2), and 4,000 out of 4,000
teachers participated in developing capacity building plans and teacher trainings (T3)), when it comes to
outcome-level results (“Enhanced quality of teaching and learning improved”),, the evidence from interviews and
FGDs with key stakeholders (UNICEF, MoE and DoE) indicates some movement towards them but not
achievement. As with SO1 and SO2, this is partially a design issue rooted in how such outcomes would be
achieved; it is also an issue related to the project’s outcomes being optimistically expressed, by comparison
with the project’s scope and timelines (see the above explanation in SO1 outcome-level results). When it comes
to the self-reported data in the online perception survey, the teaching staff appears to view the teacher
training very positively and is already making effective use of the data. Yet, interview data suggest that the
picture is different: there were only episodic instances showing the enhanced capacities being put to use to
45
enhance the quality of teaching, meaning there is no data showing a consistent strong deployment of the
capacities based on reporting by teachers.60 This included some teachers reporting stronger communication
with students as well as stronger outreach and connection to students as a result of the virtual (mobile phone-
based) technologies. Others said that students learned new technology, that they had stronger engagement
with parents, and several said it was easier to reach students with special needs as well as students displaced
by drought. Such tools certainly enhanced contact with students, though the extent to which they strengthened
the quality of teaching itself is not clear. As will be discussed later in the sustainability finding, there was weak
planning for the institutionalisation of the training beyond the specific teachers trained.
Finding 8 (relates to EQ8): Which changes achieved by the intervention were most valued by the targeted
groups, with consideration given to the needs of different targeted groups?
148. Project capacity building and planning components are valued and often strongly valued by all target groups
in all implementation locations, with raised expectations about their continuation providing an opportunity
in terms of ultimately reaching outcomes as well as representing a challenge going forward (for SO161 and
SO262).
149. Interview and FGD data made clear that the components of the project that are most valued are the capacity
building and capacity building plans, as well as the planning components across the three SOs of the project.
These can be broken down by SO, so as to highlight the particularities for each.
150. SO1’s capacity building was somewhat appreciated by the teachers, based on KIIs and FGDs with them. More
specifically, they were overall not enthusiastic about the training as an end in itself, but rather as a means to
setting up a planning (and reporting) tool that they strongly supported. This support for the improved planning
possibilities arising from a complete EMIS system was shared and even felt more strongly by DoE and MoE
respondents. Regarding survey results, more than 280 teachers left remarks on what aspects of EMIS they feel
most confident in using, and widely praised the power of the platform to provide comprehensive access to
relevant information and data. What matters most for the teachers is the system’s accessibility and ease of
use. Some teachers also expressed the need for additional training both in EMIS and basic computer literacy, as
well as addressing technical obstacles and challenges in accessing the EMIS system (T-EMIS 4) Open 1; T-EMIS
4) Open 2).
151. Yet this overall support also comes with a caveat, that expectations are now high particularly at the DoE level
and among teachers. The following paraphrases what many of them said: we have made a big effort to input
this data, often on our time and with our own resources (Internet); will it now actually be used as part of a new,
data-driven planning process? The caveat in turn underlines an opportunity and a challenge. The opportunity is
that their support for the system could help to drive forward its implementation and thus support change; but
the challenge is that if it is not used, cynicism risks could set in. This could lead them to disengage from the
change processes that the SO aims at, thus weakening the movement towards outcome-level results.
152. For SO2, the improved planning possibilities arising from the GESPs were supported and valued by the DoE
respondents. Many noted that these possibilities would improve governorate-level decision-making, with
several noting that they could possibly help to reduce the number of girls dropping out of education young;
others noted that they could help to reduce fraud within the system. The same was true of the capacity building
plans. The key question raised by many respondents was whether the GESPs would actually be used and
whether the capacity building plans would go ahead. Similar to with SO1 then, expectations for SO2 were raised
by these plans; yet the concrete longer-term commitments to implement them are still weakly expressed. This
observation is thus linked to the previous effectiveness finding about weak movement towards outcomes, as
well as earlier relevance findings about design challenges in the project in terms of the achievement of
outcomes.
153. Lastly, SO3’s capacity building was strongly valued by teachers. Interviews and FGDs found that they
appreciated the possibility to strengthen their outreach to parents and students, to draw in technologies to
their own teaching in a way that they couldn’t previously, and to theoretically enhance the quality of their

observations.
61 To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of education through roll-out of the Education Management Information
System (EMIS) and increase capacity of education planners, statisticians and educators at governorate level.
62 To strengthen the capacity of MoE at the central and governorate level to improve education services delivery.

teaching to students (how far capacity building actually did enhance their teaching skills is analysed in the
previous finding). The survey data were in line with this, with many teachers expressing their satisfaction with
the ideas from the e-learning training, noting how it helped them to use modern software as tools with their
students. Examples included using Google Forms to do multiple choice tests, Zoom for virtual classes, and
PowerPoint for effective presentations. The e-learning training was also felt to have provided the teachers with
valuable inputs on how to differentiate learning tasks and materials, according to the needs of individual
students (T-E-Learning 6) Open). Yet, some teachers pointed out that the level of usage the e-learning’s ideas
varies among their colleagues: while some embrace and apply the ideas, others do not – either due to
insufficient computer literacy levels, or because these ideas do not suit their teaching style or student needs (T-
E-Learning 7) Open).
Finding 9 (relates to EQ9): Were there any unintended results, either positive or negative, which resulted
from the project?
154. Unintended results of the project relate to lessons learned. This includes learning around how to design
effective partnerships, ensuring efficiency between upstream and downstream work, and assigning roles that
capitalise on partner strengths and ensure longer-term aims are more likely to be achieved. Other unintended
results include learning about facilitating the movement towards outcomes, how a project can create
expectations that unfulfilled risk may negatively impacts on project results, and about reaching vulnerable
populations and planning for climate change.
155. The project had a variety of unintended results, primarily in terms of learning about designing future projects
as well as about reaching vulnerable populations.
156. Regarding the design-related learning, the project’s implementation under – often challenging conditions –
showed the importance of strong coordination mechanisms between all project partners. It underlined how
communication is key to adapting to shifting circumstances. The project also highlighted the importance of
ensuring that meetings include all partners for an integrated project, so that they all have an overall
understanding of challenges as they arise and can contribute to the development of appropriate responses.
157. Relatedly and as discussed previously, one unintended result was learning around ensuring ownership in the
broader sense (as noted in finding 6, where ownership involves becoming progressively more committed to a
project and its success, by virtue of experiencing it as one’s own) and what this means for assigning partner
roles. Further unintended results relate to learning around ensuring movement towards outcomes. In the this
project, that meant more than simply providing capacity building and stronger plans/data, but also mechanisms
to foster movement towards using outcomes (including organisational-level change). This latter observation
underscores the need to balance pressure, including from donors, to propose ambitious project outcomes with
what is realistic within the project’s timeframe and budget.
158. Further unintended results for learning concern how raising expectations among key stakeholders – e.g.
teachers and staff in DoEs who worked hard on the EMIS system and the GESPs – comes with associated risks.
The learning is about the need to ensure a strong plan from the start, in order to capitalise on their built-up
expectations: by also using demonstration effects when possible, e.g. by showing how the EMIS system can
work in practice; and by minimising the chances of those risks materialising.
159. The project also had unintended results in terms of showing how vulnerable populations can be reached with
e-learning, even though this was originally not a deliberate aim. E-learning also proved useful for young people
in rural locations as well as girls and children with a disability, all of whom are more prone to dropping out of
school early.
160. Further unintended results related to how the EMIS system could support strong education planning in the
future on climate change. Although not designed to do that at present, the system could help to anticipate how
populations are forced to migrate internally within the country away from areas with environmental challenges,
e.g. as a result of desertification and lack of water, and related impacts for the allocation of teachers or location
of schools, etc.
Finding 10 (relates to EQ10): What was the quality of the processes mechanisms by which the
intervention’s activities and outputs contributed to outcome-level results?
161. The process by which the intervention’s activities and outputs contributed to outcome-level results is linked
to the causal assumptions of the project – some of which were realised and others not – as well as its ability
to overcome key barriers, challenges and constraints.
47
162. In line with the evaluation’s theory-based methodological approach, the project’s reconstructed Theory of
Change has guided efforts to construct a strong contribution narrative, by examining the linkages between
activities, outputs and outcomes and by paying particular attention to the context. Earlier analysis of the ToC
underlined the importance of making causal assumptions in this process.
163. As was noted above, for outputs to be achieved, assumptions must be realised: if not, there will be an impact
on the project’s results. The key assumptions that proved central to realising the move towards outputs were:
• National government and governorates take on increased responsibilities and leadership.
• MoE and governorate partners engage in a systematic capacity building and planning process.
• Teacher training is delivered in a high-quality, engaging manner with high participation, and teachers use
the EMIS training to enter the required data on that system.
• Implementing partners continue to operate with a sound financial management. They periodically
conduct capacity assessments, together with financial spot checks and audits adapting to the fiduciary
risk level identified.
164. The evaluation has found that these key assumptions were overall realised – as analysis of the evidence in the
findings on effectiveness and on efficiency has shown; hence the project’s success in reaching its output-level
results. Also relevant as a barrier/challenge/constraint on the achievement of outputs were disruptions due to
COVID. This was shown in the earlier findings on effectiveness and on efficiency in particular, because COVID
initially interrupted and ultimately slowed down project activities and thus the achievement of results at the
output level.
165. In the move from outputs to outcomes, the key assumptions were:
• Improved capacities are deployed, including to improve learning.
• Improved plans and data management systems inform decision-making, planning and policies.
166. These assumptions are captured to some extent in the reconstructed Theory of Change’s causal assumptions
developed at the inception phase. Consequently, the observation is that while the assumptions in the
reconstructed ToC were correct, they can now be honed and deepened thanks to the Evaluation Team’s
analysis.
167. A key assumption in moving from output-to-outcome results is a change in organizational behaviour by the
key actors change, when using the outputs.63
168. As has been shown in earlier findings, there is good evidence in this project of improved teacher capacities as
well of the plans and data management systems being developed. But there is little comprehensive evidence of
the capacities being deployed systematically, in a manner informed by the plans and data, i.e. of the output-to-
outcome assumptions holding true. This situation can partly be linked to some of the key actors not having the
capability, opportunity and motivation to do so. In turn, this observation can first be linked to analysis of
ownership and how such ownership is assumed in finding 4 and in the conclusions; and secondly, it can be linked
to analysis of how organisational change processes occur in finding 2 and in the conclusions. Another key
consideration is time, given the observation in earlier findings that ongoing work is required to support the
move towards outcomes. This underlines the importance of several of the external assumptions outlined in the
ToC:
• The need for continued partner commitment to funding projects within Iraq and relatedly, stable and
timely funding for project activities in general.
• Continuing MoE support to improving children and adolescents’ rights to education and protection as
well as to improving educational planning including via strong data.
169. Finally, it is relevant to consider the barriers/challenges/constraints outlined in the ToC. Here, we can
underline the relevance of low technical capacities (as found in all three SOs), poor connectivity (Internet
access), some weak support for change processes and procedures, challenges related to wider public service
63 Here it is useful to draw on the COM-B model of behaviour change, which says that for key actors to change their
behaviour, they must have the capability, opportunity and motivation to do so.63 In this model, ‘capability’ is understood
as the key actors having the ability to participate in an activity and so the behaviour can be accomplished in principle.
‘Opportunity’ refers to external factors that make a behaviour possible, and so there is sufficient opportunity for the
behaviour to occur. And ‘motivation’ refers to the cognitive processes that direct and inspire behaviour, in this case key
actors having sufficient motivation to undertake the behaviour.
48
reform requirements that constrain reform in the MoE, the push-pull between centralisation and
decentralisation, and COVID-related disruptions. These barriers/challenges/constraints impacted negatively on
achieving the assumptions and thus the movement towards outcomes.
170. Overall, the assumptions outlined in the reconstructed ToC for movement to outputs and to outcomes,
alongside certain external assumptions and the project’s ability to overcome key barriers, challenges and
constraints, formed a key lens. This lens helped with understanding how and to what extent activities and
outputs contributed to outcome-level results. The same assumptions also explain why the project has not fully
achieved its outcomes.
Finding 11 (relates to EQ11): Which factors were necessary for the intervention to achieve its intended
output and outcome-level results?
171. The key factors for the project to achieve its output and outcome-level results include the provision of strong
and timely upstream components, including systems (the EMIS system) and capacity building inputs (training
materials and trainers) as well as computers and Internet access. These factors also depend on strong,
adaptive and ongoing engagement by, as well as commitment and institutional support from, project
stakeholders.
172. This finding complements the previous finding, as it focuses on the key factors underlying and driving the
assumptions and thus the movement towards results, including at a design level.
173. Focusing first on design, earlier findings underlined that for the downstream (UNICEF) components to be
realised at the output and outcome level, the upstream project components were needed. For SO1, this was an
operational and maintained EMIS system plus training materials and trained master trainers as well as identified
school-level end-users for training. For SO2, it was national-level education strategy and capacity building plans.
For SO3, it was a pilot training course and related materials, plus trained master trainers. Furthermore, these
upstream components had to be strong and delivered in a timely manner in order for UNICEF’s project to have
the capacity to move ahead. As part of this, key upstream contributions were necessary, e.g. laptop computers
and Internet access.
174. For the actual implementation of UNICEF’s project, the key underlying factor to explain how activities and
outputs contributed to outcome-level results is related to the strong, adaptative and ongoing interactions with,
engagement by, and commitment from, all project stakeholders at multiple levels. This observation requires
some unpacking.
175. Evaluation interviews and FGDs found that UNICEF staff made a significant effort to push forward the project,
including in the face of significant challenges that were especially related to COVID. This push included
committing significant staff time to working on the project in the latter stages (once upstream components
were fully available). Also important were the strong linkages and communication with governorate-level actors
by UNICEF on an ongoing basis over the implementation period. These were built on relationships that UNICEF
has fostered over multiple years, and which are stronger for it. This facilitated adaptation to challenges. A good
example is the master trainers for SO3: they lacked the required technical skills, which meant that new trainers
had to be identified and trained. UNICEF therefore rearranged capacity building workshops. Another example
was in SO1, where UNICEF secured funding for UNESCO to purchase laptops, as a reaction to COVID-related
inflation increasing their price beyond what was originally budgeted. A third example was the inability to gather
large numbers of teachers together in one place for SO3 capacity building, due to COVID-related distancing
rules: the resulting solution was in an agreement to organise more sessions in more rooms on more days. Part
of UNICEF’s ability to play this role is because of its reputation as a strong actor in the education sector among
stakeholders. This supported and fostered a sense of partnership and commitment, which kept the project
moving forward. It should be noted that UNICEF’s ability to do this was facilitated by strong efforts made by the
MoE and UNESCO to drive it forward.
176. That commitment was mirrored by the commitment of stakeholders in the DoEs and at the governorate levels
as well as by teachers. Indeed, interviews and FGDs made clear that they support the project’s objectives, as
well as its activities and outputs as a way to move towards those objectives. This support was seen in their active
participation in the project, and the DoE staff’s encouraging of it. Several interviewees also highlighted that a
key factor driving their commitment was support shown by the Director General in the DoEs and, linked to that,
from the Directors. Also highlighted was generally good political support at the governorate level in the
governorates targeted. However, evidence gathered from several UNICEF staff and other interviewees indicated
49
weaker support in at least one governorate. This weaker support impacted on the quality of project
implementation there, which underlined the importance of political support as an underlying factor. Finally,
interviewees highlighted the good political support – albeit rather weak concrete commitments and weak real
ownership – at the national level (from the Ministry and the Minister’s office).
177. As noted previously, not all stakeholders were enthusiastic about their roles. For example, many teachers
were unhappy about having to enter the EMIS data on their own time and with their own Internet connections.
This showed that stakeholders really need dedicated time and the materials to undertake tasks, if the
intervention is to achieve its results. Yet the observation still stands, because they did that here. This also
underlines that stakeholders were willing to adapt on an ongoing basis to challenges as they arose. Once again,
this was clearly shown in the active usage of WhatsApp and Signal group chats among SO1 trainers and trainees,
and among SO2 trainers and trainees to a slightly lesser extent. These group chats made it possible for them to
develop and share new and user-level solutions to problems encountered along the way and thus to keep the
project components moving forward.
178. Overall, project qualitative data have revealed a broader trend, in terms of Government of Iraq prioritising a
commitment to improve the education system and related support for this priority by the funder and the UN
system. The data in general showed that these FGD and KII respondents are supportive of the project’s larger
aims. They also revealed that the project’s various components are in line with their sense of what needs to be
done to achieve these aims. This includes the need for greater capacities among the key actors involved in the
system, and for the system to be informed and driven by stronger data and planning. For SO1 in particular,
survey results (see Figure 14) found that 75 per cent of the 918 teachers who participated in the survey were
either motivated (46 per cent) or somewhat motivated (29 per cent) to use the EMIS system (T-EMIS 8). And
among government staff, the motivation to use the EMIS system was even higher at 93 per cent (S-EMIS 9).
Overall, this commitment is an important driving factor behind staff’s strong engagement with and commitment
to the project.

system (T-EMIS 8)

1 Agree 2 Somewhat agree 3 Somewhat disagree 4 Disagree
179. It is also important to underline the observations made by multiple key informants. These observations
showed that the external consultants who worked on the project, and on SO1 and SO2 in particular, were central
to its success. Indeed, the strong and high-quality work of these consultants coupled with flexible and proactive
responses to challenges as they arose – including in one case after remuneration for the project had ended –
was positively remarked on by many observers in all respondent groups who had interacted with them.
Finding 12 (relates to EQ12): How well have the progress towards and achievement of output and
outcome-level results been monitored? How well have the risks and changes in contextual factors been
monitored? And how useful was the monitoring information, and analysis of that information for timely
and effectively guiding implementation changes and adjustments?
180. Project monitoring was overall good at the activity and output levels. This included monitoring of
implementation, risks and changes in contexts as well as the capacities of trainees and how to best implement
capacity building. These in turn informed adaptations in the work undertaken through feedback loops. The
50
monitoring of outcome-level results was weak, an observation that can also be linked to weak definition of
the outcomes and the extent to which the project might realistically aim to achieve them.
181. A review of reporting documents to the EU, as well as monitoring documents that include meeting minutes
and field visit reports, showed good project monitoring at the activity and output level for all three SOs. Indeed,
a review of documents has shown that project progress, including challenges faced and the numbers of people
trained, is well documented; the same can be said of progress on the GESPs (SO2). This includes gender-
disaggregated data, but not much more about GEDSI-specific monitoring that is documented or that emerged
in interviews.
182. There is good evidence that the quality of project outputs was overall well monitored, e.g. a post-evaluation
that was done after EMIS training workshops clearly showed survey results on such questions as the relevance
of sessions, the effectiveness of discussions and the quality of training materials. The EMIS teacher survey
respondents and KIIs, as well as FGDs with teachers and other key informants, also made it clear that teachers
provided constructive feedback on project outputs. This feedback was used to adjust the system and the
implementation of training. These feedback loops influenced the design of the EMIS, and the need for stronger
trainer selection, pre-training computer proficiency tests for teachers, and an extended training period beyond
the initial five days (this latter loop was not however adopted). These feedback loops also emphasised the
importance of giving individual computers to users, ensuring reliable Internet access, and dedicated computer
specialists for each school. Finally, teachers recommended simplifying the data entry process and building in
more flexibility: the goal was to make amending information easier, as well as to provide ongoing training
support and follow-up. These various insights helped to improve the system overall, by making it more user-
friendly, accessible, and efficiently managed, thus ensuring the system was better able to play its planning role
for the educational system (T-EMIS 2) Open) & (T-EMIS 5) Open) & (S-EMIS 5) Open).
183. There is thus good evidence that the monitoring data that were generated did support adaptations to
challenges and changes as they arose. The effective communication between the project partners supported
such adaptations, particularly as upstream components were slowed down and downstream components thus
had to be adjusted. Third-party monitors were another aspect of this adaptive management, as was mentioned
by several UNICEF interviewees. They noted the quality of their monitoring and of their feedback, e.g. when
provided on issues that they observed in the field locations. This in turn facilitated timely responses from UNICEF
to such issues. In the words of one interviewee, “…they become almost our eyes and ears in addition to the
programme officers themselves.”
184. However, not all areas of output quality were consistently well monitored: multiple DoE interviewees and
some teachers trained said that, for SO3, the quality of training delivered was not consistently monitored; and
for SO1, many noted that the quality of the data entered on the EMIS system was not consistently monitored.
185. The evaluation found that the monitoring of outcome-level results was weak, based on a review of all data
available and KIIs with UNICEF staff. This was reflected in insufficient outcome data, as well as insuffient data
to monitor the progress from output- to outcome-level results and to generate feedback loops on the
organisational change-related outcomes. Several UNICEF interviewees argued that it was too soon to see
outcome-level results. This observation can be ascribed to the design issues, as well as the linking of the
outcomes that the project aimed at, as highlighted in earlier findings. Overall, the the outcome-level
monitoring was not sufficiently developed for monitoring outcome-level results of this nature.
5.5. Sustainability
This section examines the extent to which the net benefits of the intervention will continue, or are likely
to continue. In analysing sustainability, there is consideration given to the financial, economic, social,
environmental, and institutional capacities of the systems needed to sustain net benefits over time. Given
the duration of the intervention in Iraq, this involves analysing the actual flow of net benefits to date, as
well as estimating the likelihood of net benefits continuing over the medium and long-term and the
capacity of stakeholders to extend those outputs of the project beyond the project’s target groups.
This section addresses the evaluation questions EQ 13, and EQ14 (see Annex 5):
51
Finding 13 (relates to EQ13): To what extent were EMIS and the GESPs being used as intended? And to
what extent has teacher training been institutionalised and influenced plans for scaling-up by the MoE?
186. The sustainability of the project is at present weak. This observation is based on the evidence of EMIS and
the GESPs being comprehensively used, of how the capacity building plans will be implemented, of weak
institutionalisation of teacher training, and of MoE scale-up plans remaining aspirational. So it is now
essential to build on project results.
187. KIIs and FGDs have shown weak sustainability of project results overall and for all three specific objectives,
despite the many achievements of the project. This observation is broken down further below.
188. Regarding SO1, the EMIS system has been populated with data in the targeted areas. But as noted previously,
the system is not currently usable for governorate-level planning, as it has not been rolled out in all schools in
any one governorate. Furthermore, while there is good commitment to the system from all stakeholder groups,
the commitment at MoE level remains aspirational: because there is not yet a strong and definitive financial
commitment to maintaining and further rolling out the system. This highlights the issue of ownership, as was
discussed in earlier findings. To maintain the system, MoE and UNESCO as well as other interviewees, clear
stated that significant technical capacity building for the Ministry has been implemented so that the system can
continue to run. Yet capacity levels are still too low to be able to do this. Moreover, according to several key
informants, it is doubtful that the MoE is ready to run the system, especially given the heavy ongoing workload
involved in doing so. One other key informant also noted that individuals who are trained to a level where they
could run the system could also command much higher wages outside the Ministry – employee retention in the
government could thus be a problem. Multiple other teachers in KIIs and FGDs noted that a significant number
of teachers who trained to enter data on the EMIS system have now moved to other schools. Yet there are no
concrete plans to train new EMIS-dedicated teachers to replace them.
189. Earlier findings have observed that SO2’s GESPs and capacity building plans are complete. From a sustainability
perspective, the challenge underlined by multiple interviewees (particularly at the DoE level) is that the GESPs
are not being consistently used. Additionally, while such plans are complete, they also become outdated and so
there is a limited time period in which they are most useful. Likewise, while the sector coordination committees
designed to drive forward implementation have begun to be established, they are not fully operational. Just as
importantly, there is no clearly committed funding from the MoE for implementing the capacity building plans
required to fully implement the GESPs. Indeed, many DoE and MoE interviewees expressed hopes that outside
funders, working through the UN, would cover this cost. Some DoE and MoE interviewees – as well as several
from UNICEF – also made clear that part of the challenge is the fact that much of the MoE’s budget is committed
to staff salaries, thus there are relatively few uncommitted funds to dedicate to intensive capacity building.
190. SO3’s training has also been undertaken, as earlier effectiveness findings made clear. But regarding
sustainability, as mentioned in finding 2 (relevance) and finding 7 (effectiveness), the training is weak. That is
because the project design did not envision institutionalising the training beyond the specific teachers trained.
Furthermore, several teacher interviewees noted that there was interest in hearing more about their e-learning
training from other teachers in their schools. But many more said that there was little interest, little direct
support from school heads to amplify the training’s impact by passing it on to other teachers, and that many
other teachers’ technical capacities are quite low and thus they would have difficulty in taking on the training
even if they were interested. This underlines the narrow foundations of SO3’s capacity building, with no clear
mechanism in place to ensure sustainability beyond the teachers initially trained and their own interest in
carrying on using it, and there is no clear and funded scale-up plan from the MoE.
191. Overall, what this finding makes clear is the weak sustainability of the project, other than through work that
builds on the work already done and that explicitly addresses the weaknesses identified in this evaluation. This
observation underlines that project results are at a critical juncture, particularly given that the three SOs’ results
will gradually weaken (capacity building) or become more out of date (plans and data systems).
5.6. Gender Equity/JbWMGB, Human Rights and Climate Change
Gender equality/JbWMGB is the concept that women and men, girls and boys are meant to have equal
conditions, treatment and opportunities for realising their full potential, human rights and dignity, and
for contributing to (and benefiting from) economic, social, cultural and political development. For UNICEF,
equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential
without discrimination, bias or favouritism. Human rights are, for UNICEF, standards that recognise and
52
protect the dignity of all human beings. Human rights govern how individual human beings live in society
and with each other, as well as their relationship with the State and the obligations that the State has
towards them. A final principle central to this evaluation is climate change, in particular climate change-
related adaptation and mitigation measures.
This section addresses the evaluation questions EQ15 and EQ 16 (see Annex 5):
Finding 14 (relates to EQ15): To what degree were gender, human rights and equity principles integrated
into the design, implementation and monitoring of the intervention?
192. There is some evidence of gender principles/JbWMGB being integrated into the project for SO164 and SO2,65
and of their possibly forming the basis for further gender-targeted/JbWMGB programming when the EMIS
system and GESPs are ultimately used. There is also some good evidence of human rights and equity principles
being incorporated into SO1 and into SO2, though with some variability in SO2. SO366 could partly contribute
to this, those this would not be by design.
193. A document review found that the design in the proposal does not explain in detail how gender/JbWMGB is
or was prioritised as a cross-cutting issue. Nor does the design clearly explain how gender/JbWMGB was to be
implemented concretely across the project. Likewise, other project strategic and planning documents available
do not explain, prioritise or analyse gender/JbWMGB in detail, other than the admittedly important component
of disaggregating data by gender to track progress and impact. Relatedly, there is evidence of such
disaggregation in the monitoring data, e.g. with the numbers of teachers reached for capacity building broken
down by gender. Interviews with UNICEF staff, and with the UNICEF social inclusion specialist, have confirmed
that gender analysis/JbWMGB was done as part of the needs assessments. Analysis of documentary data and
KIIs with UNICEF did not find that there was a differentiated approach to boys, girls, and men or women Rights
Holders.
194. Interview data with the EMIS system designer and EMIS users – including teachers, DoE staff and at the MoE
– made clear that the EMIS system includes gender disaggregated data. Furthermore, 96 per cent of all 56
respondents among government staff agreed or somewhat agreed that the EMIS system sufficiently
differentiates between boys and girls in order to inform stronger education planning (S-EMIS-3). This data in
turn could feed into governorate-level planning, which could take the differential needs and vulnerabilities of
boys and girls into consideration when designing or adapting programming, whenever the system is eventually
used. Moreover, the system would be able to analyse intersectional vulnerabilities as a result of co-relating
them and thus form the basis for targeting these; this too could happen when the system is eventually used.
For the EMIS training, there was no evidence of gender considerations/JbWMGB playing a role in shaping how
the capacity development was designed or implemented. There was also no evidence in the qualitative KII and
FGD data of women teachers having different results than men, in terms of the capacity building activities.
195. SO2 had a stronger and more deliberate gender/JbWMGB component, with the GESPs incorporating fairly
strong gender/JbWMGB disaggregated analysis and insights about how to address particular vulnerabilities
(primarily related to female school drop-out rates). Intersectional vulnerabilities of women and girls were also
analysed in the GESPs, e.g. how the socio-economic situation of women differs from that of men. The GESPs
also analysed internal and external risks and their impact on gender/JbWMGB, as well as considering mitigation
strategies. However, this analysis could have been deeper and more complete in order to be actionable. The
capacity development plans under this SO were not specifically tailored to target women differently than men.
196. SO3 had no specific gender-related/JbWMGB component, such as how teachers might target girls differently
than boys in order to enhance learning or prioritise learning around gender/JbWMGB as a thematic priority in
the e-learning materials. Nor was there evidence of gender disaggregation/JbWMGB playing a role in shaping
how the capacity development was designed or implemented. SO2 could potentially be used to target
gender/JbWMGB related vulnerabilities, by using e-learning to reach girls who do not attend school regularly.
64 To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of education through roll-out of the Education Management Information
System (EMIS) and increase capacity of education planners, statisticians and educators at governorate level.
65 To strengthen the capacity of MoE at the central and governorate level to improve education services delivery.
66 To enhance the quality of teaching and learning by operationalising the capacity development plan and developing
teachers’ capacities at central and governorate levels.
53
Yet multiple teacher and DoE interviewees argued that the girls who do not attend school regularly are likely
not allowed to have access to a mobile phone (to access the e-learning). The interviewees also said that these
vulnerable girls often come from poorer and more rural backgrounds, where access to a mobile phone and to
the Internet is more problematic. This unintended effect related to intersectional vulnerabilities – ‘unintended’
because it was not deliberately designed into the project – would thus be unlikely to help address the issue.
This overall qualitative analysis is in contrast with the survey data, where 91 per cent of teaching staff concurred
with the statement that the e-learning training included an appropriate amount of attention to the different
needs of boys and girls (T-E-Learning 5 – see Figure below). The reason for this variation is not clear. Finally,
there was no evidence in the qualitative KII and FGD data of women teachers having different results than men
in the capacity building activities.
197. Regarding human rights and equity principles more generally, the interviewees cited above were clear that
SO1’s EMIS system includes a strong profile of students. This includes profiling potential disabilities, socio-
economic vulnerabilities, learning difficulties, as well as special needs: all of which were deliberately designed
into the system. These dimensions could help to ensure equity and rights principles, because children who are
more likely to drop out of school – or whose learning needs are not appropriately met – can be identified and
potentially targeted with programming when the system is operational. SO2 was more variable on this
dimension. In other words, some GESPs and education sector analyses included very strong analysis on rights
and equity, in terms of vulnerabilities and access. These analyses also included analysis of disabilities and how
to address them, so as to ensure access to school, as well as differential analysis by disability. This analysis was
paired with strong contextual analysis of the particular conditions in the governorate. Other GESPs were weaker
on this dimension, with no clear pattern as to why (e.g. the Muthanna and the Rusafa 2 plans included strong
components than the others reviewed). Here too, equity and rights-related principles could flow from those
GESPs that strongly included this analysis as implementation moves forward. SO3 did not specifically target
rights and equity principles in its design, implementation or monitoring. Yet it did do so implicitly, since those
fundamental rights related to access and inclusion especially for vulnerable groups, e.g. children with a
disability, could be addressed through implementation of the e-learning. Yet multiple teacher FGDs said that
they did not think this would happen in practice. These qualitative data contrast with the survey data, since of
the 918 teaching staff respondents, 82 per cent agreed that the e-learning paid enough attention to the needs
of vulnerable populations, such as disabled or socially excluded Rights Holders (T-E-Learning 4 – see Figure
below). It is unclear why there is a difference between the qualitative and quantitative data. One government
staff respondent said that the current system does not allow for systematically recording orphaned children,
with a view to better monitoring their needs and providing them with additional resources as needed (S-EMIS
3) Open).

differentiates between boys and girls to inform stronger education planning (S-EMIS 3). Further, it shows the overwhelming perception
of teachers (n=572) whether the online training sufficiently addresses the needs of vulnerable populations (T-E-Learning 4) as well
addressing the different needs of boys and girls (T-E-Learning 5).

198. One area that was highlighted in one FGD was that e-learning could help to provide a solution to the many
overcrowded classrooms in Iraq, by supplementing in-class learning with remote learning. If implemented, this
54
could then help to ensure that more young people could continue to benefit from education, despite
overcrowded classrooms.
Finding 15 (relates to EQ16): To what degree have climate change mitigation and adaptation measures been
addressed in the design and implementation of the intervention?
199. Climate change mitigation and adaptation measures were not specifically addressed in the project design
and implementation, although there are areas of potential overlap between the project and SDG 13.
200. The project did not specifically integrate climate change mitigation or adaptation measures in any of the SOs.
This point emerged from interviews, including those with UNICEF and DoE staff, as well as from document
review. This lack of such measures does not match with SDG 1367 clearly having areas of potential overlap with
the project – e.g. SO3 could have been linked to the target about improving education, awareness-raising and
human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.
201. It could be argued that the EMIS system, when fully deployed, could inform stronger planning on climate
issues. For example, the system would make it easier to continue to track children if their families move for
climate-related reasons and in cases where more or less teachers and schools might be needed if people were
to move for climate-related reasons. Other possibilities are tracking infrastructure that could be vulnerable to
climate change, including schools or other MoE facilities. Yet the GESPs do not specifically anticipate climate-
related movement and the possible implications for where schools and teachers might be needed; nor does the
EMIS deliberately include climate vulnerability data fields. Thus, these positive scenarios are still hypothetical,
which underlines the finding that the project did not specifically integrate climate change mitigation or
adaptation measures.

6. Conclusions
202. The following conclusions flow from the evaluation report’s findings, presenting larger insights arising from
them. The conclusions underline the project’s success overall at achieving results in a largely efficient manner.
This was done through a partnership approach that worked quite well, with some areas for strengthening
particularly related to engendering ownership and leveraging stakeholder engagement. This success was
achieved in the face of some significant challenges, especially related to COVID. However, this success can be
balanced against weaker results related to achieving outcomes, due to the longer-than-the-project timeline for
achieving them, as well as due to underestimating the fostering of organisational change, a key element that
would ensure their achievement. However, the project’s objectives and pathways for reaching those objectives
are supported by stakeholders, which is an essential enabler of achieving the outcome-level changes. The key
challenge is how to capitalise on that stakeholder support and commitment, in order to build upon and
consolidate movement towards project outcomes. These key themes are elaborated in what follows.
Conclusion 1: Achievement of results
203. The project was overall successful in achieving its targeted output-level results in a largely efficient manner,
despite significant challenges, especially related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The strong achievement of
output-level results is not echoed at the outcome level.
204. The project management’s responsiveness to the evolving context, aided by a 10-month no-cost-extension,
and a high degree of financial management prowess in response to the pandemic, enabled the project to
achieve its output-level results across all three specific objectives (SOs), including the successful establishment
and roll-out of EMIS (SO1), development of education capacity plans (SO2), and enhancement of teachers'
capacities for e-learning (SO3). The achievement of outcome-level results was hindered by some deeper project
design issues. Most activities took place toward the end of the project, at which point the attempt to measure
most outcome-level changes would have been premature, since outcome-level changes can take time to
manifest themselves. Measuring outcome-level changes at an organisational or institutional level is complex
and therefore challenging, because outcome results largely depend on the organisation’s capacity to create the
enabling conditions for moving from outputs towards achieving outcome-level results. Furthermore, the project
needs strong outcome-level monitoring mechanisms, including adapted indicators, and feedback loops that can
inform effective decision-making and coordination of all relevant actors at a strategic level. Additionally, due to
the longer-than-the-project timeline for achieving outcome results, the project’s management did not have
sufficient information on time to make decisions that could lead to the achievement of the outcome results.
205. Regarding the larger organisational change processes required, the findings show that capacity building and
putting the development of planning tools do not lead automatically to the usage of these newly developed
capacities and planning tools. Using new capacities and tools in order to facilitate the move towards data-driven
decision-making and planning, and thus the achievement of the outcome-level results, also requires
organisational-level change, including appropriate incentisization and ownership building measures. This is also
relevant for SO3’s e-learning not including measures to amplify the capacity building beyond the core group of
teachers trained, via institutionalisation. The evaluation findings thus call into question the project’s implicit
assumption that individual-level capacity building and the creation of sophisticated planning tools will on their
own produce organisational-level change and ultimately system-level change (in Iraq’s education system). A
further observation is that the project’s outcomes were relatively siloed from one another. This reduced their
ability to create synergistic change, which is particularly relevant given how an effective EMIS system should
support governorate-level planning guided by a GESP and stronger staff capacities.
206. Perhaps most crucially, the project’s capacity to reach those objectives depends on the effective engagement
of relevant stakeholders across all levels. Hence, the key challenge is how to capitalise on their support and
commitment to build upon and consolidate movement towards project outcomes in a sustainable way.
Fortunately, the project benefited from a very effective partnership and coordination mechanism with relevant
stakeholders providing a strong foundation to fulfill this requirement.
Conclusion 2: Adaptive management and stakeholder commitment
207. The achievement of results at the output level is linked to the strong adaptive management in the face of
significant slowdowns during implementation, as well as strong stakeholder commitment and coherence,
56
especially between UNICEF and UNESCO. The adaptive management strategies at activity-output level involved
adjusting timelines, sharing new financial resources with the other partners to ensure their upstream elements
were not holding up downstream work, and dedicating significant staff time to the project once work was
possible in its latter stages. Such strategies are at the root of the project’s success in a challenging and
changeable implementation context, as is the project’s fostering of the strong stakeholder commitment that
supports it both at a management level but especially amongst the local-level actors that feed directly into the
system, such as teachers and DoE staff. Yet the strong commitment of these stakeholders comes with increased
expectations that if there is no further progress and concrete uptake of outputs, especially by the MoE, there is
a risk of frustration and even disengagement developing. This underlines that the project results are at a key
juncture, where further engagement and follow-up are necessary in the near term, in order to build on the
successes already achieved. This observation also underlines the need to manage the expectations, given the
large changes aimed at, including with the donors and with implementing partners.
Conclusion 3: Theory of Change
208. The project’s Theory of Change did not fully grasp and address the complexity of the change process it was
aiming to achieve. This is reflected in some linkages and assumptions not being sufficiently clear or strong. A
more detailed ToC could have supported the movement from output towards outcome-level results. This is also
reflected in the strong monitoring of results at the output level but weaker monitoring at the outcome level; a
stronger ToC could have informed a selection of process indicators related to linkages between outputs and
outcomes and stronger outcome-level monitoring; this in turn would have allowed feedback loops and
consequently would have informed an analysis of what was working and what was not working in the move
towards outcomes. A stronger ToC would thus have informed a stronger response to improving those results
through adaptive management approaches.
Conclusion 4: Partnership between UNICEF, UNESCO and MoE
209. The project’s partnership approach between UNICEF, UNESCO and the MoE and the linkages between the
upstream and downstream components in general worked well, even if slowdowns upstream inevitably
affected downstream work. In particular UNICEF boasts a strong network and pre-existing relationships with
many key actors in Iraq at the sub-national level; its good reputation amongst these actors and the resultant
trust that has been built up over time; and, its extensive experience in providing training related to education.
The project partnership assigned roles to UNICEF based on these strengths and that capitalised on these
strengths. This was also a key factor in facilitating the project’s ability to achieve results, especially as project
implementation ended up being done under tight timelines.
210. The findings have underlined the importance of putting in place strong and inclusive communications and
coordination mechanisms both horizontally (between partners, including the donors) and vertically (between
upper management and field level staff), as these helped to facilitate adaptive management strategies based
on identifying and responding to implementation opportunities and challenges as these arose. Also, there was
good horizontal communication and coordination amongst the three core partners, though there was
sometimes a tendency to hold bilateral meetings, when the inclusion of all partners would have helped to
ensure a shared, project-level view of progress and challenges. Notwithstanding, such horizontal connections
at the level of UNICEF, UNESCO and the MoE were not complemented by strong vertical connections between
central-level duty bearers like the MoE. Similarly, there were no strong vertical connections between
implementing agencies like UNICEF and UNESCO and local-level secondary duty bearers further down the
implementation chain, such as teachers and DoE staff. The weaker vertical feedback loops may have
compounded the slow achievement of outcome results, since challenges were not being quickly communicated
up the line and addressed.
Conclusion 5: Ownership
211. Regarding ownership more generally, the evaluation highlighted that insufficiently concrete tasks were
assigned to the MoE, which weakened its ownership of the project. The conclusion is that strong ownership
does not arise without substantive engagement through adopting a range of active roles in the project, including
the organisation that is to take ownership supporting it with clear financial commitments. A higher degree of
ownership within the MoE, coupled with stronger adoption and institutionalisation of capacity building
measures on EMIS by the MoE, could have increased the project’s sustainability.
57
Conclusion 6: Climate change mitigation and adaptation measures
212. The context in Iraq is particularly prone to climate-related fragilities, with potential impacts on education, e.g.
through population movements but also by virtue of the need to increase young peoples’ awareness and to
encourage their informed efforts to help combat climate change. Climate change mitigation and adaptation
measures were not foreseen in the design of the project: that is a significant weakness of the project, given
the context of Iraq and given the conceptual room to integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation
measures in the project’s design.
Conclusion 7: Gender/JbWMGB principles
213. The integration of gender principles across the project varied, with explicit attention given to SO2 and more
implicit considerations in SO1. Despite gender-disaggregated data inclusion and analysis, there was a lack of a
differentiated approach in terms of programming for boys, girls, men, or women. The monitoring system did
not thoroughly address gender/JbWMBG issues, with gaps in articulating how gender would be prioritised
and implemented across project components. While potential exists for gender considerations in the EMIS
system’s future use, explicit strategies were absent.
58
7. Lessons Learned
Lesson Learned 1: Partnerships
214. Relates to findings 4, 6, 9, and 11.
215. Strong partnerships are a key way to achieve strong project results. Such partnerships have roles assigned
to partners that are aligned with their organisational strengths in the particular implementing context;
incorporate clear communication and feedback loops that inform an adaptive management strategy; and,
incorporate the elements needed to foster assumption of the longer-term roles the project expects partners
to assume (ownership in particular).
216. The project’s implementing partnership was a key factor impacting upon results – and breaking down the
components of what worked well and what worked less well provides some important lessons learned. This is
especially the case as there is an increasing move towards cooperative partnerships amongst UN entities and
with national partners, both in Iraq and more broadly.
217. The first lesson emerging under the umbrella of partnerships is related to UNICEF’s strong network and pre-
existing relationships with many key actors in Iraq at the sub-national level; its good reputation amongst these
actors and the resultant trust that has been built up over time; and, its extensive experience in providing training
related to education. The project partnership assigned roles to UNICEF based on these strengths and that
capitalised on these strengths. This was also a key factor in facilitating its ability to achieve results, especially as
project implementation ended up being done under tight timelines. The lesson then is to appropriately assess
the relative strengths of partners in the national/sub-national context where a project would be implemented,
including their reputation and thus ability to bring stakeholders onboard to the project (especially where it is
advancing a new approach to working), and thereby to facilitate achievement of project results.
218. A second lesson under the partnerships umbrella is related to their smooth functioning. More specifically, the
project has underlined the broader point that it is important to put in place strong and inclusive communications
and coordination mechanisms, both horizontally (between partners, including the donors) and vertically
(between upper management and field level staff). Doing so helps to facilitate adaptive management strategies
based on identifying and responding to implementation opportunities and challenges as these arise. These
strategies are also facilitated by inter-organisational and inter-personal relationships amongst organisational
staff, relationships that have been built over time and thus bring trust and an understanding of the others’ work
processes that can smooth planning and implementation. This is particularly important in fragile and conflict-
affected or post-conflict contexts, given the greater likelihood of shifts in the context that could impact on the
project.
219. A final dimension under the partnerships umbrella is related to building in appropriate measures, in order to
allow partners to fulfil their roles. This is a narrower lesson related to ownership and how it is fostered. Insights
from organisational assessments show that ownership emerges from actively participating in designing,
implementing and ideally co-funding project components and thereby becoming progressively more committed
to them and their success by virtue of experiencing them as (at least partially) one’s own. If then, as in many
UNICEF projects, the aim is for ownership to ultimately be assumed by a government entity, it is important to
ensure that these pre-requisites to the assumption of ownership are put in place as part of the partnership’s
assigning of roles.
Lesson Learned 2: Project Design and Implementation
220. Relates to findings 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13.
221. A strong project design, rooted in a realistic appraisal of what is to be achieved is critical for achievement
of project results, especially at the outcome level, and it should be based on a jointly constructed and
subsequently utilised Theory of Change.
222. The project has shown that individual-level capacity building and putting together sophisticated planning tools
do not on their own produce organisational-level change – e.g. within a government ministry – or ultimately
system-level change (e.g. in an education system). This is partly related to the timelines to achieve those results
at the outcome level, an observation that can also be linked to pressure, including from funders to articulate
ambitious outcome-level results. But more fundamentally, it is because usage of built capacities and planning
59
tools within the organisation and thus achievement of outcome-level results also requires organisational-level
change, in terms of changing approaches to planning, decision-making and work processes.
223. The lesson then is about the importance of collaboratively working with all stakeholders at the concept note
and proposal stage, in order to ensure that there is a strong and realistic Theory of Change. Such a ToC would
have assumptions that are clearly articulated. For example, this project’s assumption that teachers would input
data to EMIS during their free time rather than during the work day, which is clearly problematic for
sustainability, would have become clear in such a process and so could have been mitigated in the project
design. An early inclusion of key stakeholders would also have appropriate mechanisms for achieving results
realistically appraised and incorporated into the project design, e.g. including mechanisms to foster concrete
commitment from higher management. This is particularly the case for activities such as individual capacity
building, which intuitively make sense as being the key to moving towards a larger result – but are in fact
important though often not sufficient on their own to do this. Furthermore, subsequently using that Theory of
Change to inform implementation, including as the project (and its ToC) is adapted during implementation, will
strengthen the achievement of results. Lastly, ensuring that outcome-level results are realistic and achievable
will help to ensure that the project is not ultimately judged against unrealisable standards.
Lesson Learned 3: Gender, Equity, Human Rights and Climate Change
224. Relates to findings 14 and 15.
225. Gender equity, human rights and climate change are project elements that can be weak, often due to a
weak understanding of how to incorporate them or of their importance. Addressing this requires proactively
anticipating the weakness and prioritising addressing it at both the design and implementation stages of
projects.
226. The project has shown how gender equity, human rights and climate change can be somewhat lost in the
approach adopted and during implementation. This is especially because while ‘mainstreaming’ actually means
including these elements across all project components, the reality is that it sometimes ends up with them not
being strongly integrated into any of them. Yet not including these elements, or only including simplified
dimensions of them such as gender disaggregation, is problematic given UNICEF’s institutional commitments.
As the Evaluation Team found however, a key challenge is that staff capacities to do this can sometimes be
lower than necessary, compounded by staff positions dedicated to supporting on them not always being filled
in-country. Furthermore, issues related to climate change can risk seeming less urgent in a fragile and conflict-
affected or post-conflict context, and thus not appropriately emphasised.
227. The lesson then is that strongly integrating gender equity, human rights and climate change into projects
requires specifically reviewing for these elements at the project design stage and then throughout
implementation, as well as drawing on expertise from UNICEF’s own experts, including from abroad if necessary.
Lesson Learned 4: Project Monitoring
228. Relates to finding 12.
229. Monitoring at the output and outcome level, as well as feedback mechanisms, are important tools for
achieving results and should not be omitted from projects.
230. The fourth lesson relates specifically to monitoring. The evaluation found that the project had weak outcome-
level monitoring data, as well as weak monitoring of the linkages between outputs and outcomes. Earlier lessons
learned underlined the need to clearly articulate how outcomes are to be achieved, including incorporating the
appropriate mechanisms into the project’s design to facilitate this process. Here, the lesson is that strong
outcome-level monitoring and feedback loops on what that monitoring finds can be important tools for
adjusting the project’s approach and thus to facilitate movement towards outcomes. This includes monitoring
of organisational change-related outcomes, based on appropriate indicators, when these are central to the
project. Without such mechanisms, the chances of achieving outcomes are reduced, especially in fragile and
conflict-affected or post-conflict contexts where adjustments to the project are more likely to be required.
60
8. Recommendations
232. The recommendations are linked to the findings, conclusions and lessons learned in the report. They have
been reviewed by UNICEF staff in a series of rounds of comments, as well as in a recommendations workshop
with the key stakeholders for the project, including representatives from the Ministry of Education and others.
These different reviews in turn informed revisions made to them in different drafts of the evaluation report.
Recommendation 1: Maintain and Expand Work on Focus Areas of the Project
233. For UNICEF, the MoE, UNESCO and the EU (relates to findings 1, 8, and 9).
UNICEF and its partners should plan for and implement further work on the focus areas of the project,
to build upon its promising yet incomplete results. This should be done in the near-term, especially as
the project’s achievements will weaken/become progressively more outdated over time.
234. The evaluation has made clear that the project achieved some notable results in all three Specific Objective
areas, related to capacity building and planning as well as database systems to support such planning.
Furthermore, it showed that the work is relevant to the context in the country based on assessed needs. The
evaluation has found good evidence of support for and commitment to those various Specific Objectives and
the results they aim at amongst stakeholders, notably teachers as well as DoE and MoE staff.
235. This represents a positive initial results that constitutes a foundation for continuing to improve the strength
of Iraq’s education system, and are the basis for the core recommendation: UNICEF and its partners should build
upon the project’s strong foundation with further work in the areas that the three SOs focused on. Most
importantly, this should be done in the near term. This is because the project’s achievements to-date will
weaken over time, whether due to capacity building fading from memory, due to plans becoming outdated and
no longer as coherent with the context, or because of enthusiasm and support for the project’s components
amongst stakeholders fading over time.
Recommendation 2: Revise and Fine-tune Theory of Change and Project Design at Large
236. For UNICEF, the MoE, UNESCO and the EU (relates to findings 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13, and 14).
UNICEF and its partners should also address challenges in the project’s design and implementation in
any further work, by: ensuring that new capacities, tools and plans are effectively used as part of a
process of organisational capacity building that leads to system strengthening (and that this is captured
in a strong Theory of Change); building the MoE’s ownership by strongly engaging it in planning and
implementation and with all partners making significant financial contributions; creating a
demonstration effect by covering all the schools in governorates so that the EMIS and GESP can be used;
connecting together different project components to create synergies; ensuring strong monitoring at
output and outcome levels, with feedback loops to inform adaptive management; and, ensuring that
teachers have Internet access and dedicated time for undertaking their EMIS work.
237. While the first recommendation highlighted the strengths of the project to build upon, the evaluation has also
outlined challenges as regards facilitating movement towards outcomes and achieving sustainability. These
challenges should be addressed in any future work, and include:
• Revise and refine the project’s Theory of Change by incorporating components aimed at building the
ability and the will to robustly use the new capacities, tools and plans in the ways intended. The revised
ToC should explicitly articulate risks, assumptions, and how the project will move from activities to
outputs and outcomes. The observation here is that authoring strong plans, building strong data systems
and building capacities for key stakeholders at the individual level are important, but not enough on their
own given the broader, systemic-level changes aimed at by the project. Future work phases should, at the
concept note phase, conduct a review of good practices on organisational capacity building. More
specifically, these phases should focus on how complex organisations like the Ministry of Education adopt
more data-driven ways of work related to planning and decision-making and more effectively draw upon
and institutionalise newly built staff capacities, and then ultimately translate these into system
strengthening. These insights should then inform the development of activities, as well as related outputs
and outcomes, which would be incorporated into the project design for any possible future phases.
61
• Fostering the Ministry of Education’s ownership of the project and thus the sustainability of its results, by
engaging it more strongly in project design, and ensuring that it plays a strong role in the implementation
of project components similar to other project partners. Furthermore, all project partners should make
substantial financial contributions, again aimed at increasing shared ownership and thus supporting
sustainability.
• Focusing upon ensuring all schools in selected governorates are covered by the EMIS system, to facilitate
actually using the EMIS and the GESPs as governorate-level planning tools. Future work should also ensure
a robust learning mechanism is built in, to capture and publicise learning about the effects of this process,
so as to inform a demonstration effect for other governorates and thus greater support for the shift in
approach.
• Ensuring that the different project components are connected together, with linkages such that for
example the EMIS system and its users are also drawing in the GESPs, so as to create greater synergies in
the work.
• Related to the previous point about learning mechanisms, any further work should build upon the project’s
strong monitoring at the output level, by incorporating strong monitoring at the outcome level, as well as
monitoring of the linkages between outputs and outcomes. This includes capturing data about how plans,
data systems and capacity building measures were actually put into practice, including at the organisational
level, as well as the effects (if any) of this. Given the timeline for such changes, it would also be important
to have short-term as well as longer-term indicators, with the latter possibly planned to be reached in
future iterations of the project's work. Finally, it would be important to build in strong feedback loops to
the monitoring, so as to facilitate ongoing adaptive management practices.
• Lastly, any further work should address the very real concerns of user-level stakeholders and particularly
teachers, related to Internet access and dedicated time for undertaking their EMIS-related tasks. Other
concerns expressed included the perception of many that further training related to EMIS was needed, that
this should also be supported with basic computer literacy training, and that short YouTube clips should be
produced showing EMIS users standard work procedures.
Recommendation 3: Strengthening the Project’s Partnership Approach
238. For UNICEF, the MoE, UNESCO and the EU (relates to findings 4, 5, 7, 10, and 12).
UNICEF and its partners should replicate the strong partnership approach in the future, while also
ensuring that learnings from this partnership inform how the partnership approach could be further
improved. These include building in strong linkages between upstream and downstream components
(and possibly sharing these components amongst partners); capitalising on partner strengths in
assigning roles; building in conditional timeline commitments; building in mechanisms for each partner
to be able to strongly support the other; incorporating robust communication mechanisms to support
adaptive management; and, ensuring that linked partnership projects are evaluated together.
239. The partnership between UNICEF, UNESCO and the MoE has been a key strength of this project, incorporating
strong linkages between upstream and downstream components and capitalising on many of the institutional
strengths of each partner. Furthermore, this partnership approach is in line with institutional commitments
made in the UN Cooperation Framework for Iraq. The approach should thus be continued for future work
projects. But learnings from this project should also inform how partnerships are designed and implemented in
the future. Key insights include:
• Consider partnership arrangements where upstream and downstream components are shared amongst
partners, to ensure that none of the partners is kept waiting on the other’s work.
• Build in timeline commitments that are conditional, i.e. assuming that a particular upstream component is
completed by x date, or the linked downstream component will be completed by y date.
• Build in mechanisms for strongly supporting other project partners, including the possibility for shifting
project resources amongst partners to support moving components forward in a timely manner (with
appropriate communication with and oversight from the funder).
62
• Build in robust mechanisms communication mechanisms for inclusive, joint planning and discussions
amongst all partners, so that all partners are fully aware of and party to challenges and decisions. These
should be both horizontal (between partners) and vertical (between upper management and field-level
staff), so as to facilitate adaptive management strategies based on responding to opportunities and
challenges as these arise. They should also draw in donors, to ensure strong coordination with them and
thus smooth functioning of, including adjustments to, the project.
• Ensure that linked partnership projects are evaluated together as a coherent whole, given that this is how
they are designed rather than as separate projects, to avoid learning ending up siloed.
Recommendation 4: Maintain Sensitivity to Shifting Needs of Target Populations in a Volatile
Environment
240. For UNICEF, the MoE, UNESCO and the EU (relates to findings 1, 3, and 8).
UNICEF should ensure that all components in its future projects are the most appropriate in line with
the project’s needs analysis and the project proposal, based on both the immediate context and longer-
term aims.
241. This project’s thematic focus for the SO3 learning module, e-learning, was decided upon within a crisis context
related to the COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdowns of schools as well as limitations on movement. The
evaluation found that the Specific Objective did produce some good results, though also questioned whether it
was the most appropriate focus given the broader capacity needs identified amongst teachers and listed in
Finding 1. While the decision in this case was outside UNICEF’s control, it is still an important opportunity for
learning that can inform UNICEF’s future work.
• Put in place a requirement to ensure that decisions about what to focus on within future projects is justified
by a thorough needs analysis, (in line with the project proposal’s longer-term aims as well as including
contingency planning appropriate for a crisis context.
Recommendation 5: Include Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Measures
242. For UNICEF, the MoE, UNESCO and the EU (relates to finding 15).
UNICEF and its partners should ensure that future project iterations incorporate strong climate change
mitigation and adaptation measures, particularly into education-related projects where there is a
possibility to embed such measures into policy and learning. This would include incorporating them into
all future GESPs, the EMIS system, and capacity building measures.
243. UNICEF has made strong institutional commitments related to incorporating climate change components into
its projects, including developing a methodology for monitoring climate change through schools and using EMIS
(with relevant indicators). These commitments are even more important in Iraq, given the vulnerability of the
country to climate-related challenges. Yet the evaluation has found that such components were not
incorporated into the project’s design or its implementation, despite there being many ways in which this could
have been productively done given the project’s educational focus.
• Include climate components, even when key stakeholders might argue – as several did in this evaluation’s
KIIs – that their inclusion is not a priority, and moreover to do so in a manner that maximises its impact.
This would include a requirement to incorporate climate components into future GESPs, the EMIS system,
as well as capacity building measures for key stakeholders.
