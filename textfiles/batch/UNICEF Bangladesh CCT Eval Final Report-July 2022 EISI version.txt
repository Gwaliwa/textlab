Executive Summary
1. Context and Background
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Bangladesh commissioned the Economic Policy Research Institute
(EPRI) to conduct an evaluation of the Conditional Cash Transfer programme (CCT programme) of the Child
Sensitive Social Protection project in Bangladesh, implemented from 2012 to 2019 in Bangladesh. The evaluation
was conducted between the period 2016/17 to March 2022.
Context. Children in Bangladesh have continued to be particularly vulnerable and an estimated 33 million children
live in poverty.1 In 2008, UNICEF Bangladesh and the Ministry of Social Welfare (MoSW) implemented an 18-
month cash transfer pilot programme “Amader Shishu/Our child” to support orphan and vulnerable children in
seven upazilas affected by the 2007 Cyclone Sidr. UNICEF replicated the programme in old Dhaka city in
partnership with the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA) and MoSW with the objective of
reducing child labour and child marriage.
Object of evaluation. The CCT programme of the child sensitive social protection project (CSSP) in Bangladesh
was implemented from 2008 to May 2020. The programme designed by UNICEF as a pilot was implemented in
partnership with MoWCA up to 2017, when it was transferred to the Department of Social Services (DSS) within
the MoSW. The main outcome indicators of the CCT were reduction in child marriage and child labour and
increase in school enrolment of vulnerable children in the target districts.
The programme comprises two key interventions: case management services through the establishment of a
trained social workforce and case management toolkits to identify children at risk of a wide spectrum of challenges
from abandonment and violence to school dropouts, conflict with law, as well as child marriage and child labour.
For those meeting the qualifying conditions – score above 24 on the risk assessment, the conditional cash transfer
of BDT 2,000 per month was delivered every six months for an 18-month period. A spectrum of other education,
counselling and disability related services were also referred through the case management process, which was
expected to monitor at risk children until the age of 18 years.
At the time of evaluation, the programme was in the second phase (2015 onwards) and the active beneficiaries
were spread across eight districts: Dhaka North, Barisal, Khulna, Kurigram, Gaibandh, Sylhet, Sunamgonj, and
Chapai Nowabgonj. The programme was finally discontinued in July 2020, after 12 years of implementation.
Theory of Change. The programme’s original theory of change (ToC) included Impact and Outcomes of the
programme. However, the pathways towards these outcomes were inadequately expressed, which led to a
modification of the ToC to include interim outcomes and mediators, with no changes to the outcomes and
indicators presented in the original ToC. The ToC reflected the importance of knowledge, attitudes and practices,
the role of cash as an “incentive” and for improving child’s bargaining power within the household. It also
strengthened the role of the case management process in early identification of risk, and role of other services
offered through that process in achieving the intended outcomes.
Evaluation timeline. The evaluation was delayed expectedly due to limited data availability and lack of reliable
information at the national level, along with unplanned field visits, the addition of a profiling phase, and COVID-
19 related public health measures led to a 6 month+ delay in being able to get to the field.
2. Evaluation purpose and objectives
Following the decision to discontinue the CCT in May 2020, the objectives of the evaluation were revised. The
revised primary objectives of this evaluation were as follows:
1. To generate evidence on the impact of the CCT and to understand the role of cash and complementary
child protection services in the provision of sustainable and transformative social protection for children.
2. To generate accountability by exploring how successful the CCT programme has been in achieving its
expected outcomes and to generate actionable recommendations for how cash transfers can best be used
to supplement the direction of social protection schemes in the future and the necessary capacities within
government to conduct such schemes.

3. To assess the programme design and implementation as well as its relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and
sustainability.
To this end, the specific objectives of the evaluation were to:
1. Analyse the extent: (i) to which the CCT programme has been designed and implemented efficiently and
effectively, (ii) the conditions of the programme were beneficial or hindering and (iii) of the programme’s
cost-effectiveness
2. Understand how families use the money provided, whether they complied with conditions, whether the
transfer value is adequate, and explore the extent to which spending translated into benefits for children
3. Understand the role of COVID-19 in sustaining progress on schooling, child labour and early marriage
among CCT programme beneficiaries
4. Assess institutional capacity at national and sub-national level (including human and financial resources),
identify key gaps and bottlenecks in its pilot and small-scale stages and the impact of these gaps on
programme and beneficiary outcomes, with an eye to understand the role of programme in strengthening
(or not) such capacity
The results from the evaluation were intended to inform the Department of Social Services and UNICEF
regarding the estimated achievement of the CCT programme and to draw lessons for the improvement of
interventions for children in Bangladesh.
3. Methodology
Approach and design. The study was conducted in two phases: Part 1 the evaluability assessment and Part 2 the
evaluation. Once beneficiary and non-beneficiary risk forms were digitized; a profile of both groups was
constructed in Part 1 of the evaluation. With half the non-beneficiary sample receiving at least one other service
(excluding cash transfer) and a fraction of the database representing non-beneficiaries of the CCT or any other
intervention, getting a robust match was going to be challenging. Even within the sample of non-beneficiaries
available, the risk of not being able to track them all down was high.
In Part 2, the evaluation team then approached a quasi-experimental evaluation using Propensity Score Matching
(PSM) methods. The team implemented a two-pronged analysis – assessing the difference between those receiving
the CCT and not receiving any interventions and those receiving the CCT+ other interventions and those receiving
any intervention except the CCT. The study used a theory-based but exploratory approach to measure the
relevance, sustainability, effectiveness, and efficiency of the programme.
Qualitative Sample
KIIs were conducted with key stakeholders at the national, district and sub-district levels including those involved
in programme implementation, monitoring, or oversight as well as from programme beneficiaries using a
purposive sampling approach. The following interviews were conducted:
• 18 national level KIIs: UNICEF, UNFPA, SCI, DSS, MoWCA, Aparajeyo Bangladesh, MoSW
• 56 sub-national level KIIs: Social workers, CBCPC, USSO, Health workers, Educators, NGO workers,
Woman Councillor
• 35 FGDs: (Beneficiary and non-beneficiary) Caregivers, Adolescents, Children, CBCPC
• 9 case studies: Selected based on compelling stories
Quantitative Sample
The quantitative survey was sampled to be representative. It covered 8 districts including Dhaka North, Barisal,
Khulna, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Sylhet, Sunamgonj, and Chapai Nowabgonj. The summary of the final number of
respondents is provided in the Table 2.
4. Key Findings
Relevance and appropriateness
• The study finds that the choice to use conditional transfers rather than unconditional transfers was justified to
some extent. There is no conclusive evidence to show that the conditional mechanism has anything to do with
the positive effects of CCTs or that conditions have a larger impact on these outcomes than unconditional cash
vii
transfers. In the given context of limited capacity of the implementing actors to monitor conditions, the use of
conditions appears unnecessary, taking away from resources that could be allocated to better social messaging and
behaviour change.
• The risk assessment increased the visibility of potentially the most vulnerable children to a great extent and was
successful in identification of vulnerable children to complement the targeting of other social protection projects,
especially for children with disabilities and for children’s access to education overall. However, there were gaps in
coverage as not all vulnerable children that were identified through risk assessment received the CCT and the
programme excluded children in institutional care who could benefit from parental or community-based care, and
potentially street children, who tend to move frequently.
• The targeting and selection criteria were designed to minimise errors to the extent possible given financial and
human resources available. The programme’s targeting approach was designed to include as many children as
possible that may be considered at risk. Yet, whenever an arbitrary line - such as a PMT score for poverty targeting
or a risk score in this case are used, targeting errors will exist. Children who score just below 24 are marginally
different from those that score just above that threshold. Furthermore, financial availability limited the number of
CCT provision available causing social workers to bypass the risk assessment alone and incorporate other
dimensions such as confidence that the child will meet conditions to determine who is enrolled.
• Cash was considered adequate to meet the needs in terms of access to education but inadequate to increase
household income in the short term and were insufficient to drive long-term outcomes in terms of reduction in
child marriage and child labour. When tackling complex outcomes such as child marriage and child labour that
are rooted in decades of social practice and deeply entrenched social norms, cash alone is often insufficient to
drive long-term change. While cash is necessary to alleviate the financial limitations that drive such behaviours,
overcoming social pressures requires additional non-monetary efforts to challenge and change social norms.
• The programme design did not address the needs of girls and boys separately. There was no specific guidance or
guidelines on specific risks to look out for boys or girls and the assessment forms did not adopt any gender-
specific risk questions. The risk to boys and girls assumed equally in design, but social workers demonstrate
awareness of differences that should be accounted for. Nonetheless, these differences sometimes also led to social
norms and practice driven decisions that were gender negative (e.g. girls being dropped from the programme for
child labour compared to boys; domestic chores not counting towards work, etc.). Finally, the same set of
interventions were offered for all children in the programme.
• The TOC is being followed in relation to the non-monetary components of the programme package. The evidence
does not corroborate the achievement of the assumed pathways of outcome and impact through the cash transfer,
particularly the realisation of increasing household income for 60% of the households.
Efficiency
• The implementation process was very resource and time intensive and offers vital lessons to simplify it for
improved efficiency. The CCT had a lengthy implementation process and repetitive processes, which increased
the administrative burden and reduced resources available for programme activities for sub-national authorities
(e.g. monitoring and case management). The programme relied on a parallelly established structure for
implementing the core programme activities such as case management, which generate efficiency losses in the
short and long-term and make little contribution to strengthening systems in the long run.
• The lack of detailed cost breakdown limited the analysis of the cost-efficiency. Using a cost per beneficiary
approach, the cost of the programme appears to be high for the cash transfer (due to administrative costs of high
costs of identification and monitoring) but the case management approach itself costs about BDT 5,000 per
beneficiary. A comparison with data from other countries shows that cost of case management varies by context
and this programme has opportunities for improving cost-efficiency through scaling up, integration and
simplification of processes.
Effectiveness
• The programme has achieved some progress towards impact in the form of improvements identifying at-risk
children, in attitudes towards child marriage and child labour, improved agency of adolescents in negotiating
decisions related to education with parents.
• Girls were more likely to drop out of the programme, more likely to me married while in the programmes and
comprise nearly 75% of all dropouts due to child labour. Boys on the other hand were more likely to be allowed
higher tolerance with child labour, as it was deemed necessary.
viii
• The programme included children (270) with disabilities and increased access to services for them significantly.
The programme also had an important role to play in keeping children in school through cross-sectoral linkages.
• The establishment of CPCPC and deployment of social workers has been vital to the implementation of this
programme. The social workers received training before and on the job, but the programme was not integrated
with permanent government structures. While there is some evidence that CBCPC and the social mobilisation
have increased awareness and activated community members to address such risks, the roles of the CBCPC and
social workers in improving capacity beyond the programme may be limited without government ownership and
commitment to their continuation.
• The programme was monitored by officials from the Upazila as well as through UNICEF field offices.
Nonetheless monitoring of beneficiaries and of social workers could be strengthened further using a structured
monitoring framework and evaluation plan, clear feedback loops and improvements in programme design.
• Social workers were successful in monitoring conditions in the programme period (18 months), but children
became hard to track and monitor after the cash transfer and until the age of 18 due to workload of social workers
and movement of children away from the original location. Nonetheless, none of the monitoring was systematic,
recorded, or analysed for routine and reflective learning and accountability.
Sustainability
• Key learnings from a programming perspective
o Social workforce and case management are non-negotiable elements of child sensitive social protection
o Education is critical for reducing a whole spectrum of other risks for children.
o Extending the programme to cover married children will be instrumental in preventing further violation of
children’s rights.
o Integration with government institutions is vital, even for pilots to scale up as it enables processes to be
optimized for national capacity
• Integrating case management with existing cash transfers would significantly reduce the burden on case managers
and prevent duplication, thereby tackling the non-financial resource gaps
• Not enough evidence to conclude but data suggest that under the current format, sustaining any evidenced impacts
will be challenging. However, if caseworkers have the necessary time and resources and if caseloads are better
managed, there is great potential for them to affect lives of children after graduation. No differences are evident
between boys and girls due to lack of monitoring data.
5. Conclusions
• The CPSP programme has been implemented for over twelve years. In these twelve years, the programme has
filled a critical gap in capacity for protecting children’s rights. The key contribution of this programme has been
to establish and pilot a robust case management system, with important lessons for future investments in this area.
• Th study concluded that the programme was relevant and responsive to the needs of vulnerable children to some
extent and was supportive to beneficiary households in the short term. The risk assessment system was successful
in enabling the identification of vulnerable children – especially children with disabilities – for a wide spectrum of
services through strong referrals and linkages.
• The case management component plays an important role in achieving intended outcomes and the programme
offers a solid foundation on which a national social workforce may be established. Cash and case management
together improve outcomes for agency of children as well as knowledge, attitudes of families. Limited change is
noted at the community level, which requires community level interventions to propel the necessary social change
• Cash has undeniable effects on enabling households to overcome financial barriers and is a key component
enabling children to stay in school.2 However, the implementation of a new and conditional cash transfer
programme adds to the cost of implementation and had limited, if any, value addition to the uptake of education
where a comprehensive case management system is in place and a range of education stipends already exist.
• Focusing efforts on building the referrals and linkages with a long-term and periodic cash transfer while
strengthening case management offer significantly higher returns on this investment.
• Finally, inclusion of children that are living on the street, and those in institutional care that can be placed in family
or community-based care, as well as inclusion of children who are married and in labour in case management for

referrals to other programmes, would greatly improve the situation of children and the maximise the investment
in case management for the most vulnerable children.
6. Lessons Learnt
The learnings UNICEF needs to embrace are as follows:
• The costs of running a pilot – especially in the absence of planned and timely evaluations - are significantly higher
than projects which benefit from the economies of scale, adopt a learning-by-doing approach through clear
monitoring and feedback loops.
• After 12 years of implementation, the CSPB was unable to establish institutionally interest and engagement with
the government for the CCT programme. With the programme moving from MoWCA and MoSW and with
significant UNICEF involvement until programme closure, there are several lessons for future programming.
Where a pilot is designed, governments must be closely consulted, existing government channels must be
leveraged and a clear roadmap with roles and responsibilities for UNICEF and government should be developed.
• The monitoring aspects of case management processes fell short in this programme, costing UNICEF decades of
learning and opportunities for vital evidence generation.
• The removal of girls who may be married while enrolled into the programme is rather concerning. It is vital to
seek and establish linkages to other UN partners and agencies working with married children to hand-over cases
or better coordinate for their protection and empowerment.
• Social service workforce is valuable, as this programme shows that once a child is under case management, there
are immense benefits to the vulnerable child and their household.
7. Recommendations
For future pilots:
1. Make pilots designed to build national capacity, use national structures and eventually integrate in national systems.
(UNICEF)
2. Develop planned implementation and evaluation timelines with clear feedback loops for programme closure or
expansion in the design phase. (UNICEF)
3. Incorporate rigorous and systematic monitoring processes (data collection, collation, analysis and feedback loops),
develop a robust monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework and assign monitoring and oversight
responsibilities as part of the design package to prevent oversights during implementation. (UNICEF)
For programmes that may adopt and use risk assessment and case management systems:
4. Invest in piloting, testing and refining the risk management protocols to ensure all changes are based on evidence,
and tools are sensitive to needs of the most vulnerable boys and girls in a gender-sensitive manner. (UNICEF)
5. Consider digital case management systems – including risk forms for better recordkeeping, effective monitoring
and utilization of the data. (DSS)
For the national system on child and social protection:
6. Draw lessons from the case management tools used for the CCT for generating lessons, communication and
advocacy to develop, implement and scale national child protection systems. (DSS)
7. Invest in establishing a social service workforce drawing on the learnings from the CCT programme. (DSS)
8. Explore the potentials for integrated cash plus care programmes, especially for children with disabilities to improve
their access to services and opportunities and to achieve long-term impacts on complex outcomes like child
marriage and labour. (DSS)
9. Engage in further research to explore the advantages and disadvantages of conditional transfers in Bangladesh,
where resources for monitoring and tracking are limited. (DSS/UNICEF)
10. Establish vital partnerships and lengthen the planning horizon for systematic strengthening of social and child
protection systems and delivery of basic social services. (UNICEF)

1. Context and Background of the Evaluation
1.1. Introduction to the report
This report presents an evaluation of the Conditional Cash Transfer programme (CCT
programme) of the Child Sensitive Social Protection project in Bangladesh, implemented from
2012 to 2019 in Bangladesh. The evaluation research was conducted between the period 2016/17
to March 2022 by an independent international team of the Economic Policy Research Institute
(EPRI) contracted by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Bangladesh.
EPRI led the project evaluation, whilst working in continuous close collaboration with UNICEF
and key stakeholders, important ministries and departments such as the Department of Social
Services, the Ministry of Women and Children’s Affairs, and local governments as well as other
relevant partners.
During the start of this evaluation in 2019, the government of Bangladesh was keen to scale-up
the CCT programme nationally. However, in May 2020, a decision was taken to discontinue the
CCT programme. Since the evaluation was underway during this period, following discussions
with the UNICEF Bangladesh office, a decision was taken to revise the focus of the evaluation so
that the findings of the evaluation would still be relevant and valuable for future programming.
Since the programme is no longer operational, the original focus on providing recommendations
for scaling up the programme was shifted to understanding how the programme can provide
insights and recommendations for the ways in which cash transfers can be used to inform future
child-sensitive social protection programming.
1.2. Context of the CCT programme
Bangladesh is a lower-middle-income nation, with an estimated population of 164.7 million people
in 2020. The country made remarkable progress in poverty reduction – from 43.5% in 1991 to
14.3% in 2016.3 Bangladesh achieved a GDP growth of 8.31% in 2018-2019 and its economy was
recognised as one of the fastest-growing economies globally.4
Despite the impressive achievements in reducing poverty and achieving economic growth, key
challenges have continued to persist. As one of the most densely populated countries in the world,
infrastructure is weak and far stretched – thus, unable to meet the needs of its growing population.
The challenges are made worse with rapid urbanisation and high climate-risk vulnerability; both of
which undermine national efforts to cater to the needs of the most vulnerable.
Within the country, approximately a quarter (24.6%) of the population is multidimensionally poor
while an additional 18.2% are classified as vulnerable to multidimensional poverty.5 Bangladesh
ranked 75 out of 107 countries according to the 2020 Global Hunger Index 6 The proportion of
undernourished has stayed relatively consistent at 13.0% over the period of 2017 to 2019.7 The
prevalence of stunting in children due to malnourishment under five was 30.8% as of 2018.8 Data
has shown that stunting tends to be concentrated among children from households facing multiple

forms of deprivation, including poor dietary diversity, low levels of maternal education, and
household poverty.9
Bangladesh ranked 133 out of 189 countries in the 2020 Human Development Report.10
Bangladesh’s HDI for 2019 was 0.632.11 However, when the value was discounted for inequality,
the HDI fell to 0.478, which indicates the inequality in the distribution of the HDI dimension
indices, pointing to general discrimination that persists within the country.12
Situation of children
Children in Bangladesh have continued to be particularly vulnerable. Children make up
approximately half the population of the country, and an estimated 33 million children live in
poverty.13 Both poverty and vulnerability affect children disproportionately – leaving them highly
vulnerable to multiple deprivations including food insecurity, malnutrition, death from diseases
that can be avoided or treated, displacement, poor living conditions, developmental delays, child
marriage, child labour and as a result, violence, abuse and exploitation.14 In disaster-affected areas,
children are at the greatest risk of injury or death, often suffer long-term losses in human capital
accumulation, and are at risk of deterioration in mental health and wellbeing. Child mortality (and
in particular neonatal mortality) remains a critical issue.15
School-age children are deprived in the education dimension. Although Bangladesh has a
high transition rate from primary to secondary school, eventual dropout rates are high.16
Persistent poverty has made children vulnerable to other issues such as child labour and
child marriage. Over 17% of children are out of school, 31% of girls aged 15-19 are married (and
a third of girls are married before the age of 15),17 1 in 12 girls aged 15-19 is a mother and more
than 7 million children aged 5-14 years are engaged in some form of child labour.18 An ODI study
completed in 2016 explicitly notes that “Bangladesh will not achieve the 2030 development goals
on education and other objectives without a strengthened commitment to eradicate child labour.”
Additionally, the lives of 19 million children in Bangladesh are at risk due to climate change-
driven hazards such as floods, cyclones, river erosion, drought etc. 19
Social protection in Bangladesh
The government of Bangladesh has recognised the critical role social protection plays in
addressing poverty, vulnerability, and marginalisation. Over the past decades, the country
has made significant strides in expanding social protection and its portfolio of programmes has
increased incrementally every year. There are presently 145 programmes being implemented under
the Social Security System, implemented by 23 line Ministries/divisions.20 In 2019, the

Government of Bangladesh allocated approximately BDT 642 billion, or equivalent to 2.5% of the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to social programming; of which BDT 372 billion was used to
implement cash allowances, public works, and education and health incentives for poor and
vulnerable households, to tackle poverty and improve human capital.21
The unplanned proliferation in the number of programmes over the past few years has resulted in
widescale fragmentation of the social protection system as there have been multiple
duplications of programme objectives and under-coverage. Due to a large number of programmes,
the budget for each programme has been small and the benefit level provided to each individual
has been low.22 Further, a strategic review of programmes has highlighted that 65% of the Social
Security Programmes have sought to address lifecycle risks, however, albeit a large number of
programmes, there are still significant gaps. For instance, there has been very little coverage for
children between the ages of 0-4 years (gradually improving with the Mother and Child
Benefit programme now), persons with disabilities, and elderly persons (also improving
with increasing coverage through DSS’ cash transfers). While coverage has been the highest
for school-going children, the review has shown that benefit levels have been low in value – a
problem that affects all of Bangladesh’s Social Security schemes. In addition, most of the social
security schemes have focused on risks experienced by the rural population and have failed
to target the growing urban population. Data has also shown that a large proportion of poor
and vulnerable households have not had access to any form of social protection. In addition, there
has been inadequate monitoring and evaluation and programmes have mainly been measured in
terms of the amount of money distributed as opposed to the results achieved.23
The government has recognised that the fragmented social protection system has resulted in a
lower value for money and fewer impacts on poverty reduction. In 2015, the government adopted
the National Social Security Strategy which aimed at addressing the above-mentioned
challenges by streamlining and strengthening existing programmes to deepen the developmental
impacts. The long term vision of the strategy is to “build an inclusive social security system for all
deserving Bangladeshis that effectively tackles and prevents poverty and inequality and contributes
to broader human development, employment and economic growth”.24 In the short to medium
term, the government has expressed commitment to develop a comprehensive system which
adopts the lifecycle approach – whereby schemes will be consolidated to cover all age groups - and
extend the coverage of core schemes to reach those who are most in need. For children in specific,
the strategy advocates for two core programmes:
• A child grant for poor and vulnerable children between the ages of 0-4 years
• A school stipend for all primary and secondary going children belonging to poor and
vulnerable households

In addition, children will also have the disability benefit, the school meals programme, the orphans
programme, and the legal provision which enables abandoned children to receive financial support
from the responsible parent.25
1.3. Evidence of social protection in improving child-sensitive outcomes
There is growing evidence of how social protection can effectively improve children’s health and
schooling with long-term development benefits. Many social protection measures already benefit
children without explicitly targeting them. A wealth of global evidence asserts that investments in
children’s wellbeing, especially in early childhood generate cost-effective, important and sustained
benefits for children, households and the country as a whole. Child-sensitive social protection
offers governments an opportunity to invest with higher rates of return and provide
children a platform they can leverage to claim their rights, which they might be unable to do
otherwise because of their age and status in society.26
1.4. CCT programme in the context of global goals
Since the inception of SDGs, UNICEF has been either the custodian for children in the
Sustainable Development Agenda or has been supporting child sensitivity in their work towards
achieving SDGs globally. Through the programme goals, the CCT aimed to achieve progress
towards the SDGs in Bangladesh. Through the goal of elimination of child marriage and child
labour, the programme aimed to achieve SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 5
(Gender Equality), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Through the goal of ensuring children stay
in school until the age of 18, the programme sought to contribute to SDG 4 (Quality Education).
The cash transfer along with the support of the case management, the CCT aimed to achieve SDG
1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (No Hunger), and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well Being). As part of the
objectives of improving government capacity and investment for child targeted policies and
programme, the programme sought to contribute towards SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong
Institutions).
1.5. Object of the evaluation: The Conditional Cash Transfer programme (CCT)
of the Child Sensitive Social Protection project in Bangladesh
In 2008, UNICEF Bangladesh and the Ministry of Social Welfare implemented an 18-month cash
transfer pilot programme “Amader Shishu/Our child” to support orphan and vulnerable children
in seven upazilas affected by the 2007 Cyclone Sidr. The pilot met its original objective of enabling
socio-economic empowerment and sustaining increased income for 60% of the families who were
either fostering orphans or bringing up vulnerable children.
Based on the success of the pilot, in 2010, UNICEF replicated the programme in old Dhaka city
in partnership with the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA) and the Ministry of
Social Welfare (MoSW) with the objective of reducing child labour,27 child marriage and school
25 (Government of Bangladesh, 2015)
26 (DFID, 2009)
27 In terms of child labour, the CCT aimed for parents to keep their children out of all forms of labour after graduating
from the programme. However, the findings are discussed in context of child labour as defined by the UN Convention
on the Rights of the Child (1989) as ‘any kind of work for which children are too young or which is dangerous or exploitative, which
damages physical or mental development or prevents children from attending school;’ Or as defined by UNICEF children who are
‘either too young to work or are involved in hazardous activities that may compromise their physical, mental, social or educational
development.’

dropout. The CCT provided BDT 2,000 a month, over a period of 18 months. In some cases,
where the vulnerabilities of children in some families still remain significant, children received cash
support for 36 months as well following a follow up done by social workers after each of the
installment. The amount was dispersed every six months (installment), so that three instalments of
BDT 12,000 each were paid, to the guardians of eligible children if they keep children in school,
out of employment and unmarried. In Phase 1 (between January 2012 to July 2017), the
programme covered an estimated 3,661 beneficiaries. In Phase 2 (from July 2017 to November
2019) the programme reached a total of 1,688 beneficiaries (all through DSS), of whom 1,070 were
girls (63.4%). Overall, 11% of the CCT beneficiaries reported having disabilities. Based on
consultations and data from MoWCA and DSS, the programme was implemented in and had
active beneficiaries from eleven wards or upazilas and city corporations in the following eight
districts: Dhaka North, Barisal, Khulna, Kurigram, Gaibandh, Sylhet, Sunamgonj, and Chapai
Nowabgonj. These eight districts fall within six zones - Dhaka, Barisal, Khulna, Rangpur, Sylhet
and Rajshahi. Further details on the CCT beneficiaries, eligibility, selection process, payments,
graduation and expenditures have been provided in Annex 2.
1.6. Intervention logic of the CCT Programme and theory of Change
The CCT can generate impacts through three kinds of effects – the economic effect, the
integration effect, and the catalytic effect. Our previous experience with cash transfers
demonstrates that these other effects are just as important if not more than the economic effect
of the cash transfer alone. These effects are particularly important in this case – when the impacts
require outcomes to reverberate over a much longer-term than the intervention itself. While the
synergies from the integration of cash and other services generate immediate improvements, the
catalytic effect generates outcomes (or returns) in the longer term. In fact, given the expectation
of long-term change from an 18-month intervention, the greatest impact may result from
integration and catalytic effect.
Original Theory of Change
The programme’s original theory of change (Figure in Annex 2) stipulated the following:
1. IMPACT: Children go to school, stay out of employment and unmarried while in the
programme and after graduation, until the age of 18.
2. OUTCOMES: Children have access to essential services such as health care and there is
an increase in income for 60% of participating households who care for orphans or foster
children at the end of the CT.
The original theory of change (TOC) for this programme focused on the economic effect of the
programme, capturing other factors such as the increased access to social services as “spillovers”.
The economic effect alone can neither explain nor justify longer-term improvements. The original
TOC suggested that the underlying problem the CCT overcame is related to the financial
constraints of families that prevent adequate investments in the human capacity of children and
require them to adopt negative coping strategies such as pulling children out of school, engaging
them in child labour or marrying them as children. It postulated that the provision of the CCT
removes these financial barriers for vulnerable families and enables them to realise the rights of
their children including access to education, health, and protection, among others. Per the TOC,
if the household graduated from the programme before the child turns 18, the child would
5
continue to be in school and not in child marriage or engaged in child labour until the age of 18.
It did not clearly present the pathways through which this would be achieved. One suggestion in
the theory of change was that the programme would allow beneficiary families to enhance their
income at the end of the cash transfer programme, thereby making them more able to continue
education for children and steer away from child marriage or labour. However, the linkages
between an immediate increase in income due to the programme and longer-term behaviour
change were not mapped in the TOC.
The original TOC also suggested that by preventing child marriage and child labour and ensuring
access to essential services including child-sensitive social protection (CSSP) services, the
programme contributed to the larger vision of developing a model package of child protection
services that were scaled up for vulnerable women, children and young people that could reduce
equity gaps in selected areas (tea gardens, urban slums, stone crushing areas and disaster-prone
areas).
These vitally important interactions were not captured in the TOC. The original TOC captured
increased access to social services as well as the effects of the capacity development initiatives
directed at social workers as “spillovers.” For most of the causal chains illustrated above, the
impacts and outcomes are not direct, apart from the increase in income because of the cash benefit.
The overall impact is largely dependent on the behavioural and attitudinal responses of households
but how these will be achieved remained ambiguous in the original TOC.
It is through all these investments that the programme was expected to generate overall progress
in access to services and mitigate the equity gap. The original TOC assumed that 90% of eligible
families in intervention areas would receive the CCT and as a result, keep their children in school
and out of child marriage and child labour even after their graduation from the CCT programme.
Revised Theory of Change
Globally validated theories suggest that to end child marriage and child labour, changes in three
areas are necessary:
(i) Changes in household behaviour
(ii) Changes in government capacity and ownership to ensure continued drive and
commitment, strategies and investment in elimination of child marriage and labour
(iii) Improvement in the economic circumstances of the poorest and most vulnerable
children and their families to reduce economic dependence on child marriage and
labour
The original TOC was sound but had a few limitations. It did not link the various “strategies and
activities,” and was too heavily focused on creating systems and overcoming financial barriers
without enough emphasis on driving community and household level behaviour change.
Furthermore, it did not adequately demonstrate the pathways that drive impact from outcomes,
or the assumptions and mediators of impact.
The programme was about working towards ending child marriage and labour. Child labour and
child marriage, which are often entrenched in traditional values and customs and driven by
impoverishment and social norms are often the trickiest issues to tackle. Above that, working for
social change is complex and requires a log-frame or theory of change that depends on strategies
6
and is not solely dependent on activities alone. As result, the theory of change had to be updated
to reflect progress/changes in social norms – in both beliefs and behaviour, stronger capacity to
monitor and reinforce outcomes and opportunities for M&E and lesson-learning. Finally, it was
important that the TOC depicted and explained the relationship between enabling, catalytic and
focused interventions.
The revised TOC is a high-level depiction the theory of change that captures all the programme
inputs and objectives. It combines the three kinds of effects that are integral to the programme
and to achieving outcomes – the economic effect, the integration effect, and the catalytic effect.
What differentiates a conditional cash transfer from an unconditional cash transfer is the provision
of and/or strong linkages with relevant services. These are a part of the comprehensive set of
interventions being provided to vulnerable children in Bangladesh and are critical to achieving the
intended impact of keeping children in school, unmarried and not in labour up to the age of 18.
The figure above presents the strategies, inputs and activities including the activities related to the
case management processes. These collectively were expected to enable access to basic social
services and increase the income of beneficiary families. Figure 3 presents the detailed pathways
of change from output to impact. The pathways and the overall theory of change are driven by a
set of assumptions. The factors that might have moderated the programme impact and potential
risks that undermine programme impact are presented below.
A few factors that might moderate programme outcomes:
• Inadequacy of benefit amount
• Social and cultural norms within the community that prevented the intended impact of the
programme (specifically with relation to child marriage)
• COVID-19 (expected adverse impact on livelihoods, child marriage and child labour)
A few risks might affect the realisation of expected outcomes:
• Inadequate financial allocation/budget that prevented all eligible children from receiving
the benefit or receiving payments predictably and reliably
• Supply-side constraints such as poor infrastructure, lack of roads or transport that inhibit
access to schools might have weakened programme outcomes
• Poor quality of services – schools not having good quality teachers and adequate
infrastructure may have inhibited the programme’s achievements.
• Unavailability of budget to expand social services to match demands
• External shocks – economic or natural disasters
• Unexpected fluctuation in prices of basic goods and services, e.g. food, health care,
education etc. or in prices of commodities/services that enable access such as transport.
The pathways of change presented in Figure 4 depict the complexity of the programme and
emphasise that this programme is only likely to demonstrate progress towards impact if it fits into
a set of interlocking components that include cash alongside case management, effectively
connecting children to the vital services they need for the impacts that are expected.
7
Furthermore, this programme’s objective is far more longer-term than the intervention itself. For
an 18-month intervention to address rights violations that have been normalised for centuries
requires a strong catalytic effect, driven by multiple sources of support and reinforcement. The
three components of the programme – the (economic and catalytic effect), provision of services
and strong case management and monitoring are all critical to driving impact.
In the revised theory of change, the provision of cash takes on two key roles – (i) immediate
income support to meet the needs of the child such as food and to ensure that families can invest
in human capital accumulation services such as education and health care; and (ii) a “signal”,
“nudge” or “gift exchange” as a low-cost investment for the government which initiates
behavioural change, that generates a series of effects which become more powerful over time.
Without the latter, the programme may be able to drive immediate impact but is unlikely to
generate long-term change that keeps children in education, out of labour and unmarried until
their 18th birthday. Finally, mediators of change are included that focus on knowledge, attitudes
and practices regarding child marriage and labour, which are critical for enabling an environment
within which social norms and behaviours may change for the long-term.
The provision of case management and referral to services have very important roles to
play in ensuring that the programme achieves its outcomes in the following ways: (i) early
identification of at-risk children to prevent violation of rights and protect childhoods, (ii) referral
to essential services and care and ensuring children’s safety in these places to enable use, (iii)
providing children with a voice and support to stay in school, unmarried and out of employment
up to the age of 18, and (iv) monitoring the continued schooling of children and keeping them out
of marriage and employment up to the age of 18. Without a strong capacity for case management
and effective identification, tracking and monitoring of at-risk children, the likelihood of the
programme achieving its outcomes may be diminished. Cash, although necessary, on its own is
insufficient to drive large-scale impact when tackling socially entrenched behaviours and
challenging social norms such as child marriage and labour.
Finally, the provision of quality and consistent services is integral to the success of this
programme. If the services provided by the social workers including awareness raising,
counselling, protection and support, etc. are of poor quality or inconsistently provided, it can
significantly undermine programme outcomes. For instance, if community sensitisation is
identified and not consistently delivered in the right manner, through the right channels and to the
right persons, its impact on the reduction in child marriage or labour with support from the cash
transfer will be limited. The provision of quality services is potentially the most important mediator
of impact for the CCT.
If these three mechanisms work effectively, a differential impact can be observed based on whether
a child received only cash, or cash and a service. For the purpose of this evaluation, it has been
difficult to determine whether each of the services on offer have being delivered to a high quality.
However, insights have been obtained into the quality of services such as education and other
services that directly support the uptake of education or improve learning outcomes that are most
often sought or provided to the children through the case workers.
The outcome indicators for the CCT programme are presented in Annex 3.

1.7. The Theory for Impact
Evidence of the Impact of Cash Transfers on Education, Child Marriage and Child Labour
A global evidence base28 demonstrates the success of cash transfers – conditional and
unconditional – in improving the uptake of education and keeping children in school for longer.
However, the evidence of cash transfers keeping girls unmarried until the age of 18 is limited.
Nonetheless, the evidence that does exist, shows that cash-based interventions alone cannot erase
centuries old norms and practices. Social change is complex and requires long-term, multi-sectoral
approaches that focus on transformation of social norms. Cash-based support must be
complemented with interventions to change parents’ and societal attitudes, improve awareness and
education, promote higher level of education, and provide children and young people with a voice
in determining their own futures.
Some well-known examples of studies that explore the effects of cash transfer programmes on age
at marriage and age at first birth include Alam et al. (2011) who found that the girls who
participated in the Punjab Female School Stipend Programme (FSSP) in Pakistan delayed marriage
and Ullah (2013) who estimated the impact of the FSSP on the incidence of early marriage. Hahn
et al. (2015) showed that the FSSP had a significant impact on education, age at marriage and
fertility. It is important to understand here that outcomes such as delayed marriage, delayed first
birth, lower fertility, lower child mortality, increased employment, etc. manifest over a longer-term
and may only be demonstrated after sufficient time has passed. As such, most evaluations of CCTs
conditioned on education tend to focus on shorter-term impacts.29 Shamsuddin (2015), however,
explored the impact of the FSSP on women’s empowerment through labour market participation
in Bangladesh.
There are some important lessons from the Apni Beti Apna Dhan programme in India
(implemented differently in different states), which highlight the importance of complementing
cash-based support with multisectoral non-cash interventions focused on transforming social
norms to achieve changes in behaviours that require changing social norms and practices.30
A recent review of evidence of the impact of conditional cash transfers on child labour31 found
that conditional cash transfers demonstrate great promise for lowering the rates of child labour,
improving the uptake of education and overall wellbeing of children. The reductions in child labour
are pronounced when beneficiaries are poor, indicating that the mitigation of financial constraints
as a driver of child labour. The cash transfer acts as a consumption smoothing mechanism to lower
child labour.32
However, the study provided greater detail on how cash transfers have different impacts on
children, depending on their age and sex. The reduction is child labour is more likely when the
incidence is greater, offering a larger margin for impact; therefore, more likely among boys.
Similarly, while these programmes lowered children’s participation in work outside the households;
these programmes either had no effect or in some cases, increased children’s participation in work
within the household. Since girls are more likely to be involved in domestic work (or work in own
28 (International Center for Research on Women, 2016) (Kalamar, Lee-Rife, & Hindin , 2016 Sep) (World Bank, 2016)

9
farms) to begin with, the increase in work within the household was more likely among girls.33 The
study identified two pathways that could drive the increase in child labour in these cases: (i)
investment in productive assets that increase demand for labour to be fulfilled by the child or (ii)
conditions of education or schooling when the transfer value is not enough to meet the cost
associated with the condition; child work may be used to fill the gap.34 It is also important to note
that increases in school attendance are not always matched with reduction in child labour –
children may be in school and still working either part-time or more.35
Evidence also highlights the importance of linking cash transfers with other relevant and child-
sensitive services to augment the impact on child labour. These may include supply-side
interventions such as the provision of health and education facilities and/or after-school
education. However, services such as those aimed at improving livelihoods and income generation,
when paired with cash transfers may adversely affect child labour outcomes.36 Finally, many studies
identify a host of gaps in understanding as to why some cash transfers simply fail to have an impact
on child labour; why and how schooling might affect child labour for boys and girls and why in
some cases smaller benefits have an impact, while in other cases, larger benefit sizes fail.37 More
detailed evidence of the impact of cash transfers on education, child marriage and child labour is
placed in Annex 4.
1.8. Stakeholder engagement
In Phase 1 (before July 2017) of the programme, the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs
(MoWCA) and the Ministry of Social Welfare (MoSW) were jointly delivering the programme.
MoWCA was primarily responsible for the urban areas, while MoSW delivered the programme in
rural areas. In Phase 2 of the programme (from July 2017 to November 2019), only MoSW
implemented the programme.
EPRI led the project evaluation, whilst working in continuous close collaboration with UNICEF
and key stakeholders, important ministries such as MoWCA, MoSW and departments such as the
Department of Social Services (DSS), and local governments as well as other relevant partners.
1.9. Considerations and Delays
1. Data related delays
There have been several unexpected delays due to the limited data availability and lack of reliable
information at the national level. Lack of clarity on the programme’s implementation and storage
of essential data such as risk forms have meant that the study team has had to undertake unplanned
field visits and follow-up calls to get a real understanding of the data that is available on programme
beneficiaries and other vulnerable children as well as to map out the implementation process at
the Upzila level. Compiling and analysing this information have caused significant delays to the
timeline.

2. COVID-19 Pandemic
Soon after the data was gathered and analysed, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global
shutdown, which has also affected the project timeline. Due to the nature of mitigation strategies
and the lockdown measures put in place, the project activities had to be placed on hold and data
collection was significantly delayed.
1.10. Organisation of the Report
This report consists of seven sections. This first section provides the context and background to
the evaluation and is followed by section two that presents the evaluation purpose, objectives and
scope. Section three introduces the evaluation approach and methodology. Section four presents
an analysis of the main outcomes that were obtained and presents the main findings on the
evaluation criteria. Section five presents the main evaluation conclusions and section six includes
main lessons learned. The section seven, presents the evaluation recommendations, followed by
the list of cited references in section 8. The final section, nine, includes the annexures for the
report.
2. Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Scope
2.1. Evaluation purpose, objectives and intended users
During the start of this evaluation in 2019, the government of Bangladesh alongside development
partners such as UNICEF was keen to scale-up the CCT programme nationally. However, in May
2020, a decision was taken to discontinue the CCT programme. Since the evaluation was underway
during this period, following discussions with the UNICEF Bangladesh office, a decision was
taken to revise the focus of the evaluation so that the findings of the evaluation would still be
relevant and valuable for future programming. Since the programme is no longer operational,
specific focus that was previously given to providing recommendations for scaling up the
programme was shifted to understanding how the programme can provide insights and
recommendations for the ways in which cash transfers can be used to inform future child sensitive
social protection programming.
The revised primary objectives of this evaluation were as follows:
4. To generate evidence on the impact of the CCT and to understand the role of cash and
complementary child protection services in the provision of sustainable and transformative
social protection for children.
5. To generate accountability by exploring how successful the CCT programme has been in
achieving its expected outcomes and to generate actionable recommendations for how
cash transfers can best be used to supplement the direction of social protection schemes
in the future and the necessary capacities within government to conduct such schemes.
6. To assess the programme design and implementation as well as its relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency, and sustainability.
To this end, the specific objectives of the evaluation were to:
11
5. Analyse the extent: (i) to which the CCT programme has been designed and implemented
efficiently and effectively, (ii) the conditions of the programme were beneficial or hindering
and (iii) of the programme’s cost-effectiveness
6. Understand how families use the money provided, whether they complied with conditions,
whether the transfer value is adequate, and explore the extent to which spending translated
into benefits for children
7. Understand the impact of COVID-19 on schooling, child labour and early marriage among
CCT programme beneficiaries
8. Assess institutional capacity at national and sub-national level (including human and
financial resources), identify key gaps and bottlenecks in its pilot and small-scale stages and
the impact of these gaps on programme and beneficiary outcomes, with an eye to
understand the role of programme in strengthening (or not) such capacity
The intended primary users of this evaluation are Department of Social Services (DSS) and
UNICEF for lessons and recommendations derived from the evaluation for future pilots and child
targeted programmes in Bangladesh.
Secondary users of the evaluation include other departments of MoSW, MoWCA, and
development partners at the national level, and the subnational stakeholders of the CCT and actors
in the child protection and social protection sector in Bangladesh. The evaluation may also interest
other UNICEF country offices and regional offices and other NGOs in developing or improving
standards for evidence-generating pilots, improve child-sensitive programming and strengthen the
child and social protection nexus for tackling complex issues such as child marriage and child
labour.
2.2. Scope of the study and Rationale
The scope of the evaluation covered the CCT programme from 2017 to 2020. The scope of the
evaluation was revised to exclude the period from 2012-2016 due to lack of data on the programme
beneficiaries before 2017, when the programme was run through the Ministry of Women and
Children Affairs (MoWCA). Hence, the beneficiaries captured in the evaluation only reflect
beneficiaries captured through risk assessment forms by MoSW.
The evaluation drew evidence from eleven wards or upzilas and city corporations in the eight

districts. These eight districts fall within six zones - Dhaka, Barisal, Khulna, Rangpur, Sylhet and
Rajshashi, where the programme was active between 2017 and 2020.
The evaluation responds to four of the five OECD-DAC criteria - efficiency, effectiveness,
relevance, and sustainability. The evaluation of the impact of the programme was not considered
mainly as the programme aimed to prevent child marriage and labour until the ag of 18 years and
a small fraction of the beneficiaries for whom data were available would meet these conditions.
The analysis was impact was further challenged due to numerous data challenges – absence of
baseline data, substantially small sample size due to access to beneficiaries for the last three years
only. Secondly, since there was no monitoring data on these children who had graduated from the
cash transfer, the likelihood of tracing all individuals in the limited sample was also small.
12
During inception, it was also determined that the proposed comparison of the CCT programme
with institutional care in terms of their effectiveness or efficiency for achieving the intended
outcomes was not unfeasible from an ethical standpoint and there was no credible way to compare
CCTs with children in institutional care, who would necessarily have to stay out of labour,
education and in school. Since the impact of institutional care on children exceed far beyond these
metrics, the analysis was not considered relevant to the study and thus, dropped from the
evaluation.
This evaluation specifically examines the design and implementation enablers/challenges that can
inform future programme design. It provides evidence to understand the role of cash and
complementary child protection services in the provision of sustainable and transformative social
protection for children and provides actionable recommendations that can inform child-sensitive
programming and improve evidence-generation pilots.
2.3. Evaluation criteria and questions
The evaluation has been designed based on the OECD/DAC criteria of relevance, efficiency,
effectiveness, impact and sustainability with equity, gender and human-rights considerations
factored into each element of analysis. Some study questions were revised or removed during the
inception phase based on (i) data availability and (ii) agreement with UNICEF on some questions
being less relevant or counter-productive to the evaluation’s objectives. 38 All study questions have
been presented and discussed in the section below, including those that have been revised or
removed.
Relevance and appropriateness:
1. To what extent was the choice to use conditional cash transfer rather than unconditional
justified with regards to the needs among vulnerable households, availability and quality of
services, capacity of local government and service providers?
2. To what extent did the selection of vulnerable children complement the targeting of other
social projects to reach to the worst-off and most vulnerable? Were there any gaps in
relation to targeting and coverage?
3. Were the programme’s targeting and selection criteria designed in a way to minimize
exclusion and inclusion errors?
4. To what extent was the size and regularity of the cash transfer adequate to meet the needs
and challenges of the targeted households?
5. Were the needs of girls and boys considered and addressed separately?
6. Is the TOC being followed in terms of programme implementation and are the assumed
pathways of outcome and impact occurring in reality? Does it include all the factors
necessary for the TOC to be relevant? When operational, were there adjustments needed,
gaps, or missed assumptions, or adapted for the future?
38 The evaluation criteria do not include impact, which was removed due to data limitations. Subsequently, the research
questions did not include a question for unexpected effects (positive and negative).
13
7. Does the programme design follow best practices for the design of CCTs, especially for
the design of targeting and selection criteria, money disbursement, graduation criteria and
monitoring of conditions?
Efficiency:
1. How well was the delivery process managed, considering the time and resources at each
stage of implementation and coordination between UNICEF, DSS and sub-national
administrations?
2. How cost-efficient is the CCT programme and what potential is there for efficiency savings
at all stages (capacity and constraints)?
This question has been revised to seek “cost-efficiency” instead of “cost-effectiveness," as
proposed in the TOR for the following reasons:
▪ Cost-effectiveness is hard to estimate – quantitative estimates of cost-effectiveness of
CTs suffer from insufficient data on costs as well as on values of direct and indirect
benefits. Especially in a study as this one, where the scale is small and our confidence
intervals are wider, it will be difficult to estimate effectiveness
▪ The CCT has higher-value indirect benefits compared with limited quantifiable direct
benefits. We can tackle this qualitatively based on international evidence on cash
transfers and long-term benefits of the programme’s intended outcomes.
▪ For efficiency savings, we will rely on qualitative data on how the processes can be
simplified, what is more resource draining and the perception on its value-add based
on implementers, and policymakers involved at each stage of programme
implementation
Effectiveness:
1. How effective was the programme in achieving its expected results in terms of outcomes
and progress towards impacts? Is the programme equally efficient when considering
vulnerable girls and boys being benefited? How successful was the programme in improving
access to and the use of services?
2. How effective was the programme in increasing the capacity of social workers to improve
their work beyond their direct tasks of the CCT programme, and improving the capacity
of social workers, and community structures such as CBCPC to protect vulnerable
children?
3. How well did the financial management and programme monitoring system establish and
function?
4. How successful was the programme in monitoring and enforcing the programme’s
conditions? How successful was the programme in following up with the households and
children after graduation (in those cases where children were still under 18 at the point of
graduation)? Was the programme equally capable to monitor the situation of boys and girls
after benefiting from the programme?
14
Sustainability:
1. How can the learnings from this programme guide policy and programmatic structuring
towards a more inclusive, sustainable approach to social protection of vulnerable groups?
2. How can the major capacity gaps and bottlenecks at national and sub-national levels be
overcome if a different approach to social protection was employed?
3. How sustainable are the impacts on the lives of children and their households after
graduation (for those that were younger than 18 at the time of graduation)? Does this
sustainability vary between boys and girls?
4. Has the programme led to any positive or negative unintended results, taking into
consideration COVID-19, as applicable throughout the programme timeline?39
39 The research question was moved from Effectiveness to Sustainability criteria based on feedback and discussion
with the UNICEF Bangladesh team.

3. Evaluation Methodology
3.1 Evaluation approach
The team conducted the study in two Parts – Part 1 – the evaluability assessment and Part 2 – the
evaluation. In the first phase, case management forms (including both the basic and detailed risk
assessments) were used to build the beneficiary profile and to assess whether the non-beneficiary
children could be used as a credible counterfactual. The team captured all the information in all
active Upazilas and converted this data into a centralised database that was used for detailed
analyses in phase 2.
Part 1 results demonstrated that there was a sizeable counterfactual for some counterfactual
analysis but its power to estimate smaller changes in outcome indicators may be limited. Ideally,
for a matched counterfactual analysis, it is recommended that the sample of non-beneficiaries be
larger than the sample of beneficiaries. However, this was not the case. With half the non-
beneficiary sample receiving at least one other service (excluding cash transfer) and less than a
sixth of the database representing non-beneficiaries of the CCT or any other intervention, getting
a robust match was going to be challenging. Even within the sample of non-beneficiaries available,
the risk of not being able to track them all down was high.
In Part 2, the evaluation team then approached a two-pronged analysis – assessing the difference
between those receiving the CCT and not receiving any interventions and those receiving the
CCT+ other interventions and those receiving any intervention except the CCT. The study has
adopted a theory-based but exploratory approach to measure the relevance, sustainability,
effectiveness, and efficiency of the programme.

The quantitative survey was sampled to be representative. It covered 8 districts including Dhaka
North, Barisal, Khulna, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Sylhet, Sunamgonj, and Chapai Nowabgonj. The
sampling frame was the database of beneficiary and non-beneficiary children for whom completed
risk assessment forms were available. All beneficiary and non-beneficiary households in the
database created in the first part of the study were included in the sample.
The summary of the final number of respondents is provided in the table below.

Data collection
The training for field data collection was carried out from October 27, 2021 to November 11,
2021. A total of 10 days of training were provided to the field personnel with a mixture of in-house
training and field practice. All issues encountered during the field practice were discussed in a
review session and mitigated accordingly.
After the successful completion of the training, fieldwork began on 13 November 2021 and ended
on 25 December 2021. Field data collection was conducted by six interviewing teams with each
team consisting of 1 supervisor, 5-6 interviewers, and 1 logistical assistant. In addition to the
interviewing teams, 2 Quality Control Officers were also sent to the field for overall supervision.
The field team came across some challenges in locating some respondents, such as incorrect
location data in the case management form, mobile numbers of respondents were switched off,
and child’s family had moved away. These challenges were reported to UNICEF Field Offices,
who were able to support the survey team in locating the survey respondents.
3.4 Limitations encountered in evaluation process and ways to overcome these
During the course of the evaluation, several issues emerged that led to a change in the scope of
the evaluation causing the study team to revise the study question and approach in consultation
with UNICEF. These issues were considered carefully in the development of the methodology.
The most relevant issues were:
1. The programme’s selection process and identification of the target population
The TOR and documents received about the programme during the proposal phase did not specify
the full process of how the programme worked, how the beneficiaries were selected or who formed
the population of eligible children. The scoping consultations established that there has been (i)
significant subjectivity in the selection process, (ii) multiple stakeholders and viewpoints
influencing the final selection, (iii) several benefit options available as responses depending on the
kinds of risks the child may be facing (other cash transfers, social services etc.), (iv) multiple layers
of filters before finalising the list of beneficiaries and (v) significant exclusion due to budget
constraints. The broad set of determinants of what constitutes “high-risk” children have made it
18
near impossible to estimate or identify the population of eligible children. Additionally, the number
of factors, permutations and combinations that determine eligibility have made it near-impossible
to identify eligible non-beneficiaries, especially those who have not been receiving other benefits
or support without a full-scale census style survey exercise. These surveys are extremely resource
intensive – financially and timewise but most importantly in this case, extremely challenging as
well. The survey would have involved implementing the risk assessment form for every child being
interviewed, which would have required trained social workers to undertake this exercise. The
short form itself takes over an hour to complete and detailed forms require repeated visits and
several hours of effort. Since eligible children also included street children; there has been no
robust way to ensure representation of all sub-groups. Finally, the consultations have also revealed
that there is no standard way to determine who might be eliminated or put on the waitlist due to
insufficient funds – the matter is handled on a case-by-case basis.
2. The type of evaluation design
With the information on the availability of forms (or lack thereof), there has been no data on a
potential counterfactual against which impact has been measured for Phase 1 beneficiaries (there
has been very scarce data on beneficiaries reached through MoWCA) and there has been very
limited information on non-vulnerable children. These data limitations have significantly affected
the evaluation design for measuring impact and effectiveness.
Firstly, the lack of non-beneficiary forms in Phase 1 of the programme have made it unfeasible to
measure the programme’s impact on those that received benefits before 2017. The evaluation has
instead focused on Phase 2 of the programme only. Secondly, given the lack of forms for those
children that are not deemed vulnerable, the only counterfactual against which the programme has
been assessed has consisted of children that are vulnerable but not receiving benefits (they are
instead referred to other programmes). The limited amount of data for non-vulnerable children
has precluded the use of a regression discontinuity design (RDD), which would have relied on the
risk scores to split beneficiary and non-beneficiaries – above and below the threshold of 24 (used
by case workers to determine low and high risk).
The evaluation design required a robust profiling of both beneficiaries and vulnerable non-
beneficiaries. In this case, there have been several challenges – there has been no standard baseline
survey and the risk forms as well as recall modules have been used to capture experiences of
children and families with regards to access to food, services, type of shelter and living conditions,
household structures, shocks such as death or illness as well as external shocks such as climatic or
other disasters. Second, the group of beneficiaries have been heterogenous in terms of the ages of
children – these range from children aged 5 years to those aged 16 years+ in the dataset.
Heterogeneity introduces a high variance in the data, which has meant that a larger sample has
been necessary to identify impact in a reliable manner.
3. COVID-19 and impact on the sustainability of progress
The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc around the globe with catastrophic consequences
for children. The mitigation measures to contain the spread of the virus have led to long-term
disruption of schools, universities and other education facilities. School closures have risked a wide
range of adverse impacts on children and young people, including interrupted learning and risk of
dropping out but also forgone human interaction, and knock-on effects on early marriage and
19
employment due to loss of family income.40 All of these factors directly affect the sustainability of
any results emerging from the CCT. There is a strong likelihood that the COVID-19 pandemic
may have reversed some of the progress made in this regard and thus, may have consequences for
the sustainability of the programme’s potential impacts.
Unfortunately, many of the risk drivers of COVID-19 impact coincide with the characteristics of
vulnerability identified for eligibility. Some of these are presented below:
(i) Children without parental care, abandoned or without having any legal guardian – the
share of such children is expected to rise among poor and destitute households who
do not have the means to socially distance or practice proper hygiene (share water and
sanitation facilities, no access to soap etc.),
(ii) Street child without shelter:41 many children are at risk of coming to the streets are
COVID-19 death tolls rise and as livelihoods are lost. Furthermore, closure of schools
and residential services has forced even more children to the street – at greater risk of
harm. The risk of abandonment and destitution rises dramatically during crises such as
these, are the vulnerabilities are further exacerbated by social stigma that leave young
children without access to food, water or shelter.
(iii) Children engaged in hazardous work, including begging: the COVID-19 pandemic has
placed many families at risk of destitution and lowered incomes for many more. During
these times, the use of child labour for financial sustainability or even survival is likely
to intensify. Global partners working to prevent child labour agree that the pandemic
poses real risks of backtracking - “positive trends may falter, and child labour may
worsen, especially in places where it has remained resistant to change.”42
(iv) Children living in a child or woman-headed household in slums: “people living in slums
and slum-like settings in developing countries, where population density is high, are
those most at-risk and least prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic.”43 Without the
ability to comply with distancing and stay-at-home guidance, these households are at
greatest risk and the number of such households may increase dramatically due to the
health, economic and social shocks including loss of lives, loss of livelihoods, rising
incidence of domestic violence and abuse.
3.5 Ethical considerations
The Economic Policy Research Institute (EPRI) understands that appropriate oversight of human
subjects’ research is a legal as well as an ethical imperative. Equity-based frameworks pre-requisite
ethical reflection and conduct in evidence generation processes. A focus on vulnerable population
groups necessitates measures to ensure that participants treated with respect and dignity and
protected throughout the process. Further, to mitigating against risks to participants, these
processes intend to secure all those involved in the project including the staff and commissioning
and implementing organisations.

41 (Street Children, n.d.)
42 (International Labour Organization and United Nations Children’s Fund, 2020)
43 (UN Women, 2020)
20
EPRI’s work has been guided by professional standards and ethical and moral principles in line
with the UNICEF-Adapted Standards for UN Evaluation, developed by the UNEG and the
GEROS standards, as well as UNICEF’s Guidance on Ethical Research Involving Children.
The team have ensured that:
1. They are impartial and have produced a comprehensive report on the economic case,
limitations of the evidence, strength and weaknesses of the interventions and financing
mechanisms and taken due account of the view of stakeholders based on unbiased
findings;
2. Illustrated evidence on verified findings and lessons learned;
3. Exercised honesty, integrity and respect for dignity and diversity;
4. Produced the assignment reports based on fair representation of knowledge, vulnerable
groups, gender and ethnic groups.
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was received from the Institute of Health Economics,
University of Dhaka board in Bangladesh. Annex 8 provides a detailed overview of the ethical
principles, which are adhered to by all EPRI-associated personnel in all stages of their work. The
annex also includes the IRB approval form, which details the programme’s methodologies, risks,
risk mitigation plan, ethical considerations from a methodological, data collection, analysis and
management point as well as the measures taken to address these risks. IRB approval was received
satisfying the IRB’s standards for ethical research.

4. Main Evaluation Findings
The section is structured along with the evaluation’s questions of the four dimensions as detailed
in the evaluation matrix. The detailed findings are based on data collected in the research phase of
this evaluation through household surveys, key informant interviews at the national and
subnational level, focus group discussions with the beneficiary and non-beneficiary respondents,
and case studies through interviews with cases of interest.

R1. To what extent was the choice to use conditional cash transfer rather than
unconditional justified with regards to the needs among vulnerable households,
availability and quality of services, capacity of local government and service
providers?
Despite the merits of conditional cash in enforcing positive practices that proponents of
conditions claim ultimately aim to promote human rights, there is no conclusive evidence
to show that the conditional mechanism has anything to do with the positive effects of
CCTs or that conditions have a larger impact on these outcomes than unconditional cash
transfers. Furthermore, in the context of this programme’s design, the implementation of
the condition takes away from resources that could be allocated to better social messaging
and behaviour change.
Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) have demonstrated improvements in terms of keeping children
in school and preventing child labour to some extent.44 Yet, they are known to have higher
administration costs and compromise human rights. Consultations with social workers reveal that
conditions significantly increased the workload of monitoring for social workers, requiring them
to double or triple verify attendance at school. Monitoring of conditions also took away from the
time available for case management and communication, which are more beneficial in convincing
households to keep children in school. It is important to note that the monitoring activities
discussed here are self-reported by social workers in direct interviews, and there is no accessible
data that can validate the extent of monitoring activities carried out.45
44 (Save the Children Fund, 2012)
45 Further discussed under Efficiency Ef4
24
As gathered through the data collection activities, the CSSP CCT programme is essentially a cash-
plus programme combining a conditional transfer with child protection and case management
activities and other services for vulnerable children, including counselling, disability support and
others. The use of conditions under these circumstances is counterintuitive, as they incentive
compliance of conditions for receiving the cash instead of bringing change in parents’ knowledge,
attitudes, and practices. With the investments made into case management and social workforce
strengthening, non-fulfilment of conditions could trigger a positive feedback loop signalling to the
authorities that perhaps the delivery of essential education services is lacking, awareness and
knowledge among parents on the perils of child marriage or labour are lacking, or that there is a
need for other services such as social and behaviour change communication. Understanding and
tackling the root cause of the problem, such as non-punitive or developmental conditions that
focus on monitoring and improvement, would be far better positioned to deliver progressively
improved solutions. Such design mechanisms still reinforce the messages that CCTs best enable,
and instead of compromising human rights, might strengthen the bargaining power of some
household members, thereby facilitating the fulfilment of their rights and promoting their status
within the household.46
The CSSP CCT programme aims to keep children in school, outside child marriage and child
labour until age 18, irrespective of the age that the child received the benefits (age 5 years and
above). The theory of change assumes that the provision of cash will enable households to invest
in income-generating activities alongside keeping children in school, thereby increasing their
income beyond the period covered by the cash transfer. Global evidence suggests that “cash
transfers that promote children's education can increase their economic activities to pay the
additional costs of schooling. However, the efficacy of cash transfers may also be reduced if the
transfers enable investment in productive assets that boost the returns to child labour.”47 Evidence
also suggests48 that punitive conditions are exclusionary for the most vulnerable, who may be
unable to comply with conditions despite the monetary incentive – and get penalised for their
vulnerability in return.
That said, in this case, the conditional cash was not considered the main intervention. DSS affirm
that in the holistic policy context, cash is not considered the main tool for helping children, and
the priority is providing linkages and service-based support to the children. While cash is not
regarded as the ‘solace of all problems’, the overarching goal of such programmes needs to focus
on long-term transitions and changes. Another DSS official validated the idea of the insufficiency
of cash transfer and emphasised the role of awareness building in communities and motivating
and empowering children to make the right choices regarding their future.
The consultations with social workers and CBCPC members also highlighted that the CCT was a
small component of support and only provided to a small share of children who were vulnerable.
In this context, they noted that changes in behaviour were equally driven by engagement with and
through guidance for parents and other communication and monitoring activities. Globally,
46 (Orton, 2014)
47 (Furio, 2022)
48 There is some – limited - evidence available on unintended consequences of conditionality on exacerbating social
exclusion and worsening of outcomes for the most vulnerable. The area is not adequately researched but current
evidence suggests further marginalisation of the most vulnerable. (UNICEF, 2016)
25
practitioners confirm that social and behaviour change communication (SBCC) plays a vital role
in raising awareness and inspiring action at all levels of society about the dangers of socially
constructed harmful practices such as child marriage and child labour. Over twenty years of
evidence in programming against child marriage and child labour confirm that enabling social
change requires comprehensive, integrated and larger-scale intervention at the individual, family,
community and national levels. Investments in changing family, community and societal
behaviours and attitudes and creating an enabling policy and legal framework are essential for
eradicating such practices.
From a programming perspective, cash transfers generate impact through two key pathways – (i)
income effects wherein the cash eases the financial barriers, which prevent households from
undertaking investments, including investments in children’s education and (ii) substitution effects,
which reflect the increased opportunity cost of not investing in education. In order for the
substitution effect to contribute to the outcome, conditions are insufficient. It requires a better
understanding and awareness of the opportunity cost of child labour and child marriage to
encourage families and communities to keep children in school and out of marriage and labour
until the age of eighteen.
Feedback from programme stakeholders and global evidence both confirm that the role of
SBCC far exceeds the role of cash in the CBSP CCT programme. The role of conditions in
enabling better outcomes than unconditional transfers remain unclear due to inconclusive
evidence. Yet, there exists a broad consensus on the ways in which conditions can further
marginalise vulnerable groups, increase programme costs and take away from the social
workers’ ability to invest in necessary SBCC activities, which ultimately deliver social
change.
R2. To what extent did the selection of vulnerable children complement the targeting
of other social projects to reach to the worst-off and most vulnerable? Were there
any gaps in relation to targeting and coverage?
Evidence from CCT: Vulnerable children identified for much-needed support
Syed* is one of 5 siblings who live with his parents in Sunamganj. Syed’s mother was chronically ill
for many years and was not able to receive a diagnosis of her illness from the local doctor. Through
help from community members, Syed’s mother was able to get admitted to a private clinic, where
she was able to receive the necessary surgery to treat her condition.
As his family did not have any financial resources and owing to the high expenses incurred to treat
their mother’s illness, Syed and his siblings had to discontinue their education. Instead, he and his
siblings spent their time doing housework. This was a difficult phase, and the family faced a lot of
trouble in accessing basic needs such as food and clothing. Syed and his siblings spent several days
in desperation and tears.
Syed and his family’s situation were alerted to the social service office, which sent an officer to assess
the situation and enable the family to access the CCT. Upon receiving the first two instalments of the
CCT, Syed’s family was able to purchase some paddy and a cow, which were later sold to make
money. All his siblings were also able to go to school. Currently, Syed, who is in ninth grade, says
that his elder siblings will be taking their HSC and SSC exams while his younger siblings are in the
sixth and seventh grades. Syed hopes to pursue his master’s degree. While Syed’s mother is not
26
entirely sure whether they will be able to support his ambition of studying further, she hopes to fulfil
his wish.
Syed’s mother is doing much better after the surgery. She is grateful that despite their extremely
difficult circumstances, using the financial support received from the CCT, she is able to send all her
children to school and care for them as she wanted to. She is relieved because if she didn't get CCT,
“she wouldn't get back her beautiful family today.”
*The names do not reflect the actual names of individuals interviewed
Risk assessment has increased the visibility of vulnerable children
In the CCT programme, UNICEF invested heavily in the risk assessment forms, training and
placing the social workers for identification of risks and case management. Children with various
types of risks were identified and brought under the social service system and were provided
support by the social workers. By virtue of identifying children who may be at risk and then
assessing their dimensions of risk through the risk
form automatically got children who were “This is because this risk assessment form
is prepared by meeting many times at the

otherwise not identified or targeted for any

children.” – Social worker, Shibganj
channels of social protection through which they
could receive support.
i. Vulnerable children in the community
The process of identification through the risk assessment scoring system was helpful in identifying
children at risk of dropping out of school, child marriage, or child labour and recommending them
for the cash transfer. Apart from the three CCT

assessment and subsequent case management.
It was also reported that the programme was able to include children with other particular
vulnerabilities, such as children with HIV/AIDs, who were also identified through this process.
Other vulnerable groups for risk assessment include street children, homeless children, and
children without parents, where social workers work towards family reunification. After reuniting
with a family member, the child is then eligible for the CCT, which is recommended by the social
27
workers to provide support in the household for childcare and an incentive for the family to keep
the child.
If that is not feasible, children are referred to institutions like Sheikh Russell Child Rehabilitation
Centre and Government Shishu Paribar as a last resort. Institutional care is not considered ideal
as the children do not always wish to stay in such places and try to run away. However, as reported
by the social workers, for children with living parents/relatives who are in a financial or family
crisis, institutions are helpful in providing care for children in the short run while the family seeks
to recover enough to take care of the child again.
By virtue of the process of identification of vulnerable children and the risk assessment scoring,
children, who might not be otherwise supported, were brought under the social system and were
provided support through either the CCT or through linkages to a spectrum of services. The social
workers went beyond the CCT to ensure support and guidance for all children under their case
management.
ii. Children with disabilities
The creation and adoption of the risk management process increased the visibility of children with
disabilities who were previously unidentified.

situation.
The specialised support provided by social workers included talking to the police on behalf of the
child, family reunification, the providing guidance to the caregivers, referring them to the Child
Development Centre and other institutional facilities such as rehabilitation centres, and following
up on children released on bail and working as the Probation Office. As reported, in several cases,
DSS seeks to take over some cases instead of handing the child over to the police.
Additionally, under case management, such children were able to receive services and support that
dealt with the root cause of their vulnerability, such as poverty, lack of support from parents,
financial and social conflict etc., instead of directly prosecuting them for their actions to deal with
the risks. Hence, using case management, social workers were able to provide these children with
a better chance at a normal childhood.
Social workers providing support to children in conflict with the law
A social worker in Shibganj recounted the case of a child who came in contact with the law. A child
enrolled in school was accused of stealing mobile phones. The reason was stealing was described
by the social worker, “…he stole mobile because he would eat biscuits or drink tea or paying for
education…”. Hence, the root cause of the crime can be identified in the case, i.e., lack of financial
stability. The child was brought under case management and provided the CCT with the goal of
addressing the key underlying risk. Support is provided with the following aim, “…if they are given
financial help, they will be able to study properly.”
The social workers do “inquiry about those who have been released on bail from the Child
Development Centre so that they do not re-engage in crime”. Such support is able to prevent the
child from facing more conflict with the law in the future. Case management provides the opportunity
for such children to be given attention and heard by the social workers who can understand their
situation better. They hold the understanding that “just as we adults can make many mistakes, a child
can make many mistakes too” and can listen to the accounts of the children who do not need to be
prosecuted to a life of crime due to basic circumstances such as described “…most of the children
29
there were involved in theft or drug cases, maybe some of their friends gave them these drugs, and
they ate them out of curiosity, and in that case, he was framed with a drug case.”
Social workers providing support to children in contact with the law
A case of a young child from Barishal demonstrated how children who come in contact with the law
are identified and supported by the social workers. The child studied at a madrasa where she was
“tortured” by another student. The parents of the child pursued legal action against the perpetrator,
and the child was thus involved in the long procedure of dealing with the court and magistrate. The
social worker recognised that “the child who was in contact with the law is emotionally broken" and
has to deal with the social stigma “people in society look down on them”. Hence, the social worker
sought to provide counselling and guidance to deal with the situation. The child was brought to the
social service officer and was given counselling. To make the child comfortable, they asked her,
“What will make you happy now? Do you want any doll?" and upon hearing her response, she was
given a new doll. The parents of the child were also provided further guidance, “We have told her
parents to change her institution” and sought to observe the child “...to avoid facing any trouble next”.
The social workers then followed up with the child as part of case management.

30
Additionally, case management has also reportedly been successful in strengthening linkages for
children and families with social protection services. Hence, the uptake of services other than
child-targeted programmes was increased due to the programme.
While the risk assessment system was able to identify vulnerable children, it is questionable
whether it reached the most vulnerable cases in the community. The risk assessment was found to
have suffered from targeting errors which modulated the relevance of the programme overall. The
targeting errors are found as a result of the use of a single threshold underscoring risks, funding
constraints that by intentional design excluded vulnerable children, and subjectivity in the targeting
approach, which leaves room for exploitation through power dynamics. These challenges are
discussed in detail in the following section.
The programme suffered from both intended and unintended coverage gaps. Due to the
geographical limitations, the programme did not include vulnerable children in other locations in
Bangladesh that may have more vulnerable children. The programme also excluded children in
institutional care who could be brought into family-based care with financial and case management
support. Most children receiving benefits were single orphans, but the inclusion of double orphans
living with extended families or on the street may have been limited. The programme was not
conducive to the inclusion of street kids, who may be prone to movement across areas and thus,
prevented their access to the CCT that was originally intended for such children.
R3. Were the programme’s targeting and selection criteria designed in a way to
minimize exclusion and inclusion errors?
Targeting errors at the risk assessment forms stage
i. Risk assessment through scoring led to targeting errors.
While the risk assessment process was successful in bringing vulnerable children into the system
by giving them visibility, the scoring method adopted demonstrates significant gaps in coverage,
high errors of exclusion and substantial room for improvement. Whenever a proxy measure is
used to set a threshold for eligibility, errors of targeting will exist. There is substantial evidence of
such exclusions in poverty-targeted transfers around the world.
The use of scoring using a single threshold established a numerical threshold at the score of 24
and excluded the children whose condition was only marginally better. While the approach of using
a means test is beneficial in selecting beneficiaries above a defined risk threshold in a context of
high vulnerability with financial constraints of limited availability for CCT benefit per district, it
resulted in the exclusion of vulnerable children from receiving the cash transfer. There is strong
evidence, as reported by all levels of programme stakeholders that the there was little difference
between a child with a score of 23 and with a score of 24 – which could be an outcome of an
improperly designed tool for risk assessment or a consequence of measuring vulnerability in a
context where both the breadth and depth of vulnerability are high. A common example given by
respondents can be used to illustrate the point: if a child gets an overall score of 23 or 22, but they
scored a 5 on the question of child labour, meaning the child has a risk of falling into child labour,
then this child is also considered very vulnerable. However, since the child did not get a score of
24 on the risk assessment, they are not recommended for the CCT. The exclusion of such cases
31
leads to the conclusion supported by several respondents in the study that the risk assessment
system needs to be reformed in future programming.
The scoring method uses a means-test of the social risk, which is qualitative and exists on a
spectrum. It is extremely difficult to

The decision-making for targeting of the “Most of the time the difference (between a score of

interventions resulted in exclusion errors.
ii. Targeting for interventions was conducted based on a case-based approach
Recognising these limitations, the saving grace of the targeting was the case management training
provided to the social workers. Social workers took on their role as the custodians of child rights
and understood their role in ensuring the children under their purview received the necessary
support.
While the operational plan for the risk assessment required the social workers to not provide the
CCT to those who scored below the threshold and only monitor them, we saw some good case
practices where social workers recommending the child for the CCT and for interventions other
than the CCT to those who scored below 24. An example of such practice is social workers
including children below the score of 24 for case management and even recommending the CCT
if the child scored a 5 (high risk) on one of the dimensions in the risk form. They deviated from
the technical targeting guidelines and applied their skills and intelligence to the eligibility threshold.
Hence, the programme did help social workers to go beyond the responsibility regarding the CCT
and the risk assessment guideline and provide other types of assistants to these households
wherever they needed.
The deviation from the programme management guidelines leaves room for power dynamics
depending on the implementation. Based on the accounts from the social workers interviewed for
the study, we can establish that the social workers acted in the interests of the child, which can be
considered a victory of the capacity-building support provided to them by UNICEF. However,
this highlights the risks related to how power dynamics could have affected the selection of the
children and risk assessment, leaving room for corruption and leakages. With no reference to spot
checks and oversight of social workers, the social workers' ability to select or disqualify children
for intervention using factors other than the scoring can pose a risk to the programme.
32
While such misuse of overriding quantification of the targeting is not seen in the case of the social
workers, higher-level officials involved in the programme are reported to misuse the CCT targeting
and delivery of the transfer for political gains. Such examples raise questions about the community-
level power dynamics for the programme targeting and the lack of transparency and accountability.
Targeting errors at the CCT recommendation and selection stage
iii. Factors other than scoring influence the recommendation of the child for the
CCT.
Beyond the exclusion that takes place during the risk assessment stage, financial constraints for
the CCT further excluded children from receiving the CCT. After a child receives a risk score, and
if they are above the 24-score threshold, the child is recommended for the CCT by the social
worker. The list of children recommended for the CCT is higher than the limited spaces allocated
for the district due to the financial restraints of the programme compared to the vulnerability of
the target population. The list is presented in front of the Child Welfare Board and the Department
of Social Services for approval or rejection of the CCT. At this stage, the decision to provide the
CCT is highly influenced by the limited availability of CCT provision in the district for the CCT.
Since each district was assigned only a limited number of CCT provisions, the CCT was not
sufficient to cover all children targeted through risk assessment. Hence, even with a score of 24,
the child was not guaranteed to receive the CCT since it was heavily constrained by insufficient
funds. Further selection criteria were added to create a somewhat second means test.
As reported by social workers, very few of the children recommended for the CCT are able to
receive it. The CCT suffers from exclusion errors
“Our rule was that one third of children get

were able to receive the CCT.
The other factors which determined the cut-off for the CCT were case-based and described as
relative to the risks of the children on the waiting list for the transfer. Cases with a score closer to
the maximum, i.e., 60, were more likely to receive the transfer. It was also reported in consultations
with UNICEF field officers that the social workers assessed whether the child was in a situation
to benefit from the transfer and could meet the conditions of the programme, such as family
33
dynamics where the money would be used for the child, whether the child was motivated to pursue
studies displayed as good grades and regular attendance, and whether there was supporting
infrastructure for the money to be productively used. Additionally, if a child was removed from
the CCT due to breaking conditions, then another child who was on the waiting list could receive
the transfer. Such subjective targeting based on environmental factors resulted in high levels of
exclusion of the most vulnerable children, who were not able to avail the needed support and were
excluded due to the limitations of the programme.
Exclusion errors reduce the targeting efficiency, which reduces programme efficiency. As a result
of high exclusion errors, the non-monetary costs of the programme are very high. The impact of
such errors on society is high as children in a very similar situation and levels of risk are not
provided equal support. The funding constraints take away a potential opportunity from a child
for a better future. Additionally, such an error also hurts the reputation of the agencies involved
in the programme, which are the government and UNICEF, reduces the confidence in them
among the targeted communities and makes it harder to implement future engagement with the
people.
R4. To what extent was the size and regularity of the cash transfer adequate to meet
the needs and challenges of the targeted households?
Cash was considered adequate to meet the needs in terms of access to education but
inadequate to increase household income in the short term and was insufficient to drive
long-term outcomes in terms of reduction in child marriage and child labour.
Poverty is identified as the key driver of risk by all levels of stakeholders and contributes to the
risk of child marriage and child labour. In this context, the money provided to the beneficiary
children through the programme was highly valued. The size and frequency of the cash transferred
were adequate for the households to meet their most essential needs like food and healthcare and
send the child to school. As reported by the social workers, the amount of 12,000 takas delivered
every six months to the beneficiary households was used to purchase food, schoolbooks, uniform,
and other expenses related to the child. This is validated in the survey data, where most of the
respondents reported using the money on food, school, and health-related expenses.
The CCT benefit is primarily spent on the beneficiary child in the household, but some
respondents in the survey also used the transfer for expenses related to other children in the
household, and a small percentage even utilised the amount for other household members. The
amount was also reportedly used on household utilities by some respondents.
Considering the above, it is not surprising that social workers reported that through the cash
transfer, the importance and treatment of the beneficiary child were increased in the household
during the 18-month period, as the household could benefit from the amount which was being
received because of the child. However, the impact of the programme on the long-term
relationship with the caregivers and the treatment of the child cannot be measured here.

Shibganj
In order to achieve the longer-term impact, the cash
should have led to investment in sustainable income generation activities, which would enable the
households to meet their financial needs over a longer period of time and support the child until
they turn 18. There is limited evidence that the amount received was sufficient for the beneficiary
household to invest in sustainable income generation activities, which would be essential to meet
the longer intended impact. While the social workers reported some cases of the cash transfer
being used to invest in assets such as a shop, a cow and changing professions with more financial
stability, these examples are few in number. Moreover, as reported by the survey respondents, a
minuscule percentage of them use the CCT money for future assets or savings.
The CCT alone is not enough for achieving programme objectives.
The cash transfers were adequate in supporting the short-term goals of the programme, but this
was possible only in the presence of other non-monetary interventions. The ultimate objectives of
the programme, which is to overcome the social challenges of child marriage, child labour and
school dropouts, cannot be met through the cash transfer, which alone is not an adequate tool of
intervention. The case management approach, the social workers, the risk assessment, monitoring,
and the follow-up process are far more likely to drive the intended impacts.
Child marriage and child labour are complex risks which require support beyond cash, with
interventions that reach all levels of factors that influence child development in the given context.
The ecological model has long established that the interactions within and between the various
spheres of influence at the individual, household, community and national level, collectively shape
outcomes, as human beings do not live in isolation. Hence, there is a need to recognize that for
interventions to promote positive outcomes (such as the prevention of child marriage),
interventions must aim not only to educate and empower girls but also to create an enabling family,
community, and environment that is protective and supportive of their rights.49
This is recognised by the social workers as well as high level stakeholders who emphasise the role
of case management, counselling, and linkages for providing support to children and not using
cash as the sole intervention.

Saeed* lives with his mother and elder brother after his parents got divorced. Due to lack of money,
Saeed’s elder brother could not go to school after he finished Junior School Certificate (JSC), and
witnessing his mother's suffering, he started working in a shop. Saeed was referred to the CCT by
his uncle who works as a peon in the social services office.
Saeed received two instalments of the CCT, i.e., 12 thousand taka each with a total of 24 thousand
taka, when he was in fourth grade – which was two years ago. Saeed’s family has benefited a lot
from getting the CCT money. His mother bought a piece of land by combining the money from the
CCT and some savings from her eldest son’s earnings. With some financial stability, the family was
able to arrange a place of their own and subsequently, Saeed was able to attend school regularly.
When the CCT programme ended in March 2020, Saeed’s family was not able to receive the final
instalment of the CCT. Although Saeed’s family have bought land, they have not been able to build
a house yet due to lack of money and had planned to build their home by combining the final
instalment of CCT and with additional savings. At present they have a loan of 50 thousand taka,
which was taken to buy the land. Since they need to pay the loan instalments monthly, along with
their current financial instability, they are in a difficult situation.
During Covid lockdown, when the schools were closed, Saeed was sent to work in a packet making
factory to earn extra money. But now that the schools are open, Saeed is back in school. Since
Saeed’s elder brother could not continue with his studies, Saeed’s education is prioritised by the
family. Saeed’s mother wants him to have a good education and stay away from “bad deeds” that
she sees in society like addiction.

R5. Were the needs of girls and boys considered and addressed separately?
The programme did not separately address the needs of girls and boys
The programme design did not consider the specific needs of boys and girls and had a gender-
neutral approach with the same support and intervention offered for all children in the programme.
This is seen in the programme design and is validated in the data where social workers do not
report any gender related guidelines and were asked to treat children of all genders equally.

stakeholders at the field level, it is recognised that they
CBCPC member Mirpur
often lack understanding and knowledge on gender
sensitivity in programming. This can jeopardise the implementation of the programme at different
level through the stakeholders and their roles. At the CBCPC level, the committee members
influence the targeting of the programme as they serve as channels of alerts and referrals to the
social workers for vulnerable children in their communities. They also support the monitoring of
the children and in cases conduct follow ups with the children and report to the social workers.
Hence, the CBCPC members’ level of gender sensitive attitudes and knowledge can impact the
targeting as well as the monitoring of the programme. From the social workers’ side, the type of
intervention they offer the child and guidance provided to the child and caregivers can be heavily
influenced by their understanding of gender specific needs and attitudes.
As reported in qualitative data, some field level stakeholders had negative attitudes such as
increased importance of boys over girls for interventions, and the negative attitudes about re-
enrolment of girls in schools after child marriage. Such attitudes are recognised to have a very
harmful impact on the children involved with those stakeholders and gives the whole programme
a gender insensitive outlook. Moreover, such limitations in the programme display the lack of
training and sensitisation of the programme stakeholders.
Due to the lack of gender sensitivity in the programming, the CCT failed to contribute towards
the SDG 5 (Gender Equality).
R6. Is the TOC being followed in terms of programme implementation and are the
assumed pathways of outcome and impact occurring in reality? Does it include all
the factors necessary for the TOC to be relevant? When operational, were there
adjustments needed, gaps, or missed assumptions, or adapted for the future?
The CSSP project had three key components – cash support (CCT), development of case
management tools and strengthening social worker capacity for identifying at-risk and vulnerable
children. Through a combination of these interventions, the project aimed to ensure early
identification of children at risk, ensure their access to a wide spectrum of cash and non-cash
support and access to child protection services through institutions such as social workforce and
community-based child protection committees. In the immediate term, the project expected that
household income would increase at the end of the CCT for at least 60% of beneficiary households
and that children would have access to better services. Such an increase in the household
income after 18 months of intervention with 3 tranches of cash transfer is indicative of how
the programme over relies on the cash intervention.
Evidence from the field confirm that the case management activities and social worker engagement
were instrumental in realising the expected education uptake, improved awareness and change
attitudes on child marriage and child labour. The theory of change also highlights the vital role of
the cash management activities in the uptake of education and reduction of child marriage and

on the conditional cash transfer to realise these intended outcomes. In that sense, the theory of
change undermines the role of child protection tools in enabling the intended outcomes.
The CCT is a component of the larger system enabled by the CSSP project. The case management
system enabled invisible children to be included in the social and child protection system, receive
support from social workers who act in their interest and towards their preservation. As one of
the mechanisms/tools to protect children, a conditional cash was provided as an “additional
incentive”. The programme theory of change does significantly undervalue the role of the
non-cash components and heavily overvalues the ability of a small amount of cash (in
comparison to the cost of purchasing or setting up productive assets) in enabling the
intended outcomes.
An analysis of the risk forms received by the evaluation team shows that social workers provided
a total of 6,971 interventions to children who scored above 24 in the risk assessments. Of these,
4,532 interventions were recommended for beneficiaries of the CCT and 2,439 were for non-
beneficiaries of the CCT. Of all the interventions recommended by social workers, financial
assistance (including the CCT) was 28% of all recommended interventions followed by 19%
related to education regularisation through case management (see Figure 4). Awareness raising
comprised 17% of the interventions, and nutrition provision (13%) was followed by counselling
(12%) as the next most recommended services.

About 82% of the financial support was provided through the CCT and majority of the CCT
beneficiaries were also the ones receiving awareness raising (74%), and education regularisation
support (67%). The share of non-beneficiaries was higher for nutritional provision, disability
assistance, scholarship and birth registration services. The distribution demonstrates that while
CCT was a substantial component of the monetary benefits provided through risk management,
the non-financial assistances comprised a significantly larger share (71%) of all interventions
offered.

The TOC (Figure 4) has been followed to some extent, and many assumed pathways of outcome
have occurred, with adjustment. At the time of starting this evaluation, the programme had a high-
level theory of change that did not sufficiently describe the pathways from input to outcomes and
impact. No assumptions or risks had been identified. The evaluation team reconstructed a more
detailed TOC based on direct inputs from UNICEF, and relevant government stakeholders.
Based on the assumptions that impoverishment is a key driver of school dropouts, child marriage
and child labour, and the cash is being provided to children facing these financial constraints, the
cash provided through the project was expected to increase household income at the end of the
CCT. Based on consultations, the cash was considered sizeable enough to cover the opportunity
cost of schooling while also enabling at 60% beneficiary households to invest in productive assets
or businesses that increase household income sustainably. A wealth of global evidence document
that longer-term and sustainable increase in household income can only be achieved through
transformative change that is delivered through a series of sustained and multisectoral
interventions aimed at increasing human capital, skills, productivity and coping capacity. Evidence
then places strong reservations against the assumption that a three-tranche transfer can enable that
with support from a social work and case management approach. At the time of developing the
detailed TOC, stakeholders were aware and cognizant of the weaker link of long-term
improvement in financial situation resulting from this CCT alone. However, without this outcome,
there was no tangible way to link the CCT with retaining children in school until the age of 18
years, long after the programme ends for many.
The data collected at endline confirm that while the cash was instrumental in helping many families
ease financial barriers to education, they were largely insufficient to increase household income
over a longer time. By making the cash conditional, the programme was able to keep most
beneficiary children in school; yet several children dropped out of school despite the cash incentive
due to familial pressure and need to earn an income or availability of good work opportunities.
Global evidence documents how conditions may force the most vulnerable to drop out from
conditional programmes, especially when the opportunity cost of meeting the condition (or
perceived benefit) is higher (lower) than the cost (perceived benefits) of the alternative–child
marriage or labour.
On the pathways through which cash was expected to generate the intended outcomes, there is
limited evidence of investments in productive assets or activities that provide more sustainable
incomes among programme beneficiaries. While household income was temporarily improved, the
data provides no conclusive evidence on longer-term increase in household income for
beneficiaries. Contrarily, the programme does enable most households to ease financial constraints
related to education expenses but the role of conditions in enabling or enforcing the uptake of
education remains unclear.
The figure below illustrates the assumptions and mediators that would lead from outputs towards
the intended outcomes.
40
Figure 4: Assumptions and mediators in the TOC
Most assumptions from the above TOC were held in the result. However, it is recommended that
the ‘provision of cash to needy children and caregivers acting in the interest of children’ should be
mediators, as these remain directly affected by programme activities. On the mediators, there is
evidence of the following mediator being activated to translate outputs to outcomes, as discussed
in detail when addressing the effectiveness of the programme:

41
In conclusion, the TOC is being followed in relation to the non-monetary components of
the programme package. However, the role of the cash in the overall implementation of
the programme has been over emphasised – from the name of the programme to the
emphasis on impact of cash on increasing household income. The evidence does not
corroborate the achievement of the assumed pathways of outcome and impact through the
cash transfer for an 18-month period.

Ey1. How well was the delivery process managed, considering the time and resources at
each stage of implementation and coordination between UNICEF, DSS and sub-
national administrations?
Summary
The process of the programme from identification, risk assessment, referral for CCT, case
management, and delivery of benefits were aligned with the programme design. Yet,
unintended logistics – the multi-tier approval system, survey comprehension by children
(affecting cyclical risk scores), added case management expectations - need to be better
accommodated:
• Identification of beneficiaries and monitoring them was resource and time intensive as
expected from well-designed case management approaches; however, the case
management load combined with the administrative workload on social workers stretched
the social workers beyond their capacity to adequately fulfil their responsibilities regarding
the monitoring of vulnerable children.
• The role of the CBCPC was vital in the identification of vulnerable children, enabling social
workers to take the process forward.
• Finally, lack of records on risk forms and monitoring of children increases chances of
inaccurately implementing case management and the loss of data
These factors preclude a significant return on the investments, which could inform better policies,
and improve the social workforce and case management processes, and consequently, improve
programme efficiency.
The process of selection and enrolment into the CCT remains highly repetitive and lengthy
with various levels of approvals, largely determined by limited provision per district for social
workers and further filtering based on available financial resources. Reverification of the lists at
upazila, district and other levels need to be eliminated to improve cost and resource efficiency -
duplication can be addressed by optimising processes such as adopting a digital database for
registration and identification linked with social protection beneficiary databases and use of digital
and timely approval of recommended beneficiaries.
The withdrawal of the CCT benefit also has attached costs (approximately 1,000 BDT) for
beneficiaries. In the survey, 345 respondents reported expenses related to withdrawing/receiving
the CCT, of which 338 respondents confirmed spending additional money. The respondents
reported an average of 1,426.90 BDT spent on withdrawing CCT funds. Even after removing any
outliers (exceptional values) in the data set, the average cost was 1,008 BDT. Most of them
reported spending money to pay for transport or paperwork (copies and getting help with filling
documents) to collect the cash.
Among the largest drivers of inefficiency was the data management and monitoring. The
programme invested heavily in the development and implementation of case management tools
and capacity. While social workers and interviewed adolescents and parents confirm that social
workers periodically monitored the situation of the child and the household, social workers were
neither provided with the necessary tools (except the risk form used for initial selection), nor
trained nor instructed to keep records on these monitoring visits. The lack of documentation risks
the continuation of necessary support for children. While tracking of aspects in the risk form that
43
were originally identified as high-risk ensures that the child continues to receive the relevant
assistances, it can also shed light on whether selected interventions are being utilised or delivered.
Additionally, turnover of staff or a planned rotation of social workforce requires that essential
documentation be available for handover of at-risk children.
Each of these aspects is discussed in greater detail below, focusing on the challenges that moderate
the efficiency of the programme.
i. Identification of the children
Children are identified for support by the social workers through various channels of information
of which the CBCPC and NGOs are vital sources. As reported by the social workers, community
level stakeholders contributed significantly to the identification of vulnerable children in the target
communities. The CBCPC, which consisted of stakeholders of child development such as
schoolteachers, headmasters, health workers, and more, were the primary source of information.
Other community actors who were part of the risk identification process included police officers,
journalists, local representatives, NGO workers, and the additional “aware citizens”. Such
community members report any cases of suspected child abuse, child marriage, child labour, and
other disadvantaged children in the community to the social workers, who then could bring the
child into case management and provide the needed support.
ii. Risk assessment
After identification of the child, the social worker uses the risk form to conduct a risk assessment
to determine the level of risk for each child. The risk assessment forms were revised during
the programme period by DSS, in consultation with UNICEF (the evaluation took place after
the revised forms were implemented). The revision was based on feedback from sub-national
offices. Yet, social workers found the revised form incredibly lengthy and cumbersome for them
and the respondents, who often provided poor quality responses as the interview progressed. They
highlighted the need to improve the usability of forms keeping in mind child respondents and
suggest simplifying the process to one interview combining parents and children.
The risk assessment form was described as too complicated and hard to understand for
the stakeholders conducting the risk assessments. As noted by a DSS official, the complicated
form can result in inaccuracies and false information being filled by social workers who were not
able to fully understand the requirements of the form. Social workers who also held the view that
there is scope for improvement of the risk assessment form, describing it as “very lengthy” and
“slow” to fill. The questions in the form are also described as “synonymous” or “repetitive” which
makes the process take longer and is taxing on the social worker and the child.
Since the risk assessment is conducted through an individual interview with the child, the language
and length of the form needs to be easy and friendly for the child to be able to understand the
questions and answer accurately. However, the language of the questions is found to be difficult -
the social workers did not always find them appropriated translated to Bangla and they were
difficult for children to understand.

After a child is identified for the

whether the child can receive the “The list will have the signature of Councilor, the signature of
CCT. If the decision is made in our concerned staff, the signature of our Director Sir, the
favour of providing the transfer, Signature of our Child Welfare Board.” – Social worker Khulna
the case is passed on to the higher-level officials in the DSS who approve the decision. The process
can take between 3 weeks and 6 months, per consultations with social workers. The approval
process can be simplified with fewer approvals, particularly since limited CCT provision is
established for social workers and officials at a higher level have limited understanding of the
child’s needs.
iv. Delivery of the cash transfer
The delivery of the cash transfer to the selected beneficiaries is done using a mix of electronic and
other modalities. In the survey data, 97% of the beneficiaries received the transfer amount through
bank transfers. However, in the interviews with programme stakeholders, it is reported that some
beneficiaries were provided cash and even cheques directly in the field. The difference in delivery
modality of the CCT is concerning as it is unclear what factors influence the method of delivery
for different beneficiaries and the cost to beneficiaries associated with different modalities.
With bank transfers, 24% of the beneficiary households reported incurring some expense at
normally withdrawing or receiving the CCT. Out of these households, almost all (97%) reported
having to spend money to receive the transfer amount. Such challenges in the delivery of benefit
negatively affect the programme efficiency.
45
v. Case Management Cycle
The case management cycle is depicted in the figure below as reported by social workers.
Figure 5. Case Management Cycle as described by Social workers
Data-related inefficiency drivers
The data management is among the weaker links in the CCT programme design and
implementation. The risk forms, which are an important source of data for case management and
the selection process of the CCT beneficiaries, were missing for all children who were assessed
before 2017. The data, to a great extent, was lost amidst the transition from MoWCA to MoSD.
With most data still paper-based in 2021, utilisation of the wealth of information collected through
this process was minimal – risk forms were rarely revisited or used for monitoring.
46
At the national level, MoSD had a beneficiary database with information that was useful to
understand the basic spread of the beneficiaries but was insufficient to help us identify the risk
drivers and understand the risk profile of the beneficiaries. Risk assessment forms were paper
based, and a part of the captured forms were stored with social workers. The social workers
maintained the forms for respondents who scored above 24 in the risk assessment but did not
store data on children that were assessed but scored less than 24 on the risk assessments. Pre 2017,
when the programme was administered by MoWCA, all beneficiary forms had been lost at time of
evaluation. The loss of data due to poor data management throughout this pilot is a significant
cost to the programme.
With significant time investment by the evaluation team and national and division level
government officials to locate the forms, the summary of the information found from Phase 1 and
Phase 2 is presented in the table below:
Type Phase 1 Phase 2
Non-Beneficiary Forms Not available At least 82
Vulnerable Non-Beneficiaries Not available At least 921
Vulnerable Beneficiaries At least 1,284 (from DSS) At least 1,616
+ 200 (from MoWCA)
Total 1,484 2,619
Since the assessment of risk itself is a highly resource intensive process and it is necessary to have
qualified social workers. In many cases, due to the national shortage of qualified social workers,
these assessments were undertaken by “case workers,” trained on the risk form, who were
necessarily qualified for social work. Hence, there were expected differences in the quality of risk
forms and assessments, despite the level of investments made by UNICEF and partners in the
capacity development of all frontline workers to ensure that the child protection programme
functions meaningfully and the quality of service or support is standardised across upazilas.
Institutional inefficiency drivers
Social workers involved in the programme did not have clarity on their institutional role.
Since the pilot was never integrated into the government’s social protection system, the social
workers – who had been hired for the pilot - were unclear on their employment and their future
roles. They reported being unsure if they were considered UNICEF workers or DSS workers, as
they were still receiving payments after the discontinuation of the CCT programme. The lack of
clarity results in efficiency losses as social workers manoeuvre through the different government
departments to do their jobs. Since they were temporary social workers, they were not able to
engage with other government case managers as needed for their role. As previously discussed, a
major part of the work done by the social workers is providing linkages to the children under case
management to existing government and non-government programmes. Such a task requires a
certain recognition of their designation and clarity of their wider position among the different
departments which they currently lack.

"We are not actually the employees of social service, we are not the employees of UNICEF, so who

we're their people, even though we're in their office. This begs the question of who we really are."—

Ey2. How cost-efficient is the CCT programme and what potential is there for efficiency
savings at all stages (capacity and constraints)?
UNICEF’s cost data indicate that since 2012, BDT 274.6 million has been spent on the CCT pilot
project. Between 2017 and 2020 – phase 2 of the CSSP programme implementation, the
programme costed UNICEF about BDT 36.16 million,50 while phase 1 (2012-2016) costed roughly
BDT 156.6 million. In phase 2, the programme provided CCT to roughly 1,688 beneficiaries and
a total of at least 2,768 children were assessed.
Year Cost (BDT) Beneficiaries Beneficiaries Average cost per

2017-2020 36,159,270.00 1,688 2,768 (for whom BDT 13,063
data was available)
A detailed cost breakdown of these expenses is not provided but it can be assumed that:
• Investments in developing the case management toolkit, training documents and tools
were incurred before 2017
• Cost of delivering training to social workers was incurred before 2017
• Cash transfer, due to conditions and monitoring requirements may incur administrative
costs between 10% and 12%,51 excluding the cost of targeting and identification incurred
through the risk assessment process
• Cost of risk assessment should be spread across all assessed beneficiaries, irrespective of
whether they receive any intervention.
• There is little known about the cost of case management, particularly when considering
the costs associated with the assessment and management of a child’s needs, as well as the
various services to which that child is referred. The estimation of time investment in case
management per child varies by child and as does the output, depending on the child’s
needs, making cost efficiency estimations difficult. A simplified approach commonly used
in these cases is the cost per beneficiary, expressed as:
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎
𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟
• 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 (𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑) =
𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑛 𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎
𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟
Based on these, some basic estimations have been presented below. The cost per beneficiary
including cost of case management and other administrative costs is estimated at BDT 18,213.16
of which BDT 13,000 is the cost of the transfer, BDT 5,013.61 is the cost associated with the case

management (risk assessment) and the remainder is other administrative costs. For those that did
not receive the CCT but may have received other interventions, the cost is the cost associated with

There is wide variation in the annual cost of case management, cost per beneficiary, the proportion
of total expenditures spent on case management by context, and the relative distribution in
spending by cost category.52 International Rescue Committee (IRC)53 that works in emergencies
suggest that child case management services last between six and 18 months, depending on the
child’s individual needs. The cost of case management is known to vary significantly by context,
region and intensity of the case management. IRC’s54 case management services cost approximately
USD 764 per child over the course of a year in urban settings in the Middle East, about USD 187
per child in IDP camps in East Africa and about USD 874 per child in rural Sahel areas. For these
programmes, the cost estimations exclude any cost of training for social workers. Even within the
Middle East, the cost per child varied – USD 440 per child in Jordan, compared with USD 1,386
per child in Lebanon, driven primarily by local price levels.55 An analysis of cost of case
management for orphans and vulnerable children in six countries in Africa56 found that cost per

beneficiary ranged from USD 9.77 in South Africa57, USD 21.96 in Rwanda to USD 50.41 in
Zambia. Except in Tanzania, where training costs were over 50% of programme cost, in other
countries, costs were primarily personnel related. For the CSSP CCT, the case management costed
between USD 58 and USD 65 (depending on exchange rates) per child in Bangladesh. Based on a
review of social service workforce in South Asia, in 2010 Bangladesh reported 6.07 government
social workers per 100,000 children.58
There is consensus that the scale at which programmes operate has major impact on the
cost per child served. Economies of scale are not

pilots intended for national scale-up, numerous
opportunities exist in Bangladesh for spreading these fixed costs. Case conferences undertaken
as part of the CSSP have been successful in linking children to the necessary social services
and other support. The monthly case conferences present as good practice for cross sectional
and inter-departmental coordination that was a result of the programme. The case conferences
were organised to present the intervention plan for children under case management. This involved
stakeholders at the upazila level, the field level, and even district level from different departments
and agencies. Bringing all the relevant stakeholders in the field of child sensitive social protection,
the programme was able to support the enhanced of provision of services through improved
coordination. Through these monthly events, linkages to the existing social protection services and
other kinds of support were established at the upazila level. This was able to achieve one of the
intended outcomes of the programme and significantly contributed to the improvement in
programme cost efficiency. These activities highlight how the CSSP CCT programme
already enables linkages with vital services for children with disabilities and learning
difficulties – establishing case management tools formally across other cash transfers such
as the education stipend and services can significantly reduce the cost burden of case
management on similar programmes in the future. Formalising practices such as case
conferences that strengthen cross-sectoral linkages can be vital to reducing the cost
burden.
Finally, the evaluation is limited in its ability to provide a detailed analysis of cost drivers
due to lack of information on cost by function. Better management of costs data, better

children during the 18 months period of whether the immediate income support enabled the
households to meet the needs of the child such as food and ensure that families can invest in
human capital accumulation services such as education and health care and stay unmarried.
Ef1. How effective was the programme in achieving its expected results in terms of
outcomes and progress towards impacts? Is the programme equally efficient when
considering vulnerable girls and boys being benefited? How successful was the
programme in improving access to and the use of services?
The survey with parents, caregivers and adolescents explored the knowledge, attitudes and
practices surrounding education, child marriage, and child labour. They also explored agency-
related indicators to assess the ways in which the parent-child relationship may have evolved in
the terms of children’s bargaining power within the household on these vital issues.
The survey asked about children’s willingness to marry after the age of eighteen and continue
schooling at least until age 18 years and their ability to negotiate their choices with parents and
caregivers (Table below). When comparing children in the dataset who received no intervention
to those receiving the CCT and comparing those receiving other interventions to those receiving
the CCT and other interventions (CCT+), a higher share of children receiving CCT
(0.438)/CCT+(0.282) were sure that parents would support their aspirations and were confident

of accessing their desired level of education (0.201). When comparing children in the dataset who
received no intervention to those receiving the CCT, more beneficiary children were also
comfortable would negotiating decisions with parents/guardians about their education (0.385). On
the contrary, comparing children in the dataset who received other interventions to those receiving
the CCT+, a smaller share of children receiving the CCT+ (-0.145) reported discussing
disagreements on decisions regarding their marriage with their parents.

The survey also captured aspects of attitudes and practices within families based on gendered roles.
The table below shows that when compared to caregivers from households that did not benefit
from any intervention, those receiving the CCT were more likely to disagree that woman’s most
important role is to take care of the home, the children and cook for the family, but also more
likely to disagree that when faced with a limited amount of money to pay for tutoring, it should be
spent equally on daughters and sons. The finding suggests that those receiving the CCT may have
adopted more gender inclusive behaviours and attitudes, that can translate to equal opportunities
for boys and girls within the house.

At the same time, women in households receiving the CCT were less likely to accept the
intervention of an outsider in the event of marital violence compared to those receiving no
interventions. In these circumstances, protection of women and children against violence and
abuse within the household can become challenging.
When compared to caregivers from households that received interventions other than the CCT,
the data show that those receiving the CCT+ were more likely to disagree that marriage provides
protection to a girl, and that seizing the opportunity of a good marriage was more important than
continuing a child’s education. At the same time, the data showed that CCT+ receiving households
were also more likely to disagree that education provides protection to a girl compared to those
receiving other interventions. No significant differences were found on attitudes and practices
related to timing of marriage, final decisions on marriage and on education.
Qualitative data confirm that children are staying in school longer. The quantitative data
cannot confirm that the provision of cash alone had any significant improvement in this regard,
but evidence suggest that the programme (CCT and case management) has contributed to
reduction in the dropout rate through a combination of cash and case management. As reported

affirm that parents generally are more likely to encourage girls to stay in school, but pressure from
society – neighbours and others – to get girls married, the negative remarks and connotations
targeted at older unmarried girls in the community and a broader perception that older girls are
better served within the domestic environment (no employment or play) are the larger causes of
girls dropping out of school. In many cases, girls being married young are promised continuation
of education post marriage, but this seldom materializes.

Evidence from Case Study: CCT success story
Fiza* is 19 years old and lives with her parents in Khulna. She has 3 older siblings who are either
working, studying or married. Fiza has always been interested in education, and has had good
grades, but it has been very difficult for her father to support her education with his minimal income.
When she passed SSC, her family wanted to get her married, but since she received very good
grades, they agreed to admit her to the HSC level.
Fiza was referred to the CCT by a community member and was able to receive all three instalments
of the programme. Using the money she was able to continue with her studies and is currently
studying Honors at Khulna University. Post the CCT period, Fiza was able to receive other support
for her higher education such as stipends and scholarships. Despite this support, she had financial
problems while being enrolled into university. However, after submitting her result mark sheet to the
social service office, she recently received another 3,000 taka which was given to meritorious
students.
Fatema is a role model and represents the successes of the CCT programme. As a result of receiving
the CCT she has been able to complete her school and is now studying at Khulna University. Her
story is different from many of her friends, who were married off from at a very young age as their
families did not believe in the value of investing in their daughters’ education.
Fiza wants to pursue higher levels of education and everyone in her family gives her a lot of
encouragement and support for this. According to Fiza, the CCT has helped her financially, and her
family has become more aware of the importance of girl’s education. If she hadn't received the CCT,
she probably “wouldn't have been able to go so far so easily.” Other people in the society also see
her as an example for girl’s education and further encourage her.
*The names do not reflect the actual names of individuals interviewed.
There is evidence that the programme contributed towards a decrease in the number of
child marriages, at least temporarily. Data from the beneficiary database show that most
dropouts continue to be because of labour related migration, but child marriage still
represents 1/3 of the dropped-out children. More community-based and behavior change
focused interventions are required.
Child marriage is a complex risk and work towards eliminating it needs to address the root causes
that contribute to the risk. Non-monetary issues that drive child marriages cannot be tackled using
cash and conditions. Without community level engagement and positives reinforcement, progress
toward impact will be limited and at risk of quick reversal of progress on withdrawal of cash and
monitoring will remain high
Social workers and other programme stakeholders reported relative decrease in child marriages in
the targeted areas. The conditions for the CCT ensured that caregivers did not get their daughters
married to remain eligible for the CCT to a great extent. However, it did not completely stop child
marriages for girls, as almost all social workers that were interviewed for the study reported losing
cases where the girl was married and had to be dropped from the CCT and case management.
When the beneficiary database was provided to EPRI, there were 1,688 households currently
enrolled in the CCT. In March 2020, 122 children dropped out of the programme (of 1,688) before
the second instalment was paid and 167 had already been dropped from the programme (almost
55
10% of total beneficiaries), while another 951 were yet to be paid (excluding 71 special once-off
transfer cases).

Of these 27% had been dropped as they were married, while 36% were dropped as they migrated
for labour and another 26% were dropped due to discontinuation of schooling, 5% of the children
had died during the programme and another 5% had gotten access to Islamic Finance funding. Of
those that were dropped from the programme, majority were girls (68%). Girls tended to drop out
primarily due to marriage or child labour (35% of all who dropped out cause of marriage and equal
for child labour). Girls also represented 71% of total dropouts due to child labour, and 96% of
total dropouts due to child marriage. 3 out of the 4 reported deaths were also girls.

girls. In nearly all FGDs with adolescents, cases
of girls eloping with boys of their choice are referenced as a case of child marriage in the immediate
sphere of influence for the participating children. There is, therefore, a fear of forced marriage
exacerbating child marriages manifested through a lack of agency of girls in determining their
partner.
As reported by adolescent girls, since child marriages are not legal, in order to register the marriage,
parents of the children offered incentives to the marriage officer to change the age of the girl on
the official documents. Hence all the cases of marriages that might be taking place would not be
registered as child marriages.
As a result of the conditions associated with the

56
Apart from the conditions, social workers and CBCPC members were forced to adopt
interventions such as physically stopping child marriages in the community. Social workers often
were informed of suspected child marriages through the helpline number 1098 which community
members use to report cases of child abuse, marriages, and other vulnerable children in their
localities. After receiving an alert through the helpline, social workers along with CBCPC members
report intervening and reporting to the police. Using such methods several child marriages were
prevented. However, the impact of forced measures in changing the situation of vulnerable girls
and altering social practices and attitudes is extremely limited. Development partners working in
towards the prevention of child marriages, and local NGOs, including those involved in CSSP
programme report that such intervention are disruptive and unhelpful in bringing the desired
societal change.

free of risk through continued support and
guidance to the caregivers and children.
Based on qualitative data, the lack of security of girls in the community, eve teasing, parental
attitudes, and lack of awareness of risks of early marriage and pregnancy are significant
contributors to the risk of child marriage. Parents report fearing sexual abuse and kidnapping of
their daughters. In such situations, parents report that getting the girl married somewhat puts an
end to the harassment, which motivates the parents to go through with it.
The lack of awareness of parents and the children on the risks of child marriage and early
pregnancy for the girls also contributes to the risk of child marriages in the context. As reported
by a social worker in Khulna, case workers seek to counsel and provide awareness to the mothers
and the girls on the “horrors of early marriage, physical, mental, and risk of death” to change the
attitudes of parents and influence their behaviour towards child marriage. However, these
interventions are not systematic, and often conducted in an ad-hoc manner by some social workers.
Evidence from Case Study: Child marriages as a result of community pressure and family honour
Loxmi * is a 17 year old girl from Gaibandha. When she was 15, she and her younger siblings
attended school regularly. After an incident where she was nearly assaulted by a boy known to her
family, while she was home alone, her life changed completely. While the boy was reported to the
community and chairman of the village, and everyone knew that she was the victim in the incident,
Loxmi’s family still suffered social stigma due to concerns about her honour.
Loxmi was made to drop out of the school and her family got her married as soon as possible. Since
she was young, she continued to stay with her parents but was not sent to school in fears of the
social backlash of sending a married girl to school. Loxmi says that though there is more awareness
of such crimes in the community following this incident, many girls in the community are too scared
to walk on the streets or to be alone at home.
57
Loxmi herself realises the injustice she suffered due to actions of another person. She believes that
even if girls want to get married to protect their honour and free their parents from worry, child
marriage is unacceptable.
*The names do not reflect the actual names of individuals interviewed.
No support is considered for girls after marriage in cases of child marriage
All interventions through the CSSP for vulnerable children end once a child is married. Child
brides receive no support or protection after marriage and no attempt is made to reintegrate them
in formal education. The general attitude of social workers and even higher-level programme
officials about child marriage indicated that once a girl was married there was no use in trying to
reach her or provide support to her. Even girls enrolled in the CCT were not reached out to once
they were dropped from the programme for breaking conditions. Once married, the risk to health,
survival and wellbeing of girls is heightened and the need of support such as counselling, linkages
to healthcare, and education become far more critical.
Especially regarding re-enrolment of girls after marriage, the programme implementers, including
social workers were unable to see any benefit of continuing education after marriage – a gender
negative approach that is harmful to girls. This also contrasts with the attitudes of adolescent girls
under case management who report the desire to study and highlight the need for support with
family to enable them to continue education after marriage.
Social workers, CBCPC and others have been working towards eliminating hazardous
child labour,61 however children are still engaged in labour which is not limited in hours
and might be impacting their social and educational development.
Social workers and communities believe that children working in paid labour cannot be eliminated
due to the financial constraints that most households face. The cash provided through the CCT is
not adequate for eliminating the need for earnings from children and trying to eliminate child
labour without additional financial support for households is not feasible per the data collected
from parents, CBCPC members and social workers. Hence, social workers have been working
towards ensuring that the children are working in a safe, healthy and risk-free environment. If a
child under case management is involved in labour, social workers speak to the employer about
ensuring safety and health of the child at the workplace and ensuring attendance in school as far
as possible by negotiating the working hours, so the child is not working during school hours.
However, the study finds that many children are engaged in labour which affects their school
hours, which might be impacting their social and educational development. As a result, while many
children are enrolled in school, attendance remains lower than expected and learning is a secondary
priority. Many children report long days – 5 am to 11 pm. Where most girls report domestic chores
and helping their moms, boys report petty jobs and supporting the family or parents with their
61 In terms of child labour, the CCT aimed for parents to keep their children out of all forms of labour after graduating
from the programme. However, the findings are discussed in context of child labour as defined by the UN Convention
on the Rights of the Child (1989) as ‘any kind of work for which children are too young or which is dangerous or exploitative, which
damages physical or mental development or prevents children from attending school;’ Or as defined by UNICEF children who are
‘either too young to work or are involved in hazardous activities that may compromise their physical, mental, social or educational
development.’
58
work. Many children receiving the CCT are cared for by their mothers alone. In these cases,
children often miss school to share the load of domestic work and other tasks for the mother.
Child labour is not actively reported in any FGDs by children aged 10-13 but most children in the
adolescent FGDs report either paid or unpaid work, beyond acceptable hours for their age and
often interfering with education and learning. The beneficiary dropout data suggests that 75% of
labour related dropping out of the programme was reported for girls. Considering social norms
regarding the role of boys in supporting household income generation, and the perceptions of
social workers in this regard, it is highly likely that boys in labour may have been allowed to
continue in the programme.
Social workers, CBCPC and others have been working towards eliminating hazardous
child labour
Reports from Social workers:
- “We always oppose child labor. There will be no child involved in the child labor, if there is any risk free job and
it was found that the family is indigent, then we permit the children to do that job if the child can earn 500-
100bdt. But that job should be safe for children, risk-free. If there is such work, we also help them in the
workplace, talk to the owner that the child will work some specific hours a day. We talk if we think some children
need that.” – Social worker Khulna

that our children help us in the household works, it can also be considered as a work but if we want to refer to
the work which generates an income, they can get involved with a business to help their parents after their school
hours. They can get involved with such kinds of work, but they cannot get involved with any such kind of work

any work which will be harmful for their nearby environment, but they can help their family members with different
soft works, I think this can not cause any kind of problem.”- KII with a DSS official
- Stopping child labour does not contribute to their welfare and the goal should be to stop children
from working in risky jobs- "The totally risk free jobs, the children can get involved with such kind of

children work in a safe environment. The NGO imposed three conditions on employers of

Absence of community level social and behaviour change interventions limit girls’ agency
and empowerment. While counselling and providing guidance to the caregivers and immediate
household members of the children resulted in an increase in positive attitudes and practices for
childcare and gender sensitivity, the attitudes and community pressures on marriage need to be
addressed. There is a need for more active programming to strengthen community-based

Ef2. How effective was the programme in increasing the capacity of social workers to
improve their work beyond their direct tasks of the CCT programme, and improving
the capacity of social workers, and community structures such as CBCPC to protect
vulnerable children?
For the duration of the CSSP programme, case workers demonstrated the ability to go
beyond the programme boundaries to solicit support for and protect children against child
marriage, labour and to keep them in school. Nonetheless, once programme funding is
discontinued, the extent to which the vital capacity strengthening that took place through
the CSSP will translate to strengthened national capacity for case management remains
unclear. Considering that the programme has not been integrated with national systems, there is
a stronger likelihood that programme funded structures such as the social workers or the CBCPC
may be discontinued. However, there is also some evidence to suggest that the presence of the
CBCPC has increased community awareness and activated community members to proactively
identify and seek children at risk and stop practices such as child marriage. The trickle down effects
of this project on communities may have a lasting effect.

capabilities.
Social workers have contributed to changing attitudes and practices in the targeted areas.
Social workers have had a vital role to play in changing knowledge and practices and strengthening
inter-familiar relationships between parents and children, through counselling and other services.
As part of case management, social workers provide counselling to children and their caregivers
regarding childcare and reducing risks of the child. Guidance is provided to families on issues such
as dangers of child marriage and early pregnancy in girls, advantages of sending the child to school,
healthy nutritional practices and even on seeking higher education. Such counselling is reported to
be significantly used in cases of children who are in conflict and contact with the law, as they
require additional support while dealing with social stigma and continued efforts to avoid future
conflicts or crimes.

unsure of their future as case managers, whether they are employed by UNICEF or the
government but are continuing to monitor children and encourage continuation of education.
They also report challenges answering questions regarding the CCT and whether children who had
not received some tranches would ever receive it. This has not deterred social workers for working
with children for their protection and wellbeing.
Ef3. How well did the financial management and programme monitoring system
establish and function?
CBCPC supports with monitoring children in the field. However, none of this additional
monitoring is recorded for verification, learning or other accountability.
The established system of active monitoring and follow ups of children under case management
through the CBCPC members has been reported to be very successful by programme stakeholders.
Since CBCPC members include relevant stakeholders such as schools’ teachers, headmasters,
former elected officials, and health workers, they are able to support monitoring of CCT children
by reporting the attendance of the child along with other activities which are relevant to the
conditions of the programme. Follow up checks about possible improvement in the condition of
the child are also supported by speaking to the families of the children under case management,
seeking to assess the level of risk of the

Despite evidence from the quantitative and qualitative data that monitoring of beneficiaries were
undertaken, no records are kept from the monitoring processes. Consequently, neither can the
quality of the monitoring be assessed for the evaluation; it also significantly reduces any learning
opportunities, limits accountability and opens the programme up for potential abuse
1098 helpline supported case management
The 1098 helpline number is described as the number to be called in case of child protection
violation. It alerts DSS/social workers who go check on the child to ensure their safety. This
number is widely reported by social workers and beneficiaries as an important tool for
identification of vulnerable children and supporting case management. Even children and
caregivers recognise the number as the means of reporting child rights violations or in the case of
adolescent girls to be able to reach out for support to avoid forced marriages. DSS officials
reported receiving 20,000 to 25,000 calls through the helpline number in a month before the
evaluation (2021 February).
Ef4. How successful was the programme in monitoring and enforcing the programme’s
conditions? How successful was the programme in following up with the households
and children after graduation (in those cases where children were still under 18 at the
point of graduation)? Was the programme equally capable to monitor the situation of
boys and girls after benefiting from the programme?
Social workers were successful in monitoring conditions in the programme period, but
children become hard to track and monitor till the age of 18 due to workload of social
workers and movement of children away from the original location. However, there was
no documented evidence of these monitoring visits, or any information on what was
monitored. There was no structured process or checklist for monitoring. Consequently,
despite the monitoring of beneficiaries and children, lack of documents precludes
reflective learning, lessons or feedback into programme improvement and weakens
programme accountability.
The CCT and the case management activities both rely heavily on strong monitoring processes.
The data collected from parents and social workers confirm that social workers conducted follow-
up monitoring either through visits or through monitoring calls. The method used depended on
the time availability of social workers, who were already very stretched. The school attendance and
enrolment data were collected from schools to verify CCT compliance and in some cases, social
workers also talk with the teachers to confirm attendance.
During the 18-month period of CCT receipt, the social workers monitor status of children in
education before confirming payments. Additionally, beyond monitoring the CCT’s compliance,
the discussions with families and social workers show case management and monitoring helps - to
some extent - to reduce risk of child marriage. Some social workers continue
monitoring/providing support to children after 18-month period for CCT and other identified
vulnerable children under case management; however, this is not true for all social workers. Where
social workers monitor children for a longer duration, there are several positive effects for higher
education of girls - for instance, a girl from Khulna sought admission at Khulna University. Once
she was admitted, she confirmed receiving 3000 BDT from the social service council. In another
63
instance, about 23 girls received a 2000-3000 BDT merit based educational assistance through the
case management system.
While these are encouraging outcomes of the case management process, there is a lack of
structured activities or guidance on activities that lead to more sustainable paths towards
protection of children. While the monitoring process does certainly have a positive effect on
keeping children in school and away from child marriage and child labour in the short-term; in the
current form, the monitoring processes and lack of clear feedback loops will not be enough to
drive long-term change. There is no clear understanding of what social workers can do to
address the community-based risks and challenges, no guidelines on feeding back the
monitoring data or information into the programme design or design of other suitable
interventions. Therefore, there is also little motivation among social workers to keep all
necessary reports and records.
Finally, social workers report high workload – especially administrative tasks that take away their
time available for case management and monitoring. In this case, they report that CBCPC
members and other community members also play a vital role on monitoring conditions, especially
if the social workers cannot be there to keep track of children. While there was no fixed age until
when the monitoring was concluded, social workers explained that monitoring after graduating
was dependent on social workers’ time availability and the ability to reach children via the phone
numbers in their records. They also indicate that with children – especially boys – needing to
engage in some form of work, it is difficult to monitor them up to the age of 18.
Due to lack of monitoring records, post CCT monitoring cannot be validated, nor can its
quality and frequency be confirmed. There is some evidence of these being conducted – as
corroborated by children and parents – however, there is no record of when these calls were made
or visits were done, no written update or report on the child or his/her status or any record of
actions taken.
As reported by DSS and other high level programme official, as per the guidelines, social workers

The monitoring process exists but is ad-hoc and not standardized. It does not include any official
assessments or records - there are no records of monitoring of beneficiaries. The accounts of social
workers and children from the qualitative data do not provide evidence that such monitoring was
consistently done by all social workers in a systematic way. Very few social workers reported any
detail on monitoring children after the CCT or through to age 18 years.

S1. How can the learnings from this programme guide policy and programmatic
structuring towards a more inclusive, sustainable approach to social protection of
vulnerable groups?
Social workforce and case management are non-negotiable elements of child sensitive
social protection.
The CSSP programme demonstrates the vital role and the great potential that social workers and
case management approaches offer for the protection of children from abuse, neglect, and child
marriage. The CSSP highlights that social worker led case management approaches are highly
valuable for addressing social challenges and protecting the rights of children. More importantly,
they have a direct effect on access to essential services like education and health care for all and
complimentary services like counselling and other support, when needed. Having access to case
managers have significantly improved the agency of children, provided them with a safe space to
seek help and helped build a more enabling environment within the household for girls by
changing the attitudes of parents towards child marriage in particular.
The cash, on the other hand, was vital for reducing child labour or reducing risky child labour and
mitigating the impact of child labour on schooling of the concerned children, in combination with
case management activities. However, the effect of the cash transfer was limited to the eighteen-
month period, where the household anticipated and received the cash. The income effect that
alleviated the need for child’s labour was limited and temporary, suggesting the need for more
longer-term and complex cash plus interventions. With strong and robust case management and
monitoring, the role of conditions in cash is redundant. As the data showed, social workers used
a spectrum of interventions to encourage and enable children to stay in school, which were
effective. Then, the role of conditions amplifies the administrative load of managing conditions,
which could be better allocated to case management activities. Here, the conditions serve to ensure
that social workers fulfil their responsibilities in terms of monitoring and supporting children,
rather than a necessary instrument in catalysing uptake of education.
It is evident through this evaluation that social service workforce and case management systems
are non-negotiable when trying to address child marriage and child labour but that the knowledge,
attitudes and practices of social workers are incredibly vital in promoting the right behaviours
among families of vulnerable children.
The CSSP programme is a crucial hub of information to strengthen the social service workforce
for the protection of children in Bangladesh. To leverage the full potential of case management
approaches, it is imperative to have adequate number of social workers focusing on improving
66
knowledge, attitudes and practices at all spheres of influence for a child. The ecological systems
framework63 by Bronfenbrenner explains that child development occurs through a complex
interplay between the child and its environment and as such that human development is an
outcome of influencing and being deeply influenced by the subject’s surroundings. Therefore,
childhood development and behaviour do not occur in isolation but through dynamic external and
internal forces that influence both factors. Changes at the individual level – access to education;
family level – bargaining power, knowledge and awareness; community level – social perceptions
and acceptable behaviours and attitudes and then the national policies, frameworks and
infrastructure are vital institutions that influence how child marriage and child labour are valued
and perceived. To tackle these issues, interventions must be able to influence the individual, family
and community in conjunction with activities to create a more enabling economic, policy and legal
environment for protecting children’s rights. Similarly, conditions may be counterproductive to
prevent exclusion of the most marginalized and vulnerable – where those that are most unable to
meet conditions despite the cash, who may need the support are excluded.
Education is critical for reducing a whole spectrum of other risks for children
School enrolment and continued attendance are vital for ensuring a child is protected against a
spectrum of risks. Learnings about role of schooling for reducing risk for children from global
evidence is reported by substantiated in the study. Programme implementers – social workers,
CBCPC – as well as DSS and development partners affirm that every additional year of education
for girls reduces the chances of child marriage, delays marriage and pregnancy and improves the
agency of girls. Apart from receiving education for building potential of the child, schools also
provide a space to the children where they are monitored and provided guidance and support to
them and their families.
Extending the programme to cover married children will be instrumental in preventing
further violation of children’s rights
Global evidence affirms that education can be critical in reducing early childbearing and teenage
pregnancies. Nonetheless, the current programme drops girls that are married from both the CCT
and the case management system, therefore, excluding a significant and extremely vulnerable group
of children. Ensuring that at least those that are married while on case management, continue to
be monitored after marriage, to prevent early childbirth and continue education for will be
instrumental in improving educational outcomes and preventing further violation of rights for
young women.
The CSSP was not designed to scale and in its current form will be extremely challenging
to scale due limited social work capacity and intensive resource requirements for case
management and low government willingness to take over the pilot.
After twelve years of implementation, the programme was still being implemented as a pilot – not
integrated within national systems, and still financially and technically supported by UNICEF.
Higher level programme officials were not very familiar with the CCT design and objectives due
to the change in persons responsible for the programme since its inception. Government officials
who were interviewed as part of the study had limited knowledge of the CCT programme and
63 (Bronfenbrenner, 1992)
67
reported being not involved in the project or not “following the project.” In 2017, the programme
was transferred from MoWCA to MoSW. When this evaluation was started, the project team from
MoWCA was not reachable (in 2019), all programme data were misplaced, and no lessons or
records could be drawn from the pre-2017 phase of the programme – including case forms and
data on children. Consequently, a tremendous learning opportunity was lost, as the evaluation of
the programme was gravely limited. In 2022, as the evaluation team returned to the field to capture
data on the programme since 2017, the lead agencies working as counterparts with the UNICEF
team had little to no information on this programme, the CSSP team within DSS had been
discontinued and programme professionals were no longer in office.
Officials from DSS and other ministries interviewed at endline displayed a lack of confidence in
the programme design in attaining the intended objectives. An official from DSS strongly
emphasised that the goal of their work in the department was not aligned with the intervention
logic of the CCT, and their focus was on supporting vulnerable children through better referrals
and linkages. They highlighted that tackling child marriage and child labour were top priorities for
the government. However, they would benefit from building services into the national cash
transfer programmes.
While there was a keen interest in scaling the risk assessment, the capacity at the upazila level or
lower level of social workers remains greatly limited. On a positive note, the social workers put in
place for the CSSP through UNICEF were still on duty and conducting monitoring activities even
after UNICEF’s support to the programme had ended
(at the time of data collection). Social workers were unsure of whether they were hired by UNICEF
or the government but reported to still hold their positions. A lack of information, ad-hoc
programme changes, lack of commitment at the highest level and inadequate communication drive
the lack of programme sustainability.
The government did not lead or support the programme oversight or monitoring activities or take
responsibility for the programme quality. Much of this burden continued to be borne by UNICEF.
Without accountability and responsibility, the government has limited lessons and experience
implementing this programme despite the programme continuing longer than many mainstream
social protection interventions in the country.
The programme cycle is complex, repetitive and lengthy. Due to a lack of formal monitoring or
evaluation activities over the last twelve years, and a lack of feedback loops, the programme has
been implemented with ad-hoc changes to risk forms and no improvements to programme
processes. The programme design requires three levels of verification and approvals of the list of
children to be enrolled for the CCT, which increases resource requirements and lengthens the
programme cycle with no apparent gains. Despite a strong monitoring system for children, the
programme adopts conditions for cash, which require case workers to spend time on
administrative activities such as gathering and maintaining attendance records from schools.
Conclusively, due to the lack of a streamlined approach to gradual nationalization of the
programme, the government relied heavily on UNICEF for implementation and oversight. For a
case management-led approach, the programme has verification and approval processes at
multiple levels – detached from the case management assessment – where decisions to exclude
children were made based on availability of finances, which not only undermines programme
68
impact but also reduces the confidence of beneficiary children from the case management system
and social workers.
For scaling programmes that tackle dropouts, child marriage and child labour sustainably, the CSSP
offers the following key lessons:
• Services need to be linked to national cash transfer programmes through referrals and
other mechanisms (case management) to improve child sensitivity
• Child protection needs require holistic interventions at the individual, family and
community levels, supported by legal and policy frameworks that enable their protection
• Respond to gendered differences in risks - boys and girls face different challenges, at
different ages and driven by different combination of factors. While risk to child labour
for boys is primarily financial deprivation led, child labour for girls is a combination of
financial constraints and social constructs. Child marriage is more prevalent among girls
and driven largely by social constraints such as prevailing perceptions on girls’ marriages,
the lack of agency among girls in choosing their partners, safety and security risks for girls
as they age.
• The social service workforce needs to be strengthened as a top priority – trained social
workers are necessary for implementing linked programmes and enabling cross-
programme referrals.
• Conditions on cash become redundant when case management and monitoring activities
are high quality, regular and systematic.
S2. How can the major capacity gaps and bottlenecks at national and sub-national levels
be overcome if a different approach to social protection was employed?
The programme could significantly reduce resource and administration costs by utilizing
existing social protection programmes/processes to deliver cash, and strictly focusing the
role of social workers on case management activities.
Social workers are the primary implementers of the programme and are vital in the ensuring
delivery of the transfer and the case management for the beneficiary children. All social workers,
who were interviewed as part of the evaluation, reported lack of manpower at the field level – a
sentiment echoed by development partners and NGOs. Since social workers were responsible for
case management, cash delivery for CCT and for administration and record-keeping, several tasks
such as data recording and management fell through the cracks. It is imperative to establish a social
workforce team that focuses on the non-administrative components of the processes, with support
from an administrative staff for other tasks. The lost potential due to lack of administrative support
in the quality of case work is a key consideration for any future programming in the given context.
“if I have a lot more co-workers and if they are proficient in these tasks, then we can do our job better
and I do all the office work now that I am alone, then I don't have to do that anymore, but we can all
work together. It will be beneficial if we can get various technological benefits such as computer
usage, printer usage, logistical support, etc.”- Social worker Shibganj
“"In this case, if there is administrative staff, the hassle will be reduced. Otherwise, it is not possible
to handle 350-400 children for follow up along with administrative duties."—Social worker Kurigram
69
An increase in the social workforce is mandatory to improve and maintain the quality of
case management and sustain the positive effects of the programme and similar
programmes over time.
All social workers, who were interviewed as part of the evaluation, reported handling a large
number of cases, which significantly impacted their time availability for and quality of activities /
services per child. The amount of time the social workers can spend on each case is reduced due
to the high caseload and results in considerable stress for the social workers. All stakeholders
interviewed in this evaluation agree that the numbers and quality of social workers are a vital barrier
for scaling integrated social protection in Bangladesh and without a planned scale up of the
workforce, extending integrated services and protection services for children will be extremely
challenging.
S3. How sustainable are the impacts on the lives of children and their households after
graduation (for those that were younger than 18 at the time of graduation)? Does this
sustainability vary between boys and girls?
The programme, as reported in qualitative data, has demonstrated the ability to keep children in
school, reduce the risk of child marriage to some extent and to reduce the prevalence of risky child
labour to some extent while the children are in the CCT and in the case management roster. Since
there are no accessible records of monitoring activities after the CCT, it is difficult to estimate
what share of children receive this assistance but social workers in half the locations reported that
they continue to monitor and manage the cases of children who were under the age of 18 years,
irrespective of their CCT status. They seek access to necessary services and assistance from the
upazila administration for these children and continue to offer guidance on continuing education,
preventing marriage and risky labour. When a child can be traced and if social workers have the
time to monitor, they can have a significant role in sustaining programme outcomes longer term.
For instance, a child who received all CCT instalments was found to have dropped out of school
in a follow-up monitoring session. The social workers spoke with the headmaster and got the child
re-admitted in school. Case workers only close the case for the child under 18 if the situation has
improved enough to eliminate risk.
The ability of the CCT to sustainably reduce the financial constraints enough to ensure children
will be kept in school, out of marriage and labour is highly contentious. Evidence from the field
suggest that the chances of such improvement in household income is unlikely and may pose a
risk for more hours spent working for children. However, the case management system
demonstrates high potential to keep children in school and out of marriage and risky labour as
long as children are in the system, trackable and social workers are able to monitor them (case
load). If a child is out of the case management system, then the likelihood of the programme
outcomes being sustained cannot be confirmed. Social workers suggest that after age 13-14 years,
girls’ risk of child marriage remains high irrespective of financial constraints. Many boys also leave
the village and move to Dhaka and other areas for work, making it very difficult for social workers
to track them.
In some cases, social workers establish long-term contacts/ mentor-mentee relationships with
CCT and non-CCT beneficiary children. They report being reached out to by children for guidance
70
and calling them periodically to check on them. Children trying to resume higher education and
learning were most likely to out to social workers for additional support like scholarships.
S4. Has the programme led to any positive or negative unintended results, taking into
consideration COVID-19?64
In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, the programme was discontinued. While the programme
demonstrated some progress towards impacts such as reducing child labour and reducing or
delaying child marriage; the sustainability of these progress and thus, achievement of impact in the
long-run is questionable. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a global reversal in access to education
and gravely increased the risk of child marriage and labour among low-income households as loss
of earnings, rising poverty levels and hunger, and school closures made children and youth
susceptible to such social practices.
Numerous studies65 have suggested that COVID-19 has the potential to reverse the progress made
in reducing child marriage. Afrin and Zainuddin (2021)66 found that COVID-19 has triggered
hundreds of underage marriages in Bangladesh, mostly in rural areas. He indicates with evidence
that 71% of underage marriages in Bangladesh occurred due to the school closure amid the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Under such circumstances, the already weak indication of
successful reduction of child marriages through this programme may be unachievable.
Similar trends are expected for child labour in Bangladesh. Child’s rights advocates estimate that
tens of thousands of boys in Bangladesh were forced into work during the pandemic. After an
initial surge in child marriages for underage girls, the rise in child labour among boys was rapid
and rampant, which went largely unnoticed until schools reopened and large numbers of boys did
not return to school.67 Prolonged school closures and financial woes led to mass dropouts of boys,
who will not return to school again.
Given the longer-term impact of these losses, there is a strong chance that the progress made
through the programme will not be sustained unless social work and child protection mechanisms
are aggressively scaled and immediately put in action to get out of school children back into school
and prevent further child marriage and labour as households battle the long-term fight against the
effects of COVID-19.

5. Conclusions
The CSSP programme has been implemented for over twelve years. In these twelve years, the
programme has filled a critical gap in capacity for protecting children’s rights. The key contribution
of this programme has been to establish and pilot a robust case management system, with
important lessons for future investments in this area.
The CSSP was relevant and responsive to the needs of vulnerable children to some extent. While
the choice to use conditional cash transfer rather than unconditional could not be justified with
regards to the needs among vulnerable households, capacity of local government and service
providers; and the programme did not fully meet all the monetary or non-monetary needs and
challenges of the targeted households, it was able to support households financially in a significant
manner over the short term and provide invaluable support for improving knowledge, attitudes
and practices towards child marriage and education within families.
The case management system enabled the identification of vulnerable children – especially children
with disabilities – for a wide spectrum of services through strong referrals and linkages. The data
on effectiveness show that the case management process was also pivotal in contributing to the
three longer-term goals – keeping children in school until age 18 years and consequently, reduce
the risk of child marriage and child labour. Evidence indicates that cash transfer programmes
reduce poverty and vulnerability and improve well-being across a range of dimensions including
food security, health, schooling, child protection, productive activities, and safe transitions to
adulthood.68 Despite these positive effects, cash alone is insufficient to overcome structural
barriers for improving living standards and well-being.69 Hence, linking cash transfer programmes
to complementary interventions and existing services (cash plus) can boost the effects of cash for
more transformative outcomes on the lives of beneficiaries.
The development of the risk management protocols, intensive support for strengthening the social
workforce and establishment of a case management system, along with testing of the tools and
providing on-the-job training to the social workers implementing the programme have provided a
solid base upon which a national social workforce can be established. One of the largest gaps in
social protection systems around the world is not having an adequately resourced and scaled social
service workforce. Even developing countries with sophisticated social protection systems like
Cambodia, India, Thailand, South Africa and others lack the necessary systems and capacities to
fulfil case management needs. Yet, child protection discourse has affirmed – time and again – the
vital role of the social service workforce and case management in realizing the rights of children.70
The twelve years of CSSP offers invaluable lessons for strengthening and scaling social workforce
in Bangladesh, insights that can improve programming for education, child marriage and child
protection and a structure/foundation on which such systems can scale nationally.
However, it is vital to note that any targeting approach brings inherent risks of targeting errors
that can for risk means that children who are marginally better off were possibly excluded from
case management and access to other vital services from which they could benefit. The only way
to completely eliminate such risk is adopt a more universal approach, allowing self-selection into
68 (Roelen, et al., 2017)
69 (Roelen, et al., 2017)
70 ( Vadapalli, 2009)
72
the case management process in addition to the identification mechanisms trialed through this
programme.
Investments in quality, equitable education has multiple benefits, including saving lives, improving
nutrition, reducing child, early and forced marriage, and overall leading to more equal, respectful
and open societies.71 Cash has undeniable effects on enabling households to overcome financial
barriers and is a key component enabling children to stay in school.72 However, the implementation
of a new and conditional cash transfer programme adds to the cost of implementation and had
limited, if any, value addition to the uptake of education where a comprehensive case management
system is in place and a range of education stipends already exist. When this programme was first
implemented, there were no large-scale child benefit in Bangladesh. The landscape has evolved
significantly over the last decade. Some prominent programmes include Maternity Allowance
Program for the Poor Lactating Mothers and comprehensive set of education stipends – Student
stipend for Primary education level, Stipends for secondary, higher secondary and madrasah
education level students, Stipends for undergraduate and postgraduate level students, Stipends for
students of technical education institutions, Stipends for Physically Challenged Students and
Stipends for Improving the Livelihood of Transgender, Bede and Disadvantaged Community
which collectively cover over 200 lac individuals in 2021-22.73 The roll out of another conditional
CCT is counterintuitive in the presence of such comprehensive set of stipends. Using case
management to link the stipend to child protection services and increase the uptake of the stipends
would improve the coverage of national stipend programmes and continue to deliver the benefits
of the CSSP at a lower cost. Focusing efforts on building the referrals and linkages with a long-
term and periodic cash transfer while strengthening case management offer significantly higher
returns on this investment.
While the programme interventions were well received, the process for implementing the
programme offers multiple opportunities for optimization and efficiency gains. The programme is
entirely paper based, with case forms and records all managed in paper format. Due to the volume
of information and duration that these are stored for, there is a high risk of loss of data and
information – as experienced during the transition of the programme from MoWCA to MoSW
and while capturing the risk forms for beneficiary profiling in this evaluation. Paper-based data
also led to suboptimal monitoring and tracking and time-consuming filing and data management
processes. Digitisation of case management can significantly reduce the administrative burden on
social workers, freeing time for more and better case management, it will also improve data
management, ability to use data to inform better programming and services.
The CSSP aimed to keep children in school and out of marriage and labour until the age of 18
years. Given the legal age of employment in Bangladesh is 14, and 12- and 13-year-old children
are permitted to do what's deemed "light work" for up to 42 hours per week; the programme’s
ability to prevent labour among these ages is limited. The social workers demonstrate following
these protocols and ensuring that children under 18 are not engaged in risky labour, recognizing
that for many households, eliminating labour is not an option. To tackle child labour, more long-

73
term and steady approach to improve household income is required. The potential impact on
uptake of education while children remain in case management is more achievable and the case
managers play an integral role in enabling this through a multi-sectoral approach. Social workers
combine cash, access to services, engagement with stakeholders from health, education, and other
sectors as well as counselling, and family level awareness raising to comprehensively address the
structural risks of school dropouts.
6. Lessons Learned
Overall, the CSSP programme was implemented as intended but after 12 years of implementation,
the programme continues to operate as a pilot, without integration into the main social or child
protection system, or ownership from the government. The learning UNICEF needs to embrace
is that the costs of running a pilot – especially in the absence of planned and timely evaluations -
are significantly higher than projects which benefit from the economies of scale, adopt a learning-
by-doing approach through clear monitoring and feedback loops.
In response to the reflections from UNICEF staff on past years of programming, UNICEF
Bangladesh has already revised its approach to evidence-building pilots. In 2021, UNICEF has
been working towards an internal Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) to establish internal
processes for designing and approving pilots. The organization has moved forward with a clear
understanding that only fixed-time pilots, pilots with intention and clear roadmap to scale or
evidence-generation plan should be implemented to avoid an extended UNICEF-funded pilot that
is neither owned nor fully managed by government, which prevents its integration with national
social protection systems.
UNICEF must recognize that after 12 years, the CSSP was unable to establish institutionally strong
ties with the government. With the programme moving from MoWCA and MoSW and with
significant UNICEF involvement until programme closure, there are several lessons for future
programming. Based on our consultations with ministries, the government has a strong and keen
interest in child-sensitive programming. Where a pilot is designed, governments must be closely
consulted, existing government channels must be leveraged and a clear roadmap with roles and
responsibilities for UNICEF and government should be developed. With government leading the
implementation, oversight and taking broader ownership, the likelihood of programme being
nationally owned and scaled is substantially higher.
UNICEF must embrace that the monitoring aspects of case management processes fell short in
this programme, costing UNICEF decades of learning and opportunities for vital evidence
generation. At a minimum, social workers should keep updated records on the aspects of the risk
form that were considered high risk at time of initial assessment. Such data can enable programmes
to track children’s status, and fully leverage the potential of case management approaches in
protecting and empowering children and their families. In the context of Bangladesh, where staff
turnover is high within government, it is vital to protect the children during transitions from social
workers and untie the programme’s success from individuals to the role of implementation.
The removal of girls who may be married while enrolled into the programme is rather concerning.
While protection and empowerment of married children was not an explicit objective of the
programme, considering such events, it is vital to establish linkages to other UN partners and
74
agencies working with married children to hand-over cases or better coordinate for their protection
and empowerment. For example, the Global Programme to End Child Marriage that UNICEF
and UNFPA jointly implement, could be a good connection for linkage. It is under this joint
programme that UNFPA works with child brides in re-entering school, ensuring health in the
relationship, and more broader empowerment work/skills development.
Finally, the evaluation has demonstrated the opportunities that strengthening the social service
workforce in terms of capacity (numbers and skills) offer to UNICEF’s mandate for protection
and empowerment of children. Social service workforce is valuable, as this programme shows that
once a child is under case management, there are immense benefits to the vulnerable child and
their household.
7. Recommendations
The recommendations discussed in the report were derived from the findings of the study, which
were refined and validated based on feedback from key stakeholders. Since the evaluation was
conducted post the end of the CCT intervention, recommendations also rely on suggestions and
feedback from beneficiaries about the successes and challenges of the programme. Findings
derived from KIIs and FGDS with all levels of CCT stakeholder, i.e., UNICEF officials, field level
social workers, CBCPC members, and national level government officials, were key sources of
deriving recommendations for the CCT project. The recommendations were discussed and
developed jointly with UNICEF.
In the final phase of the project, feedback for the study findings was received from stakeholders
at UNICEF through two rounds of workshops for presentations of results, as well as a round of
in-depth feedback on the report. Insights and direct feedback were also gathered from government
stakeholders at the national level in a validation workshop organized by UNICEF on 18th of May
2022. The workshop was attended by officials from MOWCA and DSS, who could validate the
recommendation and suggest changes based on feasibility and strategic direction.
The following recommendations are presented in an order of priority that reflects both the
priorities indicated by stakeholders and the evaluator’s assessment of the importance and urgency
of actions considering the conclusions presented in the previous section.
a. For future pilots:
Recommendation 1: Make pilots designed to build national capacity, use national
structures and eventually integrate in national systems [UNICEF]
One of the key constraints of the CCT identified in the study is regarding the lack of government
engagement and interest in the project for scaling up or opportunity for capacity building, which
not only affects sustainability but has important implications for the cost-efficiency of investments
in pilots. It is important to ensure that future pilots are designed to build national capacity, use
national structures, and are eventually integrated into national systems.
As the primary custodians of women’s and children’s rights in Bangladesh, MoWCA and MoSW
must seek to establish long-term vision for strengthening social protection systems for women and
children. Future pilots, programming and support should fall within government priorities for
scaling child protection and social protection for children by either informing national policy or
75
building national capacity. Ensuring government involvement and leadership in donor-financed
pilots, assuming co-responsibility can amplify the effectiveness of future programmes.
The government, MoSW in particular, recognizes and intend to respond to the needs of children
in Bangladesh. With child marriage and labour at the top of their agenda, and rising awareness on
the need for inclusive and child sensitive social protection, there is clear window of opportunity
for UNICEF to collaboratively design and develop more rights-based programmes that are
delivered through the mainstream social protection systems. Having government-led design, with
very strong component of advisory and advocacy work tied into the programming will improve
government ownership of projects and activities and strengthen long-term partnerships with the
government.
Recommendation 2: Develop planned implementation and evaluation timelines with clear
feedback loops for programme closure or expansion in the design phase [UNICEF]
The CSSP programme ran like a pilot for 12 years without defined pathways of intervention for
meeting outcomes of impact for the specific intervention and with no confirmed evidence that the
programme was delivering the intended outcomes. In the process, years of opportunities to
generate lessons for such programmes in Bangladesh as well as its contribution to the small
evidence based on such programmes globally has been lost.
The CSSP did not adequately focus on evidence-generation, leading to a series of unplanned
expansions of the CSSP. In the absence of evidence, the pilot did not benefit from any process or
design efficiency gains that an early and mid-term evaluation or concurrent monitoring could have
provided. In future programming, design and operationalisation must be informed by national and
international best practices and evidence of successes and limitations of various programming
approaches.
The design phase of future pilots is recommended to develop a clear TOC which can be feasibly
implemented in the specific duration of the pilot. At the onset of future programme design,
ensuring that programmes are backed with adequate and relevant evidence, theories of change are
accompanied by evaluation plans and frameworks and clear feedback loops are established will
better ensure the programme’s robustness and relevance in the national context, enable timely
process improvements and improve programme efficiency.
Recommendation 3: Incorporate rigorous and systematic monitoring processes (data
collection, collation, analysis and feedback loops), develop a robust monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) framework and assign monitoring and oversight responsibilities as part
of the design package to prevent oversight during implementation [UNICEF]
For any programmes in the future, it is recommended to incorporate rigorous systematic
monitoring processes, M&E frameworks and ensure that there is monitoring and oversight of
programme activities and the implementing actors. The recommendation seeks to address the lack
of available beneficiary monitoring data for implementation of the conditions, as well as to
strengthen monitoring of the implementation process by funding and implementing agencies.
Periodic monitoring reports and records could have greatly strengthened this evaluation’s inputs
to further strengthen programme practices, but more importantly, been able to influence and
76
improve implementation processes – which have remained static for 12 years – while the
programme was being implemented.
For future pilots, establishment of robust monitoring frameworks and incorporating quality
assurance mechanisms such as spot checks for implementing partners and personnel should be
included in the design of the pilot.
b. For programmes that may adopt and use risk assessment and case
management systems
Recommendation 4: Invest in piloting, testing and refining the risk management protocols
to ensure all changes are based on evidence, and tools are sensitive to needs of the most
vulnerable boys and girls in a gender-sensitive manner [UNICEF]
One of the major findings of the study was that the programme was gender neutral, i.e., the
programming did not consider the needs of boys and girls separately and had the same approach
and intervention for both groups. This is recognized as a critical limitation of the project, and such
an approach can be gender negative as it is harmful for the children involved in the project.
Considering this, it is recommended for future risk assessment and case management systems to
incorporate gender sensitive programming, at all stages of the programme cycle. Gender sensitive
programming is widely implemented with several good practice examples from Bangladesh and
comparable regional cases. It is essential to revise the risk assessment and case management
approach informed by gender sensitive global evidence.
Recommendation 5: Consider digital case management systems – including risk forms for
better recordkeeping, effective monitoring and utilization of the data [DSS]
Realizing the success of the case management approach for providing timely and curated support
to different groups of children in the study, it is recommended for UNICEF to continue
supporting the government for building on the case management infrastructure.
UNICEF may support a realistic assessment of the country situation in terms of information
technology (IT) literacy of the workforce and available infrastructure and resources. Developing
the system in consultation with policymakers, users, and system developers and ensuring that the
system is government owned, has a robust governance structure and clear rules and guidelines for
all stakeholders will be imperative for the sustainability of case management systems. Finally, the
system must be designed for adaptation and with a longer-term vision considering emerging needs,
functions and use of the system going forward. Training of users (in the context of high turnover)
must be considered as part of the scale up process.
c. For the national system on child and social protection
Recommendation 6: Draw lessons from the case management tools developed for the CCT
for generating lessons, communication and advocacy to develop, implement and scale
national child protection systems [DSS]
Building on the results of a successful case management carried out by the social workforce, it is
recommended to utilize the evidence and opportunity to advocate for a national social protection
system in Bangladesh.
77
With UNICEF’s mandate to improve the lives of children, social and child protection are deeply
integrated. As social protection strives to ensure that every child has access to necessary social
protection services, the access and utilization are greatly improved through case management
systems and social workers who have traditionally been involved in more conservation child
protection services. Bridging this gap between social and child protection systems has become
increasingly important with the rising intensity and frequency of national disasters and protracted
crises, both of which, are high risks in Bangladesh.
The CSSP had the potential to bridge this gap and contribute to the national system and global
discourse on the transformative effects of social and child protection systems combined. However,
weaker coordination and collaboration between the two sectors contributed to weaker design and
a lack of joint programme management. In the future, better integration of programming, stronger
coordination and collaboration between the two sectors can fill a critical gap in evidence and
further strengthen UNICEF’s position on protecting the rights of children through these vital
investments.
Recommendation 7: Invest in establishing a social service workforce drawing on the
learnings from the CCT programme [DSS]
As reported in the findings, an increase in the social workforce is mandatory to improve and
maintain the quality of case management and sustain the positive effects of the programme and
similar programmes over time. It is evident that the existing social workforce is overworked and
overextended in their duties, due to an extreme shortage of social workers in the country. The
social workers interviewed in the study commonly reported a huge case load which was not feasible
for the number of limited social workers in their offices.
There is strong evidence of good practice implemented by social workers in identifying vulnerable
children in their communities and providing any feasible support to them utilizing all resources at
their disposal. It is strongly recommended to advocate for scale up of social workforce in
Bangladesh for strengthening and improvement of the national child protection services.
Recommendation 8: Explore the potentials for integrated cash plus care programmes,
especially for children with disabilities to improve their access to services and
opportunities and to achieve long-term impacts on complex outcomes like child marriage
and labour [DSS]
The programme demonstrated that children who received CCT and other interventions such as
education counselling etc. had more improvement in terms of their attitudes towards child
marriage and education and showed higher agency compared to those who only received CCT and
those who received neither. Provision of services also enabled children with disabilities to access
relevant services and played a crucial role in keeping children in school. Moreover, global evidence
also supports the use of case management across programmes and services to leverage better cost
efficiencies, which is vital for its sustainability.
In this context, it is recommended that UNICEF focus efforts on building the referrals and
linkages with a long-term and periodic cash transfer while strengthening case management, as this
approach offers significantly higher returns on this investment. Role of such approaches to tackle
complex outcomes such as reducing child marriage and labour, where attitudes, knowledge and
78
agency have a strong role in determining behaviour is vital. Comprehensive cash plus programme
models that influence attitudes, knowledge and agency at the individual, family and community
levels should be considered.
Recommendation 9: Carefully research the role of conditions and evidence surrounding
the efficacy of conditional transfers to achieve the intended outcomes before
implementation of the same in the context of Bangladesh. Especially where resources for
monitoring and tracking are limited, carefully consider the cost implications of conditions
before engaging in another CCT [DSS/UNICEF]
The role of conditions in generating outcomes such as uptake of education, reduction in child
marriage and labour has not been confirmed in evidence. Most global evidence has been
inconclusive in this regard. In this case, the monitoring of compliance was a significant part of the
case workers’ loads, taking away time that could have been used for case management activities.
At the local level, capacity for monitoring was limited due to staff shortages and high workloads.
With very little evidence exploring the role of conditions in child protection, it is recommended to
actively seek opportunities for evidence generation exploring the role of conditions before
implementing conditional transfers and carefully consider the implications of attempting to
enforce conditions where resources to monitor and service delivery are limited and when
sustainable changes in behaviour require systemic improvements in social norms.
Recommendation 10: Establish vital partnerships and lengthen the planning horizon for
systematic strengthening of social and child protection systems and delivery of basic social
services [UNICEF]
The lead ministries protecting the rights of women and children, there is opportunity to establish
long-term partnerships with stakeholders such as UNICEF to identify areas for assistance that are
coherent, coordinated and better aligned with national priorities and needs. Long-term
partnerships enable a longer planning horizon and thus, more systematic approach to establishing,
scaling up or enhancing the necessary infrastructure and capacities that enable governments to
deliver social and child protection effectively and efficiently. Lengthening the planning horizon
and clearly identifying the roles of various partners provide better clarity to partners and to
government enabling integrated programming and allowing both parties to better deliver the
desired outcomes.

Annex 2. Object of the evaluation: The Conditional Cash Transfer programme
(CCT) of the Child Sensitive Social Protection project in Bangladesh
From 2012 to 2017 the Ministry of Social Welfare (MoSW) and Ministry of Women and Children
Affairs (MoWCA) jointly delivered the programme – known as the CCT – in UNDAF districts as
a tool for socio-economic empowerment of families and combating child marriage, child labour
and school dropout for vulnerable children. In Phase 2 of the programme (from July 2017 to
August 2020), only MoSW implemented the programme.
The CCT provided BDT 2,000 a month, over a period of 18 months. The amount was dispersed
every six months, so that three instalments of BDT 12,000 each were paid, to the guardians of
eligible children if they keep children in school, out of employment and unmarried.
In Phase 1 (before July 2017), the programme covered an estimated 1,284 beneficiaries through
MoWCA and approximately 200 beneficiaries through DSS. There has been no information on
the total number of children assessed and, in most cases, no information on those that were
assessed but not provided the CCT. In Phase 2, from July 2017 to November 2019, the programme
reached a total of 1,688 beneficiaries (all through DSS), of whom 1,070 were girls (63.4%). Based
on consultations and data from MoWCA and DSS, the programme was implemented in and had
active beneficiaries from eleven wards or upazilas and city corporations in the following eight
districts: Dhaka North, Barisal, Khulna, Kurigram, Gaibandh, Sylhet, Sunamgonj, and Chapai
Nowabgonj. These eight districts fall within six zones - Dhaka, Barisal, Khulna, Rangpur, Sylhet
and Rajshahi. The breakdown on beneficiaries is presented in the table below.

Eligibility
The children eligible for the programme were those at risk of dropping out of school, of
employment, child marriage and under the age of 18 years as identified by the risk assessment
process. To be eligible for the CCT programme, children had to fulfil some of the following
criteria: (1) be without parental care, abandoned or without having any legal guardian, (2) be a
street child without shelter, (3) be engaged in hazardous work, begging or any activity conflicting
with the law (4) be engaged in child labour in tea garden, (5) live with a disability, (6) live in a child-
or woman-headed household in slums, (7) have parents in prison, (8) be affected by HIV, (9) be
from third gender, nomadic society or lower caste, (10) come from a family with a lower annual
income than BDT 36,000, or finally, (11) be at any other risk. Children aged 10-16 were prioritised,
though if younger children were seen as very vulnerable, they were also enrolled.
Selection into the programme
Risk Assessment Process
A review of programme guidelines and interviews with stakeholders indicate that children were
assessed for their vulnerability and situation using a risk assessment form by social or case workers
at the upazila level. All children obtaining a score of 24 or higher in Phase 2 (or 20 in Phase 1 of
the programme) were eligible for the second, more in-depth assessment, which determined receipt
of the programme and/or other services. Children who scored below the threshold were not
entitled to receiving any intervention. The nature of this selection approach suggested a dual
counterfactual since the programme might have been excluding at-risk children within two
categories:
100
1. Vulnerable children with scores above the 24-score threshold referred to other services or
programmes
2. Vulnerable children with scores below but near the 24-score threshold that are excluded
from the CCT and other programmes
There has been little to no information on children who scored under 24 but there is some
information on those who scored above 24 but did not receive the CCT.

(Children who were assessed to
be at risk but not provided the
CCT)
Vulnerable Beneficiaries At least 1,284 (from At least 1,616
DSS)
+ 200 (from MoWCA)
If a child scored 24 or above (Phase 2) in the initial risk assessment, the social workers were
required to undertake a detailed assessment using the detailed assessment form. Depending on the
analysis of the social or case worker, they were required to take appropriate steps to ensure the
care, protection, and development of the child as per the provisions of the law.
If the total score was under 24, the social/case worker was expected to closely monitor the child's
actual condition and make notes on the situation. The table below summarises the risk areas
evaluated by the case workers.

Selection Process
Initial selection
Step 1: The Community Based Child Protection Committee (CBCPC) at the ward or union level
periodically received CCT targets from the zonal/IP office (provided by the Department of Social
Service (DSS) and UNICEF) and were requested to prepare a list of potential beneficiaries that
they later referred to the Social Workers (operating at the upazila level), who, in turn, initiated case
management for the child.
Step 2: Children were assessed by their vulnerability and situation using case management tools
by the social workers. Children with risk levels above 24 were selected for further detailed
assessment and children with risk level below 24 were considered ineligible for the CCT. As part
of the case management tool, social workers made recommendations for the intervention plan (a
type of assistance to give the child or referral to other services) and were to continue monitoring
their situation.
Step 3: The CBCPC met and filtered the primary list (see selection process above) put together by
the social worker based on a set of criteria that helped identify most vulnerable children. This list
was then sent to the quarterly Upazila level Child Welfare Board (CWB) meeting.
Step 4: The Upazila-level child welfare board received the list and further scrutinised it. The
Upazila Social Service Officer (USSO, in rural areas) or Urban Community Development Officer
(UCDO, in urban areas) randomly verified a selected number of the children proposed.
Step 5: After the CWB approved the list of eligible beneficiaries, it was sent to DSS who in turn
made a request for funds to UNICEF. In case of funding shortage or limited spots, the eligible
children were placed on a waiting list to get priority for the next intake.
102
Process for selection children from the primary list
The CBCPC reviewed the summary of cases collected by the social workers and were requested
to select the most vulnerable children from that list based on a set of criteria/guidelines set by
DSS. These included rejecting the application if:
• The child was receiving cash from another government programme or NGO programme
• The family of the child was solvent or has more than one earning member
• The child was living in the area (or slum in urban cases) for less than 2 years
The case was given priority if:
ii. The child was currently in school or out-of-school but wanting to continue their studies
iii. The child was between 10 – 16 years old (but exceptions were made for younger and older
children)
iv. Households where more than one child was attending school
v. The child had a disability
vi. The child was at risk of early marriage
vii. The child was engaged in a risky job/vocation and was seeking vocational training
viii. The child was in the area (or slum) for more than 2 years
Conditions, Compliance and Payment
Social workers regularly monitored compliance and explained the programme to each caregiver at
the beginning of the cash transfer. In order to receive cash support, families were required to
comply with three conditions before an instalment was paid out: i) children were not to be married,
ii) children were not to be involved in child labour and iii) children were to continue education.
While the conditions required keeping children unmarried and out of labour until the age of 18, it
is unclear if social workers/case workers continued to monitor children after they exited the
programme, after 18 months.
Consultations also revealed that most children who were enrolled in the programme continued to
receive all the benefits for the full 18 months. While it can be gathered from consultations that
103
follow up visits were conducted every two months to check for compliance of conditions, no
records of the monitoring have been kept for programme monitoring.
Graduation
A child graduated from the programme if they met one or more of the following:
• Lived in families whose monthly income increased to more than 5,000 BDT, while enrolled
in the programme
• Turned 18 years of age
• Originally lived in families who were landless and living close to embankments but the
went on to own land and live outside the embankment with increased income
• Case workers observed reduced vulnerability and documented these through case
management
• Community members made a collective decision regarding the improved situation of
families (beyond the eligibility threshold)
Initial field research showed that a small fraction of families/children graduated from the
programme before receiving all three instalments. It is important to note that the plight of children
in these communities were grave and many children were unable to benefit from the programme
due to funding constraints.

1. Female Secondary School Stipend – Bangladesh
With the specific goal of reducing fertility rates, the Bangladesh Association for Community
Education formed the Female Secondary Stipend Programme (FSP) in 1982 and scaled in the mid-
1990s. By making sure that girls stayed in school, and due to that delayed marriage and increase
contraceptive use, fertility rates were suggested to reduce. The reform efforts of the government
in the education sector are built upon four different sectoral projects of the Ministry of Education,
all sharing the overall broad objective of developing the education sector. In more detail, the
specific objectives of the sectoral projects are to (1) increase girls’ enrolment in secondary school
and retain them there, (2) assist them in passing their secondary school examination (SSC)
examination to enhance their employment opportunities as primary school teachers, extension
workers, health and family planning workers and NGO workers, and lastly (3), delay girls’
marriage.75
Initially, the programme meant to target only the very poorest of society, but due to corruption
and the cost of targeting, the programme became available to all rural girls who met the criteria.76
The eligibility criteria are the following: (1) Attend at least 75 per cent of school days; (2) attain
some level of measured academic proficiency (45 per cent of class-level test scores); and (3) remain
unmarried. The programme was first implemented in selected subdistricts, but due to the high
demand in 1994, the Government immediately decided to expand the project to a national level
for girls in secondary school (grades 6-10).77 At present, stipends are also provided to girls in higher
secondary grades 11-12.78 Once a school participates in the programme, all eligible girls receive a
specified amount of stipend and other allowances as prescribed for each grade. The stipend pays
the whole tuition, and the additional allowance is expected to cover 50 per cent of a girl’s school
supplies and is transferred directly to an account in her name.79
Khandker, Pitt and Fuwa (2003) found that the school stipend had positive impacts on reducing
incidences of early marriage and childbearing and has been effective in closing the gender
schooling gap. Their report, based upon two cross-sectional household surveys, finds that, while
causality was difficult to ascertain; girls receiving the benefit were more likely to enrol in secondary
schooling substantially, but had no discernible effect on the schooling of boys. Analysing the
programme with an annual panel of school-level data, resulted in a positive effect on girls’
schooling, but a reduced enrolment of boys in co-educational secondary schools80. Since one of
the conditions for receiving the cash transfer under the FSSP is to remain unmarried, the
programme follows a similar theory of change to CCT. It assumes that households receiving the
transfer would invest more to send girls to school, in turn, delaying their marriage and
consequently, the age for first birth. The expectations are that this will encourage more schooling
and better fit for employability, etc.81

While Raynor and Wesson (2006) finds similar results to the previous, they state that it is less clear
exactly what other impacts the programme has had in terms of stated programme objectives such
as fertility control and empowerment of women.
2. Zoma Cash Transfer Programme – Malawi
The Zomba Cash Transfer Pilot Programme was implemented between January 2008 and
December 2009. The programme included both a conditional cash transfer and an unconditional
cash transfer, both providing initially unmarried females aged 13-22 with financial support for two
academic years82. It was originally designed for research purposes but was used for testing the
differences in impact of conditional and unconditional transfers on education, marriage, and
fertility outcomes for female adolescents83.
In the unconditional group (baseline schoolgirls only), girls received the payment if the beneficiary
girl visited one of the cash transfers points. The conditional cash transfer was given on regular
school attendance to baseline schoolgirls and baseline dropouts (girls who had already dropped
out of school). Part of the monthly transfer was given directly to the girl and another part was
given to the household target of eligible young females. The monthly household amount varied
randomly with values of US $4, $6, $8 or $10 by use of computer-generated random numbers. Girl
amount varied randomly between individuals with monthly values of US $1, $2, $3, $4 or $5, by
drawing numbers from an envelope.84
Evaluation of the programme suggests that the conditional cash transfer programme led to an
increase in the beneficiaries’ control of cash resources during the programme. However, these
impacts declined or disappeared shortly after the end of the programme. The intervention resulted
in increased skills in math, English and cognitive test scores, as well as increasing participation in
health training such as nutrition, personal hygiene, food hygiene, sexual education and
HIV/AIDS85. Evaluating the CCT programme indicates that it had a strong impact on the agency,
as it caused beneficiaries to postpone marriage and pregnancy, as well as increase their school
participation and learning86. Baird et al. (2012) states that the programme indirectly decreased risky
sexual activity and reduced their likelihood of being affected by HIV and HIV-2 when financially
empower school-aged girls. The conditionality in the transfers resulted in being the key driver of
educational outcomes, as enrolment improved to a larger extent for beneficiaries receiving the
CCT than in the case of UCT. Furthermore, the CCT was more cost-effective than the UCT by
using smaller transfer sizes to achieve the same impacts of larger transfer sizes. In addition, when
failing to comply with the conditions, the CCT saved money by not transferring the money87.
Evidence shows that the conditional cash transfer significantly reduced pregnancy among treated
dropouts during the first year of the programme, but with no significant impact among schoolgirls.
It also suggests that the intervention delayed the desire of childbearing, rather than lowering the
ideal number of children. While there was no evidence of a significant impact of the CCT
intervention on marriage during or after the programme among schoolgirls, the programme led to

117
a significant decline in marriage rates among dropouts88. The CCT programme was able to
encourage human capital information among girls who complied with its requirement, but it kept
transfers from girls who were more vulnerable to adolescent pregnancy and early marriage. While
the CCT was able to keep girls in school and by that reduce early marriage and pregnancy, the
UCT had an overall larger income effect on girls’ marriage89.
3. Berhne Hewan asset transfers – Ethiopia
To encourage parents to keep girls in school and delay marriage, the Berhane Hewan programme
used a comprehensive set of activities including life skills training for unmarried girls, community
conversations, mentorship and community service activities, as well as school supplies. It targeted
married and unmarried girls aged 10-19, with the goal to establish appropriate and effective
mechanisms to protect girls at risk of forced early marriage and support adolescent girls who are
already married90.
Girls who participated in the programme had three options for involvement. Girls, who were still
in school were encouraged to continue their education and were given school supplies. Girls who
were not in school and wanted to return to formal schooling were encouraged to do so and were
given the same school supplies, worth about US$4 over the course of a year. Other out-of-school
girls, together with girls who never had attended school, met with mentors and were given
nonformal education including basic literacy and numeracy lessons. In addition, the girls learned
livelihoods skills such as agricultural techniques, poultry rearing and construction of household
items. Before getting enrolled in the programme, they had to get permission from their parents or
guardians and agree that their daughters would not be married during the two-year programme, as
well as allowing them to attend the programme meetings. As economic incentive, parents who
kept their daughters unmarried and their daughters attended at least 80% of the group sessions,
received a goat at the end of the programme, which at the end worth about US$20.91
Erulkar and Muthengi (2009) performed a quasi-experimental research project using population-
based surveys before and after implementation in intervention and control sites to identify the
impact of the initiative. After two years of intervention, the research found that girls aged 10 to 14
were one-tenth as likely to be married and three times more likely to stay in school, compared to
girls residing in the control area. There was no impact of the programme on marriage age among
girls aged 15 to 19. However, married girls were three times more likely to be using family planning,
compared to their counterparts in the control area92.
4. Punjabi Female School Stipend Programme – Pakistan
The programme was implemented with the aim to improve the educational attainment among girls
and decrease gender inequalities, especially for middle school girls. Female enrolment in both
primary and secondary school was low prior to the start of the programme and various community
and household characteristics have been identified to be associated with gaps in school entry for
girls. Due to this, the government in 2003 mobilized resources to finance the female school stipend
programme, targeting disadvantaged girls in districts with lagging literacy rates. The programme’s

118
main goal was to promote participation in public education for girls in middle school with a stipend
of approximately US $10 per female student. Beneficiaries were targeted based on district of
residence and enrolment in eligible grades (grades 6 to 8) in public schools and conditional on a
minimum school attendance rate of 80 per cent.93
The cash transfer has both an income and substitution effect, depending on families that would
have sent their daughters to school with or without the programme and families with daughters
out of school. However, both effects point towards increased demand for education, which entails
that the programme encourages girls to work less, delay their marriage and have fewer children. It
is important to note that socio-cultural traditions in Pakistan may figure prominently in marriage
and fertility decisions, which may pressurise girls into marriage and childbearing94.
5. ApniBeti Ana Dhan Conditional Cash Transfers – India
In 1994, the Government of India launched a conditional cash transfer programme with the aim
to improve parents’ perceived value of daughters and to keep girls unmarried until the age of 18.
In order to do so, mothers who give birth to a daughter receive a monetary award of approximately
US $11 within 15 days of each birth. Provided the daughter remains unmarried, a government
purchase saving bond in the name of the daughter is redeemable at the age of 18. If the girl has
received at least a Standard 5 education, a bonus is awarded, and an additional one is awarded if
she has studied up to Standard 8. To be eligible to register in the programme, beneficiaries need
to be the first, second or third girl to be born in the family. The family must be below the poverty
line or belong to a so-called “Scheduled Caste” (they have a disadvantaged caste background)95.
Sinha and Yoong (2009) found that the programme provided to eligible households had a positive
effect on girls’ birth and survival as measured by changes in the sex ratio of mother’s total living
children over time. As a result of the programme, parents increased their investment in daughters’
human capital and made greater post-natal health investments in girls after the programme. The
programme did not increase the probability of girls attending school, but it did increase the
likelihood to continue their education conditional on first attending any school.
In India’s state of Haryana, the ambitious cash transfer programme – Apni Beti Apna Dhan –
provided a future cash benefit equivalent to USD 400 upon the birth of a girl child to be provided
to the family on the condition that they remained unmarried until the age of 18. The programme
expected a three-fold impact: increased value of girls, improved educational attainment, and
delayed marriage. An evaluation of the programme found that while the programme did not have
any impact on reducing the share of child marriages or on delaying marriage (compared to non-
receiving households), the programme might have encouraged families to marry off their daughters
once they turned 18. “Girls whose families benefited from the conditional cash transfers were 59
percent more likely to be married once they turned 18 than girls who hadn’t participated.”96 One
of the main reasons for the failure of this programme is the lack of a multisectoral approach and
a heavy reliance on financial incentives to combat behaviours that are driven by social norms and
attitudes.

Efficiency:
1. How well was the delivery process managed, considering the time and resources at each stage of implementation and coordination between
UNICEF, DSS and sub-national administrations?
2. How cost-efficient is the CCT programme and what potential is there for efficiency savings at all stages (capacity and constraints)?
This question has been revised to seek “cost-efficiency” instead of “cost-effectiveness," as proposed in the TOR for the following reasons:
▪ Cost-effectiveness is hard to estimate – quantitative estimates of cost-effectiveness of CTs suffer from insufficient data on costs as well as
on values of direct and indirect benefits. Especially in a study as this one, where the scale is small and our confidence intervals are wider, it
will be difficult to estimate effectiveness
▪ The CCT has higher-value indirect benefits compared with limited quantifiable direct benefits. We can tackle this qualitatively based on
international evidence on cash transfers and long-term benefits of programme’s intended outcomes.
▪ For efficiency savings, we will rely on qualitative data on how the processes can be simplified, what is more resource draining and the
perception on its value-add based on implementers, and policymakers involved at each stage of programme implementation

Annex 7. Data Collection Tools
Annex 8. Field Data Collection Management Approach
a. Fieldwork during COVID-19
Objectives of COVID-19 fieldwork guidelines
• To design a checklist for protocols and procedures before initiating fieldwork
• To develop guidelines for planning for fieldwork and training of field investigators
• To develop fieldwork sites procedures
• To assist the field team with standard guidelines before, during and after data
collection
• To develop guidelines during travel from one field site to other
• To design general safe and hygienic practices during field data collection
• To develop accommodation protocols for field team in the working site
• To design emergency protocols, continuity planning, and wrap up procedures.
b. Guidelines and protocols during fieldwork
Key messages for data collection during COVID-19
• Always ensure the protection and safety of both staff members as well as members
of local communities, while trying to provide key information on the humanitarian
situation as well as respecting containment measures always.
• Ensure all mandatory measures (based on both national and global guidance) for
protection of staff members and local communities are being taken
• Ensure only critical and essential data collection exercises are carried out during
their period. All other nonessential exercises can be put on hold until the risk
subsides
• Ensure all data collection efforts undertaken during this period are done so in the
most reliable, transparent and methodologically robust manner possible given the
circumstances (for example, being aware of respondent biases that may result from
remote data collection techniques, factoring these biases into the analysis and
declaring all known biases and limitations within the information products), to be
able to provide an accurate and reliable evidence base for decision-making.
• Ensure there are stronger and more stringent data management systems and
processes as a prerequisite for switching to remote data collection, specifically in
terms of data protection and management of personally identifiable data as well as
data cleaning and processing to ensure the highest possible quality of data collected
during this period.
• Throughout, ensure adherence to the core values of IIHMR University that are
consistent with COVID-19 and including Institutional Review Board (IRB)
guidelines.
Checklist for protocols and procedures before initiating fieldwork
152
• Review physical distancing, equipment handling, disinfection procedures,
signs/symptoms of COVID-19
• Communication options in the field, check-in procedures, and emergency
procedures.
• Team members should have dedicated PPE, provisions, and supplies, if feasible,
to minimize sharing.
• Team members have the right to refuse participation without fear of penalty if they
feel conditions are unsafe.
• Each team member should be asymptomatic for at least two weeks before
fieldwork and will not participate should they feel ill or have reasonable cause to
believe they have been exposed to COVID-19.
• Maintain reliable communication to receive updates or get assistance
• Remain aware of local public health requirements and COVID-19 guidelines issued
by central and state government
• Review responsible conduct in the field, community, minimize contact with the
public.
• Backup plan or flexibility at any time to self-isolate or return home.
• Follow reporting protocol if you, a team member/ colleague, or an immediate
family member tests positive.
Planning for fieldwork and training of field investigators
• Try to ensure questionnaires are no longer than 15 minutes to avoid prolonged.
For longer surveys, it is imperative to keep a safe distance and use the necessary
protective gear
• Training of field investigators needs to be conducted in a manner that ensures the
recommended at least 1-meter distance between persons.
• Conduct it in a large enough room with good ventilation, spreading participants
out, or split the group up into smaller units and conduct several rounds of training
if needed
• As much as possible, use field investigators that are familiar with mobile data
collection to avoid having to be close to them while training on the tool (field
investigators with more experience will require less support from facilitators
meaning fewer close interactions are required)
• Alternatively, training can be conducted remotely over Skype or similar
communication platforms. If this is the case, make sure that all participants have
access to a computer or phone and that the training material is shared with the
participants before training. If training is conducted remotely, it is important that
the participants have prior experience in mobile data collection and ideally are
familiar with your organization/team.
Screening and Tracking
• All researchers must self-monitor for symptoms daily. If a researcher is feeling
unwell in any way, they are to stop work, inform their team and supervisor
immediately, and complete the Government of Bangladesh COVID-19 self-
assessment tool. The results of this tool will determine the next steps for that
person.
153
• Keep detailed records of where and when you have traveled, who you have traveled
with, and the locations of the fieldwork such that tracking can be provided to the
local public health unit should a researcher become ill with COVID-19.
Standard Guidelines for Fieldwork
• The participation of each team member in the fieldwork must be entirely voluntary.
• All researchers must conduct daily self-monitoring for symptoms and should be
encouraged to use the Government’s COVID-19 self-assessment tool.
• If individuals are feeling unwell in any way or are advised to initiate further medical
follow up on completion of the self-assessment tool, they should immediately
refrain from fieldwork, return home, and self-isolate as soon as possible. Other
team members should be able to continue fieldwork if they have always strictly
adhered to distancing and cleaning requirements and are not working alone.
• All research team members must also know how to access the nearest hospitals
and emergency medical services.
• The research team must be able to monitor, daily, any new directives from public
health officials, police, or administration for the area they are in.
• The team must have a contingency plan for any team member to return home in
the event they cannot continue their work for any reason.
Field working sites and procedures
• Do not share pens, notebooks, computers, etc. but provide each researcher with
their supplies where possible.
• Clean and disinfect all equipment used each day using soap and water, if possible,
or disinfectant wipes. Remove gloves and wash hands once the cleaning of
equipment is complete.
Measures to be taken BEFORE data collection
• Obtain required clearance from relevant authorities, especially if movement
restrictions in place.
• Make sure everyone in the team (field supervisor, investigators drivers, logisticians,
etc.) are up to date on the most recent information from the WHO and state and
central government and adhere to their guidelines
• Before data collection and training, collect information about specific referrals
system for suspected COVID-19 cases and ensure that all field investigators have
updated information (e.g. leaflets from the government or other relevant
organizations) to share with respondents if asked
• Make sure that the relevant IEC materials on COVID-19 (factsheets, brochures,
etc.) are available and shared with all staff.
• Develop and train staff on appropriate reporting and communication channels to
ensure safety and early response (if needed).
• Field coordinators or field supervisor or Research Officer must be informed in
case any field investigator develops COVID-19 symptoms or visits a household or
respondent who may have shown symptoms or respondent has/ develops any
COVID-19 symptoms as stipulated by WHO.
154
Measures to be taken DURING data collection
• Every morning remind the team for the general guidance and protocols
• Approach respondent(s) for interviews/ discussions in line with the required
measures
• Inform the respondent(s) of the COVID-19 measures (based on existing
guidelines) clearly, before starting the interview or discussion
• Maintain the recommended distance (at least 1 meter) when approaching
respondents
• Avoid physical contact (handshaking, hugging, etc.) to greet respondents. As this
may be perceived as culturally inappropriate, clearly explain why you are doing this
Conduct the interviews/ discussions following the required measures
• Conduct the interview/ discussion outside (if possible)
• Maintain at least 1-meter distance from other people throughout, specifically the
respondents.
• Don’t touch anything in or around the households/ interview sites that you are
visiting
• Avoid contact with the elderly or people with chronic diseases26 if possible
• Household (HH) surveys: maintain distance from other household members as
well. If you are asked to go inside and it is not possible to maintain the safe distance,
then take the respondent outside or terminate the interview.
• Key informant (KI) interviews: maintain distance from other people in addition to
the KI
• Focus group discussion (FGD): place participants with at least 1-meter distance
from one another and conduct the interview outside unless you have a large room
with good ventilation
• Ensure measures are being followed within the team throughout as well (i.e. not
just between field investigators and respondents during the interview or discussion
process
• Do not pass on things to other people, e.g. bottles, pens, phones, leaflets, visibility
material, etc. If you do so, wash your hands and wipe off the item carefully with
hand sanitizer
• Do not drink or eat from the same containers and do not use utilities from another
person.
• Wash hands with soap/ sanitizer following advisories by state and central
government
Measures to be taken AFTER data collection
• Ensure all staff returning from data collection (field investigators, drivers, etc.)
thoroughly wash their hands with soap (at least 20 seconds)
• Ensure field investigators are reporting back to field supervisors or Research
Officer as established in the protocols
155
• Field investigators should report to team leaders any health symptoms such as a
high temperature (above 37.5), or any other mild symptoms such as tiredness, dry
cough (common symptoms), shortness of breath, aches and pains, sore throat, or
runny nose (other symptoms). If any staff is experiencing symptoms, they should
self-quarantine for at least 14 days/ until recovered.
• Field Investigators should confirm location and report of any interaction with an
interviewee that exhibited symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath
• Field supervisor or Research Officer should prepare a daily report on any
interaction with the interviewee that exhibited symptoms of fever, cough or
shortness of breath should be reported to nearest Government Health facility (Sub
center / Primary Health center/ District Hospital)
• Ensure investigators submit the data collected and clean data collection devices
daily
• investigators to upload their forms to the server daily
• investigators to wipe off all devices with disinfectant or soap and water before
handing them back and place all phones in a zip-locked plastic bag with their name
written on it. This is to ensure that devices change hands as little as possible.
Guidelines during and outside of data collection activities
• Check your temperature every morning. In case of high temperature (above 37.5
Celsius), or any other mild symptoms such as tiredness, dry cough (common
symptoms), shortness of breath, aches and pains, sore throat, or runny nose (other
symptoms), inform the team leader. Any person with these symptoms should not
engage in data collection and selfquarantine for 14 days.
• Field coordinators or field supervisor or Research Officer should ask if field
investigators have been in contact with anyone with a confirmed or suspected case of
COVID-19. If yes, the person should not be participating in the activity and self-
quarantine for a minimum of 14 days.
• Wash hands thoroughly and regularly (ideally every 1 to 2 hours and definitely in
between each interview conducted) with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.
• Do not touch your (or anyone else’s) face – particularly eyes, nose, and mouth.
• Physical distance (2m) must be maintained between any individual, including other
team members. At the same time, field workers should not work alone.
• Keep distance also in cars, i.e. use enough cars so you are a maximum of 3 people per
car. If not enough cars, see if you can use less number of field investigators and extend
data collection time.
• Do not have any physical contact with other people. That includes no greetings such
as handshakes, hugs, etc
• Sanitize all data collection items before each interview (pens, phone, tablets,
notebooks, ID cards, anthropometric equipment's, etc.)
• Ensure items are not shared among team members
• Provide pens for each staff member
• Provide zip-locked bags to place field investigator phones/devices
• Ensure field team phones have internet so that they can upload the forms daily to the
server. Alternatively, ensure that field team can access Wi-Fi at the end of the day.
• Do not spit in public
156
• Do not engage in any field research where you cannot maintain appropriate physical
distancing (2m).
• Access to restricted areas as mandated by Central / State Governments and Indigenous
Communities must be adhered to. If access to restricted areas is essential, authorization
and documents must be obtained from the appropriate bodies. Always keep these
documents with you during the fieldwork.
• Do not engage in any field research requiring face to face discussions with members
of the public unless physical distancing can be maintained.
• Physical distancing should be followed while handling documentation, reports, and
paperwork
• Use technology for communication as much as possible (e.g., text messaging and
mobile phones) rather than having in-person conversations. Where possible, use
technology to send and receive paperwork (e.g. scanning equipment).
• Inform your field coordinators or field supervisor or Research Officer immediately if
feeling unwell
• Field coordinators or field supervisor or Research Officer should ensure you know the
protocol to follow and referral mechanisms to use to inform the right people about
any observations of symptoms or sickness among field staff during data collection
157
Annex 9. Ethics and IRB Approval
a. EPRI’s Ethical Approach
The following section provides an outline of the ethical principles which must be adhered to by
all EPRI-associated personnel in all stages of their work.
1. Respect
Work and activities must ensure respect for all persons involved throughout the research process.
Respect requires that individuals be treated as autonomous agents who are afforded the right to
make decisions for themselves and act based on these decisions. To respect autonomy is to show
adequate consideration towards the values, preferences, judgements, and beliefs of an autonomous
agent.
Those with diminished autonomy (e.g. minors, persons with disabilities, those affected by
marginalisation and other vulnerable groups) are entitled to additional protections. In these cases,
special care must be taken to acknowledge the prevailing power differentials of the situation and
the capabilities and degree of agency that an individual may have.
Application of this principle requires that human subjects are enrolled into research studies only
under the conditions of effective informed consent. This involves a process in which participation
in the research is acknowledged by the research subject (or by a legally authorized representative)
as a voluntary act free from coercion or undue influence from the investigator or members of the
research team. In the context of children and other vulnerable groups respectful evidence
generation needs to be situated in their lived experience with recognizing the reality of unequal
relationships of power that frequently exist, creating environments that support these individual’s
personal agency and dignity.
Mandatory processes – Respect, Consent and Representation
• All adult participants of the study will sign a consent form which will lay out in the simplest
terms, the objective of the study and their role in it. The form will explain that the
discussions will be recorded and assure participants that the report will not identify the
individual. The form will clarify that the individual does not seek to benefit by participating
in the study and will only receive a reasonable reimbursement of travel cost associated with
participation in the study. It will present in clear terms that the government is not obliged
to respond with increased benefits or other changes by virtue of individuals’ participation
in the study.
• All children participating in the study will be required to sign an assent form. They will
only be able to participate if they have signed an assent form and if their caregivers provide
consent to their participation in the study through a signed consent form.
• All researchers must ensure that participants read and fully understand the consent forms
– taking both verbal and written consent.
• The forms will be designed considering low literacy and inability to read/write such as
allowing thumbprints. Where applicable, the consent form will be read aloud, and the
responses of verbal consent will also be recorded.
158
• For those with disabilities that prevent them from understanding or providing consent, all
measures must be taken to ensure alternative methods of consent such as using sign
language, recording verbal consent. Given the nature of this study, when it is not possible
to document informed consent, it may not be necessary to include the individual. However,
if there is a pressing need, the matter must be raised to the team leader, who may be able
to receive appropriate consent to engage them ethically.
• For interviews or research involving the participation of minors (under the age of 18), both
an assent form from the child and a consent form from the parents/legal guardians must
be signed.
• All respondent data will be kept securely and safely, and access will be limited to core team
members. The data will be anonymised by the field team before sharing with the wider
team to minimise any risk to participants. However, relevant data must be stored for
auditing the authenticity of field data for six months after the study’s completion.
• The selection of respondents will seek to ensure representation from all relevant vulnerable
groups – paying special attention to gender quality, ethnic diversity and inclusion of those
with disabilities.
2. Non-Maleficence
Researchers and affiliated personnel must avoid doing harm or injuring persons participating in
the research process, both through acts of commission and omission. The research has been
designed and will be implemented to maximise possible benefits and minimise possible harm to
children, women and adolescents participating or affected by this study. The study has deemed the
involvement of minors essential to this study because the subject of evaluation has direct
implications for children and adolescents. A rapid risk evaluation considered both the probability
and magnitude of harm, including psychological, physical, legal, social, and economic harm. The
risk to participants remains low and reasonable for this study in relation to the anticipated and the
importance of the findings in shaping the future of child-sensitive programming in Zambia. Special
care will be taken through the informed consent processes to ensure that participants have realistic
expectations from the study and are fully aware that there are no direct benefits of participation.
The necessary protection mechanisms, approvals, checks and balances will be put in place to
minimise risk to participants and researchers, alike.
Non-maleficence requires an examination of the profile, competencies and skills of researchers
and enumerators to ensure no harm comes to participants by virtue of inappropriate, unskilled or
incompetent researchers or enumerators. It also requires explicit consideration of means to ensure
the privacy of participants, their safety and any possible negative impacts arising from participation.
The study must adhere to the requirements of informed consent/assent and privacy and
confidentiality, with appropriate procedures in place to deter non-compliance and consequences
for non-compliance.
Mandatory processes – Non-maleficence
• All researchers involved in the fieldwork will receive training on ethical research, as well as
on research involving children and other vulnerable groups. They will also receive training
on engaging with children and families, with those who might be marginalised or otherwise
159
disadvantaged. Given the sensitivity of the information being captured, these trainings
combined with a minimum 2-year field research experience for fieldworkers is deemed
adequate to ensure competency and minimise harm.
• Focus group discussions inherently violate anonymity among participants. Due to this, the
groups will be made with sensitivity to issues of bias, discrimination or marginalisation.
For instance, communities in conflict or otherwise marginalised (including by gender, race
or ethnicity) will be placed in different groups. Participants will be grouped in ways that
do not perpetrate or otherwise exacerbate any conflict. For instance, those receiving a
benefit and those not receiving it will be placed in different groups. Finally, power
dynamics will be considered when forming groups to ensure that all participants are able
to express their views freely and honestly.
• All discussions will be sensitive to privacy and confidentiality of all participants. Each
participant will be made aware of and be required to agree to and ensure the confidentiality
of any information shared during the discussion. Discussions of extremely sensitive nature
may take place in the form of in-depth interviews for human interest stories.
• All researchers involved in the fieldwork or who encounter data in its raw form will be
required to sign privacy and confidentiality agreements before going to the field.
• No individual identifiers such as name, contact details or other information that are not
required will be collected during fieldwork. Any such information will be destroyed as soon
as the report is published – keeping the captured data anonymised.
• All researchers must ensure that participants read and fully understand the consent forms
– taking both verbal and written consent. For those with disabilities that prevent them
from understanding or providing consent, all measures must be taken to ensure alternative
methods of consent such as using sign language, recording verbal consent. Given the
nature of this study, when it is not possible to document informed consent, it may not be
necessary to include the individual. However, if there is a pressing need, the matter must
be raised to the team leader, who may be able to receive appropriate consent to engage
them ethically.
• For interviews or research involving the participation of minors (under the age of 18), both
an assent form from the child and a consent form from the parents/legal guardians must
be signed.
• All research activities will take place in safe places – community spaces that offer privacy
and limited to key personnel involved in the research – that minimise concerns of
anonymity, privacy and confidentiality.
3. Justice and equitable representation
EPRI will ensure that benefits and the potential burdens of the research are carefully considered
and equitably distributed among the potential research subjects. Such considerations are required
to avoid the injustice that arises from social, racial, sexual and cultural biases institutionalised in
society.
160
The groups being interviewed/participating in this study are strictly guided by the detailed Terms
of Reference that require the involvement of vulnerable population groups, such as children and
women. Therefore, the selection of participants responds directly to the requirements of this study.
To ensure that the selection is justifiable and equitable, the study team has ensured that local
expertise informs selection process, a wide range of local stakeholders are being considered to
ensure that no group is left out due to power dynamics and secondary data analysis is informing
the key groups to involve from each region.
Mandatory processes – Equitable Representation
The researchers will engage with a wide range of local stakeholders to ensure all groups of interest
are covered in the study and to identify any particularly vulnerable or marginalised groups that
should be prioritised
• To understand power dynamics and concerns of bias or prejudice that must be considered
in grouping children and adolescents for the activities
• Understand critical relationships such as those with parents and service providers as well
as dimensions of violence and abuse to ensure the protection of respondents
• Development of pre-identification checklists/groups to include per region based on
secondary data analysis
• Ensure that groups for activities and discussions are sensitive to cultural and social norms
and issues, as well as to concerns of bias, power distribution and discrimination in ways
that enable the voices of the most vulnerable to come through in the study.
• Children, women, and persons from marginalised communities are specifically included in
the study to ensure that their voice is heard when decisions regarding their wellbeing can
be informed. Any risk identified will be adequately addressed on the field, while always
adhering to local laws and legal requirements.
• The selection of respondents is mindful of including those with disabilities, of children and
other women, and of marginalised groups.
4. Honesty, Integrity and Trust
Researchers and affiliated personnel must always conduct themselves with honesty and integrity.
This includes the accurate presentation of procedures, data and findings, and ensuring that
research contains no illegitimate biases designed to distort findings to meet deliverables.
Communications with clients relating to costs, tasks, deliverables, methodology, the scope of
expected and actual results and the intended uses of data must be transparent and accurately reflect
the capabilities and principles of EPRI. Information provided to research participants concerning
the nature of the research, the participants’ role in the research and the extent of their involvement
must also be accurately communicated with integrity and respect for their autonomy and safety.
Mandatory processes – Honesty, Integrity and Trust
• All research activities will be recorded and appropriately documented (with relevant
consent). For instance, Focus Group Discussions will be recorded, notes will be taken and
compared for accuracy. All materials may be provided to the client for verification upon
161
request. Other participatory activities, including those facilitated by youth researchers will
be video recorded
• Interviews with key informants will be recorded and transcribed and can be made available
to the client for verification upon request
• Where qualitative data is concerned, a clear framework has been created against which the
data will be analysed. Where summary notes from the field are used, coding will be done
analytically and when transcripts are used, more structured methods such as counting
repetition of keywords may also be used. All methods for deduction and analysis will be
clearly explained in the report.
• Consent forms will provide accurate information to research participants concerning the
nature of the research, the participants’ role in the research and the extent of their
involvement with integrity and respect for their autonomy and safety.
5. Accountability
Researchers and affiliated personnel are accountable for their actions and conduct. All
responsibilities and duties should be clearly defined, and it is the prerogative of each researcher to
ensure that they understand their responsibilities. All team members will sign appropriate
agreements and accountability statements to take ownership for ensuring that the research is
conducted responsibly and in line with the procedures outlined above. The roles and
responsibilities of key team members will be clearly laid out in their agreement.
Mandatory processes – Accountability
• Data and findings must be used only for the purposes stipulated in the project brief. Any
unauthorised use of information obtained during the research study may be deemed an
unethical, misuse of research. EPRI has a zero-tolerance policy for such behaviour
• All research activities will be recorded and appropriately documented.
• Where qualitative data is concerned, a clear framework for analysis is created, against which
the data will be analysed using a combination of structured and exploratory approach to
data analysis.
• Where summary notes from the field are used, coding will be done analytically and when
transcripts are used, more structured methods such as counting repetition of keywords
may also be used. All methods for deduction and analysis will be clearly explained in the
report.
• Coding and analysis software such as NVivo were used to ensure that the deduction can
be trailed, and coding framework reviewed for honesty and integrity
