Executive Summary
Background
This report represents the findings of an external evaluation of the Eritrea-UNICEF Country
Programme of Cooperation, 2017–2021. The situation of children and adolescents in Eritrea
informed the rationale for the Eritrea-UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, and for the
accompanying Country Programme Document (CPD). There were three persistent issues
associated with poor child well-being in Eritrea that UNICEF intended to address with the
Government during the Country Programme (CP) time period, including: (1) under-five child
stunting and ill health; (2) a lack of access to early childhood education and limits to educational
attainment; and (3) harmful gender and social norms.
The overall goal of the Country Programme during the period from 2017 to 2021 was to
progressively realize children’s rights in Eritrea, especially among the most disadvantaged. To
achieve this goal, UNICEF supported efforts of the Government in three components (as outlined
in the CPD): (1) Child Survival and Development; (2) Basic Education, Child Protection and
Participation; and (3) Program Effectiveness. The objective of the Child Survival and
Development (CSD) programming component was to address child stunting and health
deprivations and to reduce preventable child and maternal deaths, ill health and disability in
remote areas of the country. The objective of the Basic Education, Child Protection and
Participation (BECPP) programming component was to increase access to quality basic
education for all children, protecting them from violence, exploitation and abuse, and enabling
them to meaningfully participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives. The objective
of the Programme Effectiveness (PE) component was to lead, coordinate and manage the
Country Programme in a manner that delivers results for children.
Evaluation Purpose and Objectives
The purpose of this Country Programme Evaluation (CPE) was to provide valuable insights on
what has been achieved in Eritrea through UNICEF’s contributions, and to highlight the lessons
learned to strengthen the implementation of the next Country Programme. This evaluation was
commissioned by the UNICEF Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESARO), in
collaboration with the UNICEF Eritrea Country Office (ECO). This CPE aimed to strengthen
UNICEF’s accountability to national stakeholders, including the Government of the State of Eritrea
(GoSE), children and adolescents, as well as the UNICEF Executive Board.
There were three objectives of this CPE:
1. To assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and sustainability of the
Eritrea Country Programme with particular focus on equity, gender equality and
convergence of programme components, as well as UNICEF’s strategic positioning in
relation to its child rights mandate.
2. To identify and document key lessons learned, good practices and innovations in
implementing the Country Programme that can inform and support advocacy efforts for
scale-up and replication.
7
3. To provide a set of forward-looking and actionable recommendations to strengthen
programmatic strategies in the implementation of the next Eritrea Country Programme,
taking into consideration national development priorities, such as the Eritrea Development
Vision 2025, the next five-year development plan and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development in the country.
Evaluation Scope and Limitations
The CPE covered the Eritrea Country Programme from 2017 to 2021, and examined evaluative
evidence on UNICEF’s effectiveness in leveraging national efforts for children, as well as its direct
contributions in achieving results for children. The evaluation focused on the formal UNICEF CPD
approved by the Executive Board, but also considered any changes/revisions from the initial CPD
during the period under review (such as changes in strategies to address COVID-19). The scope
and unit of analysis of the CPE includes the entirety of UNICEF’s engagement in the country, and
therefore covers interventions funded by all sources. However, the evaluation did not include an
analysis of specific UNICEF programmes, as the intent was to examine strategic goals and
processes that affect all programmes at the national, zoba (regional), sub-zoba (sub-regional)
and community levels. Three cross-cutting themes or strategic areas of focus were examined in
the CPE: UNICEF Positioning and Partnerships; Equity and Gender Equality; and Programme
Convergence.
Evaluation Methodology
There were 5 core evaluation questions, and 13 sub-questions, as outlined below and in greater
detail in the Evaluation Matrix (see Annex D).
 EQ1 | Relevance | Is the Country Programme doing the right things?
1.1. What were UNICEF’s strengths in the country from 2017 to 2021, particularly in
comparison to other UN agencies and development partners, and how were these
harnessed to help achieve results?
1.2. Were UNICEF’s strategies to address equity and gender mainstreaming in line with local
needs and at an appropriate scale of implementation to reach the most marginalized?
1.3. To what extent has UNICEF been able to position itself as a strategic partner in the
country context, including adjusting to changing situations?
1.4. What adjustments were made to UNICEF’s strategies in response to programme
monitoring and/or changes in the operational context, and how effective were these
modifications?
 EQ2 | Coherence | How well does the Country Programme fit?
2.1. To what extent have the Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action (CCCs)
and UNICEF’s Gender Action Plans (GAPs) (2014–2017 and 2018–2021) been
consistently integrated into all aspects of programming and implementation, including in
the Programme Strategy Notes (PSN), related theories of change and results
frameworks?
2.2. What roles and contributions did the Government, UN agencies and other national actors
have in UNICEF’s approach to programme convergence, and how well were these
activities coordinated?
8
2.3. Did UNICEF’s approach to addressing the challenges of equity and gender equality play
a complementary role to that of Government, UN agencies and other development
actors?
 EQ3 | Effectiveness | Did the Country Programme achieve its objectives?
3.1. Did the Country Programme contribute to the reduction of inequities and exclusion and
progress towards the achievement of greater gender equality?
3.2. What results have been achieved by UNICEF through programme convergence, and at
what levels of change (e.g., national, zoba, sub-zoba or community)?
 EQ4 | Efficiency | How well were Country Programme resources managed and utilized?
4.1. Were UNICEF Country Office (CO) resources (funds, human resources, time, expertise,
etc.) allocated, tracked and utilized strategically to achieve results, including equity and
gender-related objectives?
4.2. Were the necessary management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation structures in
place in the UNICEF Country Office to effectively implement programme convergence?1
 EQ5 | Sustainability | Will the benefits of the Country Programme last?
5.1. To what extent are the positive changes and effects of the Country Programme
sustainable at the relevant levels (e.g., national, zoba, sub-zoba and community)?
5.2. To what extent have the programme strategies and approaches adopted by UNICEF
contributed to the sustainability of results, especially equity and gender-related results?
The CPE drew upon and integrated data from a variety of sources, which were triangulated to
draw conclusions and to make evaluative judgements about the Country Programme. The CPE
relied upon a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, including: (1) document review; (2)
secondary data analysis of programme monitoring data; (3) key informant interviews with UNICEF
staff members; (4) surveys and focus groups with external implementing partners; and (5)
participatory data collection sessions with programme beneficiaries, including parents,2
adolescents and service providers.
Overall, the evaluation engaged 555 stakeholders, including 280 female participants (51 per cent).
Participants included: 5 UNICEF staff members; 3 national government representatives and 50
local government representatives [programme managers and representatives from the National
Union of Youth and Students of Eritrea (NUYSE)] from the GoSE; and 500 programme
beneficiaries (including 200 adolescents, 200 parents and 100 service providers). No UN partners
participated in the evaluation for reasons that are not known to the evaluator. This limitation is
addressed in the methodology, findings and recommendations.
1 This evaluation question was rephrased from the Terms of Reference (ToR), because it was not possible to determine
if the chosen strategies and approaches were the most cost effective with the given data, or to determine if there were
alternatives that would have worked better.
2 Throughout this evaluation report, the term “parents” is inclusive of all primary caregivers of young children.

Evaluation Findings
Relevance
Finding 1: UNICEF’s primary strengths or comparative advantages in the country were
associated with its positioning as a leader and influencer as one of the largest UN agencies
operating in Eritrea for decades. The organization provides financial and technical contributions
for policy and systems strengthening, is the lead agency in delivering multisectoral programming
for children and adolescents, and is considered a trusted and valued government partner.
Finding 2: UNICEF’s strategies for addressing equity and gender mainstreaming appropriately
targeted the needs of the local population. However, it was not possible to determine if an
appropriate scale of implementation was reached with the most marginalized due to a lack of data
disaggregated by age and sex on the child, adolescent and parent populations in each zoba. The
available data suggests Southern Red Sea requires further investments by the CO to address
child equity and gender equality within this region.
Finding 3: UNICEF was well positioned as a strategic partner with Government, but there is a
need for strengthened collaboration with some UN agencies, especially in the area of adolescent
participation.
Finding 4: Delays in obtaining a signed work plan, prolonged droughts and the COVID-19
pandemic greatly affected programme implementation and slowed progress on achieving results
for children during the evaluation time period. However, UNICEF did its best to work around the
constraints faced in the operating environment, by adjusting its strategies and programming
approaches.
Coherence
Finding 5: The CCCs have been marginally integrated into the PSNs, theories of change and
results frameworks. Thus, the overall Country Programme was not risk informed, and the
connection between development and humanitarian programming was weak. The Country
Programme has done a better job at integrating the GAP into its programming strategies, but gaps
remain in the theories of change and results frameworks.
Finding 6: UNICEF had a lead role in contributing to the Eritrea Strategic Partnership Cooperation
Framework (SPCF) (2017–2021) for three outcome areas associated with Water, Sanitation and
Hygiene (WASH), education and child/social protection. While the common agenda and
coordinating structures were clearly identified, the effectiveness of UNICEF’s leadership in
making a collective impact in these outcome areas is not currently known. The Country
Programme benefited from decentralized coordination structures through the national unions,
which have representatives that serve on committees to implement joint programming at the
national, zoba, sub-zoba and community levels.
Finding 7: UNICEF’s programming to address equity and gender equality integrated the vision
of the GoSE and community members to address priority issues in the country. Mutually
reinforcing activities were identified and implemented through a complementary life course
approach by UNICEF and its UN partners. However, the conceptual framework for adolescent
development was not clearly developed, nor were there any synergistic measures for collective
impact in the Country Programme. The conceptual framework for early childhood development
was clear and included synergistic measures. However, these measures were not integrated into
10
the Country Programme results structure, so there was no accountability to track collective impact
for CSD programming.
Effectiveness
Finding 8: Overall, there was limited recent data on the results achieved for gender equality
through the contributions of the Country Programme. On a national level, there was evidence that
the Country Programme contributed to a reduction in female genital mutilation (FGM) for girls
under 15, which declined from 33.2 per cent in 2010 to 3.8 per cent in 2018. On a community
level, consultations with programme beneficiaries on their community conditions indicated the
perceptions of girls and women were slightly more favourable than boys and males in the sampled
locations. This finding indicates progress in the achievement of gender equality on the selected
indicators, although additional studies should be conducted to include a wider sample of
beneficiaries in the analysis.
Finding 9: On a national level, the Country Programme has contributed to national policies, plans
and strategies that reflect the importance of multisectoral programming, especially in convergence
with WASH, education, health, nutrition and social protection interventions. On a regional level,
the Country Programme effectively implemented six sectoral interventions within each zoba;
however, gaps remain in the scale of coverage for Southern Red Sea. On a community level, the
Country Programme achieved stronger results for girls and women through programme
convergence, when compared to boys and men in the sampled communities.
Efficiency
Finding 10: There was insufficient data on innovations and resource utilization to draw
conclusions about the efficacy of the Country Programme. However, there was evidence of
decreased interest in donor support for Eritrea, as well as a substantial funding gap for
humanitarian response.
Finding 11: The CO made staff changes to ensure the required management conditions were in
place for collective planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation for programme convergence.
Sustainability
Finding 12: The positive advancements made through the Country Programme are likely to
continue given strong government ownership, policy and system strengthening achievements and
high levels of community participation and empowerment. However, there are gaps in resource
allocation, programming in Southern Red Sea and with WASH that need to be addressed to
ensure sustainability, especially given the ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Finding 13: A combination of strategies were considered the most effective for the sustainability
of results: (1) system strengthening; (2) community engagement; and (3) partnerships.
11
Conclusions
Relevance
The objectives of the Country Programme and its design were appropriate, and remain
appropriate for the national development goals and the intended beneficiaries, namely the most
marginalized children and women of Eritrea. However, given a lack of recent population-based
data, as well as district and community-level data, it was not possible to examine if these
strategies were sufficiently gender responsive and implemented at a scale to reach all those in
need. With the information available, UNICEF did not implement programming in the Southern
Red Sea at the level it required as a target region.
UNICEF’s strong partnership with the GoSE and its leadership towards reaching its objectives
was suitable considering its mandate, resource base, comparative advantages and operational
considerations. As one of the largest UN agencies operating in Eritrea, UNICEF is a major
influencer of policies and programmes in the country, especially in education, WASH and
child/social protection. UNICEF identified the most relevant strategies to solve programmatic
challenges, such as the global pandemic and delays in a signed work plan. In particular, UNICEF
shifted between upstream system strengthening and downstream service delivery as
opportunities arose. However, these delays did slow progress on realizing results for children and
posed some risks to UNICEF’s reputation, with ebbs and flows in service provision.
UNICEF successfully leveraged its partnerships with the GoSE to develop more than a dozen
policies and plans that strengthened multisectoral programming for CSD and adolescent
development and participation. However, given the evolving and overlapping mandates with other
UN agencies on adolescent development and participation, greater clarity on the roles and
contributions of UNICEF and its partner UN agencies in this area of programming is warranted.
Coherence
The overall logic of the Country Programme theory of change and results frameworks was
somewhat consistent with key UNICEF strategies and international commitments, but gaps
remain. The Country Programme excelled at aligning its programming strategies with the GAP,
but it did not sufficiently integrate gender-responsive theories of change and gender-
disaggregated results frameworks. The Country Programme did not sufficiently integrate the
CCCs in its PSNs, theories of change and results frameworks. The lack of a risk-informed
approach to programming is a serious limitation of the Country Programme given the contextual
socio-political-environmental realities in Eritrea.
UNICEF’s coordination and convening role within the UN, and with government sectors, was
appropriate, but the BECPP programming did not have a conceptual implementation framework
that clearly identified mutually reinforcing activities for adolescent development. The CSD
framework did not fully integrate the multisectoral Nurturing Care Framework guiding this
programming component, and opportunities for monitoring collective impact were not realized.
Effectiveness
The Country Programme effectively implemented programme convergence, delivering six
sectoral interventions within each zoba; however, gaps were identified in the Southern Red Sea
zoba. Overall, there was a lack of recent and sufficiently disaggregated data to determine if the
Country Programme was gender transformative. However, evidence from one study in 2018
12
indicated a substantial reduction in FGM for girls aged under 15 and under 5. Evidence from
programme beneficiaries, collected through this evaluation, indicated progress on gender
equality. In particular, female service providers, mothers and girls had more favourable views of
their community conditions when compared to male service providers, fathers and boys. In
addition, the Country Programme achieved stronger results for girls and women through
programme convergence, when compared to boys and men in the sampled communities. These
findings suggest that UNICEF’s targeted gender programming has been effective for girls and
women, but its gender mainstreaming strategies have been less effective for boys and men.
Efficiency
The management structures of the Country Programme were sufficient for programme
convergence and for delivering on equity and gender-related objectives, with the exception of the
adequacy of recent and disaggregated monitoring data. UNICEF promoted innovations to address
this gap through android-based platforms for WASH interventions, but there was insufficient
information to draw conclusions about gains in efficiency. Substantial resource gaps were
identified for delivering humanitarian programming, as well as decreased donor interest in Eritrea.
UNICEF did its best to address these resource gaps through South-to-South collaboration and
awareness raising about the needs in Eritrea through multi-stakeholder donor platforms, but the
overall budget fell short by US$31.69 million.
Sustainability
The design of the Country Programme is premised on government ownership and strengthening
institutional capacities in government ministries to ensure sustainability. In the case of Eritrea,
UNICEF was considered a strong and trusted partner of the GoSE, but also of the national unions
who support programming at the decentralized levels. The continuation of benefits from Country
Programme interventions will be ensured through policy and system strengthening achievements
and high levels of community participation and empowerment. Risks to sustainability include the
ongoing pandemic and subsequent effects on mental health and loss of learning, as well as
communities reverting to some traditional and harmful gender practices without continuous
sensitization. Capacity development for frontline workers, including teachers, early childhood
practitioners, health care workers and social workers will be instrumental for sustaining the impact
of the Country Programme with beneficiaries.
Lessons Learned
The following lessons were identified, particularly as they apply to UNICEF’s positioning,
programme convergence and gender mainstreaming:
 UNICEF’s leadership as a backbone entity for coordinating multisectoral programming
with the GoSE and with other UN agencies was clearly articulated in the SPCF. As a
leader, UNICEF must provide all partners with clear conceptual frameworks for
operationalizing multisectoral programming in practice, such as the Nurturing Care
Framework.
 Such frameworks enable all actors to understand the mutually supporting roles, activities
and outputs that lead to synergistic impacts. Such frameworks will facilitate coordination
and continuous communication across UN agencies where there are overlapping
mandates.
13
 UNICEF’s approach to programme convergence was both thematic and spatial. From a
thematic perspective, UNICEF utilized a life course approach to programming to identify
mutually reinforcing activities from relevant sectors for young children and for adolescents.
From a spatial perspective, UNICEF tracked the implementation of its sectoral
interventions at the zoba and sub-zoba level, which greatly enhanced the ability to
examine the extent and coverage of programme convergence.
 The ability to monitor and evaluate collective impact requires a shared measurement
framework that identifies the unique contributions of each sector and UN agency, while at
the same time containing synergistic measures of outputs and outcomes. The shared
measurement frameworks put forth in recent government policies offer a concrete way to
progressively be able to demonstrate collective impact across all UN agencies and
government sectors.
Recommendations
Recommendation 1: Strengthen the evidence generation strategy overall, and improve data
collection processes to ensure spatial data is available at the decentralized levels, and is
disaggregated by gender.
Recommendation 2: Strengthen the risk-informed approach to the Country Programme and its
implementation.
Recommendation 3: Strengthen multisectoral programme coherence and implementation by
developing or leveraging existing operational frameworks for early childhood and adolescent
development.
Recommendation 4: Strengthen the Country Programme theory of change and measurement
framework to improve the coherence of the collective impact approach.
Recommendation 5: Strengthen the gender mainstreaming approach in the Country Programme
by clearly articulating the needs and strategies of both girls and boys and by utilizing gender
responsive measures.
Recommendation 6: Consider frequent and scaled participatory data collection processes for
continued monitoring of programme relevance, effectiveness and results.
Recommendation 7: Mobilize additional resources to scale UNICEF-supported programming to
reach the most disadvantaged children, especially in Southern Red Sea.
Recommendation 8: Elaborate upon the child and adolescent participation strategy, as well as a
larger community participation strategy that recognizes the empowerment of all actors in the
Country Programme.

Section A: Background
1.1. Object of the Evaluation
This report represents the findings of an external evaluation of the Eritrea-UNICEF Country
Programme of Cooperation, 2017–2021. UNICEF has worked in Eritrea with the aim of improving
the situation of children and women, as mandated by the Convention on the Rights of the Child
(CRC), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women
(CEDAW), and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The
organization has worked with the Government of Eritrea and other UN Agencies to ensure
alignment between the Eritrea-UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, the National
Indicative Development Plan (NIDP) (2014–2018) and SPCF (2017–2021). Further, the Eritrea
Country Programme aligns with UNICEF’s global Strategic Plan (2017–2021) ESARO priorities,
as well as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The overall goal of the Country Programme during the period from 2017 to 2021 was to
progressively realize children’s rights in Eritrea, especially among the most disadvantaged. To
achieve this goal, UNICEF supported the efforts of the Government in three components [as
outlined in the CPD: (1) Child Survival and Development; (2) Basic Education, Child Protection
and Participation; and (3) Program Effectiveness. The geographic scope of UNICEF activities
included the national level (for upstream activities), and the four most vulnerable zobas (for
downstream work), which were: Anseba, Gash Barka, Northern Red Sea and Southern Red Sea.3
The Country Programme was estimated as requiring US$102.46 million to achieve the set results.
The objective of the Child Survival and Development (CSD) programming component was to
address child stunting and health deprivations and to reduce preventable child and maternal
deaths, ill health and disability in remote areas of the country. The desired outcome was that
disadvantaged children, adolescents and women utilize quality health, nutrition and water,
sanitation and hygiene services. With a budget of US$40.3 million, three main activities and
interventions were prioritized: (1) strengthening the enabling environment through the
development of health legislation, policies, strategies, plans and budgets; (2) expanding the
equitable use of maternal and newborn infant health interventions by building the capacity of
community health workers; and (3) improving access to WASH services in institutions, schools
and health centres. Key stakeholders for this programming component included: the Ministry of
Health; the Ministry of Land, Water and Environment; the World Health Organization (WHO); the
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA); the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV and AIDS
(UNAIDS); and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).
The objective of the Basic Education, Child Protection and Participation (BECPP)
programming component was to increase access to quality basic education for all children,
protecting them from violence, exploitation and abuse, and enabling them to meaningfully
participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives. The desired outcome was that
Eritrean girls and boys in four disadvantaged zobas (Anseba, Gash Barka, Northern Red Sea and
Southern Red Sea) would have expanded access to quality basic education and child protection
services. With a budget of US$51.15 million, three main activities and interventions were
prioritized: (1) protective school environments; (2) supporting the Government and partners to

enforce the legal age of marriage of 18 years and to enforce protective laws against FGM; and
(3) promoting effective adolescent participation through the development of life skills interventions
and the involvement of adolescents in community and school-based activities. Key stakeholders
for this programing component included: the Ministry of Education; the Ministry of National
Development; the Ministry of Health; the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare; the National Union
of Eritrean Women (NUEW); NUYSE; and the Eritrea Sports and Culture Commission.
The objective of the Programme Effectiveness (PE) component was to lead, coordinate and
manage the Country Programme in a manner that delivers results for children. The desired
outcome was that the Eritrea Country Programme would be efficiently designed, coordinated,
managed and supported to meet quality programming standards in achieving results for children.
With a budget of US$11.01 million, four main activities were prioritized: (1) programme
coordination; (2) advocacy, communication for development (C4D), partnerships and external
relations; (3) programme planning and monitoring; and (4) cross-sectoral approaches. Key
stakeholders for this component included: the National Statistics Office, the Ministry of
Information, and NUYSE.
1.2. Country Context
Eritrea is located in the Horn of Africa, adjacent to the Red Sea (see political map on page 2),
with an estimated population of 3.6 million (2015), including 58 per cent under 19 years of age.4
The country has a rich cultural heritage, including nine ethnic groups, the majority of whom are
considered Tigriny or Tigre. Eritrea is comprised of six administrative regions or zobas, which are
further divided into 58 districts or sub-zobas (see regional map on page 2).
Eritrea is vulnerable to environmental degradation, which can have adverse effects on the 70 per
cent of the rural population who sustain their livelihoods through agricultural and pastoralist
activities.5 For example, reoccurring and multi-year droughts are common, as are seasonal
torrential rainfall and flooding. The four of Eritrea’s zobas that are most affected by climate change
are Anseba, Gash-Barka, Northern Red Sea and Southern Red Sea. These regions also have
the lowest child well-being indicators, indicating multiple forms of deprivation and a spatial
inequality in the realization of children’s rights within the country.
Since formal attainment of independence in 1993, the country has witnessed progress in
economic and social development. For example, the country experienced an average annual
gross domestic product (GDP) increase of 3 to 4 per cent from 2010 to 2020.6 As a result, the
proportion of people living in poverty declined from 70 per cent in 1995 to 58 per cent in 2015.7
However, poverty remains a significant barrier to child well-being, contributing to food insecurity,
migration and household vulnerability, especially in rural regions.
Eritrea is governed by a single ruling party, the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ).
In 2018, the Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship between the Prime Minister of Ethiopia
and the President of Eritrea re-established diplomatic and economic ties between the two
countries after decades of instability in the region. In 2019, the Government of Eritrea announced
4 Some estimates suggest the population of Eritrea is as high as 6.7 million, although there has never been an official
government census.

five Roadmap priorities: (1) Agriculture; (2) Health and Nutrition; (3) Education; (4) Water; and (5)
Capacity Building. These national priorities align with UNICEF priorities to improve the situation
of children and adolescents in Eritrea.
1.3. Situation of Children and Adolescents in Eritrea
The situation of children and adolescents in Eritrea informed the rationale for the Eritrea-UNICEF
Country Programme of Cooperation from 2017 to 2021, and for the accompanying CPD. The CPD
is an action plan that articulates the programming agenda between the Government of Eritrea
and UNICEF to realize children’s rights.
On the positive side, the situation of children has improved in Eritrea in the last 20 years,
especially in certain aspects of children’s health and education. For example, the under-five
mortality rate declined from 136 per 1,000 live births in 1995 to 40.5 in 2019.8 Net primary
enrolment increased from 42 per cent in 1995 to 83.4 per cent (85.6 per cent male, 81.5 per cent
female) in 2017.9
However, there are three persistent issues associated with poor child well-being in Eritrea that
UNICEF intended to address with the Government during the Country Programme time period,
including: (1) under-five child stunting and ill health; (2) a lack of access to early childhood
education and poor educational attainment; and (3) harmful gender and social norms.
According to the Eritrea CPD, approximately 50 per cent of children under five are stunted, with
higher rates in the Northern Red Sea (58 per cent) and Southern Red Sea (57 per cent) regions.
Thus, undernutrition contributes to nearly half of under-five deaths in Eritrea. About 70 per cent
of neonatal deaths are attributed to prematurity, complications during childbirth and infections.10
A lack of proper water and sanitation and poor hygiene practices contribute to diarrheal diseases
and pneumonia, which negatively impact children’s health and development.
Access to education remains a barrier for younger children in pre-primary, with only 17 per cent
of four- and five-year-old children attending preschool. In addition, children and adolescents have
low attainment levels in school across all grade levels in Eritrea. Similar to the health disparities
outlined previously, the Northern and Southern Red Sea regions face more education related
deprivations.
Harmful gender and social norms also contribute to poor child development and educational
attainment. For example, child marriage was the main reason for dropping out of school for 69
per cent of women.11 Access to government services as well as parental knowledge, attitudes,
beliefs and practices shape the opportunities children and adolescents have to develop, thrive
and succeed in life.
During the period of this Country Programme, the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020
further exacerbated existing challenges for the most vulnerable children and adolescents in
accessing basic social services. Thus, the evaluation examined this change in the operating

17
context, as the emergency situation has likely slowed progress on child well-being. For example,
all 2,154 educational institutions were closed in March of 2020, affecting 679,854 children and
adolescents.12 Extended school closures are likely to have a negative impact on learning
outcomes and will increase gaps in education attainment among the most vulnerable and hard-
to-reach children who lack access to technology. National lockdowns and restrictions on
movement have limited the ability of healthcare providers to reach those in need, and to sustain
prevention measures such as routine child vaccinations. Communities also face transport issues
due to the containment measures, making it difficult for children and families to access basic
services. The COVID-19 response has also increased demand on already stretched water
supplies, sanitation and waste management services.
1.4. Country Programme Theory of Change
The theory of change for the Country Programme was not explicitly articulated in the CPD, nor
were any assumptions clearly identified. Thus, the theory of change was developed retroactively
through this evaluation and was not vetted by UNICEF (see Figure 1). Two main assumptions
were identified: (1) that UNICEF and the Government have an approved work plan; and (2) that
UNICEF and the Government have the capacity and resources to adjust to operating conditions
as needed, to ensure continuous programming. A number of theoretical perspectives or
approaches underpin the theory of change for the Country Programme.
First, the Country Programme is based upon a life-cycle approach to programming that
acknowledges the inter-connections between stages of development. This perspective enables
UNICEF to advocate for a continuum of services that are required to promote optimal
development from infancy through adolescence. For example, the CSD programming component
focuses upon the range of services necessary for early childhood development, while the BECPP
programming component focuses upon adolescent development and school-aged children.
Second, the Country Programme is based upon collective impact, or a multisectoral
programming approach that is implemented through thematic and geographic programme
convergence within the four target zobas (or the delivery of multiple services within specific
communities). The theory behind collective impact initiatives is that stronger results for children
will be achieved if multiple actors are focused upon a common agenda. This perspective enables
UNICEF to advocate for the whole child by promoting integrated services for optimal early
childhood and adolescent development. For example, the CSD programming component
incorporates interventions from health, nutrition and WASH to ensure that parents of young
children under five are equipped with the knowledge and skills to practice nurturing care. The
BECPP programming component integrates gender-responsive interventions from education and
child protection to ensure adolescents, especially girls, are equipped with the knowledge and life
skills necessary to be safe and to succeed.
Third, the Country Programme is based upon a cross-sectoral approach, in which strategies to
address issues related to children’s rights, gender, resilience/preparedness and disaster risk
reduction are integrated into each programming component. This approach ensures that each
programming component acknowledges and proactively operationalizes the way in which these
cross-cutting issues are being addressed in practice.
12 Data was derived from the Terms of Reference for this evaluation, as no other data was available.

Assumptions:
1. UNICEF and the Government have an approved work plan
2. UNICEF and the Government have the capacity and resources to adjust to operating conditions, as needed, to ensure continuous programming
For example, each programming component has considered gender-responsive approaches in
their work, such as the collection of monitoring data that is disaggregated by sex, or uniquely
tailored interventions for girls and boys, or mothers and fathers. The cross-sectoral approach
ensures that UNICEF programming is equitable and resilient to shocks such as natural disasters.
Finally, the Country Programme reflects UNICEF’s human rights-based approach to
programming, which includes a focus on operationalizing all relevant human rights conventions
(such as for children, women and people with disabilities); an equity approach in reaching the
most marginalized; gender equality through the mainstreaming and targeting of gender-
responsive programming approaches; and climate change resilience through community
capacity building.
There are six change strategies reflected in the theory of change for the Country Programme.
Each strategy is designed to contribute to programmatic outcomes, either direct or indirect, that
help achieve results for children. These change strategies, their objectives and their potential
contributions to programmatic outcomes are summarized in Table 1. Through this evaluation, it
will be important to better understand how these strategies were applied in practice, if they were
equally applied across programming components, or if certain strategies supported unique
objectives and results of the Country Programme. In addition, new strategies may have emerged
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, or certain strategies may have been prioritized, while
others were deprioritized.

South-to-South Learning and Partnerships Encourage the sharing of knowledge, skills and
Cooperation expertise as well as the adaptation of good

Fourth, the Country Programme reflects the social-ecological model of child development, a
theory that postulates that child development occurs in context and is shaped by micro-, meso-
and macro-level social, economic and cultural systems and processes. This theoretical
20
perspective is reflected in UNICEF’s balance of upstream and downstream work, which
includes interventions that target the institutional and policy levels of change (upstream), as well
as individual, family, and community change (downstream). For example, in the CSD
programming component, interventions target young children themselves, in addition to their
parents, the health care institutions and schools in their communities, and the policies that shape
coverage and access to these services.
The outputs in the theory of change reflect UNICEF’s unique contributions to the Country
Programme results, which focus on the capacity of governments, institutions and communities in
realizing children’s rights. In the CSD programming component, there are four outputs for health,
nutrition and WASH. In the BECPP programming component, there are four outputs for education,
child protection and participation in schools. In the PE component, there are five outputs that
reflect programme coordination, programme planning and monitoring, external relations, C4D for
advocacy and partnerships and cross-sectoral management strategies.
The outcomes in the theory of change reflect the collective impact of UNICEF, the Government
and UN Partners in achieving the overall impact of the Country Programme, which is to
progressively realize the rights of children, especially the most marginalized. For the CSD
programming component, the outcome focused on the use of services by the intended
beneficiaries. For the BECPP programming component, the outcome is focused upon access and
quality of basic services. For the PE component, the outcome is focused upon the efficiency and
quality of programming. The findings from the evaluation are also included in the theory of change
and are detailed in Section D.
1.5. Country Programme Stakeholders
The Eritrea Country Programme involves a range of stakeholders and partners (see Table 2).
UNICEF provides financial support and leadership in the design of the Country Programme, which
it delivers in partnership with other UN agencies who have a supporting role in specific aspects
of the programming (to be discussed in greater detail in the evaluation report). The GoSE is the
primary partner of UNICEF in implementing the Country Programme. They are responsible for
programme coordination, management, implementation and monitoring. The primary
beneficiaries or rights holders of the Country Programme are parents, children ages 0–6 and
adolescents ages 10–18. The secondary beneficiaries include frontline workers, who gain the
knowledge and skills to operationalize the programming through strengthened institutions and
systems.

Section B: Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and
Scope
2.1. Evaluation Purpose
According to the UNICEF Evaluation Policy (2018), every Country Programme must be evaluated
at least once every two programme cycles. Country Programme Evaluations (CPEs) offer an
analysis of UNICEF contributions to national development goals and the effectiveness of UNICEF
strategies in leveraging national efforts to achieve results for children and adolescents.
In the case of Eritrea, this is the first CPE to be conducted since the UNICEF Evaluation Policy
was enacted within the organization. As such, this CPE is timely; its purpose is to provide valuable
insights on what has been achieved in Eritrea through UNICEF’s contributions, and on the lessons
learned to strengthen the implementation of the next Country Programme. However, this CPE will
not inform the development of the new Country Programme Document (CPD), which already has
been developed for the Executive Board’s approval; rather this CPE is forward looking and will
inform the key implementation and operationalization strategies of the next CPD.
2.2. Evaluation Uses
This CPE aims to strengthen UNICEF’s accountability to national stakeholders, including the
GoSE, children and adolescents, as well as to the UNICEF Executive Board. Internal users
include the UNICEF Eritrea Country Office Representative and Deputy Representative, as well
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO);
the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC); and WHO.
14 The Government ministries and related entities working with UNICEF include: Ministry of Health;
Ministry of Land, Water and Environment (for CSD programming); Ministry of National Development;
Ministry of Education; Ministry of Labour and Human Welfare; NUEW; Eritrea Sports and Culture
Commission (for BECPP programming); National Statistics Office; Ministry of Information; and NUYSE
(for PE component).
22
as Senior Programme Managers. The evaluation will benefit these internal users by highlighting
strategic recommendations for the implementation of the next Country Programme. External
users of the evaluation include government representatives, UN partner agencies and donors.
The evaluation will benefit these partners by sharing lessons learned in programme convergence,
and for strengthening partnerships towards collective impact for children.
2.3. Evaluation Objectives
As outlined in the Terms of Reference (see Annex A), there are three objectives of this CPE:
1. To assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and sustainability of the
Eritrea Country Programme with particular focus on equity, gender equality and
convergence of programme components, as well as UNICEF’s strategic positioning in
relation to its child rights mandate.
2. To identify and document key lessons learned, good practices and innovations in
implementing the Country Programme that can inform and support advocacy efforts for
scale-up and replication.
3. To provide a set of forward-looking and actionable recommendations to strengthen
programmatic strategies in the implementation of the next Eritrea Country Programme,
taking into consideration national development priorities, such as the Eritrea Development
Vision 2025, the next five-year development plan and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development in the country.
2.4. Evaluation Scope
The CPE covered the Eritrea Country Programme from 2017 to 2021, and examined evaluative
evidence on UNICEF’s effectiveness in leveraging national efforts for children, as well as its direct
contributions in achieving results for children. The evaluation focused on the formal UNICEF CPD
approved by the Executive Board, but also considered any changes/revisions from the initial CPD
during the period under review (such as changes in strategies to address COVID-19). The scope
and unit of analysis of the CPE includes the entirety of UNICEF’s engagement in the country, and
therefore covers interventions funded by all sources. However, the evaluation did not include an
analysis of specific UNICEF programmes, as the intent was to examine strategic goals and
processes that affect all programmes at the national, zoba, sub-zoba and community levels.
Three cross-cutting themes or strategic areas of focus will be examined in the CPE:
 UNICEF Positioning and Partnerships – The CPE had a particular focus on UNICEF’s
positioning within the development community and its relations with national partners in
regards to its mandate. This included an analysis of UNICEF’s capacity development,
evidence-based advocacy and South-to-South learning and cooperation strategies, as
well as the organization’s comparative advantage in achieving results for children.
 Equity and Gender Equality – The CPE examined the extent to which equity and gender
equality have been mainstreamed within the Country Programme. This included an
analysis of the C4D, innovations and child and youth participation strategies. The CPE
23
also examined the Country Programme theory of change and results structure to address
alignment with global frameworks on equity and gender equality.
 Programme Convergence – The CPE examined the approaches to programme
convergence (or multisectoral programming) and lessons learned in order to establish the
extent to which these approaches accelerated or amplified results for children within the
four target zobas. This included an analysis of spatial data on UNICEF programming to
examine geographic convergence and results. The CPE also examined the extent to
which the necessary institutional structures and processes were in place for effective
multisectoral programming (see Section C: Evaluation Methodology for more information).
Section C: Evaluation Methodology
3.1. Evaluation Framework
The evaluation methodology adhered to the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and
Standards.15 The CPE adopted a theory-based and outcomes mapping evaluation approach. This
approach enabled the evaluator to re-examine the Country Programme theory of change in
greater detail with relevant stakeholders and allowed for the plausible assessment of UNICEF’s
contribution to results.16 A participatory evaluation approach was also employed to enable the
evaluator to collect and analyse data on the outcomes of programme convergence with select
beneficiaries.
According to the Terms of Reference (see Annex A), the CPE included five main evaluation
criteria and questions. Additional sub-questions were included and aligned with evaluation criteria
definitions from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Development
Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC), and some sub-questions were revised to better focus the
evaluation on UNICEF positioning and approaches to programme convergence, equity and
gender equality. The revised questions also take into consideration consultations with the
UNICEF Eritrea Country Office Representative and Deputy Representative, and with UNICEF
ESARO and Eritrea CO evaluation specialists.17
There were five core evaluation questions, and 13 sub-questions, as outlined below and in greater
detail in the Evaluation Matrix (see Annex D).
 EQ1 | Relevance | Is the Country Programme doing the right things?
15 See UNEG Norms and Standards for Evaluation (2016): <www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/1914>.
16 The retroactive theory of change was developed and further revised through this evaluation through a process of
data analysis and triangulation. The visual diagram represents the narrative and vision set forth in the CPD as well as
the results framework. In addition, it incorporates data from the evaluation on beneficiary outcomes and system
strengthening outcomes that were discovered through the evaluation (see Figure 1: Eritrea Country Programme theory
of change). However, the theory of change was not fully vetted by the CO. It has only been reviewed by those engaged
with the evaluation process and should go through further vetting by UNICEF staff members, especially in revising a
theory of change for the new CPD.
17 During inception, an evaluability assessment was done with the data provided to the evaluator by the CO. Upon a
desk review of the available data, it was clear that some evaluation questions could not be covered because there
was no data. In particular, one evaluation sub-question on efficiency and one on effectiveness were not included
because of a lack of data.
24
1.1. What were UNICEF’s strengths in the country from 2017 to 2021, particularly in
comparison to other UN agencies and development partners, and how were these
harnessed to help achieve results?
1.2. Were UNICEF’s strategies to address equity and gender mainstreaming in line with local
needs and at an appropriate scale of implementation to reach the most marginalized?
1.3. To what extent has UNICEF been able to position itself as a strategic partner in the
country context, including adjusting to changing situations?
1.4. What adjustments were made to UNICEF’s strategies in response to programme
monitoring and/or changes in the operational context, and how effective were these
modifications?
 EQ2 | Coherence | How well does the Country Programme fit?
2.1. To what extent have the Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action (CCCs)
and UNICEF’s Gender Action Plans (GAPs) (2014–2017 and 2018–2021) been
consistently integrated into all aspects of programming and implementation, including in
the Programme Strategy Notes (PSN), related theories of change and results
frameworks?
2.2. What roles and contributions did the Government, UN agencies and other national actors
have in UNICEF’s approach to programme convergence, and how well were these
activities coordinated?
2.3. Did UNICEF’s approach to addressing the challenges of equity and gender equality play
a complementary role to that of Government, UN agencies and other development
actors?
 EQ3 | Effectiveness | Did the Country Programme achieve its objectives?
3.1. Did the Country Programme contribute to the reduction of inequities and exclusion and
progress towards the achievement of greater gender equality?
3.2. What results have been achieved by UNICEF through programme convergence, and at
what levels of change (e.g., national, zoba, sub-zoba or community)?
 EQ4 | Efficiency | How well were Country Programme resources managed and utilized?
4.1. Were UNICEF Country Office (CO) resources (funds, human resources, time, expertise,
etc.) allocated, tracked and utilized strategically to achieve results, including equity and
gender-related objectives?
4.2. Were the necessary management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation structures in
place in the UNICEF CO to effectively implement programme convergence?18
 EQ5 | Sustainability | Will the benefits of the Country Programme last?
18 This evaluation question was rephrased from the Terms of Reference, because it was not possible to determine if
the chosen strategies and approaches were the most cost effective with the given data, or to determine if there were
alternatives that would have worked better.
25
5.1. To what extent are the positive changes and effects of the Country Programme
sustainable at the relevant levels (e.g., national, zoba, sub-zoba and community)?
5.2. To what extent have the programme strategies and approaches adopted by UNICEF
contributed to the sustainability of results, especially equity and gender-related results?
3.2. Data Sources and Indicators
The CPE drew upon and integrated primary and secondary data from a variety sources, which
were triangulated to draw conclusions and to make evaluative judgements about the Country
Programme. All data sources and indicators for answering each evaluation question are
referenced in the Evaluation Matrix (see Annex D). For example, the GAP and CCCs were utilized
as normative documents for examining programme coherence. The SPCF and the CPD were
utilized as normative documents for examining UNICEF positioning and partnerships.
The CPE also drew upon research and practice on collective impact initiatives to assess
programme convergence as a multisectoral programming approach. Collective impact
interventions rely upon multiple actors who commit to a common agenda for solving complex
social and environmental issues. The assumption is that greater effects on the intended outcomes
can be observed through the synergistic delivery of multiple interventions, and that efficiency can
be gained through collaboration and collective action.
Research indicates that there are five foundational conditions for collective impact initiatives to be
effective in practice.19 First, there must be a (1) common agenda or a shared vision for change,
including a common understanding of the problem and a joint approach to solving it through
agreed upon actions. Second, there must be (2) mutually reinforcing activities, or differentiated
stakeholder activities that are coordinated and synergistic through a mutually reinforcing plan of
action. Third, there must be a (3) shared measurement system, or an agreement upon what to
measure and how in order to ensure that efforts remain aligned and to facilitate continuous
learning, improvement and accountability.20 Fourth, there should be an
organization/partner/sector/actor providing a (4) backbone function, or a dedicated programme
staff with the necessary skills to coordinate partner organizations and agencies. Finally, there
must be (5) continuous communication across the multiple actors to build trust, to transparently
confirm that mutual objectives are being met, and to maintain motivation.
3.3. Data Collection and Analysis Approach
The CPE relied upon a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, including: (1) document
review; (2) secondary data analysis of programme monitoring data; (3) key informant interviews
with UNICEF staff members; (4) surveys and focus groups with external implementing partners;
and (5) participatory data collection sessions with programme beneficiaries, including parents,
adolescents and service providers.
The document review included a sample of 54 reports, studies, strategic plans and conceptual
frameworks that describe UNICEF programming goals, objectives and approaches to
19 Preskill, H., Parkhurst, M. and Splansky Juster, J., Guide to Evaluating Collective Impact: Learning and Evaluation
in the Collective Impact Context, Collective Impact Forum and FSG, 2014.

programme convergence.
26
implementation (see Annex B). This secondary data is largely qualitative in nature and was used
to contextualize the Eritrea Country Programme within the national context, and to examine all of
the evaluation questions, especially those associated with programme relevance and coherence.
The analysis of secondary programme monitoring data included: spatial data (14 data files) on
the implementation of UNICEF programming within particular zobas and sub-zobas; statistical
data on UNICEF programme implementation, reach and results; UNICEF CO reports from 2017
to 2020; and Results Assessment Module (RAM) data from 2019 and 2020 (see Annex B). This
secondary data is a mix of quantitative and qualitative information and was used to examine the
evaluation questions associated with programme relevance, effectiveness and efficiency.
Key informant interviews (KIIs) with UNICEF staff members were held remotely to discuss the
Country Programme theory of change, the assumptions behind the desired changes and the
causal linkages between the interventions and outcomes (see Annex C). Surveys with UN and
Government partners were administered in hard copy and online to examine implementation
success and challenges, as well as UNICEF’s comparative advantages and lessons learned.
Focus groups with local programme managers were conducted in person to assess
implementation progress, challenges and lessons learned. This primary data was qualitative in
nature and was used to address gaps in answering all of the evaluation questions, and to probe
deeper into programme effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability.
Participatory data collection sessions with programme beneficiaries took place in partnership
with a local evaluation team who worked closely with parents, adolescents and service providers
(see Annex C). The primary purpose of hearing directly from programme beneficiaries and service
providers was to ensure the evaluation was equitable and gender responsive, and to assess
UNICEF’s direct service provision within specific sub-zobas. This primary data was a mix of
qualitative and quantitative information and was used to examine the evaluation questions
associated with programme relevance and effectiveness.
The primary data from key informant interviews, focus groups and participatory sessions was
largely qualitative in nature and was managed using Dedoose, a platform that enables the coding
of passages of text to assess trends in the data. The process for reviewing all of the data included
the following steps:
Step 1 – Initial review of information to assess relevance.
Step 2 – Review and coding of passages of text according to the evaluation sub-questions.
Step 3 – Review of all text for specific codes to further analyse the data.
Step 4 – If data permits, use of trends analysis tools in Dedoose to summarize
trends/intersections.
Step 5 – Triangulation of information from multiple data sources and consideration of strength of
evidence.
Step 6 – Drawing of conclusions based upon the indicators in the Evaluation Matrix.
Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics such as frequencies, proportions or
ratios, scorecards or weighted averages, and by comparing data points from time 1 and time 2 (if
available). To the extent feasible with the given data, the mapping of programme implementation
assisted in a spatial analysis of UNICEF’s reach and programme convergence.

3.4. Data Collection Tools and Sampling
The methods, samples and tools utilized for primary data collection are summarized in Table 3.
Overall, the evaluation engaged 555 stakeholders, including 280 female participants (51 per cent).
Participants included: 5 UNICEF staff members; 3 national government representatives and 50
local government representatives (programme managers and NUYSE) from the GoSE; and 500
programme beneficiaries (including 200 adolescents, 200 parents and 100 service providers).

Key informant interviews with UNICEF staff members were conducted, including 10–20
questions that assessed a range of evaluation themes (see Annex C for detailed protocols).
Surveys with 10 questions focusing on UNICEF’s comparative advantage and partnership were
utilized with relevant ministries from the GoSE, as well as with representatives from UN agencies
(see Annex C for detailed protocols). The selection and sampling of these stakeholders was done
in consultation with the UNICEF Country Office. This enabled the evaluator to identify the most
relevant implementing partners to include in the evaluation, taking into consideration any
constraints in their participation.
Focus groups with local programme managers and representatives from NUYSE were desired
given there was limited data on the effectiveness of the Country Programme and on UNICEF’s
approach to programme convergence (see Annex C for detailed protocols).
The objective of the participatory data collection sessions with programme beneficiaries was
to qualitatively assess the effectiveness of programme convergence by comparing the
perceptions of adolescents, parents and service providers who live in high touch-point sub-zobas
where programme convergence was strong, with low touch point zobas, where UNICEF
programming was not as advanced.
The utilized tool was Child Friendly Places,21 which is an interactive and visual child-friendly
community assessment survey that has been implemented in more than 30 countries with over
65,000 children and adolescents by UNICEF and other UN agencies, NGOs and civil society
organizations in remote and challenging contexts (see Annex C). Surveys are implemented using
local objects, and for Eritrea, local beans and buckets were utilized (see Figure 2). The surveys
provide enough structure to collect anonymous data that can be aggregated for qualitative
comparisons using scorecards (or weighted averages), while at the same time affording the
opportunity for participants to tally, view and discuss the results in real-time using a results chart.
There were multiple indicator databanks to draw upon for child-friendly communities and schools,
which include simple, developmentally appropriate statements on community conditions that are
linked to specific articles from the Convention on the Rights of the Child. For this evaluation, 10
21 <https://cergnyc.org/portfolio/child-friendly-places>.
29
survey items were selected to assess programme convergence for CSD and BECPP
programming components (see Annex C).
The final selection of survey items represented a blend of synergistic and sector specific indicators
that aligned with the Country Programme results framework for each programming component
(see Annex C). The statements for parents and/or adolescents are similar to those asked of
service providers who work directly on these programmes. This facilitated the comparison of
views among frontline workers (programme implementers) and beneficiaries, as well as a
comprehensive community scorecard (or weighted average) for each indicator.
In order for these sessions to take place in a culturally appropriate and gender responsive way,
the international evaluator trained and worked with a local evaluation team that was contracted
by UNICEF to co-design and implement these sessions (see Annex C for detailed protocol,
training materials and data collection tools). All evaluation tools were translated into three local
languages in both oral and written formats, while images were deemed appropriate for the local
context. The data collection took place between November and December 2021 with seven local
evaluators (including 6 males and 1 female).
For quality assurance purposes, a pilot test was conducted in Asmara with one group of
adolescents and this was filmed for review by all team members before proceeding with fieldwork.
During fieldwork, the international evaluator was in regular contact with the supervisor of the local
evaluation team to address any questions or issues that arose. Overall, the data collection
process, which followed safety protocols for COVID-19, was implemented in an ethical way and
at a high degree of fidelity (as originally planned).

The geographic sampling for participatory data collection sessions with beneficiary groups are
provided in Tables 4 and 5. The sample draws upon existing spatial data on UNICEF programme
implementation within each zoba and sub-zoba (see Annex C). The evaluator analysed this data
to identify high and low touch-point sub-zobas and consulted with UNICEF staff members and the
local evaluation team to identify the final sample. The objective was to include a strategic and
representative sample of programme beneficiaries from high touch-point and low touch-point
communities to draw qualitative conclusions about the outcomes of programme convergence.
The criteria for inclusion in the participatory data collection sessions included: (1) number of
UNICEF supported interventions; and (2) number of sectors represented; (3) priority UNICEF
regions/zobas; and (4) number of parents/adolescents targeted. The local evaluation team was
also given criteria for gender and age ratios and was required to ensure relevant ethnic groups
from the selected communities were represented adequately. These criteria were met and
ensured the sample was representative of the communities under investigation.
Within the sampled communities, UNICEF’s work in CSD interventions included: Integrated
Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (IMNCI), Integrated Management of Acute
Malnutrition (IMAM), Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF), maternal and newborn health
(MNH), vitamin A supplementation, blanket supplementary feeding, immunization, sanitation,
hygiene, water supply, C4D health promotion, early learning education (ECE) and the Care for
Child Development (CCD) package [or Early Childhood Development (ECD) parenting
programme]. The main difference between the two types of sub-zoba for CSD programming was
the inclusion in the high touch-point sub-zobas of WASH and the CCD package, both of which
were absent in the low touch-point sub-zobas (see Table 4).
Within the BECPP programming component, interventions included: school construction, female
genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), mine risk education, promotion of child rights, and youth
development and engagement. The main difference between the two types of sub-zoba was the
inclusion in the high touch-point sub-zobas of FGM/C sensitization, promotion of child rights and
youth development and engagement, all of which were absent in the low touch-point sub-zobas
(see Table 5).

3.5. Methodological Limitations and Mitigation
There were two methodological limitations that should be considered when reviewing the
proposed evaluation approach. First, the evaluation relied heavily on remote methods for the
engagement of UNICEF staff members and partners. This potential limitation was due to COVID-
19 mobility restrictions that prevented an international evaluation consultant from travelling to
Eritrea. Thus, the evaluator was not able to meet with stakeholders in person or observe
programming within the context of its implementation. Such observations often provide additional
nuances and insights into the assets and challenges of programme managers and specialists. In
addition, given the lack of a signed work plan during the evaluation time period, UN partners and
national Government representatives were not able to comment on the evaluation questions. To
mitigate this issue, the evaluation adopted a participatory evaluation design with a local evaluation
team so that beneficiaries could share their views and experiences of UNICEF programming
through safe, interactive methods within their own schools or communities.
Second, as described in the Terms of Reference (see Annex A) and in conversations with UNICEF
Country Office stakeholders, there was a limited amount of recent national data on the situation
of children and adolescents. Most of the data that demonstrated the effectiveness of UNICEF
programming dates back to 2010 or 2015, and 2021 data are not yet available. To mitigate this
issue, the UNICEF Country Office conducted a situation analysis in 2019, which provided some
updated information to inform evaluative judgements. However, the data are often not sufficiently
disaggregated by sex and sub-zoba, and thus, it was sometimes difficult to assess the results
associated with gender equality and programme convergence. To mitigate this issue, the
evaluation design included participatory data collection sessions with beneficiaries, and also drew
33
upon the perceptions of UNICEF staff members, service providers, and local programme
managers on the most significant changes. This may introduce bias into the evaluation, which
was mitigated by drawing upon multiple data sources to triangulate the results and to make
informed evaluative judgements.
3.6. Quality Assurance and Ethical Considerations
Ethical guidelines for UN evaluations and the UNICEF procedure for ethical standards in
research, evaluation, data collection and analysis guided the overall process. The evaluation
adhered to the following UN and UNICEF norms and standards: United Nations Evaluation Group
Standards for Evaluation in the UN System, United Nations Evaluation Group Norms for
Evaluation in the UN System, UNICEF-adapted evaluation report standards and the Global
Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS).
Given the evaluation worked directly with parents and adolescents, their rights, confidentiality and
compensation for participation were addressed with UNICEF support. The protocols for
participatory data collection sessions were submitted to and approved by an ethical review board
with the appropriate credentials to review the methodology and tools for the ethical inclusion of
human subjects in evaluation (see Annex C). This was accomplished with support from the
UNICEF Evaluation Office in the New York headquarters.
Informed consent was obtained from parents of adolescents, adolescents, parents, service
providers and local programme managers. Oral narratives about the purpose and uses of the data
being collected, the benefits to participation and the potential risks of participation were clearly
articulated to programme beneficiaries. Participants then had an opportunity to opt-in to the
session or to decide that they would not participate without any harm or risk. In the case of
adolescents, this information was shared in child-friendly and developmentally appropriate
language.
No names or identifiable personal information were required of participants for the evaluation.
Participants received a mask, hand sanitizer, breakfast/lunch and a small gift, which was both for
their time and to show appreciation for their participation in the evaluation. Additional measures
were taken to ensure all data collection activities were safe and followed COVID-19 protocols
(namely social distancing, mask wearing and the use of hand sanitizer). All ethical considerations
were discussed with the local evaluation team to ensure the evaluation upheld these standards
and principles in practice. As mentioned previously, the international evaluator was in regular
contact with the supervisor of the local evaluation team for quality assurance purposes.

Section D: Evaluation Findings
The findings are presented by evaluation criteria and reflect the triangulation of data. This means
that different stakeholder views and data sources have been analysed together to understand
common narratives, and were not put together by chance. Readers can be assured that the
information is suitable for decision making purposes, as well as for organization learning and
accountability.
4.1. Relevance
 EQ1 | Relevance | Is the Country Programme doing the right things?
The CPE assessed the extent to which the objectives of the Country Programme and its design
were and remain appropriate within the country context. This included an analysis of whether
UNICEF’s approach towards reaching its objectives was suitable considering its mandate,
resource base, comparative advantages and operational considerations. The evaluation also
examined whether UNICEF identified the most relevant goals or strategies to solve programmatic
challenges, and whether these were equity focused and gender responsive.
1.1. What were UNICEF’s strengths in the country from 2017 to 2021, particularly in
comparison to other UN agencies and development partners, and how were these
harnessed to help achieve results?
Finding 1: UNICEF’s primary strengths or comparative advantages in the country were
associated with its positioning as a leader and influencer as one of the largest UN agencies
operating in Eritrea for decades. The organization provides financial and technical contributions
for policy and systems strengthening, is the lead agency in delivering multisectoral programming
for children and adolescents and is considered a trusted and valued government partner.
UNICEF is one of the largest UN agencies operating in Eritrea, which has positioned the
organization as a leader and influencer within the country. For example, the organization
contributed to six out of eight outcomes for the SPCF (2017–2021), because children are
implicated in all four national development pillars. UNICEF is also the only UN agency focused
on education outcomes, so the organization is very visible in shaping these policies and action
plans on a national level. Finally, UNICEF is the only organization that works across all sectors
for children in the country, and thus, it has positioned the organization as a strong leader and
advocate of multisectoral programming.
UNICEF managed 25 per cent of the UN portfolio, equating to US$81.5 million (see Figure 3).
This represents a decrease in the percentage of funding share for UNICEF from the SPCF (2013–
2016), in which the organization managed 43 per cent of the portfolio. The United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) now has the highest funding share, with 43 per cent of the
budget for the portfolio, equating to US$142.9 million. This represents an increase in the
percentage of funding share for UNDP from the SPCF (2013–2016), in which it managed 32 per
cent of the portfolio. Thus, UNDP and UNICEF are the main actors within the country, but their
35
overall financial positioning changed during the evaluation time period for the Country
Programme.

UNICEF’s technical contributions for policy and system strengthening have been substantial
during the implementation of the Country Programme. A total of 14 policy documents, strategic
frameworks, plans and studies were prepared from 2017–2021, which is a remarkable
achievement given the office size and complexities of the operating environment (see Table 6). A
majority of the policy and system strengthening documents addressed the education sector, and
in particular, UNICEF’s commitment to out-of-school children and early childhood education.
Within this sector, there was a clear and logical pathway from evidence generation to sector plans
and to frameworks for implementation. Evidence-based planning also took place in the child
protection and health sectors in the preparation of a study and then a plan on FGM and child
marriage. The nutrition and early childhood education documents are multisectoral in nature,
reflecting UNICEF’s advocacy to ensure holistic nurturing care, child survival and development.
The C4D, child protection and social protection documents are also multisectoral in nature,
reflecting UNICEF’s advocacy to integrate programming for adolescent development, health and
well-being, especially for girls.

Another comparative advantage of UNICEF was its strong partnership with the GoSE. Based
upon decades of relationship building, evidence-based advocacy and effective programme
implementation, UNICEF is considered a trusted and valued partner of national ministries and
unions. UNICEF’s apolitical mandate to serve children has provided the organization with
leverage in relationship building with the Government. UNICEF’s national staff members have
had a pivotal role in maintaining these relationships over the long-term through successive
Country Programme transitions. In a complementary way, UNICEF’s international staff members
have brought in global dialogue and evidence to slowly and thoughtfully encourage uptake of new
agendas by the Government.
For example, UNICEF’s partnerships with the Ministry of Information and NUYSE have been
crucial for advancing the BECPP programming component. These partnerships have enabled
UNICEF to implement social and behaviour change communication campaigns on FGM and child
marriage, as well as adolescent participation and child rights awareness programming at scale
within communities, and with limited financial resources. This is because NUYSE has grassroots
coordination and membership structures at the national, regional, district and community levels.
UNICEF’s transparency and ability to adjust its programming based upon the views of NUYSE
and the other Government stakeholders has also been pivotal for relationship and trust building.
For example, the Country Programme was informed by the views of adolescents, who helped
UNICEF determine priorities and actions for change through numerous consultations and
workshops in communities across the country.
37
1.2. Were UNICEF’s strategies to address equity and gender mainstreaming in line with
local needs and at an appropriate scale of implementation to reach the most
marginalized?
Finding 2: UNICEF’s strategies for addressing equity and gender mainstreaming appropriately
targeted the needs of the local population. However, it was not possible to determine if an
appropriate scale of implementation was reached with the most marginalized due to a lack of data
disaggregated by age and sex on the child, adolescent and parent populations in each zoba. The
available data suggests Southern Red Sea requires further investment by the Country Office to
address child equity and gender equality within this region.
UNICEF’s Equity Approach
UNICEF employed three approaches for addressing equity in the Country Programme: (1)
multisectoral programming, or programme convergence in the four zobas with the highest level
of need; (2) humanitarian support to children affected by climate change and the residual effects
of war; and (3) targeted support to vulnerable child groups, such as children with disabilities.
As outlined in the CPD, UNICEF’s primary strategy for addressing equity was through
multisectoral programming (programme convergence) in four zobas with the poorest child
development outcomes. These zobas include: Anseba, Gash Barka, Northern Red Sea and
Southern Red Sea. The assumption was that by integrating programming in these regions,
UNICEF could accelerate results for the children and adolescents who need it the most.
Statistics on the situation of children at the zoba level were limited prior to the current Country
Programme, but the sample of available data indicated a high level of need within these regions
(see Table 7). For example, the percentages of children underweight and pre-primary children
not attending schools was highest within these zobas. The situation of children was the poorest
overall in Gash Barka, with more than 50 per cent of children underweight, while 90 per cent of
pre-primary children and nearly 30 per cent of lower secondary children were out of school, and
40 per cent of the population believed that their community wanted to continue FGM/C.

Data on programme implementation indicates UNICEF implemented 680 programming
interventions, including 558 for the CSD programming component and 122 for the BECPP
programming component (see Table 8 and Figure 4). The highest number of interventions were
concentrated in Gash Barka, with 185 interventions, the zoba with the highest level of need. The
second highest number of interventions was found in Northern Red Sea, with 132 interventions.
Southern Red Sea received the fewest number of interventions (only 57), even though this region
was identified as a UNICEF priority. While this finding may be attributed to the lower population
density in Southern Red Sea, it does indicate less investment by the organization for children and
adolescents within this region. On the other hand, Debub, while not a priority UNICEF region,
received the third highest number of interventions.

UNICEF’s programming targeted approximately 4.2 million beneficiaries, primarily through the
CSD programming component (see Figure 5). UNICEF targeted the largest number of
beneficiaries in Debub, even though this was not a priority region, and the fewest in Southern Red
Sea, which was a priority region. Therefore, the data indicates a spatial mismatch in the approach
for addressing equity and the targeted population as it applied to Debub and Southern Red Sea.
Because there are no current statistics available on the child, adolescent and parent population
at the zoba level, it was not possible to determine the overall percentage of the population reached
through UNICEF-supported programming. Moreover, data on UNICEF programming, while
available at the sub-zoba level, could not be analysed for reach at this level of disaggregation
given a lack of population data on the targeted beneficiaries (see Annex E, Tables 15 and 16).

A parallel strategy of the Country Programme for addressing issues of equity was through
UNICEF’s targeted humanitarian support for children and families. In particular, UNICEF
partnered with the GoSE in delivering multisectoral programming to children in drought-prone
nomadic and semi-nomadic communities with a high prevalence of severe acute malnutrition and
risks of injury from mines left over from the war. Available data from 2018 to 2021 indicates that
an estimated 5.81 million children were targeted for life-saving interventions with UNICEF support,
and 2.97 million children were reached (see Figure 6).
During the overall time period of the Country Programme, UNICEF only reached 51 per cent of
its targeted populations. However, the organization exceeded its targets in 2018 and 2020, and
WASH exceeded its overall target by 133,231 children and families. UNICEF’s humanitarian
support for all sectors increased over time to address the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021,
with the exception of education interventions, which progressively declined until 2021. This was
largely due to COVID-19 mobility restrictions and the lack of a signed work plan between UNICEF
and the GoSE. Social protection interventions were added in 2020 to UNICEF’s portfolio of
response interventions, given the renewed collaboration between the UN and the GoSE, and C4D
40
interventions were added in 2021 to improve hygiene and health awareness, among other social
and behaviour change initiatives.
A third strategy of the Country Programme for addressing equity was targeted support for the
Government to address the needs of vulnerable groups of children through education and social
protection interventions, such as children with disabilities and children with HIV/AIDS. According
to the 2010 National Health Survey, five percent of overall households in Eritrea included a person
with a disability. In 2015–2016, education sector data indicated 8,650 children had various levels
and types of impairments, of whom girls made up 44.2 per cent. UNICEF has supported
government efforts to integrate children with developmental disabilities into mainstream schools,
in a self-contained special classroom. However, there is no data to indicate if these interventions
have reached those in need, and the 2019 Situation Analysis indicated that remote and rural
communities were excluded.

In the area of social protection, the Country Programme worked with the Ministry of Labour and
Social Welfare to provide 6,100 vulnerable children and families with cash transfers to support
their livelihood, health and education (UNICEF Spatial Data). This programme was implemented

UNICEF supported 5,070 children with disabilities through a community-based rehabilitation
programme, designed to support children/persons with disabilities. This was focused on
psychosocial support, physical rehabilitation, socio-economic reintegration and referral services
for various social services. While the programme attained 80 per cent national coverage, UNICEF
concentrated its follow-up implementation in the zobas of Gash Barka and Northern Red Sea.
UNICEF’s Approach to Gender Mainstreaming
Five main issues for greater gender equality were identified and addressed through the Country
Programme: (1) FGM/C; (2) child marriage; (3) menstrual hygiene management (MHM); (4) girls’
education; and (5) the participation of girls and women.
UNICEF’s approach to gender mainstreaming included three primary strategies: (1) capacity
development to strengthen institutions and systems for greater gender equality; (2)
communication for development to address harmful social and gender norms; and (3) child and
youth participation, especially for adolescent girls. All three strategies were relevant for advancing
gender equality in the country, although data gaps remain to fully understand if the reach and
scale of programming was adequate for the targeted populations.
In terms of capacity development, UNICEF was a key technical partner in developing the Eritrean
National Strategic Plan to Ensure Children and Women Rights, Abandon Female Genital
Mutilation, Underage Marriage and Other Harmful Traditional Practices (2020–2024). This
strategy guides all programming efforts for adolescent girls and women in the country by the
Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, the Ministry of Health and NUEW. The strategy was based
on a social-ecological approach to child development that considered traditions, norms, beliefs,
social and economic systems and risk factors that hinder a conducive environment for supporting
the rights of girls and women. The strategy includes three priority actions, which were well aligned
with the Country Programme and with SPCF goal 5, to achieve gender quality and empower all
women and girls:
 Priority Action 1: Capacity building and institutional strengthening, including child and
women protection system strengthening, generation and use of evidence and data for
improved programming.
 Priority Action 2: Community mapping, sensitization and mobilization to transform
social and gender norms that lead to collective and public decisions.
 Priority Action 3: Service provisions including life skills education and parenting skills
for FGM and child marriage prevention, protection and care.
For priority action 1, the Country Programme recognized that there was limited government-
approved data disaggregated by age and gender, which is a major constraint for gender-
responsive programming in Eritrea. Thus, as part of the PE component, there was an effort by
UNICEF to strengthen national capacities and systems to collect timely, disaggregated and
gender responsive data. In parallel, UNICEF aimed to have gender-specific outputs for the
Country Programme that focus on monitoring issues relevant to adolescent girls, especially girl
friendly services and adolescent friendly services. The target for 2021 was that 80 per cent of
UNICEF outputs have a gender equality marker rated at 3 (significant), up from a baseline of 78
42
per cent in 2015. However, at the time of writing this evaluation, there was no evidence to indicate
if this target was achieved.
For priority actions 2 and 3, the primary strategy for improving social and gender norms was
through C4D platforms and awareness raising campaigns with community members. Trough the
BECPP programming component, the Country Programme aimed to enhance the capacities and
knowledge of institutions, communities, teachers and social workers from disadvantaged areas
to reject the practices of FGM, child marriage and violence against children, and to support
children and adolescents’ participation in school and community-based activities. An estimated
355,280 community members were reached through FGM sensitization activities in Anseba,
Debub and Northern Red Sea. However, there is no data on the number of females versus males
who were targeted for these interventions in relation to the population. Thus, it was not possible
to determine if these interventions were at an appropriate scale of implementation or reach.
For priority 3, the Country Programme has also championed the participation of adolescent
girls and women through its programming in collaboration with NUYSE and NUEW, as a basis
for developing positive parenting skills and adolescent life skills, as well as encouraging
attendance and retention in school. UNICEF has been the leader in advancing service provision
for menstrual hygiene management in schools, by supporting the Ministry of Education to include
it in the national curriculum and through the promotion of gender-separate toilets in schools.
UNICEF has also worked collaboratively with NUYSE to enhance enrolment and participation of
girls in education, the provision of material and financial incentives to school girls, constructing
gender segregated toilets and opening boarding and para-boarding schools. However, there is
no data on the number of females versus males who were targeted for these interventions in
relation to the population. Thus, it was not possible to determine if these interventions were at an
appropriate scale of implementation or reach.
1.3. To what extent has UNICEF been able to position itself as a strategic partner in the
country context, including adjusting to changing situations?
Finding 3: UNICEF was well positioned as a strategic partner with Government, but there is a
need for strengthened collaboration with some UN agencies, especially in the area of adolescent
participation.
As mentioned in the findings for EQ 1.1., UNICEF has strong partnerships with GoSE at the
national, zoba, sub-zoba and district levels. These partnerships have positioned UNICEF as a
knowledge broker and technical expert that have led to positive results for policy and system
strengthening. UNICEF has remained nimble and agile in its work with the Government, both in
development and humanitarian programming. However, the national Government has not
participated in the evaluation, most likely due to the lack of a signed work plan, and thus their
views about UNICEF are not currently known.
UNICEF also works closely with other UN agencies to deliver its mandate in relation to the SPCF.
However, at the time of writing this draft report, no UN agency representatives agreed to
participate in the evaluation. Thus, the views of UN representatives towards UNICEF are currently
unknown. However, there is evidence that the relationship and collaboration between UNICEF,
UNFPA and UNDP could be improved, especially in programming associated with adolescent
and youth participation where there is substantial overlap in mandates.
43
1.4. What adjustments were made to UNICEF’s strategies in response to programme
monitoring and/or changes in the operational context, and how effective were these
modifications?
Finding 4: Delays in having a signed work plan, prolonged droughts and the COVID-19 pandemic
greatly affected programme implementation and slowed progress on achieving results for children
during the evaluation time period. However, UNICEF did its best to work around the constraints
faced in the operating environment, by adjusting its strategies and programming approaches.
There were three major factors that changed the operating context during the implementation of
the Country Programme. First, there were substantial delays in the Government’s approval of the
annual work plan, which greatly affected UNICEF’s ability to implement and monitor programming
due to travel and work restrictions. Many UNICEF-supported programmes were delayed or put
on hold as a result of this situation, which slowed progress on achieving results for children.
UNICEF has remained agile and flexible under these circumstances, by taking advantage of
opportunities to work with the Government in creative ways, such as through the hiring of
contractors to carry out monitoring with local programme managers. However, local programme
managers expressed the need for continued UNICEF support, and noted that many of the
incentives provided by the organization were terminated during the Country Programme.22 They
observed negative consequences from termination, such as a reduction in school attendance.
Thus, the absence of a signed work plan has reputational risks for UNICEF at the community
level.
The second major factor affecting the operating context during the Country Programme was
climate change, and the prolonged droughts it brought about. A majority of the population live in
semi-arid environments in which 65 per cent rely upon agriculture for income, and 11 per cent are
pastoralists who are mobile. Droughts contribute to nutrition issues for children, as well as
diseases such as cholera. UNICEF’s C4D strategy has been instrumental in raising health and
hygiene awareness, and in contributing to highly successful immunization campaigns.
The third major factor was the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which also created travel and
work restrictions. Decisions had to be made about how to continue delivering the most salient and
essential programming. For example, UNICEF adjusted its CSD programming by distributing
materials to parents on how to protect themselves and their children from COVID-19 instead of
meeting face-to-face in parenting programmes. The materials described ways for parents to
provide early stimulation and responsive care with their children to support a return to normalcy
and to reduce toxic stress.
Other adjustments were successfully implemented with Government partners at the zoba and
sub-zoba levels for nutrition interventions, such as the expanded procurement and provision of
ready-to-use therapeutic foods, which covered a longer period of time. While initially health
facilities were closed, UNICEF was on the frontline to support the Government in expanding
health services, as well as WASH interventions. UNICEF provided health workers with operational
guidance and standardized procedures for emergency response, and also established community
feedback mechanisms with the Government to address rumours and misinformation about
COVID-19.
22 For example, local programme managers requested that UNICEF’s incentives for girls’ education,
transportation for remote children to access school and the provision of education materials be restored.

4.2. Coherence
 EQ2 | Coherence | How well does the Country Programme fit?
The CPE assessed the overall logic of the Country Programme theory of change, as well as its
consistency with key UNICEF strategies and international commitments, including gender
equality and women’s empowerment, equity for children and the human rights-based approach.
It also examined UNICEF’s coordination and convening role within the UN, with government
sectors, and with donors in Eritrea.
2.1. To what extent have the Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action
(CCCs) and UNICEF’s Gender Action Plans (GAPs) been consistently integrated
into all aspects of programming and implementation, including in the Programme
Strategy Notes, related theories of change and results frameworks?
Finding 5: The Core Commitments for Children have been marginally integrated into the
Programme Strategy Notes, theories of change and results frameworks. Thus, the overall Country
Programme was not risk informed, and the connection between development and humanitarian
programming was weak. The Country Programme has done a better job at integrating the Gender
Action Plan into its programming strategies, but gaps remain in the theories of change and results
frameworks.
Five out of 13 dimensions of the GAP were aligned with the CSD PSN and the theory of change,
including 3 gender mainstreaming approaches and 2 targeted programming interventions in
Strategic Plan (SP) Goals 1 and 4 (see Table 9). Only 1 of these dimensions had a key progress
indicator, which was related access to menstrual hygiene and management in school
programmes (and excluded health facilities). The theory of change for CSD programming is not
gender-responsive. None of the key progress indicators for CSD included gender targets in the
PSN, there are only generalized baselines and targets. Thus, the Country Programme was
marginally aligned with the GAP as it applied to CSD programme strategies, the theory of change
and results framework.
Nine out of 13 dimensions of the GAP were aligned with the BECPP PSN and theory of change,
including 5 gender mainstreaming approaches and 4 targeted programming interventions in
Strategic Plan Goals 1 through 4 (see Table 9). The BECPP theory of change has a targeted
gender output: By 2021, community members and their leaders have committed collectively to
abandon FGM, child marriage and violence against children. However, only 3 out of 32 key
progress indicators for BECPP included gender targets, including: primary school age out-of-
school children rate (percentage; by gender); percentage of girls 0–14 years old who have
undergone FGM (as reported by their mothers); and the availability of a costed national
plan/strategy on child marriage, to be implemented with a budget. Thus, the Country Programme
was well aligned with the GAP as it applied to BECPP programme strategies and the theory of
change, but gaps remain in the results framework.

The PE component of the Country Programme focused on gender mainstreaming as a cross-
sectoral approach, and has an output associated with this approach in its results framework. This
output was: strategies to address cross-cutting issues related to children’s rights are developed
and applied. In the case of gender, the PE component was focused on the integration of CSD and
BECPP programming to ensure they contributed to greater gender equality. This was measured
by the percentage of outputs with gender equality markers rated significant, with a target of 50
per cent of the Country Programme outputs. Given there were so few gender responsive or
disaggregated indicators, this key progress indicator is only meaningful for a limited number of
programme interventions, rather than for assessing overall programme effectiveness on cross-
cutting issues of gender equality.
The CCCs (2020) were marginally mentioned or aligned with the PSNs, theory of change and
results framework for the Country Programme. The CSD programming component identified
humanitarian crisis as a risk in its PSN and theory of change, for overwhelming the capacity of
the child health system, and for requiring the scaling of services if it occurred. The BECPP
programming component does not mention humanitarian support at all. This finding may be
related to the sensitive relationship between UNICEF and the GoSE as it applies to humanitarian
support.
However, within the PE component and UNICEF’s Humanitarian Action Appeals for Eritrea during
the period from 2018 to 2021, it was clear that the Country Programme was aligned with the
CCCs. UNICEF’s primary approach for humanitarian programming was programme convergence
46
in the delivery of life saving interventions in remote and affected regions within the country, as
outlined in the previous section. Another key strategy has been community participation, including
a focus on the participation of women and girls. The assumption was that community
empowerment promotes resilience to shocks, although there was evidence that a reliance on
community volunteers has limitations for sustainability. The PE PSN, theory of change and results
framework included humanitarian programming as a cross-cutting output with two key progress
measures. However, the integration of development and humanitarian programming was not
sufficiently reflected across the Country Programme programming components.
2.2. What roles and contributions did the Government, UN agencies and other national
actors have in UNICEF’s approach to programme convergence, and how well were
these activities coordinated?
Finding 6: UNICEF had a lead role in contributing to the Eritrea SPCF (2017–2021) for three
outcome areas associated with WASH, education and child/social protection. While the common
agenda and coordinating structures were clearly identified, the effectiveness of UNICEF’s
leadership towards collective impact in these outcome areas is not currently known. The Country
Programme benefited from decentralized coordination structures through the national unions,
which have representatives that serve on committees to implement joint programming at the
national, zoba, sub-zoba and community levels.
The common agenda (or shared vision for change) for UN agencies working in Eritrea was
outlined in the SPCF (2017–2021), and shaped by the vision of the GoSE, as stated in the Macro-
Policy Paper (MPP) and the Charter of the People’s Front for Democracy and Justice. This
common agenda was, “to achieve rapid, balanced, home grown and sustainable economic growth
with social equity and justice, anchored on the principle of self-reliance.” The same vision was
further reinforced in the Eritrea National Indicative Development Plan 2014–2018.
This vision was organized into four integrated pillars and eight outcome areas in the SPCF (2017–
2021) (see Table 10). UNICEF was the lead UN agency for three out of the eight outcomes (for
WASH, education and child/social protection), and contributed to all other outcomes with the
exception of outcomes four and six.23 In this regard, UNICEF played a key role in providing the
backbone function for the collective impact of Pillars 1 and 4, by providing coordination and
leadership for the delivery of basic social services and inclusive growth through programme
convergence. However, because no UN representatives have contributed their views for the
evaluation, it is not possible to determine if UNICEF effectively facilitated continuous
communication across the agencies to build trust, or to transparently confirm that mutual
objectives were being met.

According to the SPCF (2017–2021), UNICEF’s main partners from the GoSE in the delivery of
the Country Programme included: the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry
of Labour and Human Welfare. UNICEF’s main partners from UN agencies included UNHCR and
FAO. For CSD programming, UNICEF’s main partners were WHO and UNFPA; for BECCP
programming, UNICEF’s main partners were UNFPA and UNDP. As mentioned previously, there
is evidence that the partnership between UNICEF, UNDP and UNFPA could be strengthened,
especially as it applies to common mandates around the participation of adolescents and women.
For the Country Programme, the GoSE is considered by UNICEF staff members to be the owner
of the programming, and provides direction to the organization on priorities, gaps and strategies.
48
UNICEF supports the government agenda and also brings a global perspective to the
conversation. At the national level, coordination among the GoSE and UNICEF was often strained
during the evaluation time period due to a lack of a signed work plan.
At the zoba, sub-zoba and community levels, coordination among the GoSE and UNICEF was
implemented through committees that are comprised of representatives from line ministries and
national unions. UNICEF staff members stressed that their partnerships with the NUYSE and
NUEW were instrumental in being able to deliver programming from the national to grassroots
level. This is because both unions have accountability for coordination and implementation at the
decentralized levels, as outlined in several national policies.24
However, local programme managers (representatives of the GoSE and national unions)
indicated that coordination could still be improved, especially as it applied to time management.
In particular, the schedule for the delivery of more than one intervention was often not clearly
articulated in advance, or was done in a rushed manner.
2.3. Did UNICEF’s approach to addressing the challenges of equity and gender equality
play a complementary role to that of Government, UN agencies and other
development actors?
Finding 7: UNICEF’s programming to address equity and gender equality integrated the vision of
the GoSE and community members to address priority issues in the country. Mutually reinforcing
activities were identified and implemented through a complementary life course approach by
UNICEF and its UN partners. However, the conceptual framework for adolescent development
was not clearly developed, nor were there any synergistic measures for collective impact in the
Country Programme. The conceptual framework for early childhood development was clear and
included synergistic measures. However, these measures were not integrated into the Country
Programme results structure, so there was no accountability to track collective impact for CSD
programming.
As outlined previously in section 4.1., for evaluation sub-question 1.2., UNICEF’s approach for
addressing challenges of equity and gender equality complemented national government policies
on FGM and child marriage, girls’ education, adolescent participation and gender-responsive
WASH interventions. UNICEF’s main UN partner for delivering on gender equality was UNFPA,
who had a mutually reinforcing role in adolescent and women empowerment through life skills
education and capacity development. The SPCF (2017–2021) provided a shared measurement
framework for all UN agencies in support of equity and gender equality. Four outcomes and 12
indicators explicitly addressed gender equality and/or sex disaggregation within this results
structure. Thus, it is technically possible to assess the collective impact of UN agencies on gender
equality, although an evaluation was not yet available at the time of writing this report.
The BECPP component of the Country Programme was informed through consultations with
NUYSE and adolescents, who considered gender equality as one of four main priorities for
UNICEF to address, alongside school safety, child/youth participation and environmental
protection. During the evaluation time period, NUYSE implemented its own interventions to
24 For example, the NUEW has 300,444 members and, through its offices in six regions, 67 sub-regions and 2,700
communities, it has engaged in the Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) COVID-19 response
platforms. The NUEW’s extensive grassroots presence throughout Eritrea, substantial outreach capacity and
organizational structure helped Eritrean women and girls to fully engage in the COVID-19 response.
49
address gender equality, including conducting seminars and developing media about adolescent-
related issues, as well as by sensitizing communities on the equal treatment of girls and boys.
Joint actions between NUYSE and UNICEF were considered effective by NUYSE
representatives, and included special training on FGM and child marriage, as well as the creation
of national innovation hubs or youth centres that focused on life skills development. However,
there was no conceptual framework for adolescent development that articulated how this
programming fit together in the Country Programme. Similarly, there were no synergistic
measures to examine the collective impact of this work in the Country Programme, only sector-
based indicators.
The CSD component of the Country Programme was informed by issues of equity in the provision
of basic social services and in health outcomes for mothers and children. The Eritrea Country
Office ECD Framework provides conceptual and practical tools for designing and implementing
mutually reinforcing activities to promote optimal early childhood development. In particular, the
Nurturing Care Framework was utilized to articulate the core components of ECD (good health,
adequate nutrition, security and safety, opportunities for early learning and responsive
caregiving). This framework includes all of the CSD programming components, in addition to a
new responsive caregiving component (parenting programmes). In addition, the document
provides synergistic measures for analysing the collective impact of UNICEF-supported
programming for CSD, including the percentage of children who receive stimulation and
responsive caregiving from their parents/caregivers. However, these synergistic measures were
not integrated into the Country Programme results structure, which was a missed opportunity for
demonstrating the collective impact of UNICEF’s work in early childhood. Instead, sector-based
indicators remained the sole source for reporting results in the Country Programme.
4.3. Effectiveness
 EQ3 | Effectiveness | Did the Country Programme achieve its objectives?
The CPE examined the extent to which the Country Programme achieved (or was likely to
achieve) its intended objectives. For strategic reasons, the CPE focused upon the extent to which
the Country Programme results were gender responsive/transformative and demonstrated a
reasonable contribution at the outcome levels, including any differential results across groups as
a result of programme convergence. Positive and negative, direct and indirect and unintended
results were identified, as well as the contribution of all UNICEF to the development of these
results.
3.1. Did the Country Programme contribute to the reduction of inequities and exclusion
and progress towards the achievement of greater gender equality?
Finding 8: Overall, there was limited recent data on the results achieved for gender equality
through the contributions of the Country Programme. On a national level, there was evidence that
the Country Programme contributed to a reduction in FGM. On a community level, consultations
with programme beneficiaries on their community conditions indicated the perceptions of girls and
women were slightly more favourable than boys and males in the sampled locations. This finding
indicates progress in the achievement of gender equality on the selected indicators, although
additional studies should be conducted to include a wider sample of beneficiaries in the analysis.
50
The Country Programme aimed to achieve the following gender equality targets: (1) decrease the
percentage of women aged 20 to 49 who were married before age 18 from 41 per cent in 2010 to
30 per cent in 2020; (2) decrease the percentage of girls aged 0 to 14 who have undergone FGM
from 33 per cent in 2010 to 20 per cent in 2021; and (3) raise the percentage of outputs with a
gender equality marker rate at 3 (significant) from a baseline of 78 per cent in 2015 to 80 per cent
in 2021. Given a lack of disaggregated data, and a lack of recent data (in general) for the reporting
time period, it was difficult to assess the results achieved for gender equality through the Country
Programme.
However, a 2018 government study provided evidence of a substantial reduction in FGM at the
onset of the Country Programme. The percentage of girls under 15 who experienced FGM
declined from 33.2 per cent in 2010 to 3.8 per cent in 2018. Thus, the Country Programme
exceeded its target on FGM by almost 17 percentage points. The percentage of girls under 5 who
experienced FGM declined from 12.4 per cent in 2010 to 1.1 per cent in 2018. This result, while
not being tracked through the Country Programme, exceeded the government target, set at 10
per cent for 2024.25
These findings are a remarkable achievement, and are a testament to the high level of
government ownership and community participation in the process of achieving results. They also
reflect contributions from Country Programme strategies, including child/adolescent participation
and C4D campaigns to raise awareness about these issues in a culturally appropriate manner.
However, UNICEF should not ease up on its C4D strategies against FGM and child marriage
(namely participatory approaches and dialogue and skills building with communities), as local
programme managers indicated some remote sub-zobas are slipping back to these traditional
practices; continuous sensitization is required.
On a community level, the perceptions of females and males about community conditions for
parents and young children were similar, indicating positive results for gender equality in the
sampled communities. Females had slightly higher community scorecards on 9 out of 10
indicators for CSD programming, indicating mothers and female service providers were overall
more positive about their community conditions when compared to fathers and male service
providers (see Figure 7). The biggest gender difference was found in young children’s
participation in early childhood education opportunities, favouring females (7.79 for females vs.
6.53 for males, or +1.26 difference) (see Figure 7 and Annex E, Table 17).
Overall, the perceptions of females and males about community conditions for adolescents
were largely the same, indicating positive results for gender equality in the sampled communities.
Females had slightly higher community scorecards on 5 out of 10 indicators for BECPP
programming (awareness of children’s rights, participation opportunities, career and college
readiness, psychosocial support and gender-friendly WASH in schools) (see Figure 8). Males had
slightly higher community scorecards on 5 out of 10 indicators for BECPP programming (school
attendance, community safety, gender equality, specialized programmes for girls and boys and
hygiene and health awareness). The biggest gender difference among females and males was
found in career and college readiness, favouring females (6.47 for females vs. 5.31 for males,
+1.16 difference) and gender-friendly WASH in schools (6.75 for females vs. 5.31 for males, +1.44
difference) (see Figure 8 and Annex E, Table 20).
25 The target for under five was set at 10 per cent, as outlined in the Eritrean National Strategic Plan to
Ensure Children and Women Rights, Abandon Female Genital Mutilation, Underage Marriage and Other
Harmful Traditional Practices (2020–2024).

3.2. What results have been achieved by UNICEF through programme convergence, and
at what levels of change (e.g., national, zoba, sub-zoba or community)?
Finding 9: On a national level, the Country Programme has contributed to national policies, plans
and strategies that reflect the importance of multisectoral programming, especially in convergence
with WASH, education, health, nutrition and social protection interventions. On a regional level,
the Country Programme effectively implemented six sectoral interventions within each zoba;
however, gaps remain in the scale of coverage for Southern Red Sea. On a community level, the
Country Programme achieved stronger results for girls and women through programme
convergence, when compared to boys and men in the sampled communities.
On a national level, the Country Programme has contributed to the development of multisectoral
policies, strategies and plans (see section 4.1). For instance, the National Strategy and
Implementation Framework for Out-of-School Children articulated objectives for integrating
education, social protection and nutrition interventions to encourage more vulnerable children to
attend school. The National Strategy for Accelerated Scale-Up of High Impact Nutrition identified
programme linkages with WASH, education, and social protection. Similarly, the Eritrean National
Strategic Plan to Ensure Children and Women Rights, Abandon Female Genital Mutilation,
53
Underage Marriage and Other Harmful Traditional Practices identifies linkages between
education, WASH and social protection.
On a regional level, the Country Programme has achieved a high level of programme
convergence for CSD programming, with six sectoral interventions implemented in each zoba
(see Figure 9 and Table 11).26

About one-third of the interventions were from the health sector (33 per cent), or nutrition sector
(31 per cent) (see Figure 10). Social protection interventions focused on vulnerable children and
families in remote areas represented only 4 per cent of the programming across the zobas. Gash

Programme convergence was not as advanced for the BECPP programming component, with
only three sector-based interventions delivered in education, child protection and C4D (see Figure
11 and Table 12). A majority of the UNICEF-supported interventions (59 per cent) were delivered
through C4D programming, which included community sensitization on gender equality,
protection and participation (see Figure 12). Gash Barka and Northern Red Sea had the highest
number of interventions (N=29 and 28, respectively). Southern Red Sea had the fewest number
of interventions (N=13), indicating a gap in coverage for this priority zoba.

Community Results for CSD Programme Convergence
The Country Programme has contributed to positive results for parents and children ages 0–6
years, particularly in the areas of immunizations, community safety and gender-responsive
parenting practices. Gaps in progress remain in adequate nutrition, access to play opportunities
and in WASH services.
Overall, parents and early childhood service providers rated the following community conditions
the highest (see Figure 13): (1) immunization services (8.76 out of 10); (2) community safety (8.54
out of 10); and (3) gender-responsive parenting (7.81 out of 10). The lowest rated community
conditions included: (1) adequate nutrition (4.34 out of 10); (2) access to play opportunities (4.79
out of 10); and (3) access to toilets (5.88 out of 10). Parents’ top three priorities for community
improvement included: (1) access to water for drinking and hygiene (which received 184 total
priority votes); (2) access to community health care services (which received 150 total priority
votes); and (3) access to toilets (which received 132 total priority votes) (see Annex E, Table 19).

Programme convergence had the biggest effect on participation in early childhood education
opportunities, but was more pronounced across all indicators when separating the perspectives
of parents versus service providers and gender groups. Programme convergence has contributed
to the reduction of inequities and exclusion among females in the high touch-point communities,
but has done so to a lesser extent for males. This finding is likely attributed to UNICEF’s historic
emphasis on programming that supports predominantly mothers.
Positive differences were found in the community scorecards of females in high touch-point (HTP)
versus low touch-point (LTP) communities in 8 out of 10 indicators (see Figure 14 and Annex E,
Table 17). These differences were greatest in: (1) access to community health care services (8.10
in HTP vs. 5.93 in LTP, +2.17 difference); (2) adequate nutrition (5.38 in HTP vs. 3.27 in LTP,
+2.11 difference); (3) gender-responsive parenting (7.83 in HTP vs. 6.61 in LTP, +1.22
difference); and (4) participation in early childhood education (8.26 in HTP vs. 7.32 in LTP, +0.94
difference). Positive differences were found in the community scorecards of males in high touch-
point versus low touch-point communities in 4 out of 10 indicators. These differences were
minimal for males, with the exception of participation in early childhood education opportunities
(7.32 in HTP vs. 5.73 in LTP, +1.59 difference) (see Figure 14 and Annex E, Table 17).
57

 Early Stimulation and Care
Parenting practices such as singing, playing or telling stories received community scorecards
ranging from 6.01 to 7.32 out of 10 (see Figure 14 and Annex E, Table 17). The community
scorecards suggest that programme convergence was not associated with early stimulation and
care for females or males. There were also no discernable qualitative differences in the
perceptions of parents from low and high touch-point communities. In both communities, nearly
60 per cent of parents reported singing, playing and telling stories with their children every day,
and nearly 40 per cent indicated they practiced early stimulation and care sometimes (see Annex
E, Table 17).
There was an emphasis among parents in both communities on telling stories as a basis for
developing a young child’s moral character, for teaching them social norms and values in the
community and for sharing stories about their ancestors and their patriotic bravery. Parents
considered play to be a way to bring their children happiness and social-emotional well-being.
Parents also indicated that they sing ballads, play and tell stories to help their children prepare
58
for the future and to learn their language and cultural heritage. Parents who could only sometimes
provide early stimulation and care indicated this was for two main reasons: (1) because parents
work all day and are too tired when they come home to engage in these activities with their
children; and (2) because children are busy with their school work or are in bed by the time parents
return from work (especially the fathers, who are often with their livestock until very late in the
evening).
 Gender-Responsive Parenting
The equal caregiving of mothers and fathers for their young children received community scorecards
ranging from 7.04 to 8.44 out of 10 (see Figure 14 and Annex E, Table 17). Programme
convergence was associated with positive results for gender-responsive parenting for females,
but not for males. In low touch-point communities, 62 per cent of mothers indicated equal care for
their children with fathers, whereas 82 per cent of mothers indicated this was “mostly true” in high
touch-point communities (see Annex E, Table 18). There was recognition among participants in
both low and high touch-point communities that mothers and fathers equally contribute to raising
their children, but in unique ways. Both mothers and fathers expressed a mutual responsibility
towards their child’s well-being, education, health and protection when they reported “mostly true”
for this indicator. When participants responded “sometimes true”, it was because some viewed
mothers to be more responsible for the home environment, including cooking, cleaning and caring
for children; whereas fathers were considered responsible for earning a livelihood for the family
through agriculture or National Defense Force work, which often means they are not home to take
care of their children.
 Access to Play Opportunities
Children’s access toys for play at home (including handmade toys) received community
scorecards ranging from 4.40 to 4.81 out of 10 (see Figure 14 and Annex E, Table 17).
Programme convergence was associated with positive results for access to play opportunities for
females, but not for males. Mothers in high touch-point communities had more positive views on
access to play opportunities when compared to mothers in low touch-point communities (47 per
cent said this was mostly true, compared to 33 per cent) (see Annex E, Table 18). Parents in low
touch-point communities were more likely to say that their children do not have access to toys,
especially toys from the market, because they do not have the financial means to purchase them.
Service providers reported that parents lack awareness on the importance of toys, but parents
from both low and high touch-point communities demonstrated their understanding of play in their
child’s development. They saw the value in their homemade toys (such as dolls and domestic
animals made from local materials) in helping children learn in fun ways, especially in fostering
creativity. Some parents also indicated that children want to play with new digital toys, which they
cannot afford.
 Participation in ECE Opportunities
Young children’s attendance in an early childhood centre or preschool programme received
community scorecards ranging from 5.73 to 8.26 out of 10 (see Figure 14 and Annex E, Table
17). Programme convergence was associated with positive results for access to play
opportunities, for both females and males. Overall, 48 per cent of parents in low touch-point
communities indicated it was “mostly true” that their child attended an early childhood centre or
preschool, compared to 84 per cent in high touch-point communities (see Annex E, Table 18).
Moreover, 25 per cent of parents in low touch-point communities indicated it was “never true” that
59
their child attended a centre or preschool, compared to 6 per cent of parents in high touch-point
communities (see Annex E, Table 18). In both communities, local programme managers, parents
and service providers indicated that the preschools were of poor quality, unsafe and insufficient
in number for the eligible children in their community. Parents from both communities also
mentioned that the distance from their home to preschool is too far, and that there is a lack of
awareness on the importance of sending young children to preschool. Service providers from the
low touch-point community indicated that many young children are left behind, especially with
regards to the participation of Tigre and Bidhaaweet (Hidareb) children in preschool, when
compared to Tigrinya children.
 Access to Community Health Care Services
Access to community health care services received community scorecards ranging from 5.93 to 8.10
out of 10 (see Figure 14 and Annex E, Table 17). Programme convergence was associated with
positive results for access to community health care services for females, but not for males.
Overall, 37 per cent of mothers in low touch-point communities indicated it was “mostly true” that
they could access health care services, compared to 87 per cent of mothers in high touch-point
communities (see Annex E, Table 18). However, there were common concerns among parents in
all communities about the number and quality of health care services. Parents and service
providers indicated that there were too few facilities for the size of their population, and that
mothers often gave birth at home. They also reported a lack of sufficient medicine or prescription
drugs, diagnostic instruments (such as X-ray machines) and ambulances, as well as their inability
to pay for medicine, and poor treatment by health practitioners when seeking treatment for their
children’s health.
 Immunization Services
Immunization services received community scorecards ranging from 8.41 to 9.04 out of 10 (see
Figure 14 and Annex E, Table 17). Programme convergence was positively associated with
immunization services for both females and males. Overall, 76 per cent of parents in low touch-
point communities indicated it was “mostly true” that their children received all their
immunizations, compared to 100 per cent of parents in high touch-point communities (see Annex
E, Table 18). Parents and service providers in both communities indicated that vaccinations begin
at birth and that they are distributed fairly to all children, even those living in remote areas because
health officials go to their homes, and because parents are made aware of the importance of
vaccinations through health workers. Local programme managers and UNICEF staff members
agreed that the GoSE campaign for immunizations has been highly successful, even in remote
areas.
 Adequate Nutrition
Children’s access to enough nutritious food received community scorecards ranging from 3.27 to
5.38 out of 10 (see Figure 14 and Annex E, Table 17). Programme convergence was positively
associated with immunization services for both females and males, although the difference was
greater for females. Overall, 30 per cent of parents reported it was “mostly true” that their child
had adequate nutrition in high touch-point communities, compared to 13 per cent in low touch-
point communities (see Annex E, Table 18). Moreover, 36 per cent of parents in low touch-point
communities indicated it was “never true” that their child had adequate nutrition, compared to 14
per cent in high touch-point communities (see Annex E, Table 18). Parents in both low and high
touch-point communities provided similar reasons for their child lacking adequate nutrition, even
though they all strived to ensure their child’s health. Reasons for poor nutrition included: poverty
60
and the lack of household income to purchase healthy and nutritious food, a lack of markets that
provide healthy food options, a lack of awareness among parents about what nutritious food
constitutes, a lack of transportation to get to the markets where fruits and vegetables are sold and
a lack of variety in the local diet. Thus, even though programme convergence had positive results
for nutrition outcomes for young children, gaps remain on this indicator.
 Access to Toilets
Access to clean toilets at home or nearby received community scorecards ranging from 5.68 to
6.28 out of 10 (see Figure 14 and Annex E, Table 17). Programme convergence was positively
associated with access to toilets for males, but not for females. However, differences from
programme convergence were marginal for males (+0.11 scorecard difference) (see Annex E,
Table 17). In both low and high touch-point communities, parents and service providers reported
that they are required to have improved latrines with ventilation, which is why many homes have
these types of toilets. However, the toilets are not made from durable materials, easily become
non-functional and are often not properly cleaned. Reports of open defecation as a preference
over toilets were made by parents and service providers from low touch-point communities.
 Access to Water and Hygiene
Having sufficient water for drinking and washing at home received community scorecards ranging
from 5.97 to 7.03 out of 10 (see Figure 14 and Annex E, Table 17). Programme convergence was
positively associated with access to water and hygiene for females, but not for males. Overall, 43
per cent of mothers and 33 per cent of female service providers in low touch-point communities
reported they had access to water and hygiene, compared to 56 per cent of mothers and 42 per
cent of female service providers in high touch-point communities (see Annex E, Table 18). The
narratives were similar among parents and service providers who indicated access to water and
hygiene was an issue. Namely, they reported that their water supply is routinely interrupted by a
lack of electricity and power outages; that the amount of water supply for the community is
insufficient for their needs; that pipes and other materials used in the designs are of poor quality;
that water quality and safety is an issue; that water is too expensive to purchase; and that families
must often resort to fetching water from wells, which are shared with livestock.
 Community Safety
The safety of young children in the community received community scorecards ranging from 8.17
to 9.35 out of 10 (see Figure 14 and Annex E, Table 17). Programme convergence was associated
with positive results for community safety for females, but not for males. In particular, 68 per cent
of mothers and 67 per cent of female service providers in low touch-point communities reported
it was “mostly true” that their community was safe for young children, compared to 92 per cent of
mothers and 83 per cent of female service providers in high touch-point communities (see Annex
E, Table 18). Overall, parents and services providers in both low and high touch-point
communities reported a sense of shared responsibility for children’s safety, that they have laws
to protect children’s safety and that neighbours are supportive of one another and of the
government, which contributes to unity and peace.
Community Results for BECPP Programme Convergence
The Country Programme has contributed to positive results for adolescents, particularly in the
areas of school attendance, hygiene and health awareness and community safety. Gaps in
61
progress remain in specialized programmes for girls and boys, psychosocial support and career
and college readiness.
Overall, adolescents and their service providers rated the following community conditions the
highest: (1) school attendance (8.38 out of 10); (2) hygiene and health awareness (8.25 out of
10); and (3) community safety (8.22 out of 10) (see Figure 15 and Annex E, Table 20). The lowest
rated community conditions included: (1) specialized programmes for girls and boys (4.68 out of
10); (2) psychosocial support (5.24 out of 10); and (3) career and college readiness (5.68 out of
10). Adolescents’ top three priorities for community improvement included: (1) gender-friendly
WASH in schools (which received 157 total priority votes); (2) awareness of children’s rights
(which received 100 total priority votes); and (3) specialized programmes for girls and boys (which
received 89 total priority votes) (see Annex E, Table 22).

Overall, programme convergence had the biggest effect on gender-friendly WASH in schools, but
was more pronounced across all indicators when examined from a gender-disaggregated
perspective (see Figure 16 and Annex E, Tables 20 and 21). In particular, programme
convergence has contributed to the reduction of inequities and exclusion of adolescent girls in the
sample communities, but not for adolescent boys. This finding is likely attributed to UNICEF’s
historic emphasis on programming that supports predominantly adolescent girls.

Positive differences were found in the community scorecards of females in high touch-point
versus low touch-point communities in 8 out of 10 survey items (see Figure 16 and Annex E,
Table 20). However, the effects of programme convergence were only observable in the
community scorecards (averaging the scorecards of adolescent girls and female service providers
together). On the other hand, there were few positive differences in the community scorecards
among adolescent girls and boys on their own, or across all males in high touch-point versus low
touch-point communities (Annex E, Table 20). Overall, adolescents had a much more favourable
view of their community conditions when compared to service providers, and adolescents in low
touch-point communities had more favourable views when compared to their peers in high touch-
point communities (Annex E, Table 20). These findings suggest the effects of programme
convergence are not as advanced for BECPP programming, but are nonetheless emerging in
practice.
 Awareness of Children’s Rights
63
Awareness of children’s rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child received community
scorecards ranging from 6.37 to 7.95 out of 10 (see Figure 16 and Annex E, Table 20). The
community scorecards suggest that programme convergence was not associated with awareness
of children’s rights for either girls or boys. However, the qualitative data demonstrated differences
in the level of awareness among adolescents in low versus high touch-point communities. In low
touch-point communities, adolescents were only able to identify who they learned their rights from,
which was primarily their teachers and parents, as well as through the annual Children’s Day
celebrations sponsored by the Ministry of Social Welfare. In high touch-point communities,
adolescents not only articulated who they learned their rights from, but they were also able to
identify and elaborate upon them in practical terms, including their right to healthcare services,
immunizations, quality education opportunities and protection from harmful labour practices. In
high touch-point communities, adolescents also referenced the child rights awareness campaigns
supported by UNICEF, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Social Welfare, NUYSE and NUEW
as a source of their knowledge of children’s rights. Service providers emphasized that parental
knowledge of children’s rights is quite limited, and that there are no places (such as sports clubs,
recreation centres) where adolescents could get together to discuss their rights among
themselves.
 Participation Opportunities
Access to meaningful opportunities for adolescents to voice their ideas and concerns about
decisions that affect them received community scorecards ranging from 5.97 to 7.25 out of 10
(see Figure 16 and Annex E, Table 20). Programme convergence was associated with positive
results for girls’ participation opportunities, but not for boys. The qualitative data equally points to
mixed results on participation opportunities. Adolescents were primarily concerned with making
decisions about their educational opportunities, future careers and health, as well as determining
when and who they would marry. Some adolescents indicated they had meaningful opportunities
to voice their concerns on these issues with teachers and parents, who not only listened to them,
but allowed them to make decisions on their own. Other adolescents indicated their views were
not listened to by their parents or teachers, especially girls and those residing in low touch-point
communities. In high touch-point communities, adolescents described mechanisms for voicing
their concerns with teachers at school, such as registering complaints with the administration.
However, some adolescents and service providers indicated there were no mechanisms for youth
to make complaints or to support decision-making processes at a community level.
 School Attendance
School attendance received community scorecards ranging from 7.81 to 8.68 out of 10 (see
Figure 16 and Annex E, Table 20). Programme convergence was associated with positive results
for girls’ school attendance, but not for boys. In high touch-point communities only, there was a
reference made by some adolescents to the increased attendance of girls in school. Adolescents
in low and high touch-point communities indicated that a majority of youth attended school, but
both groups also indicated gaps in the quality of their education. In low touch-point communities,
adolescents stressed classroom overcrowding, as well as the insufficient number and poor quality
of their classrooms as common issues. This included schools made out of makeshift tents and
classrooms without desks where adolescents must sit on the sand. In high touch-point
communities, adolescents also reported classroom overcrowding, but also emphasized poor
quality curriculum leading to youth boredom; absentee teachers or an insufficient number of
teachers; and shortages in learning materials (including books, ICT and laboratory equipment).
Adolescents in both low and high touch-point communities indicated that there are still some youth
who do not attend school, including: girls who have parents that believe middle school is the
64
highest education required for their daughter; youth from nomadic communities; youth who must
travel long distances to attend school; youth from poor families who cannot afford to attend school;
and youth with special needs (such as youth with disabilities). Local programme managers
stressed a need for boarding schools and transportation means for adolescents in remote
communities. There was also a recognition among adolescents that some youth do not attend
school at the right age because they spent the early years of their school-age time as shepherds.
 Career and College Readiness
Opportunities for adolescents to attend programmes that provide relevant training for their future
work received community scorecards ranging from 5.03 to 6.70 out of 10 (see Figure 16 and
Annex E, Table 20). Programme convergence was associated with positive results for girls’ career
and college readiness, but not for boys. Adolescents in both low and high touch-point communities
indicated they had access to training in first aid, drama, English language, music and Himmeret
(the core), which prepares adolescents to be future leaders. However, some adolescents in low
touch-point communities indicated that they did not have access to these programmes due to a
lack of electricity or because NUYSE does not offer them. In high touch-point communities, some
adolescents reported that the programmes they did have were not running anymore, that the
quality could be improved and that some youth do not enrol in the programmes for financial
reasons or because their parents do not see value in them.
 Community Safety
Perceptions of community safety for adolescents received community scorecards ranging from
7.62 to 8.73 out of 10 (see Figure 16 and Annex E, Table 20). Programme convergence was
associated with positive results for girls’ sense of community safety, but not for boys. In low touch-
point communities, adolescents emphasized that their religious, cultural and social norms made
them feel safe, as they included a sense of responsibility for collaboration, cooperation, peaceful
problem-solving and a respect for laws and elders. Thus, adolescents in low touch-point
communities felt safe because of a strong sense of community trust and collective efficacy.
Adolescents in high touch-point communities also indicated a high level of trust and collective
efficacy, and associated these feelings with their religious beliefs. However, they were also more
critical of their communities. For example, they shared stories of fights among groups (or ‘gangs’)
of adolescents who come from different communities, robberies committed by adolescents,
garbage or waste around their schools or football fields and violence against girls while on their
way to school (including rape, bad boys and fear of hyenas).
 Gender Equality
Gender equality, or the equal treatment of girls and boys, received community scorecards ranging
from 7.20 to 8.14 out of 10 (see Figure 16 and Annex E, Table 20). Programme convergence was
not associated with gender equality, although there were some unique differences in low versus
high touch-point communities. In low touch-point communities, adolescents were more likely to
indicate that boys were denied access to school due to their agricultural or livestock work
responsibilities. In high touch-point communities, adolescents were more likely to associate
familial/parental knowledge with the equal treatment of girls (higher knowledge leading to more
opportunities for girls). However, in both low and high-touch point communities, adolescents
overwhelmingly indicated that gaps remain in achieving gender equality, especially when it comes
to girls’ educational and career choices.
65
 Psychosocial Support
Knowing an adult in the community with whom an adolescent can talk freely about abuse or
violence received community scorecards ranging from 4.88 to 5.87 out of 10 (see Figure 16 and
Annex E, Table 20). Programme convergence was associated with positive results for girls’
psychosocial support, but not for boys. However, in both low and high touch-point communities,
adolescents overwhelmingly indicated that they do not speak to adults about abuse or violence.
Reasons for this included the perception that adults do not listen to youth, that adults do not
believe youth, or out of fear for retaliation, rumors, stigmatization or misunderstandings.
Adolescents also indicated it was a sign of respect to not talk with adults about abuse or violence,
or that they did not want to burden their parents. Service providers indicated that there were no
counselling programs or counsellors available in schools.
 Gender-friendly WASH in Schools
Having access to separate toilets for girls and boys in school received community scorecards
ranging from 5.54 to 7.26 out of 10 (see Figure 16 and Annex E, Table 20). Programme
convergence was associated with positive results for gender-friendly WASH in schools for girls,
and to some extent for boys. Adolescents in low touch-point communities were more likely to
report toilets that were not gender separated. However, local programme managers, adolescents
and service providers from both low and high touch-point communities indicated an insufficient
number of toilets, even though they were separated. An insufficient number of toilets also
reportedly led some adolescents to use toilets designated for teachers, or for other genders.
There was also a common concern among adolescents and service providers about a lack of
sufficient water for the toilets, that toilets were not functioning properly, were closed, or were in
poor condition.
 Specialized Programmes for Girls and Boys
Access to school programs for girls and boys to talk about their unique needs received community
scorecards ranging from 4.38 to 5.11 out of 10 (see Figure 16 and Annex E, Table 20).
Programme convergence was not associated with specialized programmes for girls and boys.
However, adolescents and service providers in low touch-point communities were more likely to
report having no access to these types of programmes, or only informal mechanisms to discuss
gender-specific needs. Adolescents and service providers in high touch-point communities were
able to name specific programmes for girls, including a “Ladies Club” that discussed girls’
education needs, and programmes on menstrual hygiene and reproductive health. There was
also a common narrative that where programmes did exist, they were no longer functioning or
had staffing issues. Local programme managers, UNICEF staff members and NUYSE
representatives also agreed that adolescents have a lack of access to play and leisure
opportunities. These stakeholders also indicated there was an insufficient number of youth
centres that provide twenty-first century skills development, such as the IDEA studio supported
by UNICEF. Further, there were a limited number of peer-to-peer education interventions, which
local programme managers and service providers considered essential for improving adolescent
awareness and life skills development.
 Hygiene and Health Awareness
Adolescent knowledge of how to protect themselves from diseases (such as HIV/AIDS, malaria,
and COVID-19) received community scorecards ranging from 7.85 to 8.41 out of 10 (see Figure
66
16 and Annex E, Table 20). Programme convergence was associated with positive results for
girls’ hygiene and health awareness, but not for boys. Adolescents from both low and high touch-
point communities reported that they learned these behaviours from their teachers at school, from
health professionals at health facilities, from their parents at home and from radio and television
campaigns. Adolescents and service providers in high touch-point communities were aware that
the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health coordinated their efforts to educate
adolescents on these matters, and also indicated that these topics were included in the national
curriculum.
4.4. Efficiency
 EQ4 | Efficiency | How well were Country Programme resources managed and utilized?
The Country Programme Evaluation examined if resourcing and management structures were
sufficient for programme convergence and for delivering on equity and gender-related objectives.
UNICEF’s strategy to promote innovation was also examined as it relates to efficiency.
4.1. Were UNICEF Country Office resources (funds, human resources, time, expertise
etc.) allocated, tracked and utilized strategically to achieve results, including equity
and gender-related objectives?
Finding 10: There was insufficient data on innovations and resource utilization to draw
conclusions about the efficacy of the Country Programme. However, there was evidence of
decreased interest in donor support for Eritrea, as well as a substantial funding gap for
humanitarian response.
The 2017–2021 Country Programme proposed a total of US$102.46 million for the entire
programme cycle, exclusive of funding for emergency response (see Table 13). The Regular
Resources (RR) allocation was US$14.56 million over a five-year period. This amount was
distributed between CSD (with US$3.8 million), BECPP (with US$3.65 million) and PE (with
US$7.1 million). No information was provided to the evaluator on budget utilization; thus, it was
not clear if the funds were spent down in a way that achieved equity and gender-related
objectives.

67
UNICEF senior leadership and staff members, as well as documents such as the Office
Management Plan, indicated that Eritrea experienced decreasing levels of donor support during
the implementation of the Country Programme. The CO organized at least four humanitarian
action appeals between 2018 and 2021, requesting a total of US$65.73 million for life-saving
interventions (see Table 14). This funding request equates to 64 per cent of the total CO budget,
indicating a substantial resource mobilization appeal. The data indicated substantial gaps in
resource allocation for interventions designed to reach the most vulnerable children and families
in the country. For example, the overall funding gap during this four-year period was US$31.69
million.

Funding gap 2.50 5.69 10.60 12.90 31.69
Data Source: UNICEF Eritrea Humanitarian Action Appeals, 2018–2021
In the context of limited and progressively dwindling funding, the CO sought to achieve the targets
of the Country Programme through programme convergence at the community level. The
assumption was that building capacity and strengthening systems to build resilience to shocks
would gain efficiencies and ensure sustainability. Dwindling resources also required UNICEF to
shift from funding programme implementation to a more technical and oversight role during the
Country Programme. Finally, the CO utilized the strategy of South-to-South cooperation to
engage donors in resource mobilization.
4.2. Were the necessary management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation
structures in place in the UNICEF Country Office to effectively implement
programme convergence?
Finding 11: The Country Office made staff changes to ensure the required management
conditions were in place for collective planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation for
programme convergence.
The UNICEF Eritrea CO had 60 posts in its office management structure, with about a dozen
vacant posts. The shift towards integrated programming required the CO to establish
accountability structures to ensure the achievement of integrated planning, budgeting, monitoring
and evaluation. The proposed staffing structure differed from the previous Country Programme,
shifting from a sector-focused approach to the life cycle approach to achieve the key planned
results at different stages of the child. In particular, there were two heads of section rather than
four, the WASH team was moved under the CSD programming and basic education and child
protection were merged under BECPP programming.
In terms of innovations supporting programme convergence, there were limited data on what this
meant for the Country Programme. However, evidence was found that UNICEF successfully
utilized offline, android-based systems to monitor WASH and C4D programmes that were
implemented by the government during the COVID-19 response. This system worked well and
68
was an important lesson in the context of Eritrea, given internet connectivity is marginal. This data
enabled UNICEF to identify and respond to the needs of vulnerable populations.
4.5. Sustainability
 EQ5 | Sustainability | Will the benefits of the Country Programme last?
The CPE assessed the extent to which continuation of benefits from Country Programme
interventions was ensured, including the likelihood of and risks to continued long-term benefits
and the potential for scale-up and/or replication. The CPE examined the specific factors that
influenced performance – positively or negatively – and the sustainability of results in Eritrea.
5.1. To what extent are the positive changes and effects of the Country Programme
sustainable at the relevant levels (e.g., national, zoba, sub-zoba and community) ?
Finding 12: The positive advancements made through the Country Programme are likely to
continue given strong government ownership, policy and system strengthening achievements and
high levels of community participation and empowerment. However, there are gaps in resource
allocation, programming in Southern Red Sea and with WASH that need to be addressed to
ensure sustainability, especially given the ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given the high level of government ownership over the Country Programme interventions, the
positive changes and progress made will likely be sustained. The Country Programme also
contributed to major advancements by the government to develop policies for programme
priorities. However, there are caveats for continued advancements, namely having a signed work
plan, resource mobilization and strengthened risk-informed programming. Another challenge will
be continued capacity development to ensure the effective implementation of the policies and
strategies that have been developed, from the national to decentralized levels.
5.2. To what extent have the programme strategies and approaches adopted by UNICEF
contributed to the sustainability of results, especially equity and gender-related
results?
Finding 13: A combination of strategies were considered the most effective for the sustainability
of results: (1) system strengthening; (2) community engagement; and (3) partnerships.
UNICEF senior leadership and staff members considered the dual approach to system
strengthening and community engagement to be the most effective combination of strategies for
the sustainability of results. Partnerships and capacity development were also considered key.
For example, UNICEF’s work with adolescents has built its capacity to sustain some of the
interventions, even when the organization did not have a signed work plan.
However, additional efforts to integrate programming through conceptual frameworks, such as
the Nurturing Care Framework, would better streamline programme convergence. The
government requires sensitization to this framework as a basis for improving integrated ECD
delivery at the community level. For BECPP, UNICEF staff members recommended working
69
through the 67 child rights committees to ensure synergies in programming across the various
sectors at the decentralized levels.
Section E. Conclusions and Recommendations
1.1. Conclusions
The primary objective of this evaluation was to assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency,
coherence and sustainability of the Eritrea Country Programme with particular focus on equity,
gender equality and convergence of programme components, as well as UNICEF’s strategic
positioning in relation to its child rights mandate.
Relevance
The objectives of the Country Programme and its design were appropriate, and remain
appropriate for the national development goals and the intended beneficiaries, namely the most
marginalized children and women of Eritrea. However, given a lack of recent population-based
data, as well as district and community-level data, it was not possible to examine if these
strategies were sufficiently gender responsive and implemented at a scale to reach all those in
need. With the information available, UNICEF did not implement programming in the Southern
Red Sea at the level it required as a target region.
UNICEF’s strong partnership with the GoSE and its leadership towards reaching its objectives
was suitable considering its mandate, resource base, comparative advantages and operational
considerations. As one of the largest UN agencies operating in Eritrea, UNICEF is a major
influencer of policies and programmes in the country, especially in education, WASH and
child/social protection. UNICEF identified the most relevant strategies to solve programmatic
challenges, such as the global pandemic and delays in a signed work plan. In particular, UNICEF
shifted between upstream system strengthening and downstream service delivery as
opportunities arose. However, these delays did slow progress on realizing results for children and
posed some risks to UNICEF’s reputation, with ebbs and flows in service provision.
UNICEF successfully leveraged its partnerships with the GoSE to develop more than a dozen
policies and plans that strengthened multisectoral programming for child survival and
development, as well as adolescent development and participation. However, given the evolving
and overlapping mandates with other UN agencies on adolescent development and participation,
greater clarity on the roles and contributions of UNICEF and its partner UN agencies in this area
of programming are warranted.
Coherence
The overall logic of the Country Programme theory of change and results frameworks were
somewhat consistent with key UNICEF strategies and international commitments, but gaps
remain. The Country Programme excelled at aligning its programming strategies with the GAP,
but it did not sufficiently integrate gender-responsive theories of change and gender-
disaggregated results frameworks. The Country Programme did not sufficiently integrate the
CCCs into its programme strategy notes, theories of change and results frameworks. The lack of
70
a risk-informed approach to programming is a serious limitation of the Country Programme given
the contextual socio-political-environmental realities in Eritrea.
UNICEF’s coordination and convening role within the United Nations and with government sectors
was appropriate, but the BECPP programming did not have a conceptual implementation
framework that clearly identified mutually reinforcing activities for adolescent development. The
CSD framework did not fully integrate the multisectoral Nurturing Care Framework guiding this
programming component, and opportunities for monitoring collective impact were not realized.
Effectiveness
The Country Programme effectively implemented programme convergence, delivering six
sectoral interventions within each zoba; however, gaps were identified in the Southern Red Sea
zoba. Overall, there was a lack of recent and sufficiently disaggregated data to determine if the
Country Programme was gender transformative. However, evidence from one study in 2018
indicated a substantial reduction in FGM for girls under 15 and under 5. Evidence from programme
beneficiaries, collected through this evaluation, indicated progress on gender equality. In
particular, female service providers, mothers and girls had more favourable views of their
community conditions when compared to male service providers, fathers and boys. In addition,
the Country Programme achieved stronger results for girls and women through programme
convergence, when compared to boys and men in the sampled communities. These findings
suggest that UNICEF’s targeted gender programming has been effective for girls and women, but
its gender mainstreaming strategies have been less effective for boys and men.
Efficiency
The management structures of the Country Programme were sufficient for programme
convergence and for delivering on equity and gender-related objectives, with the exception of
adequacy of recent and disaggregated monitoring data. UNICEF promoted innovations to address
this gap through android-based platforms for WASH interventions, but there was insufficient
information to draw conclusions about gains in efficiency. Substantial resource gaps were
identified for delivering humanitarian programming, as well as decreased donor interest in Eritrea.
UNICEF did its best to address these resource gaps through South-to-South collaboration and
awareness raising about the needs in Eritrea through multi-stakeholder donor platforms, but the
overall budget fell short by US$31.69 million.
Sustainability
The design of the Country Programme is premised on government ownership and strengthening
institutional capacities in government ministries to ensure sustainability. In the case of Eritrea,
UNICEF was considered a strong and trusted partner of the GoSE, but also of the national unions
who support programming at the decentralized levels. The continuation of benefits from Country
Programme interventions will be ensured through policy and system strengthening achievements
and high levels of community participation and empowerment. Risks to sustainability include the
ongoing pandemic and subsequent effects on mental health and loss of learning, as well as
communities reverting to some traditional and harmful gender practices without continuous
sensitization. Capacity development for frontline workers, including teachers, early childhood
practitioners, health care workers and social workers will be instrumental for sustaining the impact
of the Country Programme with beneficiaries.
71
1.2. Lessons Learned
A second objective of this CPE was to identify and document key lessons learned, good practices
and innovations in implementing the Country Programme that can inform and support advocacy
efforts for scale-up and replication. The following lessons were identified, particularly as they
apply to UNICEF’s positioning, programme convergence and gender mainstreaming.
 UNICEF’s leadership as a backbone entity for coordinating multisectoral programming
with the GoSE and with other UN agencies was clearly articulated in the SPCF. As a
leader, UNICEF must provide all partners with require clear conceptual frameworks for
operationalizing multisectoral programming in practice, such as the Nurturing Care
Framework.
 Such frameworks enable all actors to understand the mutually supporting roles, activities
and outputs that lead to synergistic impacts. Such frameworks will facilitate coordination
and continuous communication across UN agencies where there are overlapping
mandates.
 UNICEF’s approach to programme convergence was both thematic and spatial. From a
thematic perspective, UNICEF utilized a life course approach to programming to identify
mutually reinforcing activities from relevant sectors for young children and for adolescents.
From a spatial perspective, UNICEF tracked the implementation of its sectoral
interventions at the zoba and sub-zoba levels, which greatly enhanced its ability to
examine the extent and coverage of programme convergence.
 The ability to monitor and evaluate collective impact requires a shared measurement
framework that identifies the unique contributions of each sector and UN agency, while at
the same time containing synergistic measures of outputs and outcomes. The shared
measurement frameworks put forth in recent government policies offer a concrete way to
progressively be able to demonstrate collective impact across all UN agencies and
government sectors.
1.3. Recommendations
The third objective of this CPE was to provide a set of forward-looking and actionable
recommendations to strengthen programmatic strategies in the implementation of the next Eritrea
Country Programme, taking into consideration national development priorities, such as the Eritrea
Development Vision 2025 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the country. The
recommendations outlined here are strategic in nature, and are in direct alignment with the
evaluation findings and conclusions.
Recommendation 1: Strengthen the evidence generation strategy overall, and improve
data collection processes to ensure spatial data is available at the decentralized levels,
and is disaggregated by gender and disability. The CO has done an excellent job at building
a spatial database on programme interventions, but this data does not go beyond the sub-zoba
level. It is important to have community and district level data on the populations served in order
to ensure no child is left behind. Without this data, UNICEF can potentially make uninformed
claims and assumptions about the reach of its programming. Continue to explore the innovative
monitoring tools utilized for WASH to gather this spatial data.
72
Recommendation 2: Strengthen the risk-informed approach to the Country Programme
and its implementation. The evaluation found major gaps in alignment with the CCCs and the
Country Programme, as well as limited information on the links between development and
humanitarian programming. In addition, there was limited guidance on what to do when the work
plan is not approved in a timely manner, which greatly affected programme implementation and
likely stalled progress on results. These are important oversights of the CO that should be swiftly
and thoughtfully addressed, if needed, through additional guidance from UNICEF headquarters
and regional office support.
Recommendation 3: Strengthen multisectoral programme coherence and implementation
by developing or leveraging existing frameworks for early childhood and adolescent
development. UNICEF and its partner UN agencies have evolving priorities for realizing the
SDGs, and as such, there is a need for clear operational frameworks to guide overlapping
accountabilities for ECD and adolescents. The frameworks should empower all actors, including
the GoSE and national unions, to see themselves as agents in the design, coordination,
implementation and evaluation process.
Recommendation 4: Strengthen the Country Programme theory of change and
measurement framework to improve coherence of the collective impact approach.
Multisectoral programming requires the identification of both sector specific contributions and
mutually reinforcing activities, which should be identified through a clear theory of change that
identifies the pathways towards collective impact. Synergistic outcome and impact measures,
such as those identified in the CO ECD Strategy, should be integrated into the Country
Programme results framework.
Recommendation 5: Strengthen the gender mainstreaming approach in the Country
Programme by clearly articulating the needs and strategies of both girls and boys and by
utilizing gender responsive measures. UNICEF’s focus on girls and women had the unintended
effect of not sufficiently addressing the needs of boys and men. The pathways for the engagement
of boys and men through the Country Programme need to be better articulated within UNICEF
programme priorities and measurement frameworks.
Recommendation 6: Consider frequent and scaled participatory data collection processes
for continued monitoring of programme relevance, effectiveness and results. Given the lack
of data on programme effectiveness that often accompanies a lack of a signed work plan, the CO
should explore other ways of innovating its monitoring processes. For example, the capacity that
has now been built through the evaluation for participatory data collection through a local research
institute can be leveraged and scaled for additional data collection in other sub-zobas and
communities. The same data collection tools and approaches could also be led by NUYSE and
NUEW, as they are designed to be led by community members, including adolescents.
Recommendation 7: Mobilize additional resources to scale UNICEF-supported
programming to reach the most disadvantaged children, especially in Southern Red Sea.
Insufficient resources can lead to potential reputational risks for UNICEF with local programme
managers and beneficiaries. From their perspective, programmes that were once available no
longer exist, and they are not privy to all the nuances that caused this fluctuation.
Recommendation 8: Elaborate upon the child and adolescent participation strategy, as
well as a larger community participation strategy that recognizes the empowerment of all
actors in the Country Programme. Community participation has been foundational for the
successful and effective implementation of the Country Programme. However, some actors are
73
not visible within the participation strategy, including young children (ages 6 to 9), children and
young people with disabilities, mothers, fathers and service providers. Frontline workers, such as
local programme managers and union representatives, should continue to build their skills to
facilitate community participation.

Focus Groups with Local Programme Managers
Programme managers (local Government representatives) of UNICEF-supported interventions
will be invited to a focus group conversation for each sub-zoba visited by the local evaluation
team. The purpose of these conversations will be to learn what has worked in the implementation
of UNICEF’s multisectoral programming efforts, what needs to be strengthened to achieve results
for children and what lessons have been learned. Each participant will be made aware of the
evaluation purpose and their rights, including their confidentiality and right to opt-out of the
process at any time. The local evaluation team will facilitate this conversation, and will seek
permission to audio or video record the session, or to take notes.
The local evaluation team will begin the session by explaining that the evaluation is looking closely
at the benefits of multisectoral programming – or the delivery of more than one service for children
within a community. The local evaluation team will introduce the specific programmes that are
being examined – such as children’s clubs, or the Care for Child Development (CCD) package.
Afterwards, the local evaluation team ask everyone to briefly introduce themselves, and to explain
which programme they have participated in and how. Participants will be asked to reflect upon
the added benefits of having more than one type of service provided in their communities in sub-
zobas with high touch-points. In low touch-point sub-zobas, participants will be asked to reflect
upon what services are lacking in their communities, and what is required to improve the situation.
1. Please introduce yourself. Which programme(s) did you participate in and how?
2. What are the current needs in the community (for girls/boys, for mothers/fathers), and how
does/do this/these programme(s) address those needs?
3. What is the benefit of having more than one type of service or program for children in this
community? How does this approach impact children? (high touch-point only)
4. How do the programmes coordinate their efforts? What does this look like in practice?
(high touch-point only)
5. What programmes or services are needed to improve the situation of children? (low touch-
point only)
6. What has worked well or not so well in implementing these programmes?
7. What lessons have been learned from implementing these programmes?
Focus Group with NUYSE Representatives
The session with adolescent representatives of the NUYSE will utilize an adapted version of the
Child Friendly Places methodology to assess whether the key priorities made by them for the
Country Programme were addressed. The key priorities for adolescents in 2016 are included in
Table 22, mapped against the proposed UNICEF strategies or interventions for the Country
Programme.
The adapted tools will include the use of butcher paper and markers and a retroactive survey to
reflect on the situation of children and young people in Eritrea according to these four priorities in
2017 and 2021 (see Figure 6). After scoring their opinion on survey statements then and now by
drawing lines, participants will be asked to recall or brainstorm any actions they have seen
UNICEF and NUYSE take to address these issues (unique or joint interventions). After
brainstorming these interventions, participants will be allowed to rank them in terms of relevance
and effectiveness. To conclude, participants will be asked for their recommendations to UNICEF
for addressing these issues moving forward.

Evaluation Sample
The evaluation requires a strategic and representative sample of participants, rather than a random
sample. The goal is to ensure all ethnic groups are represented in the sample, and that there is a balance
of women/girls and men/boys, as indicated in the tables below. There are nine primary ethnic groups in
Eritrea: Afar, Blien, Hidareb, Kunama, Nara, Rashaida, Saho, Tigre and Tigrinya.

Selection of the Villages and Recruitment Criteria
The selection of the villages and the recruitment of evaluation participants will be managed by the local
evaluation team with support from the UNICEF Country Office and local authorities in the selected sub-
90
zobas. The Ministry of Education will support UNICEF in identifying the villages and recruiting participants
for ECD programming. The Ministry of Information and NUYSE will support UNICEF in identifying the
villages and recruiting participants for Adolescent Development and Participation (ADAP) programming.
The selection of the villages for inclusion in the evaluation is very important. For the high touch-point sub-
zoba, we want to select a village or community that has received two or more sectoral interventions that
are supported by UNICEF (see table on next page). In other words, we want to ensure that the high touch-
point village has received multiple services that are supported by UNICEF across health, nutrition,
education, child protection and WASH. For the low touch-point sub-zoba, we want to select a village or
community that has received no UNICEF-supported interventions, or only one sectoral intervention. This
distinction is important for us to learn the added benefit of multisectoral programme convergence.
In addition to the engagement goals, gender ratios and ethnic representation outlined in Tables 1–3, the
recruitment criteria for evaluation participants from high touch-point and low touch-point sub-zobas are
provided in Table 4. For high touch-point sub-zobas, it is useful to first identify schools, health centres,
ECD centres, adult literacy centres or other community spaces/facilities where more than two
UNICEF-supported sectoral interventions have been implemented. This will ensure the likelihood of locating
individuals who have been exposed to UNICEF-supported interventions for high touch-point sub-zobas in
particular.
The participatory data collection sessions should take place in a community space that participants already
frequent, such as a school, preschool, health centre, ECD centre or administrative facility. To ensure safety,
all sessions must be held outdoors, such as in a courtyard or covered outdoor space. The session locations
will also be determined in consultation with local authorities and UNICEF.

Steps for the Recruitment Process (High touch-point sub-zobas)
1. Identify a village that has received more than one UNICEF sectoral intervention
2. Identify four community service spaces where individuals may have been exposed to these
interventions.
a. For ECD programming, identify four ECD centres, health facilities or preschools where
parents of infants and toddlers have attended UNICEF-supported programming. Pick four
community spaces that parents frequent and ensure a range of ethnic groups are
represented. For example, select one ECD centre that provides services to each ethnic
group from the village.
b. For ADAP programming, identify four schools where adolescents have attended
UNICEF-supported programming. Pick four schools that adolescents attend and ensure a
range of ethnic groups are represented. For example, select one school that provides
services to each ethnic group from the village.
3. Recruit potential participants during school or when they typically attend programme or
community events. Use the script below to recruit volunteers. Ask those who are interested to
attend the session by providing the date and time.
4. List the name of the village, community spaces, interventions, # of participants by gender and
ethnic groups in this Participant Recruitment Tool to keep track of recruitment.
Steps for the Recruitment Process (Low touch-point sub-zobas)
1. Identify a village that has received only one UNICEF sectoral intervention (or none)
2. Identify four community service spaces where individuals may gather.
a. For ECD programming, identify four ECD centres, health facilities or preschools that
parents of infants and toddlers frequent. Pick four community spaces that parents
frequent and ensure a range of ethnic groups are represented. For example, select one
ECD centre that provides services to each ethnic group from the village.
b. For ADAP programming, identify four schools that adolescents frequent. Pick four
schools that adolescents attend and ensure a range of ethnic groups are represented.

For example, select one school that provides services to each ethnic group from the
village.

Ethical Recruitment Procedures
● All individuals who meet the aforementioned criteria are invited to participate.
● Participation is voluntary; there should be no coercion or force/power used to make individuals
participate.
● The rights of participants should be respected at all times; do no harm is the most important
principle to follow at all times.
● All participants should be made aware of the evaluation purpose and their rights in the process.
All participants should consent/agree to participate (see oral consent forms).
● Denial of services or programmes to individuals if they choose not to participate is not permitted
under any circumstances or for any reason.
Scripts for recruitment and Consent
Consent must be obtained from service providers, parents of infants and toddlers, adolescents and
parents/guardians of adolescents before any data is collected.
Given the literacy levels of participants, the consent forms will be read out loud by the evaluators as a group
activity. Working with local programme managers and service providers, arrange a time to read the consent
form to potential participants as a recruitment script. There are unique consent forms for each target group.
● Oral Consent Form - Parents of Infants and Toddlers
● Oral Consent Form - Adolescents
● Oral Consent Form - Parents/Guardians of Adolescents
● Oral Consent Form - Service Providers

Session Overview
The participatory data collection session involves four main steps and takes approximately two hours.
1. Obtain participant consent (15 minutes)
2. Gather the data through interactive scoring technique (25 minutes)
3. Tally and discuss the results in small groups (40 minutes)
4. Identify most significant changes and priority issues (40 minutes)
The assessment tools were derived from Child Friendly Places, a global participatory action research
project from 2008 and 2015 that was led by researchers from the Children’s Environments Research Group
(CERG) of the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, in collaboration with the UNICEF Office
of Research, the Childwatch International Research Network, the Bernard van Leer Foundation, numerous
UNICEF Country Offices and UNICEF National Committees, as well as local and global non-governmental
organizations such as Plan International, World Vision and Save the Children.
This process, as well as the facilitator guides and survey tools, was field tested in more than 55 communities
across 35 countries with diverse social and economic development contexts. Each aspect of the tools and
survey items was content and age validated by a network of international child rights researchers, and with
the participation of government representatives, adolescents, parents and service providers. The tools are
designed to be adapted for the local context, including the visual survey images and survey items.

Scoring Technique
The scoring technique for the interactive surveys will utilize local objects and will be anonymous. We will
utilize local baskets (such as a sefet, hamham or buckets) and white and black beans for scoring. Each
participant will receive their own small bag of beans – white for girls/females and black for boys/males. This
will ensure participants only touch their own beans to reduce exposure to COVID-19. The session will take
place outdoors, such as in a school courtyard or open space to ensure social distancing. This session was
planned for a mix of girls and boys with 25 participants and 4 facilitators.
The process ensures the participants view the results in real-time, which enables them to help analyse the
data in a group discussion. Using graphic results charts, the facilitators tally the number of respondents by
the number who indicated their score for a survey statement was mostly true, somewhat true, or never true.
During the discussion, facilitators take notes that help explain why participants scored a particular way to
capture qualitative data that helps make meaning of the results. These charts also enable participants to
reflect on which survey items witnessed the most significant changes or improvements for a defined time
period, as well as to prioritize issues for further consideration by UNICEF.
95
Before the session
Poke a hole in each basket top or cut the tip off
the top so that a bean can fit through it. This will
ensure the scoring is anonymous.
Given there are 10 survey items and 3 response
categories (mostly true, sometimes true, never
true – or, alternatively: yes, sometimes, no), a total
of 30 baskets are required. These baskets can be
used for each session, after they are disinfected.
Tape, staple or tie a response category image
onto each basket (can also use a smiley face,
straight face and sad face).
96
GIRLS / WOMEN Prepare the beans for participants. Select larger
beans over smaller beans.
Make individual bags of 10 beans each (1 bean
per survey statement). Give girls/females a bag of
white beans and boys/men a bag of black beans.
This will assist in the disaggregation of the data
after the session is over for use in the evaluation.
White beans = girls/females
Black beans = boys/men
BOYS / MEN
NOTE: Different coloured beans can be used,
but make sure all evaluators know what the
colours mean.
Prepare the results chart using large sheets of
paper and markers. Tape the survey image cards
to the results chart.
Hang the results chart in the courtyard where all
participants can see it.
97
In the courtyard or outdoor space, create 10
scoring stations that are at least 2 metres in
distance from each other.
Participants will take turns walking around the
scoring stations so make sure there is adequate
room for movement and for social distancing.
Participants will take turns scoring each survey
item as they proceed through the stations to retain
social distancing. They do this by dropping their
bean into the bucket that reflects their opinion.
For example, the person who is at scoring station
4 must wait for the person at scoring station 5 to
finish their own vote before moving to station 5.
At each station, place the survey image card
next to the baskets. For example, you could put
the image card on the ground adjacent to the
baskets, or the image card could be made into a
sign with a stick, which you place next to the
baskets.
Use rocks or tape to hold down the image card if
needed. Laminate the image card if possible to
ensure durability.

During the session
Scoring your opinions
Conduct a quick warm-up activity to get the
participants engaged.
Discuss the word opinion with participants;
UNICEF is interested in their opinions, i.e., what
they think about the programmes or about their
community. Emphasize that for this activity, it is
okay to have different opinions. There are no right
or wrong answers. Participants should score
based upon their own opinion and experiences in
their community.
Before scoring begins, the local evaluation team
will be spread out around all 10 stations. Each
team member will take turns reading the survey
statements, one-by-one, at all 10 stations, so all
participants can hear them in advance of scoring.
To assist in comprehension, the evaluator may
hold up the image card for participants to see.
The local evaluation team needs to explain and
model the scoring technique. Use an example,
such as “I like mangos”, to make sure everyone
understands how to score.
Participants score their opinion by:
1) Walking to the survey station
2) Reading the survey statement (or having it
read to them if needed)
3) Deciding how they want to vote
4) Dropping their bean in the basket that
reflects their vote
The local evaluation team should be prepared to
re-read the survey statements to participants
during the scoring process to ensure those with
lower literacy levels understand each statement.
99
Tallying the results
Once all of the participants have had an
opportunity to score their opinions on all 10 survey
statements, it is now time to tally and discuss the
results.
This requires the counting of the total number of
beans found in each basket for each survey item.
In this example, there are a total of 11 beans, or
participants who said “mostly true” to the survey
statement.
The local evaluation team should count the
responses to ensure the beans are not lost or
stolen.
Enter the total counts on the results chart, which
should be hung on a wall near the scoring stations
for everyone to see.
The total responses should be shared out loud
with participants and logged onto a results chart.
For example, “we have 11 votes here that say
mostly true for [insert survey statement]”. This will
ensure the participants remain engaged during the
counting process.
NOTE: The evaluators will count the results by
gender group after the session because this
would take too much time out of the session
itself. In this example, there are 4 votes for
girls and 7 for boys.
100
Discussing the results
After all the scores have been tallied, the
evaluators will split the group of 25 into two
groups. Two evaluators will be assigned to each
group with one as the lead facilitator and one as a
notetaker.
The main question guiding the discussion is, “how
did you score this statement, and why?” To
interpret the results with participants, follow this
logic:
● If a majority of people say the statement
is mostly true, this means their rights are
being realized; ask for examples of what
is working, as this is a community asset.
● If most people say the statement is never
true, this means their rights are not being
realized; ask why is this right not being
realized?
● If most people say the statement is
sometimes true, this means that some
aspects of their rights are being realized,
but others are not; ask under what
conditions it is sometimes true, and
sometimes not true?
● For example, is it true for some people,
but not others (such as girls vs. boys), or
does it depend on the situation or time of
day?
Tips for meaningful discussions
● Frequently remind participants that there
are no right or wrong answers, that this is
based upon their own personal
experiences and opinions.
● Frequently explain that it is okay to have
different opinions.
● Explain to participants that UNICEF really
wants to learn from them about how to do
its work better, and that anything they can
share will be helpful.
● Do not force someone to speak if they
prefer not to.
● Encourage others to listen while others
are talking and to respect one another.
101
After the results have been
discussed, the participants will be
ready to reflect upon which
community conditions have
changed the most in the last four
years and to prioritize their
issues.
Most significant change
Ask the participants which survey
statements have they seen the
most change in over the last
couple of years. For example,
have they seen community safety
improve the most, or have they
seen improvements in access to
certain types of services? What
specifically has changed?
Prioritizing needs
Give each person 3 small circle
stickers, or a coloured marker.
Ask everyone to take turns
placing their 3 stickers next to the
assessment items they want to
change the most in the “Priorities”
column on the results chart.
End the session by thanking all of the
participants for their time and thoughtful
contributions.
THANK YOU! Explain that you will now pass out a small gift
from UNICEF. Have two evaluators be prepared
to pass out the small gifts to participants. Upon
giving the gifts to the participants, ask that they
verify their gender, ethnic group and age using
the Participant Demographics Tool.
After the session
● Take a photo of the results chart.
● Tally the results by gender.
● Input the session data into the Session Database Tool.
