Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1. The Country Programme (CP) 2018 – 2022 of the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF) in Egypt aims to support the efforts of the Government of Egypt (GoE) to promote
the child’s rights and reduce inequalities in the child related indicators. To do so, the Country
Office (CO) has focused its Programme on interventions that have proven potential benefit to
the children in vulnerable situations.
2. This report presents the findings of the final evaluation of UNICEF Egypt CP. It has been
commissioned by UNICEF CO in Egypt and managed by UNICEF in the Middle East and
North Africa Regional Office (MENARO) in close collaboration with UNICEF CO in Egypt.
The partners of UNICEF from the GoE during this process are the Ministry of International
Cooperation, the Ministry of Education and Technical Education (MoETE), the Ministry of
Health and Population (MoHP), the Ministry of Youth and Sports (MoYS) the Ministry of
Social Solidarity (MoSS) and the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood (NCCM).
This strategic evaluation complements the sectoral evaluations and studies carried out by
UNICEF and external experts.
Purpose of the evaluation
3. The main purpose of this evaluation is for learning and accountability. It aims to produce
an independent, objective and useful assessment of the CP achievements, to demonstrate
accountability to the stakeholders, draw lessons learnt and provide recommendations. The
specific objectives of the evaluation are the following:
− Assess the coherence, relevance, efficiency and effectiveness of the Programme;
− Assess the contribution of the CP to upstream policy, strategy and other system level
support towards contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG);
− Document key factors that have facilitated or hindered the achievement of results;
− Assess the CP sustainability and its performance in reaching more children in vulnerable
situations,
− Document key Programme learnings as an alternative delivery modality;
− Assess the extent the design and the interventions of the Country Programme
Document (CPD) integrate cross cutting issues such as gender, youth, child rights,
children with disability, equity and provide concrete recommendations to improve the
design and relevance of the CP.
Evaluation methodology
viii
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
4. The evaluation was focused on high-level key questions which provide framing for more
specific evaluation questions based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development and Development Assistance Committee criteria comprising coherence,
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability.
5. The evaluation included assessment vis-à-vis other criteria comprising: Human Rights-
Based Approach (HRBA); equity; Gender Equality, and Empowerment of Women (GEEW).
6. The evaluation complied with UNICEF-adapted United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG)
norms and standards including the UN System-Wide Action Plan (UN-SWAP)2. It used both
quantitative and qualitative information and applied triangulation methods using systematic
document review, quantitative data analysis, semi-structured online interviews. The
participants of the Key Informant Interviews (KII) included UNICEF Management Team and
specialists, Government officials, donors and implementing partners.
Key Findings
Coherence
7. In 2017, UNICEF CO in Egypt designed a CPD 2018-2022 that was aligned with the
Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS) of the GoE. The CPD is also aligned with the 2018-
2022 Government Action Plan and other national sectoral strategies, aligned with many SDG
as well as with the African Agenda 2063. It intended to achieve UNICEF Strategic Plan while
making important contribution to the United Nations Partnership for Development Framework
(UNPDF) outcomes. The CP was effective in supporting the Coronavirus Disease
(COVID-19) response in timely manner as well as addressing issues faced by refugee and
migrant children in Egypt.
Relevance
8. The CPD was developed using evidence-based data from Demographic and Health Survey
(DHS) and other reliable data sources. The Programme intended results were highly relevant
for enabling UNICEF to better align and respond to the GoE priorities, especially in regard to
boys’ and girls’ needs.
9. The initial result matrix of the CP was enriched during the implementation phase. However,
the CP had not developed a complete a Theory of Change (ToC) for the CP.

Upon expiry of the initial UN-SWAP duration, a second generation of the UN-SWAP was developed with widespread consultation across UN system entities and
launched in 2018). https://gendercoordinationandmainstreaming.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2022-02/UN-SWAP%202.0%20Brochure%202021.pdf
ix
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
Efficiency
10. The budget utilization rate is about 87 per cent. The European Union (EU) is discussing
with the GoE on its cooperation framework and is likely to decrease its financial support to
UNICEF in the coming years. Consequently, UNICEF will potentially face a budget gap in the
new CP as EU is one of its important donors.
11. In the nutrition sector, a study on the cost-of-service delivery was carried out to help
policy makers understand the potential benefits of scaling up key interventions and to identify
and prioritize the most cost-effective package of interventions. Another cost-effective analysis
was conducted on the Early Childhood Development (ECD) nursery model.
Effectiveness
12. Overall, the CP has good performance on effectiveness and the majority of outcomes and
outputs are achieved or are likely to be achieved.
13. The CP was successful in strengthening the Primary Health Care (PHC). It supported in
timely manner the COVID-19 response of the GoE. In 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic seems
to be under control. However, given that the COVID -19 pandemic has already impacted
households living in vulnerable situations and their children, the evaluation suggests that
UNICEF continues to support the GoE in mitigating the negative effects of the pandemic.
14. UNICEF supported MoSS to extend the social protection programme, Takaful and
Karama Programme (TKP) along with a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
system to address the high levels of poverty which have been exacerbated by the pandemic.
UNICEF also supported the TKP in establishing a national parenting programme contributing
to reduce the intergenerational poverty cycle.
15. The CP is supporting the Education 2.0 reform program through mainstreaming the Life
Skills and Education Citizenship Education (LSCE) framework, digitalization and
mainstreaming the Community-Based Education (CBE). The National Plan of Action (NPA)
of Ending Violence Against Children (EVAC) was finalized by a taskforce with UNICEF
support. UNICEF continues its efforts for addressing Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).
Furthermore, UNICEF supported NCCM and the National Council for Women (NCW) to
launch the first National Girls’ Empowerment Initiative, Dawwie focusing on addressing the
root causes of harmful practices in Egypt.
x
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
16. In terms of gender mainstreaming, few gender analysis were conducted during the
design of the CP. In addition, sex-disaggregated data were not reported systematically in the
annual reports and, different services were not delivered for girls and boys except for Child
Protection. Nevertheless, for the first time a gender transformative programme, Dawwie, has
been launched by the GoE with technical and financial support of UNICEF.
17. UNICEF has set functioning sectoral task forces. However, there are rooms of
improvement regarding coordination mechanisms. For instance, cross sectoral activities were
implemented at a relatively slow speed as each sector is focus on its own priorities.
18. The following pilot models are promising, but given their nature and magnitude, such
pilot interventions have not yet showcased enough results to positively influence impact
indicators.
− The ECD nursery pilot model is successful as it is based on a case investment study in ECD.
− UNICEF also continues its advocacy with MoSS to institutionalize the case management
system to protect children. This pilot case management system is part of the national alternative
care strategy was informed by two gap assessments on foster/alternative care systems and two
executive regulations introducing structural reforms to institutional childcare.
− The Meshwary pilot project that trained adolescents and youth to become
more economically and socially empowered is also a success. It has a potential to support key
adolescent development outcomes and has gained endorsement from the Prime Minister.
− The Dawwie program is expected to be expanded into a wider range of communities in order
to combat harmful practices such as FGM, child marriage rooted in social norms. As the
program has a great potential to positively influence impact indicators with a favorable echo
especially in rural community, UNICEF is currently working to establish a partnership with
the Haya Karima Presidential Initiative in coordination with NCW and United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) to scale up the Dawwie program.
− The positive parenting programme model proved to be very much welcomed by the GoE
and after being mainstreamed in the TKP is currently adopted by MoHP for the Primary Health
Units and will be mainstreamed in all Haya Karima villages.
Sustainability
19. The CP has shown good sustainability and a substantive contribution to the development
and improvement of the legal and policy framework in all focus areas of the CP. Evidence of
xi
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
sustainability should be more evident after the end of CP, but there are results across outcomes
which are already showing good sustainability prospects.
20. Support from UNICEF to the COVID-19 response and support to refugee children and
migrant in learning opportunity are examples of humanitarian-development nexus. The
frequency and complexity of humanitarian crises urge having a better risk-informed
programming and stronger systems for prevention, response and early recovery and then,
prevent being reactive in responding to emergency issues. The positive note is that UNICEF
Egypt CO has already developed a strategic framework for emergency preparedness which
explicitly connect shock responsive interventions and long-term development initiatives
especially for communities living in vulnerable situations.
Lessons Learned
21. Lessons emerge from the issues highlighted in this evaluation could be capitalized.
1) Looking through the COVID-19 window of opportunity for example in harnessing the
power of technology for learning and training purpose and Real Time Monitoring (RTM);
2) Well-functioning task-forces and other internal coordination mechanisms that UNICEF
has successfully implemented have facilitated the progress toward results should continue
and be strengthened
3) Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, many external factors have facilitated the progress
toward results such as legislative reforms and presidential initiatives
4) Pilot models through UNICEF’s support were successful in such a short timeframe.
Depending on budget availability some of those pilot initiatives should be continued and
scaled up.
Recommendations
Recommendation 1: Improve the documentation of the CP by (a) developing a comprehensive
ToC for the entire new CP; (b) setting up all baseline and target indicators and (c) develop
strategic notes for Programme components. To fill data gaps the office should conduct a
evidence gap mapping exercise and plan for relevant research to fill these gaps.
Recommendation 2: Strengthen the ability of UNICEF to leverage funds for children.
Recommendation 3: Strengthen internal task forces and other coordination mechanisms to
maximize the coherence and effectiveness of CO programming.
Recommendation 4: Continue the effort in mitigating the negative impact of the pandemic
through technical assistance and financial support and also support the GoE with systematic
and long-term social and behavioral change programmes.
xii
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
Recommendation 5: continue advocacy and service delivery for innovative, promising and
newly implemented models and projects namely: community based ECD models, positive
parenting, case management system to protect children, adolescent and youth participation and
girls’ empowerment.
Recommendation 6: Prioritize the finalization and implementation of the strategic framework
for emergency preparedness to support resilient and shock-responsive activities while focusing
interventions where possible in the most vulnerable communities for the new CP.

I. BACKGROUND AND COUNTRY CONTEXT
22. This report presents the findings of the final evaluation of the 2018–2022 CP of UNICEF
Egypt. The evaluation was managed by UNICEF MENARO in close collaboration with
UNICEF CO in Egypt which commissioned the evaluation. It has covered the entire UNICEF
portfolio during the first four years of the five-year Programme. This strategic evaluation
complements the sectoral evaluations and studies that have been carried out by UNICEF and
external experts.
23. The CP had an initial budget of US$ 94,205,000 and was successful in securing up to
US$ 134,578,381. The CP aimed to support poverty reduction efforts as well as the elimination
of disparities through early interventions that represent effective developmental investments.
It prioritizes interventions focused on strengthening equity of access for and equitable impact
on all children. The main partners of UNICEF were government ministries, agencies and
departments at national, governorate and district level and Civil Society Organizations (CSO).
24. The section 1 of this report describes the context within which UNICEF has been
operating, and outlines the main components of the CP. The section 2 describes the purpose,
objectives and scope of the evaluation. Section 3 is focus on evaluation methodology, it
describes methodology of the evaluation including the evaluation framework, data collection
and sampling strategies, data collection tools, limitations and challenges faced by the
evaluation. This section also highlights ethical considerations. Findings resulting from the
evaluation are presented in section 4 which is organized according to the main evaluation
criteria (coherence, relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability) and the evaluation
questions. The assessment of each criterion is followed by a partial conclusion and
recommendations. Based on findings, lessons learnt and recommendations are presented in
section 5.
1.1. Background and country context
1.1.1. Geographic and demographic context
25. The Arab Republic of Egypt is located in northeastern Africa and is bordered by the
Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, Libya to the west, Sudan to the south, and Israel and the
Gaza Strip to the east. With an area of 1,002,450 km2, Egypt counts a population of
1
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
approximately 102.5 million3. The country has the third largest population after Nigeria and
Ethiopia in Africa.
26. According to the Population, Housing and Establishment Census conducted in 2017, the
estimated annual growth rate for the inter-census period reached 2.56 per cent. The current
population of Egypt is expected to double by 20784. Egypt has a relatively young population,
where about 40 per cent of the total population are below 18, about 57 per cent of the total
population lives in the rural areas.
1.1.2. Economic context
27. Egypt is a low middle-income country and its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by
an estimated 5.6 per cent in 2019 but due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic it was
reduced by two percentage points in 2020.5
28. According to the latest income and expenditure survey conducted by the Central Agency
for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS), the poverty rate is about three in ten (29.7
per cent) Egyptians below the national poverty line. To address the COVID-19 pandemic
challenges, the GoE has reacted via a series of policies and a stimulus package of USD 6.4
billion or almost 2 per cent of GDP6.
1.1.3. Political context and government priorities
29. Since 2011, Egypt has witnessed a period of political change7. However, in 2021, the
country continued to benefit from overall political, economic and fiscal stability. The GoE
launched its first SDS also known as Egypt Vision 2030 in February 2016.
30. Egypt is a country of transit and destination for refugees and the country currently hosts
more than 5 million refugees and migrants.
31. Since 2015, public spending on access to basic services grew from 13.6 per cent as a
percentage of total government spending in 2018 to 29.8 per cent in 2020. Similarly, public
spending on health and education grew from 4.9 per cent to 6.1 per cent and from 8.8 per cent
to 10.1 per cent respectively during the same period.

1.1.4. Child poverty
32. Egypt has made significant progress to improve child wellbeing. Nevertheless, a study
on child multidimensional poverty conducted by UNICEF in 20178 found that Egypt continues
to face challenges to realizing the rights of every child to a fair chance in life. The rate of
multidimensional child poverty is about 29.5 per cent, in Egypt (equivalent to approximately
10 million children).
33. Large geographical disparities can be observed in multidimensional poverty and rural
areas have a higher level of multidimensional poverty and intensity of deprivation where 2 in
5 under five children are poor compared to 1 in 4 in urban areas (see Figure 2).
Figure 2: Multidimensionally Poor Children
1.1.5. Education in Egypt
34. Egypt is home to the largest school system in the Middle East with more than 22 million
students. Egypt has near-universal access to primary education and boys and girls attend school
at nearly equal rates. Over the past 20 years, girls’ enrolment in school has risen greatly. In
2000/2001, the girls’ enrolment rate was 96.2 per cent, while the boys’ enrolment was 99.6 per
cent (Langsten and Hassan, 2018; El-Saharty, Richardson and Chase, 2005). Even so, it is
noteworthy that the enrolment of girls has increased faster than that of boys. For instance, in
2019/2020, the net enrolment rate was 102 per cent for girls and 98 per cent for boys (see
Figure 3).

dataset has shown that the dropout rate in basic education schools of children aged 6-14 years
is limited to 1.6 percent (El-Laithy, 2021)9. Although this percentage seems small, it is still
significant given that this is the compulsory basic form of education. In secondary schools, the
dropout rate reached almost 15 percent. Females, poor students and those in rural Upper Egypt
have the highest rates with rates that reached 17.3 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively for
girls and boys.
36. Despite the increasing levels of educational attainment among the youth and the
progressively narrowing gaps between genders in education, university graduates suffer from
high unemployment rates, especially females. As of 2020, the unemployment rate for Egyptian
youth between 15 to 24 years of age was 30 per cent unemployment, with 25 per cent among
males and 42 per cent among females (Danish Trade Development Unit, 2020)10.
37. The primary Education completion rate in Egypt is already universal surpassing 100 per
cent in 2019, but the pre-primary net enrollment rates remain relatively low around 25 per cent
in 2019/2020 (see figure 3).
Figure 3: Net enrolment rates (per cent) in Egypt

38. Even though girls’ school enrolment has risen significantly over the past years, there is
a high dropout rate. About 71 per cent of boys completed schooling up to the secondary level,
while only 68 percent of girls completed the same grades. The figures of MoETE place out of

school children at 15.9 per cent at the primary level, with a gender gap of 3 per cent at the
national level, and widening at sub-national levels, particularly in rural Upper Egypt11.
39. The quality of education remains a major challenge preventing children from developing
their full potential and contributing to the society in the long term. For instance, in a recent
Learning Poverty Assessment of the World Bank (2020)12, in Egypt, educators noted that over
70 per cent of children age 10 couldn’t read or comprehend an age-appropriate text.
40. As the instruction has traditionally focused on exams rather than on developing critical
thinking and practical skills, MoETE is implementing a global educational reform known as
Education 2.0 which aims to meet the aspirations of Egypt Vision 2030. Since September 2018,
MoETE has started key reforms to expand education to include pre-primary education and
strengthen Grades 1 and 2 of primary education in disadvantaged areas. The education 2.0
reform also integrates the traditional curriculum with life skills inspired by the LSCE
framework of UNICEF in the Middle East and North Africa framework.
41. Egypt is one of the Arab countries that give special attention to the rights of Persons with
Disabilities through articles in the Egyptian Constitution (2014) that ensure equal educational
opportunities to all people with and without disabilities inside the educational faculties’
institutions. The number of persons with disabilities is estimated at 10 per cent to 12 per cent
according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
1.1.6. Child Health, nutrition and Early development in Egypt
42. Egypt is committed to achieve the universal right to high quality healthcare, and then
worked towards building and maintaining an inclusive and effective healthcare system that
guarantees high quality healthcare services and promotes overall wellbeing. As a result, key
national health indicators have improved:
− Maternal mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 live births) has improved from 45.9 in 2016 to
42.8 in 201913,

43. Good results have been achieved in reducing malnutrition among children. For example,
the rate of stunting among children under 5 years of age dropped from 22.7 per cent to 15.5
per cent, wasting from 8 per cent to 3 per cent, and anemia from 27 per cent to 22.3 per cent
all from 2015 to 2018 (see Figure 5). Despite important improvements in health and nutrition
sector, there are challenges related to the access to basic social services. Regional disparities
remain substantial in child survival in the most disadvantaged areas of the country, especially
in rural areas.

significant number of households are still not connected with the water system in rural areas
and in urban slums.

1.1.7. Violence against children, child marriage and Female Genital Mutilation
45. Many legislative instruments protecting children’s rights in Egypt advocate for children
to live free from violence at home, at school and among their peers. The legislation on
children’s rights includes the Egyptian Constitution of 2014, the Convention on the Rights of
the Child, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the Egyptian Child
Law.
46. The rate of violence against children remains high in Egypt. For instance, 93 percent of
children (1-14 years) are exposed to some form of violent discipline by their parents and/or
caregivers, which include physical and psychological violence (2014 DHS) and 65 per cent of
students (13-17 years) have experienced physical violence in school (UNICEF-NCCM 2015
study). Only 4 per cent of children are disciplined using an approach that is exclusively
violence-free.
47. Furthermore, a study on violence against Children in Egypt16 conducted by UNICEF and
NCCM in 2014 in Cairo, Alexandria and Assiut pointed out that two thirds of the children were
victims of physical violence, and 78 per cent were victims of emotional violence. The study
also highlighted the very high prevalence of FGM (65 per cent in Cairo, 39 per cent in
Alexandria, and 94 per cent in Assiut), as well as the fact that children and adults largely
consider violence against children as an acceptable means of discipline.
48. Despite prohibitions on FGM, its practice remains highly prevalent (about 25 per cent),
with large regional disparities. National statistics have shown that 87 per cent of ever married
women 15-49 have undergone FGM (2015 Egypt Health Issues Survey) and 70 per cent of
women and girls aged 15-19 years have undergone FGM. Focusing on girls aged 15 to 17, 61
per cent of girls aged 15 to 17 have undergone FGM as per the 2014 DHS. These mutilations
have serious physical and psychological consequences on young girls. Since the FGM
procedure is often performed by medical practitioners, in 2016, the Egyptian People’s
Assembly approved an amendment of article that aims to deter perpetrators of FGM by
expanding the previous criminal penalty of up to seven years’ imprisonment to imprisonment
for up to 20 years.

49. Around 17 per cent of women between 20 and 24 years old admitted to having
been married before the age of 18 (2014 DHS). These marriages often have serious
consequences on the health of young girls. Since 2008, the minimum age required to marry by
the Personal Status Code is 18, for girls as well as for boys.
1.2. Overview of the Country Programme components
1.2.1. Country Programme budget
50. The CPD was approved with an initial budget of US$ 94.2 million for the 5 years country
program of which about 15 per cent (US$ 14.2 million) is Regular Resources (RR) and US$
80 million is Other Resources (OR).
51. This budget has increased over time and then in 2021, USD$134,578,381 was secured up
with UNICEF core resources represent 25 per cent (USD$33.5 million). The weight of RR was
also increased from 15 per cent to 25 per cent of the total budget (see Figure 6)

Development: Social Protection; Health, Nutrition and Population; Education and Protection.
The CP objective is: by 2022 interim 2030 targets are reached with respect to population and
sustainable access of all people in Egypt to public services notably quality, equitable, inclusive
and rights-based social protection, health and education services.
53. The UNICEF CP is contributing to the 2018-2022 UNPDF through four outcomes (See
Table 1).
1.2.2.1. Social inclusion and data programme
54. This component supports the GoE to consolidate and expand social protection programs
to address the high levels of poverty which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

1.2.2.2. Child survival and early development programme
55. The component counts four pillars: good health, adequate nutrition, opportunities for
early learning responsive caregiving and Communication for Development (C4D) activities.
1.2.2.3. Learning and protection programme
56. This component is focus on learning and protection through system strengthening and
enhancing quality service delivery. It also includes adolescent participation, C4D and Social
& Behavioral Change which focuses on addressing root causes of behaviors through two
strands of work positive parenting and girls’ empowerment (gender transformative
programming).
1.2.2.4. Programme effectiveness
57. This component supports efficient and effective planning, management, monitoring and
quality assurance of the program, ensures close linkages and coordination between UNICEF
and the implementation of the 2018-2022 UNPDF, and the national Vision 2030. The
component includes partnerships and advocacy and, key cross-cutting areas to support results
across all outcomes such as C4D, gender mainstreaming, integration of disaster risk reduction,
emergency preparedness and support to subnational coordination.

II. PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF THE
EVALUATION
2.1. Evaluation purpose
58. The main purpose of this evaluation is for learning and accountability. It aims to produce
an independent, objective and useful assessment of the CP achievements, to demonstrate
accountability to the stakeholders, draw lessons learnt and development specific
recommendations.
2.2. Evaluation objective
59. The evaluation was intended to inform the new CP development process building on the
Mid Term Review. The evaluation sought to explore the extent to which the CP has achieved
the intended results and the value it has added to improve child rights in general and for most
vulnerable children and regions.
60. The evaluation is also forward looking as it intended to inform the development of the
new CPD (2023-2027).
61. The specific objectives of the evaluation are the following:
− Assess the relevance and effectiveness of the Programme;
− Assess the Programme results and achievements and document key factors that have
facilitated or hindered achievement of results;
− Assess efficiency in use of resources in delivering the programs;
− Assess the program sustainability plan and suggest sustainability measures;
− Assess the contribution of the CP to upstream policy, strategy and other system level
support in promoting child rights in alignment to the emerging national priorities and
towards contributing to SDGs;
− Assess the Programme performance in reaching more vulnerable children17, adolescence
and youth in improving learning, protection, participation, better health and wellbeing;
− Document key Programme learnings as an alternative delivery modality;
− Assess the extent the design and the interventions of the CPD integrate cross cutting issues:
gender, youth, child rights, children with disability, equity;
− Provide concrete recommendations to improve the design and relevance of the CP to the
UNICEF Strategic Plan.
Including children with disabilities, adolescent girls

Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
2.3. Scope and focus of the evaluation
2.3.1. Thematic Scope
62. The scope of the evaluation includes four components of the Programme: the social
inclusion and data programme, the survival and early development programme, the learning
and protection programme and the programme effectiveness component that covers program
management and coordination and cross-cutting areas such as C4D, gender mainstreaming,
integration of disaster risk reduction and emergency preparedness.
2.3.2. Geographic and temporal scope
63. The evaluation provides an assessment of the CP from the inception in 2018 to 2021. The
evaluation was a nationwide focus on UNICEF contribution to the GoE effort to address
priority in child health and early development, child protection and learning and child poverty
as well as data gaps on SDG indicators related to children.
64. As this is an evaluation of a CP, the predominant focus was on institutional support in
high level dialogue and the GoE commitment to advance child rights. The evaluation has
assessed UNICEF effort in strengthening national capacity to improve effectiveness and
efficiency of service delivery for children, adolescents. The evaluation has also assessed the
extent to which CSOs and other implementing partners were effective in programming and
service delivery.
65. In addition, due to the significance of the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications for
the CP, the evaluation looked at the impact of the pandemic on the Programme.
2.4. Key Stakeholders and their interest in the evaluation
66. The key intended audience of the evaluation, with interest, expected uses and role in the
evaluation processes for each stakeholder are listed (see Table 2). UNICEF, the line ministries
involved, implementing partners are expected to be the primary intended users of this
evaluation findings. UNICEF is expected to use the findings to inform the next programmatic
cycle and ministries are expected to use the evaluation findings to develop and implement
policy directives to improve child rights if different areas.

III. EVALUATION APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY
3.1. Evaluation approach
67. This Terminal evaluation comprises two complementary approaches: A ToC approach
and a Logical Framework analysis. The CP has not developed a ToC for the entire Programme
but two specific ToC and strategy notes were developed for Outcome 2 (Survival and Early
Development) and Outcome 3 (Protection and Learning). In addition, a Results and Resources
framework has been developed.
3.2. The theory of change
68. The ToC represents the main hypothesis that this evaluation is attempting to assess
against the main questions in the evaluation matrix. The evaluation assessed the ToC and the
Results and Resources Framework that has been developed. This review has been completed
with interviews with and suggestions from the Management Team of the CP.
3.2.1 Potential risks
69. The main risks identified during the design of the CP included:
1) the volatility of the political and socioeconomic environment in the region, and its potential
negative impacts on Egypt;
2) chronic conflicts in neighboring countries; changing funding priorities for donors;
3) economic slowdown and increasing vulnerabilities as a result of national economic reforms.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic appeared in 2020, additional challenges are to be taken into
account in the implementation of the CP.
3.2.2. Risks and mitigation strategies
70. UNICEF has planned to review the likelihood and impact of those risks on an annual
basis and make programme adjustments, including geographic targeting, as necessary.
3.3. Evaluation criteria and questions
3.3.1. Evaluation criteria
71. The evaluation covered the criteria of Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development and Development Assistance Committee but not assessing connectedness or
impact given the nature of the Programme: Coherence, relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and
sustainability. In addition, the evaluation included cross cutting elements of gender, equity and
human rights-based approaches.
17
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
3.3.2. Evaluation questions
72. The Term of References comprises high-level key questions which provided framing for
more specific evaluation questions.
Coherence
To what extent is the CP supporting national priorities and SDGs? How has the Programme
aligned with the COVID-19 response of the government?
Relevance
To what extent does the CP align with the key priorities for boys and girls in different
categories in Egypt?
Efficiency:
To what extent has the Programme used the most cost-efficient implementation methods?
To what extent have the Programme management arrangements been efficient?
Effectiveness
To what extent has the CP achieved its objectives and results or is likely to achieve them?
How were cross-cutting issues taken into account?
What worked well in achieving CP results that should be replicated or scaled up at the design
of the next CP?
What factors (political, sociological, economic, etc.) have affected the outcomes, either
positively or negatively? How have these factors limited or facilitated progress towards
the outputs?
What are the unanticipated effects of the CP either positively or negatively?
How has COVID-9 affected the CP?
Sustainability
To what extent have initiatives from the CP resulted in the GoE policies and procedures
supporting boys and girls?
To what extent has capacity building for government resulted in improved services for boys
and girls?
73. The proposed questions in the original Term of References were discussed and
streamlined during the inception phase, and this resulted in:
a) the addition of sub-questions, indicators and data sources next to each evaluation question;
b) the identification of cross-cutting issues such as Gender, Human Rights and Equity;
c) the identification of refugee crisis and the COVID-19 Pandemic as issues that could have
affected the CP implementation.
d) In addition, the evaluation assessed partnership and the humanitarian-development nexus.

3.4. Evaluation methodology
74. The evaluation was carried out following the UNEG Norms and Standards and the
evaluation report is prepared following the Handbook of Global Evaluation Report Oversight
System handbook18. The evaluation incorporates the human rights-based and gender
perspective and applied Results-Based Management (RBM) principles and logical framework
analysis.
75. The evaluation relied on diverse, both quantitative and qualitative information that was
triangulated. It utilized a diverse range of data collection methods that include: systematic
document review, quantitative data analysis and semi-structured online interviews.
3.4.1. Documentation review
76. The desk review uncovered sources of usable secondary data, thus let primary data
collection be focus on how to overcome limitations in terms of quality and availability of
secondary data as well. It included:
− Policies and programme content analysis;
− Document and evidence review.
3.4.2. Qualitative data collection and analysis
77. The KII were conducted with representatives from key stakeholders’ groups: specialists
and Senior Management Team from UNICEF Egypt CO, high level officials from ministries,
staff from implementing partners and donors.
Sampling of Key Informant Interviews
78. Out of 40 key informants invited, 34 responded/participated and this represents a
completion rate of 85 per cent. Twenty-one (21) women participated in the KII; this represents
62 per cent of participants. Thirteen men participated in KII and this represents 38 per cent
(detail list of participants at annex 3). The interviews were conducted with 14 participants from
UNICEF, 10 key informants from the Government, 5 participants from the implementing
partners and 5 participants from the donors.

Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
79. Due to COVID-19 outbreak, online interviews were used for primary data collection. A
script was designed with the aim to structure the contents of the semi-structured interviews
following the results chain from inputs to outcomes (see annex 4).
3.4.3. Data analysis
80. The quantitative analysis at the national level was conducted to assess the progress made
in outcome indicators. Using available secondary data from both the quantitative national
database and the evidence and document review, a trend analysis for outcome indicators was
undertaken with the aim of understanding underlying bottlenecks that impede the progress
against CP results. The evaluation has also performed analysis drawing upon Programme
financial expenditures. Qualitative data was analyzed in line with the contribution analysis
approach, whereby the assumptions that underpin the ToC was assessed.
3.4.4 Management of the evaluation
81. The evaluation was undertaken by a consultant who developed a detailed evaluation
design during the inception phase. He collected all necessary data, completed data analysis and
presented findings to key stakeholders. During the entire process, the consultant worked in
close consultation with the MENARO Regional Evaluation Advisor who has ensured quality
assurance.
82. In addition to UNICEF Egypt CO Management Team, the keys stakeholders for this
evaluation are the donors, relevant Government partners and implementing partners that have
signed joint annual work plans with UNICEF.
3.4.5. Ethical requirements
83. The evaluation follows the UNEG Norms and Standards as well as the UNICEF Ethical
Guidelines for Evaluation19for conducting Ethical Research Involving Children and Ethical
Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research and followed the
three principles of:
(i) Respect for Persons;
(ii) Beneficence; and;
(iii) Justice.

Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
84. The evaluation was based on the following principles of independence, impartiality,
credibility, absence of conflicts of interest and accountability.
85. For all interviewees’, an informed consent was obtained. Informed consent includes the
ethical components as following:
(i) transparency about the objectives and content of the study;
(ii) privacy and data security;
(iii) voluntary participation;
(iv) the right of participants to refuse or skip any questions without incurring any
consequence;
(v) a follow-up to inform or receive complaints and supply any further information about the
study.
86. Before data collection phase, protocols for the protection of human subjects in the
evaluation were assessed through a research ethics review by “HML Institutional Review
Board” (see a copy of the certificate in Annex 8).
87. In regard to the adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation was carried out
remotely without travel to Egypt. Then, there was no need to apply the respect of COVID-19
pandemic barrier measures required for in-person data collection.
3.5. Limitations and constraints faced by the evaluation
3.5.1. Issues in baseline and target setting
88. A substantial number of baselines and/or targets had not been established and were
expected to be completed with DHS data given that a DHS was planned for 2017 and another
was expected for 2021. As the last comprehensive DHS was 2014 with a special edition
published in 2015, the reliance on the DHS data caused challenges as a DHS. So, in the adapted
CP result framework, data sources had been changed. To overcome those challenges, the
evaluation used a proxy for indicators or relied on previous reports indicators.
3.5.2. Limited disaggregated data
89. There was a limited availability of disaggregated data related to the situation of children
and across different vulnerable groups (gender, location disability). Mitigation strategies were
a strong emphasis on triangulation for increasing reliability and additional disaggregated data
collection to the extent possible.
24
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
3.5.3. The timing of the evaluation
90. The timing of the evaluation had limitations because the data collection phase was fallen
in December – January, when stakeholders were on tight deadlines to complete their annual
reports. Care was taken to ensure that before the interview, the interview guide was shared
with the interviewee to avoid time wasting.
25
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
IV. FINDINGS OF THE EVALUATION
4.1 Coherence
91. The key questions related to the coherence criterion are as follows:
1) To what extent is the CP supporting national priorities and SDGs?
2) How has the Programme aligned with the COVID-19 response of the government?
In order to answer the above questions, the evaluation assessed the CP alignment with national
priorities and international development agendas and the effectiveness of the CP in responding
to specific/urgent requests from government.
4.1.1. Country Programme alignment with national priorities and key development
issues
92. During the design of the CP, UNICEF learned from national reforms that have been
undertaken since 2014. Lessons learned from the previous CP was also an opportunity for a
more focused, strategic and cross-sectoral programme. Thus, UNICEF improved its work with
a more focus on an upstream level focused on policy advices and capacity building. This
decision was based on the needs and requests from the GoE and then, the CPD was articulated
around three core programme components:
1) The Social Inclusion and Data component;
2) The Child Survival and Early Development (CSED) including health, Nutrition, ECD and
Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH). This component includes also the parenting
programme focusing equally on skills building and social support;
3) The learning and Protection component (Learning, Child Protection) and C4D.
The Programme effectiveness component includes Communication, Planning and M&E,
Operations.
93. The evaluation assessed the alignment of the CP with the main policy document of the
GoE: the SDS. It is the governing framework for all development programs to be implemented
until 2030 and counts ten priority pillars.
1- Economic development
2- Energy,
3- Knowledge, innovation and scientific research,
4- Transparency and efficient government institutions,
5- Social justice,
6- Health,
7- Education and training,
8- Culture,
26
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
9- Environment,
10- Urban development.
94. The outcomes of the CP resonate with four out of the 10 pillars of the SDS as shown in
below (see table 4):
(1) social justice;
(2) Health;
(3) Education and training;
(4) Knowledge, innovation and scientific research.
95. Furthermore, the CP were designed to have multiplier effect on other pillars including
pillar 1 (Economic development), Pillar 9 (environment), Pillar 4 (Transparency and efficient
government institutions).
Table 4: Country Programme outcomes and related SDS pillars
CP programme components SDS Pillars
Outcome 1: social inclusion and 5: Social justice
data 3: Knowledge, innovation and scientific research
Outcome 2: CSED 6: Health
7: Education and training
Outcome 3: learning and 7: Education and training
protection 5: Social justice
96. As the SDS is committed to guarantee growth, development, and prosperity for future
generations, it aims to improve the Egyptians’ quality of life and raise their living standards
while achieving social justice and equality. The SDS is primarily focused on economic
development and growth but it also takes into account rights-based approaches. Even some
areas such as child protection and ECD are not directly listed as key pillars, they are fully
considered in the SDS document.
97. The CP is consistent with the country priorities enshrined in the SDS. The intended
outcomes of the CP are also aligned with key sector strategic documents (national strategies)
in the areas of education, health, social protection and justice as well as cross-cutting issues
such as women empowerment.

Program effectiveness:
Ensure that the CP is efficiently designed, coordinated, managed and supported to meet quality programming standards in achieving results for children.
98. The CP is also aligned with the 2014 Constitution that provides opportunities for
improving the national child rights system. This Constitution explicitly mentions fundamental
rights, including the right to identity, basic services and protection, including the provision that
the state will establish a judicial system for child victims and witnesses as well as safeguards
against detention of children.
4.1.2. Country Programme alignment with the SDG, UNPDF and UNICEF Strategic
Plan
Country Programme alignment with SDG
99. The CP was based on the priorities identified in the SDS document, which document is
fully aligned with the 17 SDGs, as well as the African Agenda 2063.
100. The Social inclusion outcomes directly addressed the SDG1 (no poverty), SDG 5 related
to gender equality and reducing inequality (SDG 10). In a context where three in every 10
Egyptians are in monetary poverty and a similar proportion of children in multidimensional
poverty, the CP was intended to address the poverty issues including advanced work on
multidimensional child poverty and deprivations as well as support to national, targeted
conditional cash transfers for most vulnerable children living in poverty.
101. UNICEF had committed to most of the targets under SDG 3 (related to health) and SDG
4.2 related to ECD, care and pre-primary education. The strategy concerning health included
strengthening the PHC systems and maintaining health and nutrition services in spite of
COVID-19 while supporting the COVID-19 response of the GoE including supply and
awareness for vaccination.
102. The component related education and learning is focuses on improving quality education,
ECD and pre-primary education (SDG 4) in line with national reforms and government
priorities, that bridges the first 1,000 days through to the early years of formal education.
103. Regarding child protection, the focus is on social norms to strengthen girls’
empowerment, reduce harmful practices such as FGM, child marriage and optimize positive
parenting. This CP component is aligned with SDG 5 (gender equality), and reduced
inequalities (SDG-10).
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
Country Programme alignment with UNPDF
104. The UNPDF -2018-2022 in Egypt is composed of four outcomes:
1) Inclusive Economic Development,
2) Social Justice,
3) Environmental Sustainability and Natural Resource Management,
4) Women’s Empowerment.
105. UNICEF worked towards reinforcing its comparative advantages in achieving directly
two outcomes: outcome 2 (social justice that comprises health, nutrition and population,
education, social protection) and outcome 4 (Women’s Empowerment) whilst also ensuring
national ownership through encouraging the collective contribution of national initiatives, key
stakeholders and government entities as well as all relevant United Nations agencies.
Country Programme alignment with UNICEF Strategic plan 2018-2021
106. The CP is also aligned with the UNICEF’s Five Global Goal Areas identified by the
UNICEF Strategic plan 2018-2021 namely:
1. Every child survives and thrives,
2. Every child is protected from violence and exploitation
3. Every child learns,
4. Every child has an equitable chance in life
5. Every child lives in a safe and clean environment
107. It is worth mentioning that in terms of access to safe and clean environment, UNICEF
key interventions were about WASH, embedded in the CSED outcome. The same programme
component has started developing interventions that address climate change issues.
108. As the global SDGs has called for quality early childhood experiences, UNICEF has
placed a greater emphasis on improving early learning which is also a priority for the GoE.
ECD is part of the transformative agenda for 2030, making it an international priority for the
21st century.
109. The global targets in education (SDG 4.2), health (SDG 3.2), nutrition (SDG 2.2), and
protection (SDG 16.2) addressed key issues to realize young children’s developmental
potential.
110. The CP outcomes and outputs respond to the strategic objectives of UNICEF and most
of them are clearly covered. Although, more explicit emphasis can be placed in future on
improving the equitable use of safe drinking water, sanitation and healthy environments, some
30
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
specific outputs can also address the aim of lowering the risk of natural disasters, including
those from climate change.
4.1.3. Country Programme Ability to respond to urgent requests from Government: the
COVID-19 response
111. The CP that was aligned with national priorities and international development agenda
was also planned to review the likelihood and impact of key risks on an annual basis and make
programme adjustments, including geographic targeting, as necessary.
112. The most significant urgent request from the GoE was the COVID-19 outbreak in
February 2020 in Egypt. The response of UNICEF was intense and timely and it consisted of
a rapid mobilization of additional funds. It also led to the response of the international
community, the mobilization of other sources of funds. For example, UNICEF launched a joint
tender in April 2020 on behalf of several United Nations Agencies for the period covering till
the end of 2020 for access to Personal Protective Equipment supplies for COVID-19. On a
parallel front, UNICEF had worked on preventative actions to protect the health of children
and their parents and caregivers. The programmatic response of UNICEF to the COVID-19
pandemic was changed, in the sense of being more sustainable taking into account the impact
of the pandemic.
113. Other major emergency issue that required an important response from UNICEF was the
refugee crisis especially, the need to support migrant and refugee children.
Conclusion
114. The CP-2018-2022 is fully aligned with the SDS covering the following pillars: social
justice, Health, Education and training, Knowledge, innovation and scientific research. The CP
was also aligned with national sectoral strategies.
115. The CP is aligned with many SDG, the African Agenda 2063 as well as UNICEF
Strategic Plan 2018-2021. It has made important contribution to UNPDF outcomes.
116. The CP was effective in supporting the Government response of COVID-19 in a timely
manner. It has also implemented programmes to address issues related to the refugee crisis
especially, for children in vulnerable situations and their family.
31
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
4.2. Relevance
To what extent does the CP align with the key priorities for boys and girls in different categories
in Egypt?
In answering the above question, the evaluation assessed the extent to what:
1) The CP used evidence-based data to identify and address challenges faced by boys and girls
in relevant areas in Egypt.
2) The CP designed relevant tools such as ToC, Result & Resource Framework, Programme
Strategy notes.
4.2.1. Evidence-base data to identify and address key challenges for boys and girls
117. The main priority areas of the CPD and its results framework were intended to address
the needs of vulnerable children and their families. The following are examples of studies and
consultation processes that have informed the design of the CPD.
4.2.1.1. Egypt Demographic and Health Survey – 2014
118. The main source of quantitative data to inform the CPD process was the DHS conducted
in Egypt in 2014. This DHS report has shown key improvements and challenges in maternal
and child health indicators, including nutrition and medical assistance. The report has also
included in-depth analysis on birth registration, disabilities among young children, ECD,
primary and secondary school education, child labor, child discipline and FGM.
119. Almost indicators presented in the DHS report are disaggregated by sex, households’
characteristics and wealth quintile. Most indicators were estimated and presented at national
as well as the governorate level.
Household Income, Expenditure and Consumption Survey (2017/2018)
120. Carried out by the CAPMAS, the nationally representative Household Income,
Expenditure and Consumption Survey that ended in September 2018, is the principal source
of data for poverty in Egypt including child poverty.
121. Up to date information on household living conditions let drawing poverty maps that are
essential component to design efficient programs to eradicate poverty. For instance, poverty
indicators were crucial for TKP that UNICEF supports in different ways including:
Highlighting geographic variations, understanding poverty determinants, selecting and
designing interventions, identify better targeting mechanisms and monitoring progress.
32
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
4.2.1.2. Study on multidimensional poverty in Egypt-2017
122. This study utilized the Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis to identify the main
deprivations on several aspects of children’s well-being.
123. The poverty indicators were estimated and presented by sex and at the governorate level.
The study helped the government to revise its interventions to better address the needs of
children and to achieve a more equitable environment for all children and also recommended
the following:
− Policies to reduce multidimensional child poverty:
− Integrated response for ECD,
− Systemic response to end violence against children,
− National action plan to address malnutrition,
− Develop programmes targeting different socioeconomic characteristics given that the
incidence of multidimensional poverty differs widely by child age, geographic location,
and child and household socioeconomic characteristics.
4.2.1.3. Violence against children in Egypt-2015
124. Carried out in Cairo, Alexandria and Assiut, this study provided an in-depth overview of
the status of children and adolescents in the country in regard to violence. Quantitative Survey
has provided evidence on the magnitude and pattern of physical, emotional and gender-based
violence affecting children in Egypt. The qualitative part of the study provided inputs on the
perceptions of children and adults on the issue of violence against children.
125. Overall, the report has called for the GoE to uphold a zero-tolerance policy on violence
against children, and has provided the means and tools to help parents, care givers and schools’
staff to use positive discipline methods with children.
4.2.1.4. Evaluation of Takaful and Karma Program impacts
126. Egypt has been providing cash to poor households through its first conditional cash
transfer program, TKP, a social protection program run by MoSS, since March 2015.
127. The TKP was evaluated by the International Food Policy Research Institute using both
quantitative statistical methods and qualitative methods The evaluation was designed to
measure and explain the impacts of the cash transfers on household welfare, and to examine
whether the program’s criteria for household selection were effective in identifying poor
households (Breisinger, ElDidi, El-Enbaby, Gilligan, Karachiwalla, Kassim, Kurdi, Jilani and
Thai, 2018).
33
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
128. The main findings from the evaluation can be summarized as following:
− Beneficiaries report that program implementation works well.
− Impacts on households’ consumption are positive and helped the poor to cope with rising
prices
− The program improves the quality of diets and then, improved the nutritional status for
children under the age of two years
− Takaful increased household spending on school supplies and transportation to school
129. Based on the findings, the evaluation recommended:
- To continue to fund the program and expand coverage.
- Improve targeting to increase participation of excluded poor households, especially in
urban areas.
- Increase transparency in the beneficiary selection process.
UNICEF support to KTP is in line with the above recommendations in expanding the coverage
of the programme, improving the selection process of the beneficiaries and support the
development of a M&E framework for TKP.
4.2.1.5. Consultation process with stakeholders to inform the design of the CPD -2017
130. The stakeholders who participated to the KII during the evaluation have acknowledged
the high-level adequacy of the CPD with its implementation strategies.
131. Key ministries that participated in the consultation process including: the Ministry of
International Cooperation, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Planning and Economic
Development (MoPED), NCCM, MoHP, MoSS and MoETE.
132. CSOs, Non-Governmental Organizations, religious leaders and academia have also
participated to the development process of the CPD.
133. Other important development partners were also consulted namely: WHO, UNFPA, EU,
World Food Programme, World Bank, the International Organization for Migration and the
United Nations High Commission for Refugees.
134. The CP was designed with the assumption that the government would gradually assume
responsibility for the direct implementation of the programme. Thus, UNICEF was expected
34
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
to be more focused on providing institutional support to the major priority components known
as upstream model.
4.2.2. Did the Country Programme address key priorities for boys and girls in Egypt?
135. Learning from previous CP and based on available data, the CP was designed along with
interventions that addressed most pressing needs of the children and their families, especially
in the areas of education and learning, health, child poverty, child protection and the
abandonment of harmful practices. Moreover, UNICEF has increasingly responded to the
humanitarian needs of children not only with respect to refugee areas, but also with regards to
the negative impact on the economy due to COVID-19.
136. It is important to acknowledge that the context of Egypt has changed significantly since
the CP was designed; in particular with the economic deterioration, shocks due to COVID-19.
In fact, the current CP was designed in 2017 in a different context, with UNICEF Egypt making
a shift in programming, and hence development activities focused on activities such as
advocacy, knowledge management, systems strengthening accompanied with interventions on
service delivery on particular intervention areas.
137. In the education and learning component, the CP has high focus on increasing the pre-
primary education enrollment rate and improving the quality of education in all level of
education system. The CPD explicitly identified weak quality, low learning outcomes and
associated dropout rates as key issues to address. According to the CPD, half of the students
do not learn foundational skills and perform at the bottom of international learning assessments.
The teaching approach generally focuses on memorizing and recalling information rather than
encouraging critical thinking, does not provide students with the skills they need to succeed in
the labour market or to meet life challenges. The support in the education sector also aimed to
ensure formal and non-formal learning opportunities that include life skills, personal
empowerment and active citizenship for the more vulnerable children, adolescents and youth,
including children on move
138. In the Heath sector, UNICEF intended to further improve the PHC services and neonatal
survival. The interventions of UNICEF were also keen to tackle the main issues of malnutrition
(stunting, anemia, and overweight) prevalence. Furthermore, UNICEF has positioned ECD as
a key means by which multiple threats to children may be addressed, and as a strategic
mechanism for ensuring strong cross-sectoral linkages within the CP.
139. Regarding child poverty and inequalities, UNICEF targeted governorates with the
highest entrenched extreme poverty and inequities and improve knowledge on child poverty.
35
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
Rural/urban gaps in access to services and household living standards are compounded by
differences in opportunities for children across governorates. The CP was also focus on
addressing challenges faced by children of urban slum communities and informal settlements
and the particular needs those children of Upper Egypt.
140. Boys and girls faced diverse types of violence as reported in Egypt and, accordingly,
UNICEF has developed meaningful programmes to tackle violence against children through
maintaining diversified interventions at different fronts, including legislative framework,
policies and regulations, quality prevention and response services/interventions, inter-linkages
and referrals among different system structures as well as community mobilization, child
protection mechanisms, monitoring, data and resources management.
141. In regard to gender-based harmful practices such as FGM, early marriage, UNICEF was
committed to support the GoE in the enforcement of laws protecting children from harmful
practices. Through supporting policy development and enhancement, community mobilization
interventions including intergenerational dialogues and girls’ empowerment, and national
campaigns, as well as institutional capacity strengthening through investment in protection
services and evidence generation, the engagement of UNICEF was instrumental in galvanizing
even further national support to eradicating harmful practices including FGM. Addressing
these root causes would enhance the impact of the Programmes across sectors, including
harmful practices social protection, child survival and early development, education and child
protection.
4.2.3. Did the Country Programme design relevant documents for monitoring and
evaluation purpose?
4.2.3.1. Theory of change
142. The 2014-2017 Strategic Plan of UNICEF presented the first corporate ToC for each of
the main outcome areas. The CO are now encouraged to prepare ToC during the preparation of
new Country Programs.
A ToC provides a graphical overview of how interventions contribute to a common goal. The
aim is to understand the overall goal and the intended results of this initiative at each level, the
logical connections between the various levels of these results, the preconditions or
assumptions on which these connections are based, and any inherent risks that could affect
those assumptions and the achievement of results.
36
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
143. UNICEF Egypt has developed a thorough rational for its 2018-2022 CPD which
identified priorities for children to be addressed in partnership with the GoE in the system level,
in services delivery as well as in the most deprived governorates. The CPD also included risk
analysis and mitigation strategies.
144. UNICEF Egypt has developed a strategy along with a detailed ToC for two of its CP
components namely: outcome 2 (Child Survival and Early development) and Outcome 3
(Learning and Child Protection) (Annex 6 and Annex 7). Nevertheless, UNICEF has not
developed a full and detailed ToC for the entire CP.
4.2.3.2. Result matrix
145. The CPD developed a result matrix in which many indicators either baseline or target
were supposed to be filled with the planned DHS surveys. Unfortunately, since 2014, Egypt
has not conducted a DHS or similar nation-wide household survey. Hence, UNICEF relied on
other data sources to fill data gap as much as possible. For this reason, some key indicators in
the latest result matrix such as child poverty related indicators and those on learning outcomes
are not updated. Furthermore, for some outcomes there has been a change of focus which meant
the readjustment of outputs and associated indicators.
146. In addition to this data informational gap, the context of Egypt has changed since the CP
was designed, in particular with the COVID-19. Thus, with regards to gaps in data, it is
important to conduct thematic researches based on informational gaps to better prioritize and
address girls and boys needs in Egypt.
147. On the positive side, the CO has planned to complete a Country Office Annual Report
(COAR) and also track results through the Results Assessment Module (RAM). Therefore, in
this report, the main quantitative information source used was COAR and the RAM with new
or updated indicators.
Conclusion and recommendation
148. The CPD was aligned with key priorities for boys and girls in Egypt. It was developed
using evidence-based data from DHS and other reliable sources to identify and address
challenges faced by boys and girls in relevant areas in Egypt. Moreover, the CP results are
highly relevant for enabling UNICEF to better align and respond to the priorities of the GoE,
especially in regard to boys’ and girls’ needs. To ensure the effective and efficient
implementation of the CP, UNICEF had developed a result matrix that was enriched during the
implementation of the Programme.
37
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
149. However, the CP had not developed a full and ToC for the entire Programme and some
key indicators were not updated due to a lack in household related indicators. Furthermore, not
all baseline and target indicators have been set up on time due to the lack of updated indicators.
As the Egypt Family Health Survey will be completed in 2022 it is expected to help in closing
the data gap. This nation-wide households survey is an opportunity to conduct further thematic
analysis on relevant topics based on informational gaps to better prioritize and address girls
and boys needs in Egypt.
Recommendation
Recommendation 1: Improve the documentation of the CP by (a) developing a comprehensive
ToC for the entire new CP; (b) setting up all baseline and target indicators and (c) develop
strategic notes for Programme components. To fill data gaps the office should conduct a
evidence gap mapping exercise and plan for relevant research to fill these gaps.
Suggestions for strengthening the M&E component include:
▪ To timely develop detail ToC for the entire CP;
▪ To develop ToC for key programmatic components of the CP;
▪ To explore ways for setting up baseline and target indicators such as:
− redefining the target group of social protection and not only target the extremely poor
and set up a system to report data on most vulnerable children (for example: children
on the move, children with disability);
▪ To conduct thematic researches based on informational gaps identified.

4.3. Efficiency
150. The efficiency assesses the extent to which the available resources and inputs produce
results. It examines the extent to which the results and/or direct effects are achieved with the
appropriate resources and inputs.
151. The key questions related to the efficiency criterion are the following:
To what extent has the Programme used the most cost-efficient implementation methods?
To what extent have the Programme management arrangements been efficient?
To understand the efficiency of the CP, in this section, we focus on:
✓ the cost structure allocation and the efficiency utilization of short-term funds,
✓ the efficiency of using resources management arrangements,
✓ the efficiency of the capacity building.
4.3.1. Cost structure allocation and effective fund rising
152. According to the CPD, the Programme had an intended resourcing of US$ 94.2 million
for the 5 years for the entire implementation period, of which about 15 per cent (US$ 14.2
million) is RR and 85 per cent (US$ 80 million) is OR.
153. The planned budget has increased over time and was up to USD$ 116.5 million in 2022.
The CP was effective in resources mobilization as much more funding (US$134.57) was
received than planned (see Table 6).

154. In such difficult context of the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF has adapted its fund
mobilization strategy and approaches to include the development of successful project
proposals and the development of partnerships with the private sector to ensure an optimal
influx of resources for the implementation of the CP. The main donors providing OR are EU,
United States, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Japan, Italy, Global Alliance for Vaccine and
Immunization. UNICEF has also received additional thematic funding for COVID-19
pandemic (see Figure 7).

155. The Social Inclusion and Data programme was less funded (3.7 per cent). This
Programme component has also a low budget mobilization rate (38.9 per cent). In regard to the
household data gap reported in previous section, this component has to continue its financial
and technical support to CAMPAS and to other specialized organizations in order to support
data collection, data analysis and the dissemination of updated household indicators.
156. Overall, the CP has a good fund utilization rate of 87.0 per cent. However, the CSED
programme had a low utilization rate of 79.0 per cent due to the situation of COVID-19.

157. The bulk of funds (57.5 per cent) was used for the implementation of interventions under
Outcome 3 (Learning and Protection) in line with the respective resource requirement. In the
same way, the CSED component is the second most funded programme (28.3 per cent).
158. The funded budget of the ‘Learning opportunities for disadvantaged children’ component
counts for the half (52 per cent) of the entire budget of the outcome 3 component, while a third
of the funded budget supports the two components of Child Protection namely: ‘Child
protection system strengthening and EVAC’ and ‘quality child protection interventions’ (see
Table 7).

159. The ‘Positive parenting and FGM’ is funded with 7 per cent of the budget of the outcome
3 component. The ‘Adolescents’ participation’ programme counts for 3 per cent of the funded
budget. It had a low utilization rate of 51 per cent. The three programmes with low fund
utilization rate (‘Adolescents’ participation’, ‘Positive parenting and FGM’ and ‘EVAC and
41
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
quality child protection interventions’) should accelerate the implementation of their planned
activities during the year 2022.
160. The evaluation has identified fund rising challenges such as potential gap in the budget
for the near future. Part of the potential budget gap stems from the Cooperation Framework
between EU and the GoE. In fact, EU is discussing its global cooperation framework in Egypt
with the Government and is likely to decrease its financial support for UNICEF in the near
future (2022-2023). Given that EU is one of the top donors of UNICEF in Egypt, in the case
of an important decrease in its financial support, UNICEF should strengthen its ability to
leverage funds from other donors including private sector to continue its core activities.
161. Another key point is that the funds for COVID-19 response are emergency short-term
funds and then, they could expire before being fully utilized by the Programme. Hence, beyond
strengthen its fund rising capacity, UNICEF should reinforce the dialogue with the GoE about
much increase of funding from the GoE for the social sectors to ensure that key sectors are
better equipped to cope with steep drops in resourcing.

4.3.2. Efficiency of using resources and management arrangements
162. The government officials, the implementing partners and the donors consulted during
data collection phase perceive that the results have been achieved in a cost-efficient manner,
with little duplication mentioned.
163. The evaluation learnt that financial monitoring practices are based on regular financial
reports of implementing partners, Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfers rules and
42
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
regulations including Funding Authorization and Certificate of Expenditure form, spot checks
on utilization of funds and site monitoring visits. In addition, trainings were provided to the
counterparts on Direct Cash Transfers reporting requirements. Staff capacity to support
Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfers assurance activities has been enhanced through
workshops/training. UNICEF ensured effective financial management through the efficient use
of ‘VISION’ and close monitoring of financial implementation. As an illustration, UNICEF
has carried out 26 spot checks and 96 programmatic visits, which make completion percentage
of 104 per cent and 105 per cent, respectively. UNICEF procedures are also acknowledged to
be transparent and trustworthy, by the development partners consulted for this evaluation.
164. The efficiency gains have also resulted from the rigorous use of the agency procedures
and guidance for in country transportation, fuel supply, and printing services, as well as
extensive use of national roosters for individual while relevant. These arrangements helped
increase efficiency and reduce time and transaction costs through economies of scale.
165. Most of the interviewed participants appreciated the UNICEF practice to use national
expertise as much as possible to minimize costs and secure national ownership and capacity
development. As far as comparison with other development partners is concerned, the
stakeholders’ perceptions about the financial costs of UNICEF programmatic assistance were
positive overall. Thus, there was straightforward spending as per approved budget by UNICEF,
with funds spent in an accountable and cost-effective manner. As a result, UNICEF achieved
the targeted satisfaction rate (90 per cent) through the annual end-user survey.
4.3.3. Efficiency of capacity building
166. An important mechanism set in place to support the GoE and other partners to achieve
efficient interventions has been the capacity-building at the institutional and community level.
For instance, many ministries have put a great deal of effort into training technical staff. The
capacity building activities helped improve the financial management, provided better quality
of services delivery to population, and better planning and M&E of public policies.
167. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, UNIECF increased the utilization of innovations in new
technologies and communication in addition to face-to-face trainings. Online platforms were
also developed to support eLearning and online trainings for healthcare workers.
168. A remote training offers a solution for an effective training strategy during the COVID-
19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the challenges of online learning can sometimes create barriers to
implementing it effectively. UNICEF has recognized in the 2020 COAR that “there were
43
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
connectivity challenges for many partners and service providers, and the switch to online
training was not without its challenges”. In addition to the connectivity issues, other stumbling
blocks that sometimes come up with online learning include lack of learner interaction,
engagement and motivation and weak digital literacy. A virtual learning can be isolating itself,
and spending more time alone in front of a screen can get in the way of productive learning.
An online learning often means sitting passively and reading text on a screen and listening to
a lecture. When there is not enough interaction with the content, learner will lose interest and
be engaged in surfing. In an online training, the trainer is not sure that all learners especially
those who are not familiar with e-learning platform are up to speed with the latest technology.
This can be frustrating for them and, even compromise their training outcome. While online
training is not to replace in-person training, the pandemic has given an urgency to bridge the
digital gap and plan for and overcome the most prevalent online training challenges.
4.3.4. Efficiency of coordination mechanisms and monitoring and evaluation systems
169. Intersectoral coordination mechanisms are crucial on enhancing intersectoral
components. The coordination model has inherent clear benefits, and some of them relate to
the coordination and coherence of the interventions both internal and within United Nations
Agencies. The presence of joint Programme components speaking with one voice enable the
identification of common and complementary operational interests for each programme
component. This makes it possible to determine the most appropriate interventions with the
Government and the rest of the national partners, avoiding duplication and maximizing the
good use of limited resources to achieve common purposes.
170. UNICEF has set up functioning task forces that hold regular internal meetings. For
example, the Office wide task forces held regular meetings to design, plan and review joint
sectoral collaborations chairs by the Representative such as task force on ECD and task force
on violence against children.
171. UNICEF is also engaged on different coordination mechanisms with other United
Nations Agencies and with the GoE. the Development Partners Group chaired by the United
Nations Resident Coordinator is an example of such external coordination mechanisms. In
addition, on a monthly basis, each CP component met with donors and implementing partners
to discuss planning and implementing issues for more efficient service delivery. As a
participant said during the KII: “UNICEF is playing very important role in enhancing the
communication on the national by engaging with different donors and different stakeholders
44
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
and expanding network of good will ambassadors not only for UNICEF but for the entire UN
system in Egypt”.
172. However, there is still room for improvement to increase synergies and efforts between
the United Nations Agencies and with the CP components. In regard to internal coordination,
cross sectoral components are implemented at a relatively slow speed as each sector is
predominately focused on its own priorities. Hence, a strong leadership and management are
essential to strengthen internal task forces and coordination mechanisms and the, ensure
effectiveness of task forces and overall coordination mechanisms. In terms of coordination with
other United Nations Agencies, it is important to prevent coordination issues such as those that
the government officials participating in the KII have pointed out regarding the Sinai
programme.
173. The M&E component ensures continuous performance monitoring of the CP in efficient
manner and also developed tools and provided capacity building to UNICEF programmatic
section and Government officials to enhance monitoring skills and practices. Especially, the
M&E component has enhanced its efficiency through the use of RTM and the support to
effectively target vulnerable children and their families.
4.3.5. Did the Country Programme establish unit-cost of service delivery?
174. UNICEF conducted cost-effectiveness analysis on nutrition and ECD interventions on
the feasibility of potential scale-up scenarios. An investment case in the nursery sector was
conducted in November 2019. The study found that, the total annual cost of service delivery
for a coverage rate of 10 per cent of all children age 0 to 4 in registered nurseries will be about
2.6 billion Egyptian Pound (EGP) in 2020. The total cost of providing services over the entire
period (2019-2030) will be about 67 billion EGP. Based on the estimations of this study, an
investment strategy that targets a 20 per cent coverage rate by 2025 would reach up 5.8 billion
EGP.
175. In the nutrition sector, a study on the cost-of-service delivery was carried out to help
policy makers understand the potential benefits of scaling up key interventions and to identify
and prioritize the most cost-effective package of interventions. The study found that the
estimated benefit-cost ratio for implementing this scenario in Egypt is 17.87: meaning that
every dollar invested would result in about $18 in economic returns and $1,326 million in
productivity gains, hence, benefits of investing in nutrition significantly outweigh the costs.
45
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
176. In regard to positive parenting programme, UNICEF has conducted a formative research
during the pilot phase before scaling- up the programme by 2021. This formative research
indicated that almost boys and girls have been to school, with only approximately 2 per cent
with no education. However, gaps in parental knowledge, attitude and practices related to
breastfeeding, hand washing, oral hygiene and food diversity are widespread.
177. The formative research was successfully in supporting the scaling and rollout of
parenting programme and then, the parenting programme become one of the GoE top priorities
and a strategic intervention to promote the wellbeing of children and families in the country.
178. In the education, child protection and child poverty components, the evaluation did not
find cost-efficiency studies that identify the cost-efficient scenario or other implementation
arrangements or alternative service delivery modalities.
Conclusion and recommendation
179. The budget utilization rate of the CP is about 87 per cent, and UNICEF has good financial
and management arrangement to achieve cost efficient interventions. Two case investment
studies were conducted in ECD and in nutrition sector to identify cost-effective package of
interventions.
180. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the discussions on the Cooperation
Framework of EU with the GoE, there might be a potential gap in the budget for the coming
years. Areas of improvement include:
− Improvement UNICEF ability to leverage funds including partnerships with private sector.
− Strengthen coordination mechanisms and avoid overlapping service delivery interventions
between the CP components and with other United Nations agencies in Egypt.
Recommendation 2: Continue efforts to leverage funds for children.
Recognizing the success factors of fundraising focus on:
− Strengthen the relationships with the top donors (bilateral and multilateral) and ensure
their satisfaction with the Programme implementation and reporting,
− Strengthen corporate engagement for financial and in-kind support to programs,
− Engage with new potential donors including the private sector,
− Celebrate an annual fundraising event,
46
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
− Continuous dialogue on sustainability issues with the GoE including about a gradual
increase of Government funding to social sectors that could help ensure that key sectors are
better equipped to cope with steep drops in resourcing.
Recommendation 3: Strengthen internal task forces and other coordination mechanisms to
maximize the coherence and effectiveness of CO programming.
This could include:
− Strong leadership and management to ensure appropriate staffing/workloads to balance sectoral
and intersectoral responsibilities and eliminate sectoral isolation;
− Ensuring that the responsibility for intersectoral work is appropriately distributed across all
positions with well-defined responsibilities in the staff members;
− Introduce programmatic tools for planning and reporting that articulate the horizontal links
across programmatic sectors necessary for effective intersectoral work;
continue to promote intersectoral work with and between government partners especially
related to multisectoral issues such as health, child protection, education, C4D.
47
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
4.4. Effectiveness
181. The effectiveness aims to analyze the extent to which the expected outputs and outcomes
were achieved, and also assess the extent to which these products have contributed to the
achievement of the planned results. The key questions to assess the effectiveness are as follows:
− To what extent has the CP achieved its objectives and results or is likely to achieve them?
− How were cross-cutting issues taken into account?
− What worked well in achieving the CP results that should be replicated or scaled up at the
design of the next CP?
− What factors (political, sociological, economic, etc.) have affected the outcomes, either
positively or negatively? How have these factors limited or facilitated progress towards
the outputs?
− What are the unanticipated effects of the CP either positively or negatively?
− How has COVID-19 affected the CP?
182. In order to answer the above questions related to effectiveness for each component of the
CP, this section of the report is structured as follows:
1) Effectiveness in policy level and achievement of outcomes and outputs,
2) National reforms and key factors that have facilitated progress towards the results,
3) CP performance in addressing emergency issues COVID-19 pandemic and refugee’s crisis,
4) Gender equality and inclusion issues.
183. The policy level analysis aims to appreciate the extent that the 2018-2022 CPD upstream
policy, strategy and other system level support in education reform, child protection, and youth
empowerment, ECD, and child survival contribute in promoting child rights. Thus, above the
assessment of outcomes and outputs, the report is highlighting what is been completed with the
support of UNICEF in terms of designing and costing sector planning documents, policy
dialogue and capacity building in the central level of different ministries and government’s
entities.
184. For each CP component, outcome and outputs analysis include both quantitative and
qualitative assessment of the achieved results. The analysis is based on the updated framework
or the Result matrix. It also used available data from the COAR and RAM.
185. In order to allow for a more executive understanding of this section and due to the
large amount of information related to each outcome and output, the results are presented
using a traffic-light colour scheme (see Table 9).

Note: some of the color’s, (e.g., that for “not achieved”) have also been used to point out certain
issues, for example, when an indicator, had no baseline or did not have a target.
4.4.1. Achievements in the Social Inclusion and Data component
186. The results achieved in this component contribute to four progress indicators with annual
milestones for outcomes. The results in table 10 indicate that all the output indicators are met
or are likely to be achieved by the end of the CP in 2022.
4.4.1.1. National Protection Strategy and restructuring of social protection action
187. UNICEF has supported the development of a National Protection Strategy. Given that
child poverty has different dimensions, addressing the related issues includes enabling an
environment of integrated social protection system, sensitive to children’s rights. So, the
National Protection Strategy is focused on cash transfers to better target the poor families with
children while increasing the investment in quality basic social services such as education,
PHC, nutrition and child protection. The Social Protection Strategy was finalized in 2020 along
with its Action Plan.
188. UNICEF has continued supporting MoSS to develop policy and strategic framework on
social protection. Moreover, MoSS has finalized and adopted the TKP beneficiary module with
a support from UNICEF. The CP contributed to the development of a M&E framework for
TKP and then, MoSS has utilized data from this M&E framework in its annual reporting.
UNICEF provided technical support to MoSS to coordinate the overall operations/expansion
and technical support to the TKP, the conditional and unconditional cash transfer program.
“The way UNICEF is actively engaged to provide technical and financial support the Takaful
and Karama initiative if very well appreciated” said a stakeholder during an interview.

189. UNICEF has provided support to the TKP implementation, to the design and
implementation of its M&E system. It has also supported reporting to enhance the
dissemination of lessons learned, research and key achievements.
190. The share of GDP allocated to targeted social protection for poor and vulnerable families
and children has increased from 2.3 per cent to 4.8 per cent since 2017. Furthermore, public
50

investment component of the public expenditure, where the share of investment towards
education and health have been on a steady rise since 2016. As a result, social protection
programme was expanded to reach more than 3.4 million families according to the 2020 Mid
Term Review and 5.5 million children are covered by social protection system.
4.4.1.2. Effort to close data gap on child related SDG
191. UNICEF has provided technical and financial support to the CAPMAS to implement the
‘Egypt Family Health Survey’ which replaces the DHS. Data collection has started in 2021 and
continue in the first semester of 2022. This programme is such important as it will update
datasets on children and SDGs.
192. Two progress indicators related to child poverty statistics are not reported due to a lack
of updated data. Those indicators will be updated when the ‘Egypt Family Health Survey’
report becomes available in late 2022. However, there are ongoing discussions on the creation
of a national child multidimensional poverty measure to be included in the national regular
reporting.
193. In regard to Social Inclusion and Data program, almost output indicators are achieved
and three indicators are on good track to be achieved by the end of the Programme (see Table
10).
4.4.1.3. Products to generate evidence and advocation for children
194. Working with different partners including the CAMPAS, MoPED, MoSS, the American
University of Cairo, UNICEF has successfully generated evidence to inform policy debate and
budgetary decisions on the main deprivations that children face in Egypt. For example, the
Programme produced relevant knowledge document on FGM, children on the Move, shock-
responsive social protection and poverty, public finance for children. UNICEF has successfully
supported several trainings to strengthen the capacity of researchers. In addition, UNICEF
supported seven structured training courses to enhance the capacities of more than 174
researchers in developing public policy research papers on children’s issues.
195. UNICEF is also collaborating with the Oxford Poverty and Human Development
Initiative, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia, MoSS,
MoPED, and CAPMAS to produce new and updated estimates on separate indices on child
multidimensional poverty, thereby addressing the evidence gap on this SDG indicators.
51
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
196. UNICEF also supported the deployment of RapidPro under the ownership of MoPED,
currently used by MoSS and MoHP to generate evidence.
197. UNICEF has also completed a repeated phone-based assessments using RTM to track
the impact of COVID-19 on children’s well-being. The RTM was considered as a global good
practice by UNICEF Regional Office and the Head Quarters and was included in a report on
‘Situation and Programmatic Monitoring Adaptations in COVID-19’.
4.4.2. Achievements in Child Survival and Early Childhood Development
198. UNICEF has supported MoHP to achieve important milestones including strengthening
the PHC system, developing the National Food and Nutrition Strategy and National Strategy
for ECD. Additionally, UNICEF has made great support to the medical component of the
COVID-19 response. UNICEF has also supported MoHP to finalize a plan that integrate
adolescent and mental health in PHC: this new area of focus is very acknowledged by the
participants of KII from the MoHP as a gap to be filled.
199. In regard to outcome indicators, four indicators are fully achieved or on good progress
and two are partially achieved in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Table 11).
200. The output indicators related to CSED (including Health, nutrition, WASH and medical
COVID-19 response) components are fully achieved or likely to be achieved (see Table 11).
4.4.2.1. Strengthening primary health care system
201. UNICEF has worked together with MoHP to continue strengthening the PHC system
even during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.
202. The Jump Start Package was developed to ensure over 1,445,000 children and women
received essential health care, including perinatal services, immunization and treatment of
childhood illnesses through UNICEF-supported health facilities.
203. Furthermore, UNICEF and MoPH have accomplished the following:
(i) Increased the capacity of district health managers for evidence-based planning;
(ii) Conducted skills-enhancement training of health service providers;
(iii) Expanded the scope of essential health service to include ECD corners and parenting
programmes;
(iv) launched social media campaigns to disseminate core messages related to COVID-19
prevention and vaccination;
52
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
(v) Established several community platforms, and supported the Government to establish
online platforms including RapidPro, Facebook page, YouTube channel and WhatsApp
groups).
The universal health coverage has been identified as a platform through which services across
sectors are organized to ensure the progressive realization of children’s rights. MoHP is
implementing its roll-out plan for the Universal Health Insurance (UHI) with the support of
UNICEF that incorporates high high-impact maternal, newborn, children and adolescent health
interventions. To support UHI model, UNICEF has completed a rapid assessment of the model
and has initiated the priority areas of support in 2021 were trainings of family practicians on
RBM, Integrated Management of Childhood Illness and nutrition.
The support of UNICEF is expected to be intensified in 2022, as UNICEF is contracting
international institution to perform a comprehensive assessment of the new model, and to
support roll-out of the model to new governorates.

4.4.2.2. Support to improve nutrition status
204. Nutrition strategies are known to be multisectoral and require prioritization and
coordination at a high level to achieve common goals. Developing a common nutrition and
food strategy to set common goals, prioritize interventions across sectors, and coordinate
activities to promote efficiencies and build on synergistic activities. In Egypt, a National Food
and Nutrition Strategy 2022-2030, was developed with a strong support and coordination from
UNICEF.
205. UNICEF has made significant contributions towards maternal and child health and has
contributed to the results through planning and organizing maternal and child health services
in the field. In addition, the field coordinators hired by UNICEF were instrumental in mapping
and convening local government and community stakeholders to implement and track the
health and nutrition initiative in selected governorates.
206. The Programme also provided technical support to the development and dissemination
of training packages, including those on Integrated Management of Childhood Illness, Infant
and Young Child Feeding and RBM.
4.4.2.3. Early Childhood Development
207. UNICEF is engaged in continuous high-level advocacy to ensure that ECD is prioritized
by the GoE and developmental partners.
In the system level, UNICEF worked towards supporting the government to develop an
integrated ECD national strategy to guide and support the scaling up of quality ECD services
The strategy was finalized in 2020 along with a plan of action and budget were developed and
endorsed by the national ECD committee. Other important technical inputs from UNICEF
include supported the development of a comprehensive ECD-Management Information
System, supply forecasting and design and implementation of communication campaigns. Prior
to the strategy, an ECD situational analysis and a framework for national Early Learning and
Development Standards were also developed, with support from UNICEF, to inform the ECD
national strategy development.
208. To ensure that caregivers of children are adequately engaged to maximize and sustain
effects of results, in 2021, UNICEF scaled up the operationalization of a Social and Behavioral
Change Model on parenting.
56
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
209. UNICEF also partnered with MoYS, MoSS, CSO, Federation of Egyptian Industries and
International the Labour Organization to implement an ECD Voluntary Centre model. The
ECD Voluntary Centre model supports play-based learning in some of the most deprived
communities. Cash transfer was also distributed to PHC centres to roll out an integrated
package of services, and financial resources provided to MoSS and MoYS to support
implementation of the new ECD model centres. As a result, a total of 11,108 children and over
107,000 parents benefitted from ECD centers in 2021, which were scaled up from the childcare
models developed by UNICEF to be adopted by private sector.
210. As mentioned in the efficiency section, UNICEF has conducted a cost-effectiveness
analysis on ECD nursey interventions to highlight the feasibility of potential scale-up scenarios.
The ECD model centres which has shown great results is an application of the case investment
study. This evaluation suggests that the evidence of success gained in ECD model centers be
used for advocacy to leverage funds to continue implementing the pilot ECD model as well as
to scale up the model.
211. In addition to the ECD, an Early Childhood Care and Education tailored for 4-5 years old
children has been implemented in the kindergartens (KG) that can also refers to pre-primary
classes. The KG programs are a form of early childhood education that takes place in a formal
classroom setting. About 10,000 children (aged 4-5) are attending UNICEF supported KG in
which 113 KG teachers are trained with a pedagogic qualification.
4.4.2.4. Strong support to the medical response of COVID-19 pandemic
212. The initial response of UNICEF was focused on the Infection Prevention and Control,
procurement of critical supplies, and risk communication. In addition, healthcare workers
within health facilities and communities provided with Personal Protective Equipment with
UNICEF support. UNICEF has also led the efforts along with WHO to secure millions of
COVID-19 vaccinations to the country through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access
(COVAX) initiative. UNICEF also supported CSOs with funds and technical expertise to
engage community-based organizations in the promotion of health and nutrition and shaping
individual and social expectations, in addition to awareness-raising, knowledge-sharing and
skills development.
213. In 2021 and 2022, UNICEF continues its focus on the prevention of the spread of the
virus and mitigating the negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the population in
partnership with other development partners.

4.4.3. Achievements in Education
214. This section is focused on the main achievements in the education sector reform, learning
system strengthening and expanding learning opportunities, learning opportunities for
disadvantaged children and community based and inclusive education. The Programme
specific outcome and output indicators are on good track and, almost indicators are likely to be
achieved by 2022. However, statistics on learning outcome (in mathematics and science) as
well as three indicators on ‘Learning opportunities for disadvantaged children’ are not reported
due to a lack of updated data (see Table 12).

4.4.3.1. Education system reform, learning system strengthening and expanding
learning opportunities
215. In late 2017, MoETE initiated a full-scale transformation of the education system to be
completed by 2030. This reform, the ‘Education 2.0’ is focused on skills-based learning and an
expansion of digital learning. The CP is supporting the Education 2.0 reform program through
policy dialogue and technical assistance.
216. UNICEF has coordinated with MoETE to successfully complete the Education Sector
Analysis and Education Sector Plan and then, co-chaired the first Local Education Group.
UNICEF has advocated for a skills-based approach to learning and worked with MoETE to
develop and roll out a skills-based curriculum starting by Pre-Primary and Primary 3 by
training MoETE curriculum experts. UNICEF conducted researches on global best practices
for skills-based education for Grades 7 to 12 and the findings will be used to develop a
roadmap, policy advice, and strategy recommendations to education authorities to inform the
rollout of Education 2.0 in these higher grades.
217. The digitalization is an important focus of the education reform agenda in Egypt. It aims
to link education and technology. The COVID-19 crisis has also accelerated technological
advances due to social distancing guidelines and, free online spaces were created to get
educational content and providing educational technology to classrooms. The support of
UNICEF to the COVID-19 response facilitated safe school reopening and supported MoETE
in building an online platform offering materials and channels to support the continuation of
learning during the pandemic. For example, the teachers’ preparedness training package was
deployed, reaching 1,170 teachers (54 per cent refugees) reaching 27,800 students.
Furthermore, 760 teachers received LSCE training that they applied during after-school
sessions and summer camps that were instrumental to ensure continuity of learning for
marginalized children due to UNICEF Support.
59
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
4.4.3.2. Learning opportunities for disadvantaged children
218. UNICEF is supporting the government initiative to enroll children in formal and non-
formal education opportunities, including children on the move and has supported the
development of guidelines for the adaptation of learning materials for children with disability
and out of school children and adolescent.
219. The COVID-19 response facilitated safe school reopening and 552 schools received
WASH rehabilitation benefitting 475,518. Those children received either hygiene supplies
(161,865), cash grants (13,884), educational supplies (15,827) or learning support
(277). UNICEF reached a total of 701,676 children who had improved access to quality, safe
learning opportunities in 9 governorates.
220. To strengthen national capacity to provide formal and non-formal Early Childhood Care
and Education services for more vulnerable children, UNICEF supported 20,766 children with
comprehensive interventions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on children. Similarly,
educational supplies were given to 50 KG benefitting around 3,195 refugee children.
Education cash grants reached 13,884 refugee children. The rehabilitation interventions
conducted in 20 KG benefitted 1,586 students. In 55 KG refugee schools 2,101 children
received hygiene supplies by the end of the year.
4.4.3.3. Community based education and inclusive education
221. The CBE or community schools are used to meet the education for all goal in
communities that generally lack school infrastructure which are mostly located in remote areas.
These alternative education models provide primary education in which the curriculum is the
same of the public schools and locally relevant in terms of local language dealing with
problems of daily lives. The community schools also reach unschooled children and utilize
child-centered, active-learning approach.
222. According to the Mid-term evaluation of an EU funded programme entitled ‘PAGODA’,
about 1 per cent of all primary school students’ study in community schools. About 10 per cent
of primary students attend private schools, with the remaining 89 per cent of primary students
attending regular government schools. The community school model is promising, although,
data reveals that CBE reaches approximately 133,000 students per year (up to 30 students per
5,000 community schools) most of which are out of school children wishing to complete
primary education (See Table 13).

Given that the estimated primary age out-of-school children are about 78,000-372,000 and
preparatory age out-of-school children about 221,000-474,000, the CBE reach a little over a
third of out-of-school children.
223. The CBE have faced many challenges. For instance, on the supply side, the CBE
programs often have a strong technical approach, but sometimes lack the political will to
recognize CBE as equal to public education. On the demand side, there is an overall
misperception of CBE as second class and relegated to the poor. This is coupled with
inadequate community mobilization towards CBE and lack of a structured community
participation mechanism hinder the support of community members to the day-to-day school
operation.
224. In consultation with MoETE, UNICEF is actively working to improve the model
especially in light of the broader ‘Education 2.0’ reforms building on its success in reaching
out-of-school children and providing quality education. UNICEF also worked on building a
skills-based curriculum for community schools that serve out-of-school children and ensures
that skills-based learning is available to marginalized children, including those with disabilities
and those who are out of school. The figure below presents the proposed revised CBE 2.0
approach in the context of the global education 2.0 reform (see Figure 9).
225. This new approach of CBE 2.0 should provide more opportunities to learners including
certification and transitioning to public schools and transition to pre-employment education or
employment.

226. In support to the inclusion of children with disability in the education system, key
milestones for inclusive education in Egypt under education 2.0, are namely:
1) the special education curriculum frameworks,
2) the guidelines for the adaptation and accommodation of learning materials for the children
with sensory disabilities,
3) the teachers’ guide on inclusive education.
These resources will act as pivotal references for education staff working in inclusive and
special education schools across Egypt.
227. UNICEF is also engaged in service delivery working with communities through projects.
As illustration, UNICEF has implemented an EU funded programme ‘PAGODA Delegation
Agreement for Expanding Access to Education and Protection for at Risk Children in Egypt’
which has a component on inclusive education. The programme has supported the
establishment of district-level Performance Improvement Centers to serve in cascading
62
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
technical assistance and capacity building programmes to the public school in their clusters. In
2019, the evaluation of this programme found that the programme has led to the
institutionalization of the inclusive education model that is accredited by MoETE and national
universities. As a result, MoETE started the dissemination of the inclusive education capacity
building interventions beyond the programme target and educational establishment. For
instance, in 2021, UNICEF reached 28,128 refugee children and 6,177 children in CBE who
received educational supplies and learning opportunities.
4.4.4. Achievements in child protection and behavioral change
4.4.4.1. Laws and policies to protect children from violence and alternative care
228. In policy level, the NPA of EVAC was finalized in 2020 by the National EVAC
taskforce, with a support from UNICEF. A M&E and costed framework of the NPA of EVAC
were also developed. UNICEF also launched a national alternative care strategy in line with its
advocacy with MoSS to institutionalize a case management system to protect children. This
case management system became a national model for the provision of comprehensive package
services proposed to the Prime Minister’s Office as the model for Haya Karima villages
targeting the most vulnerable communities in Egypt. UNICEF has also established with
MoETE, child safeguarding mechanisms in schools, based on the national EVAC strategy. The
support from UNICEF (technical, financial and advocacy) contributed to the adoption of law
criminalizing FGM medicalization and introduced amendments to Child Law on judicial
treatment and alternative care.
229. Overall, the CP has well performed on its child protection related indicators both in the
protection system strengthening, access and quality service providers. UNICEF contributed to
the development of the quality assurance system for social work. The achieved results include
capacity building for social service workforce and other child protection stakeholders in
different sectors such as justice, education and health, leading to provision of improved case
management services to children at risk, victims of violence and children in contact with the
law and in-person psychosocial support for those children.
230. Laws and policies to protect children from violence and ensure an adequate response
from duty bearers and justice sector institutions are endorsed by the government (see Table
14). However, indicators on violent disciplining method were not reported due to the absence
of updated data. The CP has a relatively low performance in terms of percentage of children in
contact with the law that are reached with non-custodial alternative measures to detention and
63
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
child-friendly procedures and legal services. For example, UNICEF has supported the
establishment of specialized forensic centres at prosecution offices to speed up the process for
medical examination of confiscations in cases related to children. Despite the existence of
alternative measures to deprivation of liberty in the Egyptian law such as training and
rehabilitation programs and community service, these alternatives are still not widely
implemented. To improve the situation of children in contact with the law with alternative
measures, key informant interviewees suggested “the establishment of child prosecution offices
in more governorates, as well as extension of the period of appointment of prosecutors working
on child cases”.

4.4.4.2. Social and behavioral change model
231. The current CP focuses on positive parenting and girls’ empowerment as drivers of
change tackling the root causes of individual and societal behaviors harmful for children
(RAM, 2021). Thus, Social and Behavioral Change component focuses on addressing root
causes of behaviors through two strands of work on positive parenting and girls’ empowerment
(gender transformative programming).
Positive parenting
232. The violence against children may occur in the home, in the community, at school and
online; and may be perpetrated by parents or other caregivers, peers, as well as by strangers.
According to UNICEF global databases, about three quarters of young children are subjected
to violent discipline by their caregivers on a regular basis (UNICEF, 2020)20. In Egypt, the
report of the 2014 DHS has shown that 93 percent of children (1-14 years) are exposed to some
form of violent discipline by their parents and/or caregivers. While the most common forms of
violence affecting children take place in a home and family setting, the home and family can
also be the most important sources of protection from violence, and of care and support when
violence has occurred.
233. A parenting programmes are broadly defined as a set of activities or services aimed at
improving how the parents approach and execute their role as parents, specifically their
parenting knowledge, attitudes, skills, behaviors, and practices (UNICEF, 2010). These
programmes intend to help parents and caregivers to understand the importance of positive,
non-violent discipline in child development and of close, effective parent-child communication
reduces harsh parenting practices, creates positive parent-child interactions and helps increase
bonding between parents or other caregivers and children – all factors that help prevent
violence against children.
MoSS and NCCM, in cooperation with UNICEF and with the support of EU, have launched a
positive parenting program targeting underprivileged families. The program offers community
sessions on several areas of positive parenting including: proper care, psychological support,
health, nutrition, learning, cognitive development and positive discipline. The program has also
a focus on child marriage, FGM and the importance of education.
20 UNICEF. (2020). Designing parenting programmes for violence prevention: a guidance note May 2020.
66
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
234. MoSS has adopted the concepts of positive parenting within the package of interventions
for social protection and ECD programmes. The programme presented the curriculum
implemented in villages and governorates of ‘Decent life’ initiative. The Programme also uses
the interactive communication platform of Social Solidarity in documenting and following up
with families in need of advice on family and education issues through communication via
hotline (free message).
235. NCCM successfully launched its first important multimedia campaign on positive
parenting ‘Awladna’ (meaning Our Children), in December 2016 with the support of UNICEF.
In 2021, UNICEF scaled up the operationalization of a Social and behavioral change model on
parenting. As a result, an estimation of 160,000 children (4 children for each of the trained
parent) interacted with the over 41,000 parents and 163,000 community members that engaged
with face-to-face activities related to positive parenting and COVID-19 prevention and
response during the reporting period.
Girls’ empowerment
236. UNICEF supported NCCM in a consultative process to define a social and behavioral
change model to promote acceptance of diversity (gender, ability, nationality) and to define a
national M&E framework to track girls’ empowerment in Egypt.
237. UNICEF enhanced the positioning of the National Girls’ Empowerment Initiative also
known as “Dawwie” which mainly aims to empower female adolescents through several
activities that provide them with the chance to speak out about their dreams, struggles, and
beliefs. In Arabic, the word ‘Dawwie” is the echoed voice, meaning a voice that is loud enough
to create an impact. In the ground, the activities provided to both girls and boys included digital
literacy, self-expression, participation, inter-generational dialogue, and community theatre in
safe and culture-sensitive spaces such as the Civic Education Centres. The Dawwie programme
was launched in five governorates across Egypt, and it is expected to be expanded into a wider
range of communities in order to combat harmful practices and other issues rooted in social
norms including FGM, child marriage, education, skills development and employment
especially for girls and women.
238. Again, there is a lack of reported data for a number of indicators to monitor the progress
on annually basis as shown in red cells (See Table 14). For instance, indicators on FGM were
not reported due to an absence of updated data. Furthermore, the degree of attained knowledge
on elimination of violence against children of both religious leaders and community members
67
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
who received awareness training sessions was 25 per cent, below the target of 70 per cent (see
Table 14).
239. On the positive side, the programme reached many communities especially in rural areas.
For instance, in 2021 results, 53,000 community members engaged in viewing clubs focusing
on harmful practices, 15,000 community members engaged Face -to-face and over 32,000
online with Dawwie activities. Over 7,000 boys and girls have been trained on digital literacy
focusing on gender equality.
240. The practices rooted in cultural and social norms such as FGM take long time to change.
Hence, UNICEF should continue advocacy and service delivery for girl’s empowerment to
scale up the implementation of the Dawwie community engagement package. UNICEF is
already working on establishing a partnership with the Haya Karima Presidential Initiative in
coordination with relevant national and international partners such as NCW and UNFPA.
4.4.4.3. Adolescent and youth participation and skills development
241. Indicators on adolescents and youth are on good progress to achieve 5 indicators out 7
while the remining 2 indicators are partially achieved.
242. UNICEF is supporting MoYS to implement the ‘Meshwary’ programme. It is a life skills
and employability programme endorsed by the Prime Minister through a comprehensive social
and economic empowerment programme for youth and adolescent.
243. UNICEF supports the implementation of three projects implemented in partnership with
MoYS namely: Meshwary ‘My Journey’, Civic Education and Adolescents and Youth
Parliaments, and Sports for Development (S4D). In 2021, 52,197 young people were
directly reached through those three programmes.
The Meshwary project is implemented in many governorates namely Cairo, Alexandria,
Sharkya, Assiut and Sohag, Aswan, Qena, Kafr El Sheikh, Dakahlya and Behaira and Gharbya.
The project has coached girls and boys from 10 to 24 years old to become more empowered
economically and socially through training on life, employability and entrepreneurial skills and
comprehensive career guidance. The focus was on enhancing the skills of young people living
in impoverished governorates and preparing them to transition from learning to earning.
The S4D project is focused on building social cohesion and promoting gender equality and
girls’ empowerment using play, sports and physical activity.
68
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
Both Meshwary and S4D project supported adolescent and youth to develop skills such as
teamwork, communications, self-confidence and decision making, where assessment for all
participants showed an improvement in skills development perceptions from 51 per cent to 95
per cent and 42 per cent to 96 per cent respectively.
The Civic Education and Parliaments programme equipped 220 adolescents and youth with the
necessary skills to design and implement adolescent and youth-led initiatives. For the year
2021, the project has reached 16,220 adolescents and youth. For the same year (2021)
the participants were trained and 2,863 leading initiatives were developed on COVID-19 to
raise community awareness about social distancing and hygiene, reaching 70,000 community
members.
244. Given the current widespread geographic reach of adolescent and youth participation
projects especially Meshwary project, and their potential to support key adolescent
development outcomes, the programme gained endorsement from the Prime Minister.
245. Therefore, the evaluation suggests that UNICEF continue to advocate on positioning
young people as a priority on the national agenda through policy dialogue and then, prioritizes
the scaling-up of this promising model in 2022 and beyond.
4.4.5. Achievements in regard to Programme effectiveness (Outcome 4)
246. In terms of effectiveness, important achievements can be mentioned. For instance, the
repeated phone-based surveys on tracking the impact of COVID-19 on children’s well-being
was considered as a global good practice by UNICEF Regional Office and the Head Quarter.
The surveys were also acknowledged by the government officials: “this online assessment is
very useful to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of COVID-19 response”.
247. UNICEF has successfully launched online platforms which engaged individuals
including influencers, political/community/religious leaders for effective advocacy on child
rights issues such as harmful practices. Social medias also correct COVID-19 related
misinformation while highlighting the importance of vaccines (see Table 15).
248. In cooperation with UNICEF, United Nations Development Programme, Plan
International and MoYS launched the ‘Generation Unlimited’ on January 11th 2022 under the
name ‘Shabab Balad’ (Country’s Youth) during the World Youth Forum 2021 in Sharm El
Sheikh. Egypt is the first country in the region to witness the launch of a national version of
the international platform. The initiative is committed to train and empower adolescent and
youth for them to participate effectively in achieving Egypt’s vision 2030. The initiative is fully
69
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
aligned with the willingness of the political leadership in Egypt to support adolescent and youth
and to avail all means for them to develop skills such as creativity, innovation and
entrepreneurship.

3.4.6. Country Programme performance in addressing COVID-19 pandemic and
refugee’s crisis
During the implementation of the CP, humanitarian response has acquired great importance in
Egypt with COVID-19 pandemic and refugee crisis.
4.4.6.1. COVID-19 response
249. UNICEF has relied on sector working groups for delivery of services in COVID-19
pandemic. UNICEF was one of the development partners in Egypt to timely address the
prevention of the spread of the virus in support to the COVID-19 response of the GoE. UNICEF
also strengthened the capacity of the health system and support MoHP to develop and
implement the Egypt National Deployment and Vaccination Plan. As a result, 540 health
providers and community health workers were trained, and COVID-19 Risk Communication
and Community Engagement campaigns reached 106 million with an engagement of 3,5
million. In addition, 1,393 vaccination posts were setup, 75 million doses of vaccines delivered
and other necessary medical and hygiene supplies – most of which by UNICEF through the
COVAX facility and the cold and ultra-cold chains had been equipped. In terms of vaccination,
29 million people were vaccinated, among them 16.8 million (58 per cent) are fully vaccinated.
250. The Egyptian economy performed relatively well in the COVID-19 context with the
support from development partners including UNICEF. The Government continue its effort to
mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 and UNICEF should continue its support to the
Government in regard to its comparative advantages compared with other development
partners in the country.
251. For instance, UNICEF has provided its knowledge and expertise to the medical response
of the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with support to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-
19 pandemic in multiple areas such as nutrition, health, education, WASH and child protection.
252. Another aspect that illustrates the comparative advantage of UNICEF is its capacity to
mobilize financial resources especially, in support to the medical response of the COVID-19
pandemic as outline in the efficiency section (see table 8).
253. Furthermore, UNICEF has increased the complementarity and coherence among the
development partners and consequently provide technical assistance in a more comprehensive
manner to the GoE. For example, UNICEF has led efforts together with WHO to secure
millions of Covid-19 vaccinations to the country through COVAX initiative.
71
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
4.4.6.2. The refugees’ crisis
254. UNICEF Egypt has been working with Children on the Move to adapt its programming
to respond to the increased needs of refugees, migrant and vulnerable host community children
and their families. UNICEF programming in Egypt has an approach which focuses on
resilience and development to respond to the ongoing humanitarian needs of refugees, migrant
and vulnerable children in the country.
255. The CP is supporting the government in its efforts to integrate refugees and asylum
seekers into Egyptian communities: instead of refugee camps, they are integrated into Egyptian
communities, moving freely in the country and with access to public education and PHC
services at an equal level to Egyptian citizens.
256. In its efforts to also push Children on the Move as a priority target group for the GoE,
UNICEF supported the rollout of Annex Standard Operating Procedures along with NCCM,
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for
Migration through developing a simplified referral pathway, which was validated for
implementation by relevant governmental stakeholders, including the National Coordinating
Committee for Combating and Preventing Illegal Migration and Trafficking in Persons . In
addition, through UNICEF advocacy efforts, MoSS officially approved availing services of
Case Management Units to children on the move and their placement in care institutions.
257. According to the 2021 COAR of UNICEF, the CP has made notable efforts to facilitate
the refugees/migrant to access basic social services:
− 20,000 refugee and migrant students attending refugee community schools;
− UNICEF supported 28,128 refugee children in Community-based-Schools with
educational supplies and learning opportunities;
− UNICEF supported around 3,195 refugee children in 50 KG, with educational supplies;
− 13,884 refugee children benefitted from education cash grants to support continuation of
KG education;
− 2,101 children in 55 KG refugee schools received hygiene supplies to ensure COVID-19
safety in schools;
− 59000 young refugees/migrants, aged 10-24 were reached through Meshwary programme.
− 342 adolescent’s refugees/migrants aged 10-18 participated in UNICEF’s S4D
programme;
72
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
− In 2021, UNICEF has supported 94 schools in North Sinai, 25 schools in Ismailia
governorate; as well as, 25 schools in South Sinai with improved water and sanitation
facilities, as well as the provision of soap to create a safe learning environment for all
students.
258. Psycho-social support and positive parenting sessions benefited 25,490 children
(11,552 boys and 13,938 girls) including those on the move and 9,761 parents (659 fathers and
9,102 mothers) from vulnerable families through Family Clubs’ original programming.
UNICEF also continued to play a significant role with NCCM and the Office of Prosecutor
General in supporting the release of 81 detained children due to irregular migration in Aswan
in 2021 and bringing total to 10,000.
259. The GoE has granted full access to public education for Syrians, although significant
barriers remain related to both access and quality of education in a safe environment.
4.4.7. Human Rights-Based Approach, equity and gender equality, and empowerment
of women
260. The Programme is assessed to be coherent with the principles of non-discrimination and
equality, participation and inclusion, and accountability. HRBA is a normative approach that
focuses on the development of the capacities of ‘duty-bearers’ to meet their obligations and of
‘rights-holders’ to claim their rights. HRBA was explicitly used in identifying the vulnerable
groups and developing strategies to promote their rights as well as in multiple research and
analytical work.
(i) The evaluation found that the Programme objectives and approaches were compliant with
national and international legal instruments, and commitments signed by the GoE,
including:
(ii) Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1981;
(iii) International Convention of Civil and Political Rights (1982);
(iv) Convention on the Rights of the Child (1990);
(v) International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and
Members of Their Families;
(vi) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2008);
Moreover, the Programme objectives and approaches were found consistent with the
development and policy priorities of the GoE as stipulated in the SDS of the GoE which include
73
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
the promotion of child rights and well-being and, therefore it could be argued that the
Programme is aligned with the HRBA principles.
261. Furthermore, the TKP cash transfer that UNICEF has supported is fully informed by
HRBA as it focuses on alleviating the burden of citizens in communities most in need in the
countryside and slums in urban areas. UNICEF financially supported the expansion of the TKP
while technically helped building effective targeting and efficient systems. The programme
main principles are: Human Rights Based, Equity, National ownership, Systematic &
integrated, Developmental Approach21. The TKP supports Egypt’s most vulnerable citizens by
providing efficient Targeting22 based on a proxy means testing questionnaire crosschecked with
a Unified National Registry linked to the unique identifier.
262. UNICEF is also supporting the Decent Life (Haya Karima) initiative to ensure access to
health and other social services for the most vulnerable populations. UNICEF has selected
priority governorates, namely: Assuit, Minia, Gharbya, Alexandria, Marsa Matrouh, and North
Sinai for the intervention. The selection criteria are based on the highest concentration of poor,
refugees, high child mortality rates and prevalence of stunting,
263. The Egypt National Deployment and Vaccination Plan that UNICEF supports is
committed to ensure timely and successful deployment of the vaccines to all people living in
Egypt, including refugees, migrants, asylum seekers, and other foreign residents.
264. In addition, UNICEF has implemented specific projects/programmes in selected
governorates to better reach children most in need such as refugee/migrants, unaccompanied
children including those in North Sinai. For instance, in 2020, FGM prevention and response
interventions have expanded into Primary Health Units, schools and sports centers with a focus
on Upper Egypt which has the highest prevalence of FGM in Egypt.

Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
particularly with reference to compliance to the GEEW and UN-SWAP standards. The
assessment of the integration of gender equality has been merged into the section on
compliance to UN-SWAP and GEEW. Gender equality is a normative principle to ensure that
priorities in the national development framework reflect the country’s commitments to
achieving gender equality and that CP results and strategies contribute to these gender equality
goals through gender mainstreaming.
266. To assess gender mainstreaming, the evaluation has appreciated in which degree gender
concerns have been taking into account: (1) during the CP design and was identified in the
Country Program Document; (2) during the implementation and was highlight in annual reports
and other key document; (3) in the service delivery according to girls’ and boys’ needs.
4.4.8.1. Existence of gender analysis in the Country Programme Document
267. A gender analysis was not documented in the CPD. In addition, the indicators presented
to describe the rational and the context of the Programme does not contain enough gender
disaggregated data. Similarly, the initial result framework had not included gender
disaggregated baseline indicators.
4.4.8.2. Existence of gender-disaggregated analysis in periodic reports
268. A sex-disaggregated analysis is not available across all CP components in periodic
reports. In the annual reports, information is disaggregated by sex only in the sections related
to ECD, learning, adolescent and young participation (see Table 16).
Table 16: Sex- desegregated data in the annual report (2021)
Indicator Achèvement (2021) Percentage of
girls
Educational supplies distributed to refugee children 3,195 50%
Children benefitted from the rehabilitation interventions conducted 1,586 47%
in 20 KG in North Sinai and Ismailia governorates
Refugee students that received hygiene supplies in 55 KG 2,101 50%
Students in schools with WASH rehabilitation 475,518 48%
Life skills education for children in North Sinai 68,945 49%
Young people (10-24) reached through Meshwary programme 31,700 49.5%
Participation in S4D programme (10-18 years) 4,27 88.7%
Participant in Civic Education and Parliaments programme who led 4,583 54%
initiatives in their communities (10-24 years)
Participant in S4D programme (10–18 years 4,277 89%
75
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
269. The gender parity is almost achieved as girls’ percentage vary from 48 percent to 89
percent (see Table 16). In the primary education, the Net Enrolment Ratio stood at 100.2 per
cent with a Gender Parity Index of 1.06 (gender equality). Moreover, 50 per cent of girls in
primary education benefitted through UNICEF’s technical support to the national education
reform.
4.4.8.3. Existence of relevant and specific service delivery for boys and girls
270. There is a little information about the service delivery according to different needs of
boys and girls. For example, all schools should have separate toilets for boys and girls. While
there are not studies providing quantitative evidence in Egypt, girls may be discouraged from
attending school without adequate toilet facilities coupled with poor menstrual hygiene
practices.
271. On the positive side, in the child protection area, boys and girls in contact with law are
treated differently. This was confirmed during the interview by participants: “the judicial
treatment and alternative care promoted by UNICEF is different for girls and boys according
to their needs”.
272. Above all, gender mainstreaming still a concern since there was a little gender analysis
during the CP design and sex-disaggregated data were not reported systematically in the annual
reports. Regarding the service delivery, there is not a reference to girls’ and boys’ needs except
in the child protection component. Thus, the Programme could be argued to be rather ‘gender
neutral’ with evidence to suggest that any interventions were planned and implemented to
promote child rights and reach those in most deprived situation. However, the evaluation found
evidence for interventions prioritizing gender equality such as girls’ empowerment
interventions.
4.4.9. Factors that have facilitated or hindered effectiveness
4.4.9.1. Enabling factors
273. Many external factors have contributed to the achievement of the CP substantive results.
Below are the main external factors.
Legislative reforms
274. Since the adoption of the SDS, GoE carried out many legislative and institutional reforms
while conducting structural reform in many sectors such as education, health, social inclusion
and child protection.
76
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
The education reform agenda (education 2.0) in 2017
275. The reform aims to update teaching strategies and change mindsets is supported by IT
integration programs covering digital content. “Students will learn for life, not for an exam”,
said an interviewee.
The amendment provisions of the Penal Code regarding “bullying” in 2020
276. The law outlines an updated definition for bullying as ‘a show of force or control by the
offender, or the abuse of a vulnerable victim’ and outlined a minimum prison term of six
months and/or a penalty. This new law should help to tackle violence against children.
The Universal Health Insurance law of 2018
277. This law reinforces the universal coverage and grant access to Egyptians who had limited
access to healthcare, or none at all, under the previous health insurance scheme. It makes the
enrolment of all Egyptian citizens residing in Egypt in the UHI programme compulsory.
The amendments to the laws on FGM of 2021
278. The maximum sentence of seven years is now up to twenty years and doctors and other
medical staff involved in FGM are banned from practicing their profession for up to five years.
Presidential initiatives
279. The leadership Program intended to develop the skills of young people and the TKP.
280. Funds to mitigate the COVID-19 impact. The GoE allocated 100 billion EGP to fund
a comprehensive plan to combat the Coronavirus impact including expanding cash transfer
programme.
Technological revolutions the world
281. The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has accelerated technological advances: for example,
free online spaces were created to get educational content and providing educational
technology to classrooms and training are conducted in both online and face to face formats.
282. The main internal supporting factors have contributed to the achievement of the CP
substantive results are the following.
Well-established internal structure and competent staff
283. UNICEF staff have exercised due skills and track record of delivering complex and
sensitive programs/projects.
77
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
Effective leverage of relationships
284. UNICEF maintains excellent relationship with the Government, Parliament, oversight
bodies, civil society, EU and international development partners which have been shaping
policy on specific issues.
Partnerships with authentic change actors
285. The partnership with CSOs, think tanks and media helped understand the challenges and
engage them in the transformation process and implementation work, and build ownership.
Comparative advantage of UNICEF
286. This advantage has been put at good use through the ability of UNICEF to link work at
the local level with policy level, given its status with privileged relationship with the
Government.
▪ The positive image of UNICEF among the public
▪ A strong cross sectoral Communication functions
4.4.9.2. Factors hindering effectiveness
287. The main factor which affected the realization of children’s rights as a whole and
hindered the achievement of the CP planned results to date was the COVID-19 pandemic.
288. Direct impact of COVID-19 pandemic includes school closure, increase of violence
against children during lockdown, delay in implementing planned activities such as face to face
training, delay in purchasing supplies. In addition, short-term funds for COVID-19 response
expire before all dedicated activities are implemented.
289. Other factors which hindered the effectiveness of CP implementation and which were
not under the control of UNICEF include the following.
• The legal framework of NCCM: NCCM has more a policy making and coordination
role while MoSS has direct responsibility for delivery of services. NCCM is part of
MoHP which impedes its efficiency in terms of coordination. An advocacy is engaged
for new law to make NCCM an independent Agency in line with the recommendations
of International Committee of Children.
• The turnover of government officials working with UNICEF in all components
especially for specialized judges and trained health workforce.
78
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
290. Refugee crisis increase in the number of refugees and asylum seekers up to 2021, 269,826
in November 2021, and around 38 per cent of which are children with specific vulnerability
and needs.
4.4.10. Unplanned effects
291. As far as CP implementation is concerned, the evidence collected for this evaluation does
not bring much about unexpected or unplanned (negative) effects of the Programme. However,
stakeholders are unanimous that COVID-19 pandemic comes with accelerated technological
advances with application during the CP implementation.
Rapid increase in the use of innovative technologies in organization
292. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, UNICEF Egypt has
accelerated its transformation into a digital organization from the upscaling of digital
teleworking practices to the use of innovative technologies in its programmes, finance and
operations.
Increased use of real-time information solution
293. A real-time information solution was deployed to monitor the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on household through repeated surveys. The use of RapidPRo has been intensified
for COVID-19 risk communication and youth/community engagement at scale.
Leveraging e-learning power
294. UNICEF established a Learning Hub that supports online learning platforms such as
the Learning Passport as well as those from MoETE to enable continuous access to education
during COVID-19 education crisis for children, adolescent and youth, and teachers around the
world and drive improved learning outcomes through high-quality, portable education.
UNICEF has also supported the efforts led by MoHP to provide online trainings for more than
550 healthcare professionals tackling infection prevention and control.
Conclusion and recommendations
295. The majority of outcomes and outputs are archived or most likely to be achieved by the
end of the CP (2022). There is evidence demonstrating that UNICEF interventions/strategies
led to legislation and policy changes and ensured dedicated budget allocations in the targeted
areas. The ‘Egypt Family Health Survey’ that is underway will allow UNICEF to assess the
progress in areas such as FGM, learning outcome and poverty reduction.
79
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
296. The stakeholders were unanimous that UNICEF has made timely and important support
to the COVID-19 response of the Government either in terms of medical response or mitigating
the impact of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be under control in 2022,
however, it has already impacted vulnerable household and their children and there still a need
for UNICEF to support the Government in mitigating the negative effects of the pandemic.
UNICEF has comparative advantages to do so, in regard to its technical expertise, capacity to
leverage funds and its leadership role to increase the complementarity and coherence among
the development partners and consequently to provide technical assistance in a more
comprehensive manner to the Government.
297. The CP was successful in implementing pilot models in different sectors. Based on a case
investment study in ECD, pilot nursery model was successfully implemented.
298. UNICEF continues its advocacy with MoSS to institutionalize the case management
system which became a national model for the provision of comprehensive package services
proposed to the Prime Minister’s Office. UNICEF supported the GoE to launch a national
alternative care strategy, informed by two gap assessments on foster/alternative care systems
and two executive regulations introducing structural reforms to institutional child care.
299. Learning on the pilot phase and the formative research on positive parenting, UNICEF is
supporting MoSS and NCCM to scale up the positive parent-child interaction programme
which is an essential requirement for ECD and to prevent violence against children. The GoE,
SCOs, UNICEF and EU remain committed to the promotion of positive parenting programme.
Private sector is also supportive to the programme.
300. The Dawwie programme is implemented in five governorates is expected to be expanded
into a wider range of communities in order to combat harmful practices rooted in social norms.
As the programme is a success with a favorable echo especially in rural community, UNICEF
is currently working on establishing a partnership with the Haya Karima Presidential Initiative
in coordination with relevant national and international partners such as NCW and UNFPA to
scale up the Programme.
301. The Meshwary project that aimed to train adolescents and youth to become
more economically and socially empowered. The project is a success and has a potential to
support key adolescent development outcomes and, it gained endorsement from the Prime
Minister.
80
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
302. The GoE is committed to continue and scale up the implementation of the pilot models
and UNICEF is a key partner to provide technical and financial support to the Government.
Learning from its predecessor, the Strategic Plan, 2022–2025 of UNICEF is mainstreaming
multiple cross-cutting priorities including a more focus on ECD, gender-transformative
programming, community engagement, social and behaviour change. For instance, the multi-
disciplinary area of social and behavior change, and community engagement is positioned as a
‘Change Strategy’ under the new UNICEF Strategic Plan 2022-2025. This shift in social and
behaviour change within UNICEF promotes policy and programme actions that are routinely
informed by behavioral evidence, customized to local contexts, and grounded in human rights
approaches.
303. In addition, UNICEF has already developed partnerships including with UNFPA and the
private sector to leverage funds to implement and scale up the promising models.
81
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
Recommendations
Recommendation 4: Continue the effort in mitigating the negative impact of the pandemic
through technical assistance and financial support and also support to the GoE with systematic
and long-term social and behavioural change programmes.
Recommendation 5: continue the advocacy and service delivery for innovative, promising
and newly implemented models and projects namely community based ECD models, positive
parenting, case management system to protect children, girls’ empowerment and, adolescent
youth participation.
Proposed ways to implement this recommendation include:
− to explore the possibility of replicating these promising projects in other areas of the Country
Program based on need and budget availability,
− to set up a more systematic framework to measure change over time through cost-efficient
data collections activities.

4.5. Sustainability
304. The sustainability assessed whether the strategies and mechanisms put in place ensure
that the results of the interventions remain after the CP is completed, with an emphasis on
national capacity development and established partnership.
305. There are three main questions related to sustainability as follows:
− To what extent have initiatives from the CP resulted in GoE policies and procedures
supporting boys and girls?
− To what extent has capacity building for government resulted in improved services for boys
and girls?
− To what extent has the humanitarian-development nexus been implemented
306. To answer the above questions, the evaluation was focus on measures that ensure
sustainability of results in policy and services delivery level, and how humanitarian-
development nexus has been implemented.
4.5.1. Measures for ensuring sustainability of results
307. The sustainability has been analyzed through different aspects:
(a) policy environment and policy strategy;
(b) capacity to implement policies;
(c) financial and for human resources committed for implementation;
(d) existence of a monitoring system to ensure the implementation is sustained.
4.5.1.1. Existence of enabling policies and strategies to support sustainability
308. An important aspect of the sustainability is that UNICEF has achieved the CP results
working together with the GoE to develop legislation and policies which create and strengthen
an enabling environment across UNICEF’s target sectors. For example, at system level,
sustainability mechanism is related to political advocacy and capacity building. As mentioned
in the effectiveness section, UNICEF has supported the development of national or sectoral
strategies and law which explicitly take into account the issue of children’s rights.
4.5.1.2. Capacity to implement policies and strategies
309. In order to achieve future sustainability of the interventions, UNICEF has developed
capacity building activities and advocacy at institutional, governorate, district and community
level. Staff from ministries including MoHP, MoF, MoPED, MoSS, MoYS, NCCM and
83
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
CAPMAS have successfully completed trainings and capacity building activities supported by
UNICEF.
310. A sub-question of the evaluation is related to the extent to what the capacity building for
government resulted in improved services for boys and girls.
311. To answer this question, the evaluation relied on the interviews of stakeholders from
central government. They noted that trainings, workshops, manuals and guidelines prepared
with the support of UNICEF helped them to understand better the needs and possible
approaches to respond to the needs of children. There are also examples of positive impact at
individual level: first cohorts of trained practitioners became competent trainers for
programmes implemented with MoYS and MoHP.
312. A consensus among stakeholders was that the efforts of UNICEF were of particular
importance in the sectors of social inclusion and data, case management, FGM, education,
ECD, medical response of COVID-19 and, provided the best coverage given available
resources. For example, through the design and implementation of the Egypt National Family
Survey, CAMPAS staff have gain substantial knowledge, leadership and ownership to conduct
future nation-wide household surveys. Indeed, the generation of evidence is based on the
organization of briefs/studies and seminars with national and international experts and, this is
potential to sustain the advocation for children’s rights and deprivations as it places children’s
rights at the centre of the policy debate and policy making.
313. Implementing partners (CSOs and Non-Governmental Organizations) have been
supported in different areas including: financial management processes, capacity development
training, development of e-tools and this led to timely report on a quarterly basis. Above all,
some participants in KII said: “UNICEF is functioning on need based and its direct
interventions for children and young people in their communities is an assurance of
sustainability and impact on children’s life”.
314. In addition, the positive change in social norms (FGM, girl empowerment and violence
against children) represents key prerequisites for sustainable outcomes for children.
4.5.1.3. Committed resources to ensure sustainability
315. The GoE is committed in a sustainable manner to achieve SDG including to promote the
well-being of children. Consequently, the public investment on education and health sector has
been on a steady rise since 2016.
84
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
316. The GoE has also made effort to get human resources to implement the CP. However,
sustainability of acquired knowledge and skills at institutional level is challenging due to the
high turnover rate of technical staff.
317. The sustainability of CP is also dependent on the partnership that the GoE has established
with other development partners. The following partnerships are good examples of
sustainability with long term effect and then more sustainable. The ‘United Nations Joint Fund
Support Project for Integrated Financing for SDGs in Egypt’ aims to help Egypt fulfil its
National Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 with a realistic financing strategy to invest in
several key sectors, including some ‘accelerators’ of the SDGs. UNICEF has participated in
this joint programme that is under the coordination of the United Nations Resident
Coordinator’s Office and the United Nations Development Programme in Egypt23. The joint
Programme is expected to catalyse high level dialogues on key aspects of SDG financing in
Egypt between the Government and the United Nations system involving other key
stakeholders such as the international financial institutions and the private sector.
318. The second example of joint programme that involves UNICEF is the ‘Mainstreaming,
Acceleration and Policy Support’24. It operates within the premises of the 2018-2022 UNPDF
and intended to better understand interlinkages across the SDGs and to nurture planning and
decision-making in an integrated way that supports balanced progress across the three pillars
of development and also to provide concrete evidence-based policy recommendations that are
actionable.
4.5.1.4. Monitoring system to ensure the implementation is sustained
319. In supporting TKP, UNICEF contributed to improve its design, implementation and the
M&E system for sustainability.
320. In regard to child protection, EVAC strategic framework and plan of action were
developed along with a case management system.
321. Stakeholders from government are also willing that UNICEF develop or apply
framework or tools to more systematically capture the impact of its interventions and lessons
learnt for future programmes.

85
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
322. Furthermore, the GoE has formed an Inter-Ministerial Committee by a decree from the
Prime Minister to follow up the implementation of the SDGs including CAPMAS as the
national statistical office and the main source of data required for the SDGs. However,
challenges exist and could jeopardize the M&E system of the SDG in Egypt including25:
− week technical capacity building on SDGs;
− Insufficient quality assurance of data produced by other statistical parties;
− Data gaps on key thematic areas;
− The need to rely more on administrative data;
− Insufficient Financial Resources;
− Lack of a National Strategy for the Development of Statistics.
4.5.2. Humanitarian-Development nexus
323. The Humanitarian-Development Nexus approach demands both humanitarian and
development efforts to be more effectively connected, working towards achieving collective
outcomes that reduce need, risk and vulnerability, over multiple years.
324. As mentioned in the efficiency analysis section, emergency issues were important during
the CP course as the overall emergency budget represents 39.1 per cent 26 of the budget
received up for the for CP.
325. Given that children, adolescent and youth in emergency contexts face numerous
challenges in accessing and obtaining a quality education, UNICEF has supported community-
based-schools with educational supplies and learning opportunities including for refugee
children. UNICEF has also set up an online learning platform (the learning Passport) to serve
the most marginalized children in Egypt, particularly refugee and migrant students.
326. UNICEF is successfully and appropriately working with and through the GoE to
strengthen state-led responses to COVID-19. In doing so, the organization reinforces its
subnational presence and comparative advantage through strong relationships and networks
with line ministries including MoHP across multiple sectors.

86
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
327. However, the new approach of the nexus and its language are not fully integrated in the
CP as it is not yet prominently integrated into the 2018-2021 Strategic Plan. Thus, UNICEF
might fully integrate COVID-19 adaptations into the next CPD and maintains funding for both
wider development programming and ongoing emergency responses. Additionally, there is an
opportunity for COVID-19 to accelerate progress on shock-responsive social protection and
strengthen local and national capacities for disaster risk management and preparedness.
87
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
Conclusion and recommendation
328. Sustainability aspects are embedded in the CP towards sustainable change at the level of
duty-bearers in terms of enabling policy frameworks and strengthened capacities as well as at
the level of rights-holders through sustainable access to opportunities and services and through
empowerment for meaningful participation in rights realization of boys and girls.
329. UNICEF Egypt has shown a substantive contribution to the development and
improvement of the legal and policy framework in many focus areas of the CP such as its
support to education reform, NPA of EVAC, amendments to the laws on FGM. Thus, UNICEF
has contributed to establish an enabling environment for preserving and enriching the CP
results in the coming years and evidence of sustainability should be more evident after the end
of CP.
330. Furthermore, there are results across outcomes which are already showing good
sustainability prospects. For instance, UNICEF support is acknowledged in terms of capacity
development training, support to improve the M&E system of TKP, interventions to address
root causes of harmful practices.
331. With the support of UNICEF, capacities building activities led to more competent and
skilled staff, institutionalized trainings in M&E approaches, availability of a wide range of
guidelines, quality standards toolkits, training modules and methodologies. Staff turn-over in
public institutions impedes the long-term strategic thinking and action and might decrease the
institutional sustainability.
332. The results achieved in support to the COVID-19 response of the government and
UNICEF effort to integrate refugee children and migrant in learning opportunity are examples
of humanitarian-development nexus, even there is a need to accelerate progress on shock-
responsive social protection and strengthen local and national capacities for disaster risk
management and preparedness. The frequency and complexity of humanitarian crises urge
having a better risk-informed programming and stronger systems for prevention, response and
early recovery. However, UNICEF Egypt has not yet designed a strategic framework
for emergency preparedness which explicitly connect shock responsive interventions and long-
term development initiatives especially for most vulnerable communities. UNICEF Egypt has
been rather reactive to COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of a strategic planning.
88
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
Recommendation 6: Prioritize the finalization and implementation of the strategic framework
for emergency preparedness to support resilient and shock-responsive activities while focusing
interventions where possible in the most vulnerable communities for the new CP.
Ways to fully integrate the humanitarian–development continuum into programming include:
- To implement the nexus in accordance with the UNICEF’s Strategic Plan 2022–2025 which
does not separate out humanitarian action as a cross-cutting priority, but rather, and in
accordance with an approach that supports programming across the humanitarian-development
nexus, it systematically applies a humanitarian lens to the theories of change underlying work
on all Goal Areas including the results framework;
- To consider an emergencies risk analysis as part of the CP planning process to assess internal
skills and capacity, analyze children and women’s vulnerability, assess capacities of
Government, humanitarian actors, national partners and communities;
- To develop minimum preparedness activities for different types of crises (sudden/slow-
onset, acute/chronic) to fill potential capacity gaps and ensure UNICEF readiness to respond
in line with UNICEF global emergency preparedness guidance.

V. LESSONS LEARNED
333. This section, outlines the main lessons learned that emerge from findings highlighted in
previous evaluation. The following lessons learnt can be capitalized for the future programme
implementation.
5.1. Looking through the COVID-19 window of opportunity
334. The COVID-19 pandemic in forcing to respond quickly and adapt constantly to new
challenges has demonstrated the importance of robust and resilient and shock-responsive
national systems in all development areas.
335. In addition, bridging the digital divide can help bring quality education for all. As a result,
there is a growing interest for online platforms dedicated to E-learning or training sessions. The
pandemic has sped up the use of RTM for example to conduct a monitor the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on a number of social indicators in Egypt.
336. With all of the changes that have taken place globally due to COVID-19, remote work
has proven not only to be a necessity but an overwhelming success. Then, the pandemic has
increase cost-efficient virtual meetings of which some are more suitable compared to face-to
face meetings.
337. Learning from its experience of managing partnerships during the COVID-19 response,
the CO might also improve budget flexibility, adaptive programming and meaningful partner
interaction, and simplifying its partnership arrangements in emergency contexts. Thus, the
pandemic brings many opportunities that help promote children rights.
5.2. Functional task forces and internal coordination mechanisms
338. Intersectoral coordination mechanisms is crucial on enhancing intersectoral CP
component. Hence, a strong leadership and management are essential to strengthen internal
task forces and coordination mechanisms and the, ensure effectiveness of task forces and
overall coordination mechanisms.
339. In regard to coordination with other United Nations Agencies, it is important to prevent
coordination issues such as those related to the Sinai programme.
5.3. Many external factors have facilitated the progress toward results
340. The COVID-19 pandemic has occurred during the CP implementation. However, many
external factors have facilitated the progress toward results such as legislative reforms and
90
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
presidential initiatives. The enabling factors include strengthening systems, promoting child
sensitive legislation and regulatory frameworks, structural reforms with targeted subsidies,
interventions in the most vulnerable regions (especially in upper Egypt). They are strong
foundation to achieve better results in child rights related indicators.
5.4. Promising successful pilot models
341. The ECD pilot models including on-site childcare service, shared childcare facilities,
outsourcing, and childcare allowance should be adopted by the private sector as there is an
evidence-based of their success.
342. The case management system approach established by MoSS which firstly serves as a
one-stop shop for various services including child protection services, became a national model
for the provision of comprehensive package services proposed to the Prime Minister’s Office
as the model for Haya Karima villages targeting the most vulnerable communities in Egypt.
343. The success of the pilot phase of the positive parenting programme and the findings of
the formative research on this programme have been instrumental for scaling up the positive
parenting programme in Egypt. Moreover, the GoE, the civil society, UNICEF, EU and private
sector remain committed to the promotion and the scaling up the positive parenting programme
as an enabler for child development and protection from violence and a subsidiary of the Child
Development Foundation.
344. Regarding UNICEF’s work on girls’ empowerment coupled with the abandonment of
child marriage and FGM, donors and other stakeholders have agreed that more outreach to the
local level is needed as many governorates are concerned with those issues that are rooted in
cultural and social norms.
345. The Meshwary project on adolescents and youth empowerment is a success and has a
potential to support key adolescent development outcomes. It also gained endorsement from
the Prime Minister

Purpose of Activity/Assignment:
In line with the UNICEF Evaluation Policy, Country Programme Evaluations are mandatory for every second programming
cycle. As the Egypt Country Office did not have a Country Programme Evaluation during its last programming cycle and
is therefore mandated to conduct a Country Programme Evaluation at this point. It is within this context, that the
government of Egypt and UNICEF Egypt Country Office (ECO) will begin discussions about the priorities, strategies, and
resource requirements of the next Country Programme (CP) for the period 2023-2026.
To inform this work a Country Programme Evaluation is being undertaken to allow the office to evaluate the current
country programme and how UNICEF has fared. The evaluation seeks to understand factors that have facilitated or
hindered achievement of results for children and identify key lessons and recommendations for the upcoming country
programme. Furthermore, the evaluation will look into alignment of the current country programme to national
priorities.
Objectives
The objective of the independent evaluation consultancy of the UNICEF country programme 2018 - 2022 is to produce
an independent and useful evaluation report that provides accountability and learning. The Evaluation is forward
looking and inform the development of the new CPD (2023-2027).
More specifically the evaluation will:
Assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of the program and of the results achieved, the
focus will be on relevance and effectiveness.
• Assess the extent that the UNCIEF CPD 2018-2022 upstream policy, strategy and other system level support in
education reform, child protection, and youth empowerment, ECD, and child survival contribute in promoting
child rights in alignment to the emerging national Egyptian priorities and towards contributing to SDGs? What
are the factors that have facilitated or hindered achievement of results for children and the key lessons,
accelerators and recommendations to inform the upcoming country Programme?
• Assess the extent UNCIEF CPD was effective and contributed to more vulnerable children27, adolescence and
youth in improving learning, protection, participation, better health and wellbeing? What could be done
differently to address the vulnerability through upcoming country programme.
• Assess the extent the design and the interventions of the Country Programme Document integrate cross cutting
issues such as gender, youth, child rights, children with disability, equity, etc?
Provide concrete recommendations to improve the design and relevance of the Country Programme to the UNICEF
Strategic Plan (relevant Egypt planning tools)
27 Including children with disabilities, adolescent girls.
107
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
Scope of Work
The Country Programme Evaluation will focus on the CP 2018 – 2022. The evaluation will draw on the CPD document,
CPD Results and Resources framework, as well as the evaluations already conducted and the Mid-term Review of the
country programme. The evaluation will look at the program at a high level focusing on strategic and high-level issues
rather with a zoom on promoting child rights in alignment to emerging national priorities and towards contributing to
the SDGs. And to what extent UNCIEF CPD was effective and contributed to more vulnerable children and how did it
apply cross cutting issues such as gender, youth children with disability throughout the country program.
Evaluability
The country programme includes agreements of the work programme by sector as well as strategic notes that describe
the activity
The programme has undergone several deep dives as well as a midterm review that have documented much of the key
issues of the country programme as well as the progress to date.
The mid-term review includes reflection on the pathways for change.
Evaluation Questions
The evaluation questions are relatively high level with potential sub-questions that should help the consultant develop
the evaluation matrix included in the annex. The Consultant is expected to design the methodology and questions that
are expected to effectively inform the objectives of this assignment. The questions are selected taking the OECD
Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria into account but not assessing connectedness or impact given the
nature of the programme.
30. The main purpose of this evaluation is for learning and accountability. It is both summative and formative

108
Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report
Methodology
Based on United Nations Evaluations Group (UNEG) and UNICEF guidance on evaluation including the norms and
standards, the guidance on how to integrate gender into evaluation. Ethical Guidelines for UN Evaluations and the
UNICEF procedure for ethical standards in research, evaluation, data collection and analysis will guide the overall
process. UNICEF adapted evaluation report standards and Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS). The
evaluation should incorporate the human rights-based and gender perspective and be based on results-based
management principles and logical framework analysis.
The Consultant will develop the detailed evaluation design during the inception phase – in close consultation with the
MENARO Regional Advisor Evaluation managing the evaluation, and key evaluation stakeholders. The Evaluation should
rely on diverse quantitative and qualitative information that will need to be triangulated. The stakeholders for this
evaluation are relevant Government partners with whom UNICEF has joint annual work plans. Where possible and
appropriate, the evaluation should seek to obtain evidence as to what may or may not have occurred in the absence of
UNICF’s programme.
The evaluation will use data from primary and secondary sources, including desk review of documentation and
information and interviews with key stakeholders. A participatory and transparent process will be followed to engage
with multiple stakeholders at all stages of the evaluation process.
