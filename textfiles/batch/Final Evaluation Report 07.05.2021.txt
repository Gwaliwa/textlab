Executive Summary
The Project, Promoting Reconciliation in Sri Lanka with USD 1.6 million was funded by the Peacebuilding Fund
of the UN and implemented from April, 2017 to August 2019. The Project was extended up to 31 December
2020 with financial closure on 30 September 2020. The Project's peacebuilding efforts are implemented by
UNDP, UNICEF and WHO through three Outcomes, viz., (a) Promoting processes for social cohesion and
conflict prevention (UNDP), (b) improving education system to support inter-personal and inter-group
understanding and interaction (UNICEF), and (c) addressing conflict-related mental health and psychosocial
issues (WHO). The Project was implemented at the National level as well as in the Northern, Eastern, Uva, and
Central provinces.
The Evaluation: The purpose of the evaluation is to provide lessons for future peacebuilding initiatives to the
Government counterparts, UN agencies and implementing partners, and the Peacebuilding Fund. The objective
of this summative evaluation, carried out between November 2020 to March 2021, is to assess relevance,
efficiency, effectiveness, progress towards outcomes, sustainability, gender and conflict sensitivity of the
Project as well as the effectiveness of monitoring and evaluation. The evaluation was commissioned by UNICEF.
The evaluation methodology consisted of desk review of documents, 90 key informant interviews, 33 Focus
Groups Discussions, and a physical assessment of 11 schools for civic education and positive discipline. A
questionnaire was administered to 33 beneficiaries to assess the performance of livelihood assistance initiative.
Because of COVID-19 pandemic, virtual data collection methods were used in Key Informant Interviews. The
evaluation faced several limitations, viz., difficulties with identifying key informants and arranging interviews
(Component # 1); delays in obtaining key documents from RUNOs; absence of critical information on project
implementation; and extended closure of schools due to COVID-19.
Relevance: The Project is well aligned with Government's policies and strategies especially supporting
UNHCR Resolution 30/1, and the National Policy on Education for Social Cohesion and Conflict Resolution and
Reconciliation. It builds on Articles 28/29 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child of UNESCO framework
of Global Citizenship. The psychosocial component addresses the mental health and psychosocial issues in the
reconciliation process and in a conflict-related milieu in the overall peace building efforts. The Project is also
aligned with the Peacebuilding Priority Plan (PPP) for Sri Lanka.
Effectiveness: Overall progress is weak, and targets have not been achieved. Project delivery has suffered
from inadequate coordination amongst UN Agencies and connectivity amongst the implementing partners. A
common understanding of the 'Project' amongst implementers was not evident at different levels. Absence of
a designated ‘Project Manager’ for overall coordination and timely implementation has affected effectiveness.
These delays have been exacerbated by the Easter Sunday attack of 2019 and COVID-19 pandemic.
Additionally, the dissolution/disengagement of the relevant Government agencies in 2019/2020 has
significantly affected effectiveness.
The Project, however, made adjustments to address critical gaps in government funding for emergency work
after the Easter Sunday attack of 2019 and COVID-19 pandemic. With the disengagement of ONUR, funds
were utilized for a research study on violence and to provide livelihood support to ex-combatants. The modus
operandi of implementing this initiative via Government agencies was apt albeit it did not provide the desired
outcomes. The Project's approach of implementation through CSOs could have been more effective if the
connectivity amongst CSOs was better.
Whilst the Project's design has considered the pathways for peacebuilding, its Theory of Change does not
capture the philosophy of UN Joint Programming reflecting the need for integrated responses to the issues.
In Project management, programmatic coordination has not been effective. The Project neither prepared
annual workplans nor a monitoring and evaluation plan. As a result of weak monitoring, major delays in
delivery of outputs do not appear to have drawn the attention of UN agencies.
Efficiency: The evaluation did not analyse financial information as output-based expenditures were not
available. Yet, there was general indication that the allocations made to work packages were more than
adequate; the Project did not assess some deliverables for value-for-money.
iv
Progress towards Outcomes: Limited project progress at the output level has hindered the Project’s ability
to contribute to outcomes. In Component # 1, Project's initiatives at policy level have not proceeded to the
level expected with delayed delivery or abandoning outputs due to the closure of the Secretariat for
Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms and disengagement of Office for National Unity and Reconciliation
in 2019/2020. The social cohesion module introduced to Sri Lanka Institute for Development Administration is
noteworthy, but its continuation could not be ascertained.
In the education component (# 2), delivery has been affected by the limited level of understanding of the
innovative concepts of civic education and positive disciplining amongst CSO partners, and delays and the
inability to complete work. The social cohesion work has not been taken up evenly across the schools. The
School Development Plans have not factored in the activities promoted by the Project into their planning
processes. Monitoring of project work in schools was weak. The E-platform is fully implemented only at one
school, because the school has trained staff and enthusiastic parents and students.
In regard to positive discipline, schools lack facilities that are conducive for learning and social and emotional
growth. Of the children, 3.2% did not feel safe and protected at school; 4% did not feel protected and safe at
home; 10% did not feel that teachers engaged them interactively; 9% did not like to work in groups and in
supporting peers; and 21% did not feel they had the ability for tolerance and anger management. The
evaluation found that 89% of the parents continue to beat children as the most effective form of discipline;
42% use harsh language; 33% do not establish rules of behaviour and encourage good behaviour; 29% do not
have a daily routine or structure at home; and 24% do not demonstrate anger management and self-restraint.
The progress could have ben better demonstrated if there was a baseline, technically sound common modules
with provision for adaptation across the Provinces and sectors of living, and regular review. Work with the
University Grants Commission and the National Institute of Education has not been completed.
In Component # 3, the Project supported the preparation of the National Mental Health Policy (2019-2030)
and the Action Plans have been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in December, 2020. The Project's work
on mapping mental health and psychosocial services using the IASC 4Ws tool has not been taken to a
completion due to lack of access to data. The National Suicide Prevention Strategy, developed with Project's
support is yet to be approved. The Project developed a suicide registry and a hospital-based suicide attempt
surveillance system for the Ministry of Health, and trained its staff. This is yet to be operationalised. The Project
trained 60 volunteers from 11 districts to recognize and support suicide prevention. The Project is continuing
its dialogue with the Ministry of Health to complete the tasks initiated under the Project.
The Project supported the Mental Health GIS-based access points and piloted it in Nuwara Eliya and Mannar
districts. The Global tool, MH Atlas was introduced to collect data on mental health. The Project trained 250
mental health professionals in early identification and treatment of substance abuse. The Manohari
Programme, introduced to strengthen psychosocial well-being and improve mental health services through
community-based interventions, has been piloted in 12 districts for frontline mental health staff and
community leaders. The staff showed positive behavioural changes. The multi-stakeholder alcohol abuse
prevention programme also supported communities to acquire coping skills. Following the Easter Sunday
attack (2019), the Project trained about 1,500 teachers in the affected areas on Psychosocial First Aid and
provided a purpose-built self-help manual in Sinhalese and Tamil. The IASC-MHPSS Reference guide on Basic
Psychosocial Skills for COVID-19 Responders was translated into local languages.
Sustainability: The evidence for sustainability of project initiatives is limited, as several work packages are yet
to be completed. The closure of Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms and the
disengagement of the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation from the Project have significantly affected
sustainability of the peacebuilding component. The sustainability of modules for introducing reconciliation
and peacebuilding to new entrants of the Government Administrative Service could not be assessed due to
non-availability of information. Sustainability of the work with the University Grants Commission on ragging is
uncertain, and UNICEF will continue to support the National Institute of Education on curriculum revisions,
expected to come into force in 2023. In the psychosocial component, sustainability of some initiatives cannot
be assessed as work has not been taken to a completion. The Manohari programme has transcended beyond
the trained frontline health staff in some locations but it has not been institutionalised in the Ministry of Health.
v
Alcohol abuse prevention work is institutionalised in the relevant agencies. The developments in reconciliation
in Sri Lanka have somewhat reversed largely due to very divisive election of 2019, Easter Sunday attack of 2019
and the COVID-19 burial issues.
Cross-cutting considerations on gender and conflict-sensitivity: In Gender, there are no specific
interventions towards achieving Gender indicators except in Component 2. The Project has not maintained
gender disaggregated data in Components 1 and 3. The understanding of gender equality programming and
monitoring amongst Partners is not to the desired level. There are no documented insights of Project's
technical inputs on gender equality and its inclusion in the curricula and modules developed. In Conflict
Sensitivity the Project approach included conflict sensitivity analysis and vulnerability assessments. The Project
followed conflict analysis as a central and cross-cutting component to promote conflict sensitive practices of
the project. There is evidence to ensure that conflict sensitivity is integrated in Project actions.

Lessons Learnt: There are five programming lessons, viz., (1) Using a bottoms-up approach and capturing the
nuances of joint programming in designing projects of this nature, (2) implementation modality of using
Government partners and CSOs with better oversight, (3) the success of delivery of civic education and positive
discipling is due to the readiness of schools to embrace new methods, (4) need for regular dialogue with
Government agencies to ensure proper management of work packages, and (5) success of interlinkages
between psychosocial support and peacebuilding was dependent on the commitment of the community
health professionals.

1. Introduction
Sri Lanka has experienced insurrectionary violence and protracted ethno-political conflict from
about 1983 to 2009. The youth led insurrectionary violence in the South of the county from
1987-89 and the separatist violence between Tamil youth led rebel groups and government
forces in the North and East of the country killed thousands and inflicted devastating and
deeply felt consequences at the human, social, physical, and institutional level. The conflict has
created made people less secure. Repeated displacement from the homes, inability to access
their own lands for livelihoods, food insecurity, and destruction of infrastructure were evident
in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, resulting in vulnerable groups such as women-headed
households, families of the disappeared, or former child combatants. The process of reparation
and reconciliation has lingering issues with post-traumatic stress disorders within the affected
communities and social and political divisions between ethnicities and social groups.
With the end of the conflict in the North and the East in 2009, the Government made significant
investments in infrastructure development thus vastly improving the roads, hospitals,
administrative buildings, schools, electricity, telecommunication and water supply. Processes
of conflict resolution and reconciliation were parallel initiatives to establish a socially cohesive
society. The Government established a ministry for rehabilitation and reconciliation in 2015,
which provided the institutional framework to work on policies focused on issues of
peacebuilding, reconciliation and transitional justice. Concomitantly, two agencies, viz.,
Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM) and the Office of National
Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) were established to promote and coordinate transitional
justice and reconciliation initiatives. The constitutional crisis of October 2018 which removed
the then Prime Minister, temporarily deactivated SCRM; although it was restored with the
reappointment of the Prime Minister in early 2019. The change of Government in November
2019, SCRM was again deactivated and finally dissolved in early 2020 as it had not been
established under a statute; ONUR became completely dormant and staff moved elsewhere.
In October 2015, the Human Rights Council adopted a resolution titled ‘Promoting
reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka’. The resolution supported the
commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to undertake a comprehensive approach for
reparation and reconciliation with a nationally owned and victim-centric transitional justice
process that addressed the social and political divisions in Sri Lanka. and advanced
accountability and reconciliation for all. SCRM was specifically entrusted with the way forward
on the Human Rights Council's Resolution.
Consequently, the Peacebuilding Priority Plan (PPP)1 was prepared by the Government of Sri
Lanka and the Peacebuilding Support Office to implement the reconciliation and transitional
justice commitments to the people as part of Government's peacebuilding agenda. This Plan
was expected to serve as the framework for development partners' support towards
peacebuilding.
The Government, in 2017, identified the need for reforms to educational curricula to address
issues surrounding peacebuilding and encouraging a more inclusive and pluralist society’2. The
revisions to the curricula were expected to address the need for inclusive policy and practice
with equitable representation in decision-making around policy reforms, education

administration and school governance; all groups should benefit from an equitable allocation
of education inputs; all groups must feel that their cultures, gender identities, religions and
languages are recognized and respected within the education system. Revisions to the civic
education curricula and supplementary modules for language was perceived as a means of
improving trust and social cohesion between people and groups by strengthening
competencies in analyzing the legacies of conflict; resolving conflict and promoting peace and
social cohesion.
Additionally, the Government also highlighted two pre-conditions that will contribute towards
the educational reforms, namely, curriculum revisions and school to university level models
aimed at strengthening competencies among young Sri Lankans for analyzing, resolving, and
preventing conflict as well as promoting peace within their communities.
Analysis of the situation on the ground in the conflict-affected areas also highlighted the need
for psychosocial support for affected communities. It noted that psychosocial services are of
ad hoc nature without proper support programmes for follow-up work and feed-back
mechanisms. The National Mental Health Policy expired in 2015, and an updated Policy was
needed.
Many donor-funded projects have examined some of the issues highlighted in the previous
sections. At the time of the design of this Project, there have been four projects implemented
in Sri Lanka supported by the UN Secretary-General’s Peacebuilding Fund (PBF)3 at a total value
of USD 655,000.

2. Background
The Peacebuilding Priority Plan (PPP) supports the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the
Government's reconciliation and accountability commitments in keeping with the Human
Rights principles and standards as part of its peacebuilding agenda. In terms of the agreement
signed by the Co-Chairs of the Peacebuilding Board, the UN Resident Representative and the
Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sri Lanka are eligible to source funds from the UN
Peacebuilding Fund to implement the peacebuilding agenda in Sri Lanka
2.1. The Project
The Project, Promoting Peacebuilding in Sri Lanka, has identified the following three
intervention areas based on the development of PPP and its implementation. Firstly, the
Government set in place two Ministries with mandates to promote national integration and
reconciliation, and national dialogue across the country. Given the number of stakeholders, it
was important to set in place a coherent national architecture for the institutions mandated
with peacebuilding, including a regularised platform for dialogue at all levels (Outcome # 1).
Secondly, the Report of the Taskforce on Reconciliation Mechanisms recommended changes
to educational curricula4 supporting social cohesion, thus providing the rationale for Outcome
# 2. Thirdly, the same Task Force recommended providing psychosocial support5, in particular
addressing affected youth and young refugees, IDPs and former child soldiers providing the
background for Outcome 3.
The Project budget is USD 1.6 million (see Annex 2.1 for details).
The Project contributes to PPP outcome 'Reconciliation' (Sri Lankan society with peaceful co-
existence and a sense of belonging6). The focus of the Project is in line with 2.1 (National
Reconciliation), 2.3 (Conflict prevention) and 4.1(Strengthening essential national state
capacity) of PBF Focus areas.
The Project commenced in April 2017 with a duration of 29 months but has been extended up
to 31 December 2020 with financial closure on 30 September 2020.
Project Objective and Outcomes
The Project's Theory of Change (ToC) is reproduced below7:
IF authorities committed to peacebuilding and healing develop, through inclusive
consultative processes, policies and strategies that provide opportunities and mechanisms
for groups involved in and affected by the conflict to interact and share lessons and
experiences, AND to jointly participate in rebuilding, reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts
between and amongst communities, THEN prospects for creating a society that is tolerant
and lives in harmony are greatly enhanced.
The key assumptions of the ToC are the availability of effective consultation processes and
opportunities for sharing lessons and experiences together with joint community interaction

to necessary platforms for peace and harmony in the affected communities. The evaluation
focussed on these elements to assess the performance of the Project.
The key objective set out in the ToC aligns well with the PPP Outcome on Reconciliation, which
relates to the establishment of positive relationships and mutual understanding between and
among different groups contributing to peaceful co-existence.
The project aimed to implement this theory of change through the following three outcome
areas:
Outcome 1 Processes and mechanisms promoting social cohesion and conflict
prevention, including through dialogue and early warning, institutionalized
at national and sub-national levels
Outcome 2 Education system supports inter-personal and inter-group understanding
and interaction among teachers, students, parents, and communities
Outcome 3 Conflict-related mental health issues are addressed to reduce inequalities and
promote greater state and civic engagement in reconciliation processes
The key outputs and performance indicators are given in Table 2.1. Annex 2.2 gives Outcomes,

2.2. Key Accomplishments of the Project
In the absence of the Project's terminal report, the following narrative reflecting the key
achievements of the Project has been prepared.
Outcome 1
Processes and mechanisms promoting social cohesion and conflict prevention, including
through dialogue and early warning, institutionalized at national and sub-national levels.
(UNDP)
Output 1.1
The Project supported the operation of the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation
Mechanisms (SCRM), established by a Cabinet decision in late 2016 in the Prime Minister's
Office as a sequel to UNHCR resolution to design and implement transitional justice
programme. The Project provided staff positions and the key functions undertaken are:
• Capacity development of state/non-state actors;
• Assist in developing a strategy for transitional justice; and
• Assist the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report on UN resolutions.
SCRM became inactive during the constitutional crisis in 2018 and was finally disbanded in
March 2020 without a successor.
The Project also launched the Ahanna (=listen) Programme to build awareness on
reconciliation on the theme Development begins with reconciliation. A mobile unit to show-
case the concept visited 44 towns covering Western, Southern, Central, Northern and Uva
Provinces, and conducted 10 events as a part of the Enterprise Sri Lanka Programme of the
Prime Minister's Office as well as in collaboration with the some District Secretariats.
The Project tried to engage the Provincial Youth Council Officers to sustain the Ahanna
Programme; however, this was not successful due to polarisation of youth committees based
on their ideologies (and opposition to the Prime Minister's Party). Attempts on continuation
of this programme at the community level through the Community Policing Committees also
came to a standstill halfway.
Phase II of the Ahanna Programme, planned to target schools, had to be abandoned early in
its life due to change of Government in late 2019. In this short period, if covered 20 schools in
Colombo/Avissawella area.
The Project recommended the establishment of District Reconciliation Committees; however,
there has been no action from the Government.
The Project developed a communications strategy for the SCRM to enhance their outreach on
reconciliation efforts;
The Project provided technical assistance for the establishment of the Office for Reparations10
in the Ministry of Justice.
The Project introduced social cohesion as the overarching theme and mainstreamed the ideas
of peacebuilding / reconciliation to social cohesion through the development of two online
10 Established by the Parliament Office for Reparations Act, No. 34 of 2018 (22 October 2018)

courses for the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA) to be used for
training and awareness building on social cohesion amongst Government officials11.
These courses are:
• Foundation Course on Social Cohesion for inductees of the Sri Lanka Administrative
Service;
• Elective course on conflict mitigation for mid- to senior public officials.
The Project developed the technical content and rolled out the Foundation Course for about
150 cadets of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (2019). This has since been converted to a
digital course.
The Project also trained 12 staff members of SLIDA as Trainers.
The Project proposed to SLIDA a protocol for monitoring and post assessment of the trainees
to ensure updating the course and to adjust it for sustainability. However, the Project has no
information on the current situation, and the evaluation was also not able to elicit any
information from SLIDA despite repeated attempts both by UNDP and the Evaluation Team.
The Project also carried out the following activities:
• Workshops on Social Media for Transitional Justice and Reconciliation (TJR) (12 workshops)
in Ratnapura, Colombo, Galle, Kalutara and Kandy to counter misinformation and to bridge
knowledge gaps among media personalities and journalists (2019)
• Media Workshops for Provincial Reporters on ethical and effective reporting of TJR (9
workshops) for building awareness and understanding among media personnel regarding
Peace and TJR; countering myths and misinformation regarding these concepts; and
provide knowledge on ethical methods of reporting (2019);
• Sensitising Programme on Government Reconciliation agenda for Government Staff
conducted in six districts (Anuradhapura, Colombo, Trincomalee, Matara, Kilinochchi and
Kandy) to seek the support of government officials (2019);
• Training of Trainers programme focusing on TJR for Community Policing Officers
conducted in seven districts with the participation of more than 500 CPC officials (2019);
• Two Military Dialogues Training of Trainers Programmes [12-day programme in 2018; 5-
day programme in 2019] on fundamentals of transitional justice conducted for 55 officers
from the Police and the Civil Security Department. The training was supported by the
Government of Switzerland, and 25 officers attended training in Swaziland and Malaysia.
The 12-day programme was supported by International Resource persons.
• Two Military Dialogues Programmes conducted for a cross section of middle grade officers,
junior officers and Non-Commissioned Officers of services covering about 80 beneficiaries
in each programme.
Output 1.2
Three CSOs (National Christian Evangelical Alliance of Sri Lanka; Sirahunani, and Prathibha
Media Network) partnered UNDP in this output, as outlined below:
• NCEASL developed the Minor Matters Platform including a ‘Digital Citizenship Toolkit
(DCT)' on ethical use of online platforms. The platform, based on the philosophy of
freedom on religion/beliefs, addressed safety and security of digital communications,
digital rights and responsibilities, and digital activism. DCT was launched in 2018 (following
11 Report of the Peacebuilding Advisor, UNDP (15 June 2019)
8
the religious fundamentalist incidents at Digana) and has reached 20,000 via social media
campaigns. It produced 11-module toolkit in Tamil and Sinhalese as the pivotal tool for
awareness raising on freedom of religion/belief.
➢ The Project funded the development of the tool kit; NCEASL leveraged other funding
to deliver training to 180 youth; it is awaiting approval of the Ministry of Youth Affairs
to be launched with Government blessing;
➢ Developed five proposals for on freedom of religion/beliefs as post training activities;
➢ Developed comic books (8-14 yr children). These are yet to be approved by the
Education Department to be used in schools;
➢ It has also conducted photo exhibitions, impressions and videos to convey its theme.
• Prathiba Media Network (PMN) promoted inter-religious and civil society dialogues on
social cohesion, transitional justice, and reconciliation in the Southern, Uva,
Sabaragamuwa, and Eastern Provinces. It addressed underlying issues such as negative
attitudes of the Southern 'Sinhala Buddhist' Communities towards transitional justice, their
ignorance on preventive measures for non-occurrence of conflicts and violence, reparation
for those who were victimized by circumstance of abuses and damages of internal armed
conflicts and the flawed understanding of constructive opportunities for peacebuilding
through engagement with the civil society actors and stakeholder institutions.
• Sirahunani launched the ‘Evidence’ Project aimed at rebuilding relationship between
Muslim and Tamil communities in the North and East of Sri Lanka, using films as the
medium to create dialogues. It worked intensely with ethnic and gender mixed Tamil and
Muslim youth groups and have trained them, empowered them, and facilitated them to
produce six films based on their own experiences, which have been showcased in the North
and the East.
Quotes from the Field: Participants of Prathiba Media Workshops
I participated in a Community Dialogue Media Training programmes conducted by Prathiba Media
Network as a youth service officer of the National Youth Service Council (NYSC). The training
improved my understanding of transitional justice and reconciliation, and reparation for the victims
of war and the conflict affected people. I contributed to both Ruhunu and Wellassa radio stations.
With the skills gained, I continue my work as a volunteer trainer for peacebuilding in the radio
programmes in my own work. With the experience gained, I do my own productions where I try to
demystify the concepts of transitional justice and social cohesion as essential elements of peace
building. I have witnessed PMN programmes influencing the youth and the general public to respect
the democratic rights of the communities….
A Participant/Trainer of Community Media Dialogue Programme
I am an ex-military officer and later started as a community volunteer. I participated in the Community
Media Dialogue Training conducted by PMN and contributed to as a leader to prepare and record
three community radio programmes. The training changed my negative attitudes convinced me of
the importance of transitional justice, social cohesion and reconciliation, and peaceful co-existence
of ethnic communities. I worked closely with religious leaders to bring together the Buddhist temple,
Christian church, Islamic Mosque and the Hindu Kovils of the estate Tamil Communities to eliminate
burning communal and religious hostilities and bring about peaceful co-existence and social
cohesion. I am happy that I have been able to bring together Sinhalese villages and Tamil plantation
communities. We also realised that both Sinhalese and Tamil communities should learn each other's
language; so, we started Tamil classes for Sinhalese children….

The project was also expected to identify priority issues that require resolution at the local
level, initiate dialogue to bridge the trust deficit and build momentum on peacebuilding.
These experiences have been used to recommend the establishment of District Reconciliation
Committees, which have not materialised.
The Project expected to strengthen capacities of identified CSO networks with a focus on
women’s groups and frontline government officials, through practical trainings and awareness
and support to create and strengthen a dialogue facilitator pool at the local level. There have
been no specific interventions targeted on women's groups, and the only work relating to
strengthening front-line government officials was the awareness programmes and SLIDA
trainings.
The Project planned to (a) support to adapt/design a model and tools which facilitate increased
communication at the community level and pilot the early warning model, (b) strengthen local
capacities to monitor the overall process and any resulting changes, and (c) identify key lessons
learnt on the process of adapting the model. Instead, the Project used part of the funds for a
research study on drivers of violence using secondary data by an International Consultant12.
The remaining funds13 have been used for an additional output to support ex-combatants with
vocational training and financial support to commence livelihood activities.
Livelihood Support to ex-combatants
About 350 ex-combatants and their family members received support from the Project; this
component has been implemented via the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs,
Resettlement and Reconciliation, Northern Province Development, Vocational Training and
Skills Development and Youth Affairs. However, there is no database of the beneficiaries, and
the Project was able to provide a list of only 60 beneficiaries. As was agreed with UNICEF, this
sub-component was assessed via individual telephone interviews based on a questionnaire
(the findings are in Annex 2.3). Of the 60, only 33 could be contacted as the telephone contacts
given were no longer in service or not responded. Beneficiary selection was the responsibility
of the District Secretariat. However, documented criteria for beneficiary selection were not
available with the Project.
Analysis of data collected from the administration of the questionnaire (Annex 2.3) revealed
the following:
• Overall, about 60% were satisfied with the new livelihood. About 15% were not
satisfied; these were largely in animal husbandry sector where the animals have died
due to disease and floods.
• All respondents stated that if not for Project assistance, they would not have been able
to start their new livelihood ventures. In regard to the impacts of the enterprise on
household income, 58% indicated modest impact whereas 21% indicated substantial
impact. Nine respondents had exposure to some form of vocational training arranged
by the security forces. Those respondents were of the view that all trainings received
were satisfactory. However, none of them was able to secure employment in the
relevant field of training; rather, the Project supported them with alternate livelihoods
(cf. Table 3 in Annex 2.3).
12 Report of this Study was not available to the evaluation team.

• The Project's support provided supplementary income to the families; however,
excepting in two cases, the Project did not follow up with the beneficiaries to ascertain
progress with their work. In terms of Project's visibility, none of the respondents was
aware that the support was provided by UNDP.
Outcome 2
Education system supports inter-personal and inter-group understanding and interaction
among teachers, students, parents and communities (UNICEF)
This section examines the interventions for education for social cohesion strategy and
activities. The strategy builds on the ongoing National Policy on Education for Social Cohesion
and Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation process which is seen as a vital process for
addressing the consequences of protracted internal social and political conflict in Sri Lanka.
There have been several initiatives in the past to introduce social cohesion in education
curricula. A review of these studies will provide an overview of successes and failures, which
would be useful to understand the contextual factors that contributed to the performance and
delivery of positive outcomes14.
The study uses a profile structure of the education system, its expectations and salient
characteristics that have a bearing on the delivery of an overall school curriculum that
promotes social harmony and addresses “interpersonal violence” or bullying in schools. The
curriculum in this context is the overall learning system of planned learning activities which
consists of content of subjects of study, lists of subjects, and experiences offered to learners
within the school15. The overall curriculum also specifies the combination of people, materials,
facilities and equipment and procedures that interact to achieve eight (8) common national
goals and seven (7) basic competencies which have been defined to contribute to Goal # 4 of
the Sustainable Development Goals16. This framework, which is elaborated in Annex 2.4, serves
as a tool not only to analyze the relevance of the interventions of the project but also to
understand how the project interventions contribute to the overall school curriculum. The
ongoing processes including a national-online consultative process for education reforms in
2023, has impacted the progress of work related to this output.
Output 2.1
The Project was expected to support the National Institute of Education (NIE) to revise curricula
to incorporate transversal skills into Sinhalese and Tamil languages through interactive
activities for Grade 6 and revise the civic education curriculum for lower secondary grades.
NIE completed two reports to include transversal skills to the language curriculum; however,
it has been decided that all revisions and changes should be part of the ongoing education
reforms to fully align with UNESCO’s Global Citizenship Framework. The general education
reforms are expected to be piloted in 2022 and finalized and rolled out by 2023. The NIE is of

the view that transitioning to skills-based education should be mainstreamed across the
curriculum rather than isolated curricula revisions. Given the overall education framework
adapted for this study (Annex 2.4), it is evident that the overall curriculum and the way it is
adapted in the school is of priority.
The Project also planned to support the NIE’s Department of Institutional Development to
enhance pre-service teacher capacity to deliver the Civic Education content using activity-
based teaching approaches. In this regard, following activities have been carried out:
• A desk review of the civic education curriculum of the National Education Colleges,
(taught at Sri Pada, Batticaloa and Ruhuna Colleges) using the framework of the “Global
Citizenship Education for Social and Emotional Learning”17 framework of UNESCO
targeting students aged 12-14 years of age;
• Developed methodologies for observing classroom practice of lecturers at the colleges
and pre-teacher candidates to understand how the curriculum is practiced as a
balanced mix of concept and theory and practice and experience. The field observation
team comprised NIE staff and lecturers from the Teacher Education Colleges;
• Delivered a field report based on the desk review and observations that found the
curriculum in practice was weighted to concept rather that activities and experiences
and had not been substantially upgraded to reflect and assess the key skills of the
global citizenship framework; and
• The draft revised module that focuses on activities that provide a range of learning
experiences is yet to be finalised. The draft curriculum was also validated by a selected
group of teachers who have taught the curriculum in schools for over five years.
However, the draft module will be subject to further review once the overall curricula
for the reforms proposed for 2023 are finalized.
The Project was also expected to develop a platform for teachers to promote civic
competencies among students in a meaningful manner by deploying digital tools in the
teaching-learning process. The main activities are debates, dramas, presentations, and blogs.
The Project partnered with a private company (Head Start) to establish an E-platform to
promote social cohesion in eight (8) schools in the North, East, Central and Uva provinces and
48 teachers were trained to reach 886 students. The company has experience in delivering
important educational content across geographic spaces with efficiency and has provided a
digital learning environment for students during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The Project
has developed the software and has designed the content for use of interactive learning
material for students and teacher guides, and has provided the necessary hardware to schools.
Teachers were trained in 2019 but work has been interrupted in 2020 due the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the Project has entered into a contract with this company until June 2021
for follow-up activities.
The following activities are yet to be completed:
• Finalising the revisions to the civic education curriculum and textbooks for general
education including training of In-service Instructors, teachers and finalizing teaching
guides, and developing monitoring protocols for curriculum implementation;
17 Key skills are: empathy, mindfulness, compassion and critical inquiry. UNESCO, MGIEP has designed a 6-module
series on global citizenship education, covering issues such as: terrorism, migration, governance, rights and duties,
identity and violence. https://mgiep.unesco.org/global-citizenship
12
• Approval and roll out of the Civic Education module for Teacher Education Colleges
(TEC), including completion of training of lecturers at TEC, and technically revising the
competency assessment tools of the curriculum to ensure the balance between
academic knowledge, practice and skill;
• E-learning teacher training, monitoring and follow up to capture learning and for
corrective action in the pilot schools; and
• Strategy to promote social cohesion and civic values through language and social
sciences subjects.
Output 2.2
Positive Discipline
The premise for this intervention is that improvement of social and emotional skills reduces
bullying and peer victimization, the persistence of which leads to increased levels of physical
and mental health problems, low academic achievement, behavioural difficulties and violent
behaviour in adulthood. Based on a pilot project on promoting positive classroom
management in the Northern Province, the stakeholders in education and UNICEF expanded
its interventions to promote conducive and collaborative learning environments in targeted
schools in the North, Central and Uva Provinces.
The project activities have been implemented through two CSO partners (IPDT and the Red
Cross) and the Provincial Ministries of Education.
In the Uva Province, the Red Cross has implemented the project in 55 schools in the Badulla
District. As the Red Cross did not have the capacity to implement the project in the Monaragala
District, the Provincial MoE has implemented the Project in several schools in the Monaragala
District. In Badulla, the Project developed modules in consultation with teachers, school
principals, and education and social service officers for training teachers, students and parents.
It also carried out orientation workshops for District level officers and the school community,
trained a core group of trainers as master trainers from the school community to rationalise
costs, and training teachers, school principals and School Attendance Committees (an
estimated 800 members, and trained volunteers for follow up and post training assessments).
In addition, a sum of LKR 15,000, has been given to each school to establish or upgrade spaces
for teachers assigned as school counsellors and a suggestion box for students.
The evaluation finds that this sub-component has been implemented within a span of seven
(7) months, starting in 2019 with no time allocation for follow up and review. Consequently,
there is no information of a project review or formal documentation of follow up and corrective
action. When viewed in the context of the “framework” referred to elsewhere. integrating and
enhancing general skills across the curriculum of schools requires a planning process with
school communities including the students, monitoring and reviewing change and assessing
outcomes. According to the Red Cross the time allocation for the process of engaging,
students of different ages, teachers, parents and school principals was insufficient and in the
absence of follow up mechanisms, the outcomes unascertainable.
In the Monaragala District the project has been implemented by the Provincial Ministry in 13
schools from four education divisions. Groups of three resource persons were trained and sent
to the District from Badulla to train parents, students, teachers and principals. Of the 52 schools
that were planned to benefit, 18 schools had been excluded and the project has come to a
13
standstill in 2020. There is an interest by the Provincial Council cover the remaining work in
schools.
In the Northern Province the project reached 150 schools and nearly 4,500 students. The
feedback on project activities was positive; the students in both primary and lower secondary
grades were trained on inclusive practices in the classroom such as supporting students who
fall behind in achievement, and creating a conducive classroom and school environment for
all students. The evaluation has assessed the views of both parents and teachers and note that
significant changes have taken place in the schools as a result of the interventions. In the
absence of effective outcome monitoring the study is unable to validate the information.
In the Eastern Province the programme has been implemented in several schools. The
Provincial Ministry has prior experience in implementing allied project strategies attributed to
UNICEF; the S4D strategy, and the music for social cohesion strategy have provided a
conceptual base for the positive discipline strategy. The music for social cohesion project
started in 2016 in partnership with 18 schools has been implemented over a period of 30
months. The project has since been extended to five schools each from the 17 educational
zones in the province and the Provincial Ministry plans to extend the programme. Discussions
with key informants showed that such prior experience in translating the concept of social
cohesion to action has given them a technical advantage over others who do not have such
prior experiences.
In the Central Province, the Provincial Ministry of Education implemented the project in
stages. During the first stage in 2018, the Project developed guidelines and a manual for
training a core team of trainers that included ISAs and the rolled out the training to school
principals, teachers, parents and students in 500 schools in the Nuwara Eliya District. The
specific reasons for selecting the Nuwara Eliya District were (a) excessive use of corporal
punishment by teachers and school principals which result in prolonged absenteeism of
students, (b) low levels of self-discipline of students mainly attributed to lack of structure and
guidance from family and community and (c) teachers who travel long distances and work
under difficult circumstances lack competencies to institute structure and practice and manage
student behaviours without the use of violence.
Project activities have been dormant in 2019 due to inaction by the implementers; in 2020 few
attempts have made to share experience and learning between school principals from urban
1AB schools and those from the Nuwara Eliya District. The Provincial Ministry has since revised
the manual and plan to implement the project in 20 schools from each of the five education
zones in the Nuwara Eliya District.
The Project also planned several other activities, as follows:
• Commissioning a study on the knowledge, attitudes and practices on bullying in
schools as an input to future advocacy for a national strategy to combat bullying in
schools. UNICEF’s study on ‘Estimating the Prevalence and Drivers of Bullying in
Schools’ has been completed and discussions are ongoing with relevant stakeholders
on its launch;
• Expanding the Positive Disciplining programme to 675 schools in the North, East,
Central, and Uva Provinces;
• Instituting a provincial mechanism to provide oversight and engagement with the
school community to promote violence-free schools;
14
• Develop a synchronized version of the “Positive Discipline Manual” to be used across
Provinces.
The evaluation found it difficult to determine the progress of planned activities across the four
Provinces as UNICEF did not have data on planned vs actual delivery of outputs. Some CSO
partners have data but their reliability could not be confirmed as UNICEF did not the relevant
work-plans. The evaluation found that the COVID-19 pandemic and the change of government
strategy have affected the progress of the project. In the absence of a mid-term review of the
project or consistent outcome monitoring, the evaluation safely infers that the following
activities are overdue/pending:
• Reaching all schools with a planned and integrated process of training, and support
for implementation at school level;
• Developing school-based action plans across schools with roles and responsibilities
and monitoring mechanisms to capture change;
• Training parents, especially, parents of children of high risk of dropping out of school
and other vulnerabilities;
• Capturing learning and developing centralised training modules for different target
groups such as parents, children, teachers and principals and standardizing the
technical content and modules. The good practices evidenced by the evaluation are
mainly based on the interest of the principal and staff rather than on the effectiveness
of implementation; and
• Managing implementation effectively across the provinces with centralized core
strategies and monitoring.
Output 2.3
The project planned to support the University Grants Commission to conduct a national study
on the Issues of Ragging and SGBV in Sri Lankan Universities. The rationale for the study is
derived from the fact that “ragging” is now defined as “a form of social violence that is now
almost institutionalised” a process which started as an "initiation ritual" characterized by
humour and relationship building has evolved into a process of abuse, humiliation, or
harassment of new entrants or junior students by selected groups of seniors. Ragging has
resulted in death and grievous physical harm to a small number of students. Different forms
of sexual harassment and abuse are the most prevalent. Although there is a body of research
and documentation18 of ragging the study was expected to provide an updated data and

analysis of the prevalence, nature of "low intensity violence”, mechanisms of prevention and
responding and the legal and procedural gaps.
It was envisaged that the findings of the study will be an input for the following:
• Support the development of policy guidelines that will create a macro framework to
promote violence-free environments, while universities will be expected to propose
their own measures at the university-level;
• Support strengthening the monitoring framework around issues of ragging and SGBV
and related data management at central and local levels;
• Provide input to pilot the strategies in three selected universities; and
• Develop a module on co-existence and Peace to be incorporated into the orientation
package for new university entrants.
This estimated cost of the intervention was LKR 19 million (or approximately USD 110,000),
and has been planned to be implemented in two Phases. In Phase I, the Centre for Gender
Equality and Equity of the UGC undertook a study on the issues. The draft report, which has
been reviewed by UGC authorities, has undergone revisions but is yet to be finalised by
UNICEF. The change of management at UGC following the change of Government in 2020 has
affected the pace of work. As a result, Phase II of the component, namely developing policy
guidelines to create a macro framework to promote violence-free environments, and
University level action plans, strengthening monitoring framework around issues of ragging
and SGBV and related data management at central and local levels, and the development of a
module on co-existence and peace for the new university entrants has not taken off the
ground.
A circular has been issued by the UGC in 2019 (No 12/2019) to create a macro framework to
promote violence-free environments, University level action plans, strengthening a monitoring
framework around issues of ragging and SGBV and related data management at central and
local levels.
The module on co-existence and peace for the new university entrants is yet to be fully
implemented. The module on social cohesion is in draft version and its utilization is yet to be
discussed and finalized.

Conflict-related mental health issues are addressed to reduce inequalities and promote
greater state and civic engagement in reconciliation processes (WHO)
This component is aimed to ensure that conflict-related mental health and psychosocial issues
are addressed to reduce inequalities and promote greater state and civic engagement in the
reconciliation processes, and has been implemented at national, provincial, district and
community levels.
The evaluation had noted that WHO-MHPSS programme has already inherited a legacy of
issues and an experience base in implementing a range of activities to address mental
disorders and well-being of individuals and communities in their conflict or disaster affected
environments in Sri Lanka. For example, responding to the plight and psychosocial challenges
faced by women-headed households created by the internal armed conflict and in the post-
16
conflict scenario and changes in their lives and the sustainability of their recovery attempts is
a case in point. The assessment of outcomes of MHPSS of the current project has been
undertaken with due considerations to the inherited issues and the experiences of
interventions of WHO implemented through community-based organizations, psychosocial
health volunteers, NGO activists in a milieu of changing policy reforms in the field of MHPSS.
The evaluation notes that these issues and experiences have factored into the project in order
to address psychosocial issues of different target groups and contribute to reconciliation
objectives of the Project.
Output 3.1
National Mental Health Policy and related areas
The Project supported drafting the National Mental Health Policy of 2019-2030 with the
participation of both Government and the Civil Society. The policy is expected to strengthen
(a) leadership, legislation, stewardship, research and management functions (b) delivery of
comprehensive mental health services, (c) human resources, infrastructure and financing. and
(d) empower communities in promoting their mental well-being and reducing stigma and
discrimination. The Policy places this work in the centre of the Directorate of Mental Health.
The Policy was approved in December 2020.
The Project also supported the preparation of mental health action plans through District
Mental Health Fora established with the technical support of the Project. This work is dormant
because of COVID-19 pandemic and with health staff otherwise engaged, and there has been
no progress.
Mapping Mental Health and Psychosocial Service
The Project also facilitated mapping of Mental Health and Psychosocial Service (MPSSS)
Providers and their service access points in Mannar, Batticaloa and Gampaha district by using
the IASC 4Ws tool. The mapping tool captures aspects such as coordination, collaboration,
referral systems and accountability mechanisms of diverse partners involved in the provision
of mental health and psychosocial support services, and has been applied in a sensitive
environment after the Easter Sunday attack of April 2019. It envisaged linking the MHPPS
service providers to Mental Health Fora at the district level.
A team of MHPSS practitioners conducted the district level mapping of Mental Health and
Psychosocial Service (MPSSS) Providers and their service access points using the tool, IASC
IASC 4Ws19. The evaluation found that the mapping work was not followed up due to
insufficient cooperation from the Government stakeholders in providing data and information,
and due to the complexity of the tool with coding and sub-coding, which have to be reviewed
in the Sri Lankan context for improving the intelligibility and user-friendliness for consideration
for adoption under low resource setting scenario.

The Project provided technical support to the Sri Lanka Medical Council for the development
of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy recommendations (December, 2019). However,
this is yet to be implemented by the Ministry of Health.
The Project supported the development of a suicide registry and a hospital-based suicide
attempt surveillance system for the Ministry of Health. For this purpose, it trained a cadre of
staff at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, India. The Project also
obtained expert services from this institute to prepare the national suicide registry and a
hospital-based suicide attempt surveillance system, and pilot it in the Gampaha District,
Although the activity is complete, it is yet to be operationalised due to non-availability of an
instruction manual to ensure systematic and unform data collection.
The Project, with the assistance of the College of Psychiatrists, trained about 100 media
personnel in order to prevent emulation effects of suicides on susceptible persons due to
sensational publicity through television and other mass media. The training has enabled the
journalists to use more neutral and appropriate language in reporting of suicides. Related to
this work, the Project made a local adaptation of the HBO play, Ever Brilliant Thing by Duncan
Macmillan. This one-off event held in Colombo attracted about 250; yet, there has been no
follow-up work by the Ministry of Health.
The Project partnered with the Consumer Action Network for Mental Health Lanka (CAN-MH)
to increase community capacity to recognize and support suicide prevention by recognizing
the stigma around attempted suicides. A 3-day workshop for 60 volunteers from 11 districts
was held in November 2019 with the focus of imparting a rights-based approach and
consumer empowerment and the other priority areas of the organization related to suicide
prevention. However, there has been no follow-up work by WHO.
Quotes from the Field: Participants of CAN-MH Workshops
I had been a mental patient for several years and was treated at a Government facility. On recovery,
I offered my art and craft skills for designing interior decorations, paintings and making toys and
ornamental goods for self-employment for women with similar mental and psychosocial problems.
CAN-MH workshops boosted my conceptual understanding of mental health, consumer
empowerment, and added meaning to my voluntary work on training mentally affected women.
Additionally, I got further opportunities to offer my services for mentally affected women groups in
different parts of the country…
A volunteer from Padukka
CAN-MH workshops were a turning point in our work as volunteers because we got new
knowledge and better skills to work on mental health issues at the community level. Our training
has been recognised by the Divisional Secretary and Medical Officers – therefore we can now work
with the community with their blessings. We have skills to work on alcohol use, substance abuse,
sexual abuses, domestic violence and family disputes which are frequent in our areas. With the skills
we have, we work closely with government mental health staff in peripheral hospitals to identify
cases of mental illness and attend to counselling or refer severe cases to hospitals for treatment….

The main achievements are as follows:
• The Project assisted the review of Sri Lanka National Mental Health Programme by
providing the services of WHO's regional and national experts;
18
• With Project's assistance, a digital platform to support Mental Health GIS-based access
points was developed. The system was piloted in Nuwara Eliya and Mannar districts; it
has enabled identification of the areas covered by mental health services and the
existing service gaps in terms of geographic spread and helped in a fair system of
allocating resources;
• The Project continued to support WHO's data collection on mental health by
introducing the Global Tool, MH Atlas, which covers areas such as mental health system
governance, resources, services availability, mental health promotion and prevention.
It supported the training of district focal point officers on the use of the online tool for
data entry. The Ministry of Health has appointed a fulltime staff member for data
management and monitoring functions.

The Project supported several capacity development programmes for CSOs to address
violence in their communities20.
The Project developed the Manohari Programme21 to address Emotional Behaviours/Mental
Health Wellbeing Issues. The purpose of the programme was to strengthen psychosocial well-
being and improve mental health services through community-based interventions so that
harmful conflicts can be prevented leading to peaceful co-existence of families and
communities, provided they are capable of controlling their harmful emotions (such as anger,
fear, baseless suspicion and hatred etc.). The programme produced 10 drama therapy training
modules as originally agreed with WHO but added another four later in concurrence with
WHO. These modules included storytelling, dialogues, role playing and interactive discussions
on basic emotional behaviour regulation, coping skills, positive behavioural changes and
promoting understanding and non-violent responses in stressful situations.
Quotes from a Drama Therapy Expert/Principal Trainer of Manohari Programme
The Manohari training modules are based on the underlying notion that conflicts and violence among
individuals as well as communities take place due to the lack of understanding and poor capacity to
manage emotions. The training modules attempt to address these emotional behaviours and thereby
contribute to establish a peaceful social environment free from conflicts and violence. The important
elements are the use of proper communication and getting community members to speak out and
share their problems. Storytelling, role playing, dramatizing the narrated stories and visualization etc.
have been used to encourage participants to talk. The programme is an innovative way of
implementing community-based interventions for people living in conflict-affected areas…….
The 5-day stand-alone training modules covering themes such as managing emotions, anger,
jealousy, fear, and destructive peer pressure etc. were delivered through story-telling and
interactive group discussion on the key messages conveyed by the story. It was piloted at
Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Vavuniya, Monaragala, Badulla, Gampaha, Hambantota,
Kalutara, Kandy, Matara, and Ratnapura for frontline mental health staff/MHPSS workers as
well as community leaders. It was expected that the Regional Directorates of Health would
continue these programmes, but there is no evidence for such follow-up work. However, many

of the CSO participants have indicated post-training work to support communities with
psychosocial needs to reduce social stigma around mental health and build resilience. This
latter programme has targeted communities affected by excessive consumption of alcohol,
illegal drug use, medical substance abuse, poverty due to loss of incomes and livelihood
avenues as well as affected women and women-headed households.
Quotes from the Field: Participants of Manohari Programme
The workshop structure of using role models of different characters by converting stories into a
practical drama made a huge change in our ability to control emotions such as anger, fear, hatred
etc. I personally realized that if everyone controls his or her emotions, they can always make peaceful
decisions and there will be no conflict over different personal or social issues…
A Community Mental Health Service Officer from Monaragala
Playing different roles under drama therapy sessions changed my mind-set significantly. I do not
present myself as a public health law enforcement officer anymore; rather, I work as a community
facilitator in carrying out my health activities. This approach has immensely helped me to work with
utmost humanity and positive attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic….
A Public Health Inspector in Kandy District
Participation in the Manohari programme has been a turning point in my career. I learned how to
control emotions and how to influence others on positive behavioural change. Drama therapy is an
innovative experience, and I am convinced that it is one of the best ways to promote positive
behavioural change. I now use the skills I gained to treat patients visiting the hospital, and I handle
mental health and psychosocial patients very effectively in the villages…
An Occupational Therapist from Monaragala
After attending the Manohari Training programme, I decided to work as a trainer of mental health
especially focusing on the psychosocial issues of girls and boys in the schools. I also targeted teachers
to transfer my skills. I conducted 15 workshops covering about 1,000 students and 140 teachers. I
then made a presentation to the Zonal Education Office on my experience in applying some of the
training modules for changing emotional behaviour of school communities……..
A Community Psychiatric Nurse from the Uva Province
Interviews with participants of these activities showed that there have been positive
behavioural changes in the participants. Some have indicated disseminating the messages to
others. All participants interviewed acknowledged on the need for changing perceptions on
harmony.
Responding to Emergency Situations
The Project trained about 1,500 teachers on Psychosocial First Aid support in areas affected by
the Easter Sunday attack in 2019. Similarly, the civil society organizations were supported
during the COVID-19 pandemic to address issues such as emotional behaviours, loneliness,
fear, and anxiety due isolations and restriction of mobility following curfews and lockdowns.
Towards this end, the Project translated an illustrated self-help manual on stress management
into Sinhalese and Tamil and disseminated it through Community of Practice. The Project also
translated into local languages IASC-MHPSS Reference guide on Basic Psychosocial Skills for
COVID-19 Responders. It also trained about 1,500 frontline health staff in the COVID-19
responses trough Inter Agency Standing Committee.
20
The Project also envisaged supporting the Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association to establish a
community-based guiding programme of young women and girls in marginalized and
disempowered communities that have no access to formal education. This work started only
in October, 2020 targeting 40 Grama Niladhari Divisions in four districts, but the work never
got off the ground due to COVID-19 and the closure of the Project at the end of 2020.
Alcohol and Substance Abuse
The Project also supported the National Authority on Tobacco & Alcohol (NATA) and the MoH
in implementing the Multisectoral Alcohol Prevention and Rehabilitation Programme by
training nearly 250 mental health professionals in early identification and treatment of
substance abuse as well as addressing related issues such as gender-based violence. A
component of this activity also focused on developing the capacity of the district mental health
unit staff in supporting rehabilitation through specialized therapeutic interventions. Other
interventions included establishing a multi-stakeholder coordination committee at the RDHS
/ DS level with membership from all stakeholders involved including police, excise, health,
social services and civil society organization from the district, and supporting the Tobacco Free
Village initiative of NATA. About 10 such programmes have been conducted during the Project
period, and it has been institutionalised in MoH. Another noteworthy development is that the
trained counsellors and psychosocial volunteers are adequately competent22 to handle some
psychosocial cases by themselves by providing counselling and deciding on referring needy
cases of alcohol, drugs and substance abuse mental health for treatment at the hospitals.

3. The Evaluation
3.1. Objectives
The objectives of the final evaluation are to assess the extent to which the project, Promoting
Reconciliation in Sri Lanka, has; (a) achieved the expected results, (b) is relevant, effective, and
efficient, and (c) achieved outcomes, and ensured sustainability of the interventions
implemented. To establish the aforementioned analytical considerations the evaluation was
expected to analyse the implementation approach adopted, assess the institutional
arrangements including project management and operational systems and value for money,
and make recommendations for future programmes based on good practices and lessons
learned. The evaluation findings will also inform decision-making processes of the project
stakeholders, including donors and national partners. It will, as per the norms of UN agencies,
fulfil accountability requirements of the donor, and provide the background for any future
funding
The Project ended on 31 December 2020; however, as indicated elsewhere, the Project
interventions are in the core programmes of the UN agencies and are likely to continue.
Specific Objectives:
The specific objectives of the final evaluation are:
• Assess the DAC criteria (Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Progress towards
Outcomes, and Sustainability) of interventions implemented and results achieved in
line with Theory of Change and the results framework;
• Document the best peacebuilding practices and lessons learnt;
• Assess to what extent the PBF project has made a concrete contribution to reducing
conflict factors in Sri Lanka as identified in the conflict analysis;
• Assess whether the project has been implemented through a conflict-sensitive
approach;
• Evaluate the project’s implementation strategy, institutional arrangements as well as
its management and operational systems and value for money, and adjustments, if any,
of the implementation strategy for optimal results;
• Provide recommendations for the future, specifically considering the COVID-19 and
the new political context.
The main users for this evaluation will be the Government counterparts such as the Ministry of
Education, National Institute of Education, Departments of Education in the provinces and
zones, University Gants Commission, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Women and Child Affairs,
Ministry covering the subjects of peace and reconciliation, UNDP, UNICEF and WHO, and CSO
partners implementing the project, Development actors working in the area of Peacebuilding
and reconciliation, including the Peace Building Fund.
This evaluation has been commissioned by UNICEF on behalf of the three UN lead agencies of
the Project (UNDP, UNICEF and WHO). The Terms of Reference is at Annex 3.1.
22
3.2. Evaluation Principles
The conflict-affected areas have seen significant improvements to infrastructure. However,
rebuilding community confidence and introducing lasting peace have been less significant. In
the circumstances, the evaluation examined project interventions that have been introduced
to address the needs and aspirations of the Government and the target communities from a
peacebuilding perspective.
The Human Rights and Gender Equity aspects were assured in the evaluation by adopting the
following:
• Review of logframe and project interventions to identify specific action having a
bearing on Human Rights and Gender Equity;
• Review of Project's progress reports to identify work packages involving aspects of
Human Rights and Gender Equity;
• Availability of gender disaggregated data relating to Project interventions;
• Details of beneficiary participation in project interventions;
• Formulation of KII and FGD Guides and the questionnaire to capture Human Rights
and Gender Equity [erspectives.
The evaluation was carried out as an independent in-depth evaluation using participatory
approaches whereby all key parties associated with the project were informed and consulted
throughout the evaluation. The evaluation team leader liaised with UNICEF's Evaluation
Manager on the conduct of the evaluation and methodological issues
Ethical standards
At the time of contracting, the Evaluation Team declared no conflicts of interest.
Ethical norms and principles were followed throughout the evaluation process and in particular
during the interviews. The evaluation followed the minimum standards and procedures
outlined by UNICEF23. The evaluation also followed IPID's child protection policies including
an assessment of the Evaluation Team using these policies to ensure that the evaluation team
conformed with the approved policies. The evaluation adopted a participatory approach,
combining self-reporting with external validations (as situations permit), extensive discussions
and feedback loops with the respondents.
Given the engagement with school communities, ethical clearance for the study was obtained
from HML IRB24. The Provincial Departments of Education, under whose jurisdiction the schools
function, were informed by UNICEF of the purpose of the evaluation, and their approvals were
obtained for school visits and meetings with the school communities. Special care was taken
given the COVID-19 situation, and the relevant Public Health Inspectors were kept informed,
and their concurrence obtained. After, formal approval was obtained, the school communities

were informed that their participation was voluntary. The parents were informed by the
Principal of the school, and the purpose of the proposed visit of the evaluation team.
All meetings started with an explanation on the Project and the purpose of the meeting. They
were informed that their participation was voluntary, and that they are free to withdraw at any
time. Their written consent was obtained prior to the meeting. The meetings with parents were
held an hour before their collection of children from school to that they did not have to make
a special trip to school, thereby minimising inconvenience.
Participation of children was voluntary and with the permission of the School Principal and
parents. The interviews were held in a classroom in the presence of a teacher but with mutual
understanding that the teachers would not interfere with the application of the tool. In the
application of the pocket voting tool the facilitator presented a question/analytical
consideration to the respondents and the respondents used colour-coded cards (to identify
girls and boys) to mark responses or vote for each analytical consideration and level of
response (for Likert scales), and deposit those in unmarked envelops. The tool has been tried
and tested by the evaluation team to preclude bias and subjectivity, reduce reservation to
express opinions and protect privacy. Children's anonymity was maintained, and the
information collected was used to assess the appropriateness of the new curriculum.
Overall, the evaluation used the following protocol:
• obtaining consent from all participants, particularly school children (via Education
authorities);
• incorporating child-friendly interview techniques;
• Conducting interviews in the local languages;
• Exercising due diligence when working with CSOs ensuring confidentiality, integrity
when dealing with sensitive topics; and
• Adherence to the principles of Do No Harm, impartiality, transparency, inclusivity and
participation.
The data and information collected during the evaluation have been stored securely and will
be kept confidential. Anonymity of the respondents was maintained throughout25.
3.3. Scope of the Evaluation
Programmatic Scope: The Project has three (3) Outcome areas ('components'), and the
evaluation covered all relevant interventions, especially from a peacebuilding angle. The
evaluation noted that some interventions are still in progress.
Geographic Scope: Given the current situation with the COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation
was conducted with minimal social contacts. As agreed with UNICEF26 virtual data collection
methods were used as an alternative to face-to-face data collection. The evaluation covered
all areas in the country where project activities have been implemented (see Table 2.4). Physical
visits were made to Central, Uva, Eastern and Northern Provinces for school due to difficulties
with online assessment technologies in the schools.
Evaluation period: The evaluation covered the entire project period from April, 2017 to
December 2020.
25 In the case of ex-combatants, the names were provided by the Project, and the questionnaires contain a code.
26 Meeting held with UNICEF on 23 September 2020.

Gender
The Evaluation Team formulated specific questions on gender (in addition to key questions 11
and 16 in Table 3.1).
For this purpose, the evaluation used the following definitions:
Gender: refers to the social attributes and opportunities associated with being male
and female and the relationships between women and men and girls and boys, as
well as the relations between women and those between men.
... Gender determines what is expected, allowed and valued in a woman or a man
in a given context.
Gender equality is when people of all genders have equal rights, responsibilities
and opportunities. Everyone is affected by gender inequality - women, men, trans
and gender diverse people, children and families. ... Gender equality is a human
right.28
The evaluation team used the following additional questions for the evaluation of gender
perspectives.
• Is gender mentioned in the situation analysis, issue statements and documents produced
by the project? Do these documents reflect the inclusion of non-binary gender identities?
• Do the project components identify differences between men and women, and girls and
boys and the intersectionality between ethnicity and religion and other non-binary gender
identities?
• Is data disaggregated by sex (male and female)?
• Do objectives, outcomes and indicators explicitly address gender inequality? (Has a
gender-responsive results framework been utilized to target context-specific gender
barriers and bottlenecks?)
• Has the monitoring system generated data that will demonstrate gender-differentiated
progress towards planned outcomes?
• Does the programme examine the root causes of gender Inequality (social norms, cultural
beliefs, values)?
Female evaluation staff were used in assessment of girls' schools.
3.5. Evaluation Methodology and Tools
The evaluation used the theory of change approach to operationalize concepts of social
cohesion, gender equality and reconciliation to a cohesive and comprehensive evaluation
methodology. The data collection methods and tools to collect data and information from a
range of sources and informants was based on this process of operationalization. It paid
attention to triangulating the data and information collected before making its assessment.
This is essential to ensure an evidence-based and credible evaluation, with robust analytical
underpinning.
Data and information needed for the evaluation were drawn from different sources using the
following tools:
• Desk Review of documents
28 https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/gender-equality
27
• School-level assessments (specifically for Outcome #2)
• Focus Group Discussions (FGD)
• Key Informant Interviews (KII)
• Telephone Interviews using a pre-tested questionnaire (livelihood component of
Outcome # 1)
The Evaluation Framework (Table 3.2), structured against the standard OECD-DAC criteria
agreed for the evaluation, provided the approach and the basis for this evaluation.
The evaluation used a group of experienced researchers for the school assessments. Data
collection methods were gender sensitive. Female interviewers/facilitators were engaged with
women and girls to increase their participation.

The Project has provided literature relating to the Project, its implementation, and progress
(Annex 3.2). In the absence of the Project’s terminal report, a summary of outputs achieved
has been prepared by the Evaluator, based on the progress reports made available, and from
the information made available to the evaluator at various meetings (See Section 2.2).
School-level Assessment [Outcome # 2]
Given the status of project implementation, school-level assessments were confined to
evaluate (a) civic education component, and (b) violence against children (corporal
punishment). These assessments were carried out in the schools, using structured guides.
The school level assessment was multi-faceted, and involved consultations with children in a
classroom, consultations with parents and teachers, KIIs with School Principals, Trainers for
improving student achievements, provincial education authorities, and representatives of NIE.
The schools selected for assessment is given in Table 3.4. School selection took into
consideration the type of school (IAB and IC types), gender-mix, ethno-religious diversity,
language of teaching and disability and other exclusionary factors.

Pocket Voting - FGD: The sample of children was a mixed group of about 20-25 children
selected based on the following criteria.
• Age category 11-16 years where civic education module and revised texts have been
introduced by the Project;
• Minimum 40% of girls;
• Inclusion of children with one parent or caregiver or without parents and caregivers;
• Inclusion of differently abled children or those with learning difficulties/slow learners,
if any'
• Inclusion of children from any other identified discriminated groups (social, cultural
and economic)
The Civic Education Component has been implemented in eight (8) schools (two in each
Province) and the assessment was undertaken in three schools, using assessment tools. The
Project has covered 433 schools with training to address the issue of violence against children.
As agreed with UNICEF, eight (8) schools from IAB and IC types were selected for this
assessment – two from each Province.
Focus Group Discussions (FGD):
Thirty-five (35) FGDs were held with school communities in each of the schools visited (one
FGD each with Children, and one with Parents) to gather information relating to Outcome # 2.
It was not possible to identify specific project targeted beneficiaries relating to Outcomes 1
and 3 as direct community interactions had been limited by nature of implementation of
Project activities without a specific target community. The evaluators conducted nine FGDs
with communities in Mannar, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, and Batticaloa districts to assess the
33
general situation with regard to the current reconciliation situation (Outcome # 1) and
psychosocial welfare work (Outcome # 3). FGD with the community in Mullaitivu was
conducted online. The list of FGDs is at Annex 3.3.
Key Informant Interviews (KII):
KIIs were conducted using a semi structured interview framework. The list of persons
interviewed is in Annex 3.3.
The following interviews, which were originally scheduled, could not held due to reasons
indicated:
• Representatives of SLIDA (despite repeated attempts, interviews were not arranged by
SLIDA management)
• Trainees from the Sri Lanka Administrative Service who underwent training at SLIDA
(contact details of a sample of trainees were not provided by SLIDA)
• Trainees on Military Dialogue (Trainees were not identified by UNDP due to the
sensitive nature of the work)
Telephone Interviews
Telephone interviews using a structured questionnaire were conducted with 3330 ex-
combatants in Kilinochchi and Jaffna districts who have been provided with vocational training
and/or livelihood support.
The Questionnaire did not contain any sensitive information but only information related to
the 'vocational' training they received, current employment vis-à-vis training received,
satisfaction on the training courses, livelihood activities undertaken, and the current income
levels.
The questionnaire was administered by a researcher who has experience in remote data
collection and working with ex-combatants. The respondents were briefed on the purpose of
the questionnaire, and their engagement was purely voluntary. They were also informed that
they are free to withdraw at any point during the interview.
COVID-19 Considerations
The evaluators followed the guidelines provided by the Government of Sri Lanka31 regarding
the precautions to be taken to prevent spread of COVID-19. In essence, face-to-face meetings
were reduced as much as possible.
School visits and meeting with school communities were undertaken only with the specific
COVID-19 guidelines provided by the Provincial Education authorities, in addition to Ministry
of Health guidelines. The Education authorities reviewed situation almost on daily basis.
Pandemic situations in the Northern Province and concomitant closure of schools delayed
school assessments.
In spite of receiving priori approval, a school in the Central Province could not be visited due
to a detection of COVID positive person in the school.
30 This represents 50% the entire population who could be contacted.

The study team was equipped with sanitisers, face masks, and face shields during the field
visits.
3.6. Data Management
Collection of qualitative data from interviews and FGDs was based on guides structured to
capture specific information sought for the key evaluation questions. The structured guides
ensured that the data/information collected were reliable and valid and that same or similar
responses will be gathered if administered under similar conditions. The Survey Team also
ensured that the instruments captured what has been intended to capture.
Data Analysis
Before starting analysis, quality of the data was checked for reliability and validity. Data points
relating to answers for key evaluation questions were highlighted, and spot checks between
data from different Provinces were made to ensure consistency,
Data from different sources (KII and FGDs) were triangulated to derive trends, situations, and
conclusions. This analysis also brought out some of the field limitation relating to project
implementation aspects.
Quantitative data collected from the administration of the questionnaire on livelihoods were
transferred to excel workbooks for further analysis to identify trends.
Data storage
Data and information collected are in a repository at IPID and will be protected in accordance
with Privacy Acts and Data Protection Laws of Sri Lanka. Anonymity of the respondents and
subscribers was maintained. The researchers used anonymous data for their analysis.
3.7. Limitations
The evaluation found several limitations for its smooth implementation and timely completion
of the tasks. Table 3.5 summarises the constraints, and mitigatory measures taken, as
applicable.

4. Project's Performance
The Project sought to promote social cohesion and conflict mitigation through three
components. The evaluation recognizes that the Easter Sunday attack of 2019 and the COVID
19 pandemic of 2020 together with the change of government policy and strategy during
2018-2020 have affected the performance of the project.
4.1 Relevance
The Project is aligned to the Peacebuilding Priority Plan of Sri Lanka. It can be inferred that
the initiatives planned in the Project are consistent with the overall peacebuilding objectives
and purpose. Of particular importance are the activities targeting adolescents and youth
(schools and Universities) which seek to establish shared values and norms irrespective of
wealth, ethnicity, race, and gender so that society is socially cohesive. It is envisaged that the
long-term application of concept and strategy of social cohesion will forge social bonds in
civic society, establish responsive democracy, and bring about peace and harmony32.
The Project also addresses Sustainable Development Goals 4, 5 and 16.
Component #1
The Peacebuilding component is well aligned with the Government’s policies and strategies to
introduce equity and relief to conflict-affected people, and reduce poverty, as reflected in the
Government policy at the time of project preparation33. It also directly addresses several
recommendations relating to conflict-affected people in the North and Eastern provinces
made by the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC)34. The Project directly
addresses the needs of the Government on reconciliation and peacebuilding by providing
significant financial and operational support to the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation
Mechanisms (SCRM), the then Ministry of Integration and Reconciliation, Ministry of National
Coexistence, Dialogue and Official Languages & Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation,
Resettlement and Hindu Affairs, and the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR)
leading on reconciliation policy processes35.
Of particular importance is the Project's alignment to support Sri Lanka relating to the Human
Rights Commission Resolution 30/1. Initiatives with the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) in
operationalising the transitional justice mechanism, Office on Reparations on setting
groundwork for an enhanced reparations process that draws upon international best practices,
and the preliminary work on the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
are much focussed as contributing towards fulfilling aspirations in the Peacebuilding Priority
Plan36 of the Government of Sri Lanka.

37
Component # 2
The relevance of the component on education can be viewed from different perspectives. At
the national level, the interventions relate to the National Policy on Education for Social
Cohesion and Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation and has a relevance to addressing the
overall violence that has manifest in Sri Lanka during the last four decades. As conflict
resolution is a process determined by the context of the country and has no blueprint, the
components of the project are theoretically of high relevance to the operating context.
From a reconciliation and peace building perspective the project also falls within the 3-level
pyramid of conflict resolution and peace building models37 described as a 3-track pyramidal
model of: high level negotiation (military and political leadership, level 2 (respected leaders
from different ethnicity, academics and humanitarian leaders and level 3 (local leaders, CSOs
and community) and all three levels are seen as important for the process. When the project
is examined in the context of this model, the overall project design is based on track 2 and 3
(or levels 2 and 3) interventions in conflict resolution and peace building. The level 3
interventions of reaching school children, parents and the school community is strategically
effective as it reaches a larger population. However, the impact or desired change expected of
reaching a larger population depends on the interfaces with completed outputs of level 2, and
it is only when such integrated processes take place that the project becomes relevant.
Furthermore, all components leading to the outcomes should have been fully implemented
with synergy for the project to be defined as of high relevance to reconciliation models.
The Project also builds on Articles 28 and 29 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child and
falls within the aegis of the UNESCO framework of Global Citizenship which recognizes that
children need to be socially connected and emotionally stable for societies to be cohesive and
governable. By applying the principles and standards of Child Rights, especially the principles
of best interests of the child and non-discrimination the project implements a rights-based
strategy for social cohesion. Empirically, the rights-based approach means institutional and
structural change through planned interventions that build the skills and personality of
children for tolerance and respect of all cultures and ethnicities, equality of sexes, and respect
for the environment. However, as most of the project outputs are in the process of
development the evaluation cannot comment on the relevance and scalability of the project
design and strategy38.
Component # 3
The psychosocial component of the Project directly addresses the mental health and
psychosocial issues in the reconciliation process and in a conflict-related milieu in the overall
peace building efforts of the country. The Project provided technical inputs towards a number
of policy and strategy reviews (e.g., National Mental Health Policy; mapping of Mental Health
and Psychosocial Service; National Suicide Prevention Strategy; National Mental Health
Programme Review)39.
The Project's overall support to MHPSS-related issues such as emotional distress, depression,
fear psychosis, alcohol and other substance abuse, disruption of family life, sex abuses, gender-
based violence and physical disabilities and poverty are relevant and has been prioritised by

the Government. Evidence from the field shows that MHPSS issues of the affected communities
are inseparable from the peacebuilding efforts.
The Project's support to affected communities following the Easter Sunday attack of 2019
aimed at peacebuilding between different communities is also acknowledged, and can be
regarded as emergency support for a good cause.
Since the cessation of hostilities in 2009, there have been many initiatives towards addressing
MPHHS issues. However, the community support mechanisms through voluntary psychosocial
welfare at the village level, which has contributed significantly to alleviate the situation in
affected families, remains a problem. The stakeholders feel that whilst MHPPS support
supplements Government efforts, the Project could have addressed the lingering issue of the
sustainability of voluntary psychosocial support schemes at the village level.
The Project also builds on a previous initiative supported by the PBF aimed at reconciliation40.
Overall, the Project support is consistent with the priorities set by the Government, and funding
is considered as a critical gap filling initiative41. The livelihood component introduced during
the mid-term of the Project is also relevant as providing livelihood support is a part of
rehabilitation and resettlement effort of the Government.
Conflict Transformation42
The Project has been designed to contribute to conflict transformation. As is evident from
several previous studies, peacebuilding requires multi-level national agreement to achieve
sustained peace. Of particular importance is the political 'reforms' and philosophy conducive
to peacebuilding. The societal contribution, particularly from the affected communities
depends on higher level commitment and reforms. Much has been researched and
documented on the need for high level commitment for reconciliation and peacebuilding. The
country regularly experiences ethnic and religious polarisation, which have not receded in the
recent times. Political authorities, clergy and even intelligentsia have contributed to divisive
nationalist forces and xenophobia43. The Project did not address this aspect adequately. The
relevance of the Project would have been sharper if the focus was on changing the mind-set
of political and administrative leaders, which will have a quicker impact on the ground and
politically easier to accomplish.
Project Design
The Project proposed a multi-pronged approach towards promoting social cohesion and
conflict prevention, with a strong focus throughout on measures aimed at building
understanding and countering violence. The Project's design has considered the pathways to
contribute towards peacebuilding objectives. The outputs and outcomes, if achieved, would
have contributed towards peacebuilding approaches44.

agencies, Ministries, the State officials both national and Divisions and Districts as well as

representatives from Government institutions across the country on reconciliation
mechanisms is very appropriate as it targeted the key people who either engaged with the
victims or the public who could reach out to victims. The Project's work on reaching people
through media particularly on Transitional Justice and Reconciliation (TJR) is seen as
appropriate.
The Project's Theory of Change (ToC) is as follows:
IF authorities committed to peacebuilding and healing develop, through inclusive
consultative processes, policies and strategies that provide opportunities and
mechanisms for groups involved in and affected by the conflict to interact and
share lessons and experiences, AND to jointly participate in rebuilding,
reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts between and amongst communities,
THEN prospects for creating a society that is tolerant and lives in harmony are
greatly enhanced.
However, the available evidence indicate that the Project carried out work as three discreet
Projects with minimal interaction. The ToC did not capture the nuances of joint programming
and implementation. The ToC is not explicit in indicating the integrated responses needed in
joint programming to achieve the changes sought in the ToC, and did not clearly indicate the
pathways for achieving the objectives of the Project45.
The relatively slow pace of implementation by the Government agencies is indicative of their
limited ownership of project outcomes. If they were a part of the design of the Project, perhaps
their involvement in implementation would have been different.
4.2 Effectiveness
Project Implementation Delays
The delivery of Results has been affected in a number of ways, primarily due to delays in
implementation. Detailed analysis was not possible in the absence of approved annual work-
plans, and the reasons for delays, particularly before 2019. These implementation delays have
been exacerbated by the Easter Sunday attack of 2019 and COVID-19 pandemic. Easter Sunday
attack prevented some field work in several areas of the country whilst COVID-19 related
shutdowns also delayed implementation of field work46. The delays affected the overall
outcomes of the Project, and the target beneficiaries were unable to participate and benefit as
expected out of the Project47. Specific delays and institutional issues are summarised below:
Component 1: The closure of SCRM in March 2020 (but effectively in the 3rd Quarter of 2019)
and disengagement of ONUR affected work significantly. Placing SCRM in the Prime Minister's
Office was expected to be effective in influencing other arms of the Government, but has been
unfortunately seen as a politically motivated action. SCRM was largely staffed by UNDP staff,
and the constitutional crisis on October 2018 resulting in the removal of the Prime Minister for
52 days forced the UNDP staff being relocated to the UN Compound for 'safety'.
45 Key Evaluation Question # 3 (Table 3.1)
46 Key Evaluation Question # 10 (Table 3.1)
47 Key Evaluation Question # 12 (Table 3.1)
40
Component 2: Although the Project design offers innovative concepts and strategies, the
delays and the inability to complete work have negated the effectiveness.
Component 3: Much of the work has been delayed. Work is pending partly due to the
main partner, Ministry of Health being pre-occupied with the COVID-19 Pandemic. Mapping
of Mental Health and Psychosocial Service (MPSSS) in the three districts has also not been
completed due to shortcomings in the tool used. The recommendations for a National Suicide
Prevention Strategy are also pending with MoH.
Technical aspects of Project Delivery (Component # 2)48
All activities implemented under Component # 2 have cross cutting principles of inclusion and
targets all adolescents especially those aged 12-14 years, as per the “global citizenship
framework” of UNESCO and draws on key issues such as the lack of equality, quality and equity
in education with continued marginalization of children who live in the remote rural and estate
sectors. However, the full range of activities planned under the project have not been
implemented as evidenced in the delivery of outputs. The Civic Education Curricula for lower
secondary grades have not been revised and the acceptance of curricular and training of
lecturers at colleges of education is pending. In schools all of the stakeholders have not been
trained and there has been limited follow up. When analyzed within the framework of
education, it is evident that an integration of all activities is necessary to contribute to the
outcomes of the project.
As changes in the way the overall curriculum is integrated and implemented in a school context
are as important as the application of subject specific curricula, the project interventions could
result as isolated interventions that do not contribute to a holistic curriculum application. This
is evident in the way schools have been reached and how they have implemented the project.
Some schools have fully understood the concepts and integrated the activities to the
curriculum through activities that generate experiential learning across the school while other
schools such as in the Monaragala District have received partial training and have uneven
understanding of application.
All long-term outcomes in social cohesion entail the implementation of synergistic activities
to address the structural causes of political violence in Sri Lanka. There is no evidence that the
project has made such an analysis and strategized around what activities fall within the sphere
of control of the project (school-based activities), the sphere of influence (outputs with NIE
and UGC) and sphere of interests (changes in policy and social norms and values).
Project Management
The evaluation considered the following project delivery criteria for effective delivery of results:
• Deployment and coordination of technical expertise across the project is flexible and
mutually beneficial;
• Matrix exists for accountabilities and responsibilities across the Project;
• Delivery and compliance are mapped and monitored regularly; and
• An organisational culture of integration between the three UN organizations and their
partners exists and decisions benefit the whole project.
48 Key Evaluation Question # 12 (Table 3.1)
41
The project delivery model is expected to be collaborative, accountable and flexible.
The overall coordination of the Project is the responsibility of UNICEF, which is also responsible
for providing consolidated reports to the donor. In regard to coordination, the Project Proposal
sets out the following mechanism:
"An overall coordination mechanism which will meet quarterly, led by UNICEF. Additionally,
three Working Groups, based on each Outcome will be set up under the Project, for the
purpose of approving annual work-plans, reviewing progress reports, advising on bottlenecks
and challenges, and conducting bi-annual lessons learned and review sessions. The Working
Groups will be convened by each RUNO, and the results of these meetings will feed into the
Peacebuilding Board, through UNICEF and the PBF Secretariat.49"
There was no evidence of the functioning of these working groups. Furthermore,
programmatic coordination, aside from collating individual reports from RUNOs, to ensure
achievement of the overall objective of the Project was not effective.
The Project did not prepare annual workplans; rather programming appears ad hoc. There was
no monitoring and evaluation plan. Major delays in implementation of activities do not appear
to have drawn the attention of UN agencies. Indeed, some CSO contracts have been issued
during the 3rd Quarter of 2020, and the CSOs reported their inability to complete work by
December, 2020 and were hopeful of contract extension beyond the life of the Project.
The Evaluation Team was not provided with evidence of formal and regular M&E activities at
the field level undertaken by UN Agencies and Partners. It is the opinion of the Evaluation
Team that if the Project prepared internal annual workplans, the delays observed now could
have been averted. Additionally, M&E of field activities has been inadequate. Efficiency and
effectiveness of implementation could have been improved with regular M&E action, in
particular in the following key areas of work:
• Work on reconciliation dialogues;
• Audio-visuals promoting peacebuilding and reconciliation;
• Curriculum revisions with NIE;
• Work package offered to the UGC;
• National Mental Health policy initiatives.
The Project also envisaged an annual review with all project partners, including representatives
from all relevant line Ministries to discuss implementation challenges and constraints. The
Evaluation Team was not provided with evidence of holding this annual review50. As a result of
these shortcomings, translation of project interventions into outcomes has been adversely
affected51.
Working through Partners and Gaps in Coordination52:
The Project’s way of implementing through intermediate partners (CSOs) has enhanced
effectiveness. CSOs have provided the much-needed connectivity with the communities.
However, Project implementation and its effectiveness have suffered due to inadequate
49 Project Proposal; page 24.
50 The Project's opportunities and constraints have been discussed at 10 PBF Board meetings during the life of
the Project (Source: UNDP)

52 Key Evaluation Question # 8, # 15 & # 21 (Table 3.1)
42
coordination amongst UN Agencies and amongst CSOs. Synergies and common
understanding of the Project were not evident at different levels.
The Project has implemented activities via several Government agencies, which is an effective
mode of implementation provided regular liaison, M&E, and quality assurance are in place.
Component # 1 worked primarily through the Prime Minister's Office, but this has not resulted
in the desired outcomes due to instability of administrative structures. The livelihood
component has been implemented through District Secretariats, but lack of supervision and
documentation has affected effectiveness. Both UGC and NIE have not kept the pace of work
– resulting in undue delays. Work with the Ministry of Health has also limited effectiveness
due to latter's commitments to COVID-19 management
The capacity and level of engagement of CSOs and partners in government (Provincial
Ministries) in the different districts varied affecting the quality and timeliness of delivery. For
example, in Component # 2, the understanding of the concept of social cohesion in the Eastern
Province was technically sound compared to the other Provinces, mainly attributed to prior
experiences. There was no horizontal relationship between the CSO and government partners
to cross-fertilise their interventions and enrich experiences53.
Lack of a leader for the Project (or a designated ‘Project Manager’) for overall coordination
and timely implementation has affected effectiveness. The education component (in the
context of peacebuilding and reconciliation) is a case in point; As this component translates
the concept of social cohesion to practice it is important to establish technical interfaces
between components implemented by the three partners as well as the three sub-components
in the education component54.
The implementing UN agencies and Partners have a clear role for achieving peacebuilding
results. Notwithstanding this commitment, the three agencies in this Project worked in
isolation; the evaluation notes a missed opportunity for the agencies and its Partners to act
together and share lessons from different facets of the Project, and demonstrate provision of
integrated solutions in joint programming55. Added to this shortcoming is the fact that some
CSOs were not well informed of the overall project objectives and strategies, and worked
within their own programmes.
Adjustments to Project Strategy:
The Project made adjustments during its lifetime, particularly in Components #1 and #3. The
funds saved by the disengagement of ONUR from the Project were utilized for a research study
on violence and to provide livelihood support to ex-combatants. In Component # 3, provision
of psychosocial support was extended to communities needing support after the Easter
Sunday attack56. However, it is unclear whether the target beneficiaries or partners were
involved in effecting these changes.
The Project has provided financial support to several initiatives which have been identified
during the life of the Project. These would normally address gaps in government assistance by
providing financial support for critical and emergency work (Easter Sunday attack; COVID-19).

43
Leveraging other support
The Project's support to SCRM and ONUR with the former established in the Prime Minister's
Office was an opportunity to leverage a political window of opportunity for engagement at
the higher level. However, this did not materialise due to the constitutional crisis in 2018 and
disbanding SCRM which was unfortunately labelled as a political agency of the then
Government57.
4.3 Efficiency
The evaluation team did not receive detailed budgets and end-of-the Project expenditures.
Therefore, there is no analysis on output-based expenditures. Although budgets were not
available for perusal, there was general indication that the allocations made to implementing
agencies were more than adequate. Indeed, it would appear that the Project has been very
generous with funds, and there has been no assessment of value-for-money of some of the
deliverables. As at the end of the Project, some agencies have not spent the money provided
to them58. There was no evidence of any counter-part funding or accounting, and of any other
funds leveraged by the Project.
The evaluation finds that UN Agencies have allocated funds for implementation to the
Government agencies and CSOs; however, follow-up with these agencies has been minimal.
An example of significant investment is the allocation made to the Ministry for providing
livelihood support to about 360 ex-combatants (estimated by the Evaluation Team to be
approximately USD 300,000), the results of which have not been reviewed adequately as the
responsibility has been devolved with the Ministry/District Secretariats.
Delivery of outputs has been behind schedule as already detailed elsewhere resulting in
reduced efficiency59.
4.4 Progress towards Outcomes
The Peacebuilding Priority Plan's Outcome # 2 (Reconciliation) is largely focussed on the
support to the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms, to wit:
As a direct complement will be technical support to the institutional structures of
Government with a mandate to lead on reconciliation, in particular the Secretariat
for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms which, as a relatively new institution,
requires support for its core functional areas including multi-stakeholder
coordination, communications, monitoring and evaluation, and policy
formulation60.
Dur to the closure of SCRM by the Government and abandoning its achievements resulted in
the Project not achieving its main outcome61.

Component 1 (UNDP)
As indicated in the preamble, the Project's initiatives at policy level have not proceeded to the
level expected due to closure of SCRM. Introduction of social cohesion module to the
induction course for the new entrants of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service, conducted by
SLIDA is noteworthy but its continuation could not be ascertained. The Project provided a
communication strategy for SCRM, but this too has become redundant.
Some of outreach work entrusted to CSOs have been incorporated into their own work
programmes, and will be conducted when an opportunity arises. The main constraint for CSOs
to continue these outreach programmes.
Most livelihood initiatives are likely to continue in a majority of the cases providing
supplementary income for the households.
Component 2 (UNICEF)
The conceptual framework for analyzing the outcomes of the interventions in Social Cohesion
and Violence Free schools is based on the premise that changes need to take place at every
level of the educational system. Table 4.1 and Fig 4.1 provide an insight to how the evaluation
operationalized the outcomes at the different levels.

Teachers and the School Principal were consulted to glean outcomes. The implementation of
the project is not even across the schools. The Ramanathapuram School has received the
equipment recently, and the equipment is not installed as yet. The school continues to use
Smart Boards donated by KOICA. The school is waiting for the construction of a separate
building to be completed to install the equipment and start the project. The Watawala School
too had not used the opportunity effectively as the reception is poor and the school does not
have a teacher trained for civic education.
The school development planning process (Table 4.2) shows that all schools have rated the
participation of parents, teachers and children in the School Development planning process as
high. However, a review of the School Development Plans shows that schools have not
factored in the activities promoted by the Project into the planning process as well as the plans.
Therefore, there were no monitoring mechanisms in place to monitor the progress of the
project in schools, define ownership of the project and add additional activities generated by
the project for putting sustainability mechanisms in place. The E-platform is fully implemented
only at the Al-Munawara school; the other schools have not factored in the activities related
to social cohesion into the SDS process.

The study assessed how children experience and perceive social and emotional stability as well
as their attitudes and behaviours towards children of other religions and ethnicities. The scale
was a progressive analysis and data shows that all of the children liked attending school and
felt safe and protected in the school. However, 15% of the children said that they do not feel
protected and safe at home. The inference from cross tabulating the data was that children
who experienced violence at home did not feel safe and protected at home (see Table 4.3).

The good practice of the E-platform comes from the Al-Munawwara school that demonstrates
how initiative and commitment from the school has contributed to taking the project to
another level. Discussions with the teachers and the Principal of the Al-Munawwara school
showed that the school had installed the equipment and that they are committed to using the
E-platform effectively not only to link with other schools but also to provide students with
“learner centred and experiential education”. Some of the key conductive factors were that
the: (a) school has qualified teachers to teach civic education, (b) the principal has undergone
a 3 day training on social cohesion while serving at a previous school and he was confident
that he could facilitate the process as he also had the academic background in conflict
resolution and reconciliation processes, (c) the Provincial Ministry of Education of the Eastern
Provincial Council was supportive of the project and (d) the parents and students were
receptive to innovation and use of technology. Some of the initiatives from the school that
have contributed to the good practice are: (1) provision of experiential learning through:
annual study tours to places of worship of other religions as the student population was
exclusively Tamil speaking and Muslim, and (2) annual gatherings with schools that have
children of other ethnicities. The principal attributed the success to having a team of trained
teachers who have demonstrated skill in facilitating the entire process.
Quotes from the Field: A Principal
Yes, we received valuable material from UNICEF such as a smart board, laptops, camera, projector,
sound equipment, furniture and Wi-Fi facilities etc. We are grateful to UNICEF as they provided all
these materials to our school. The smart board is most important, as teachers use it effectively to
teach students with visual presentations and by using videos. The involvement and interest of
students is high, and they like to learn in the smart class room. We have a small draw back as we
sometimes face difficulty in the network connection and there is a lack of space in the smart
classroom but we do not see it as a barrier…..
Regarding parents, their involvement was most visible in the Al-Munawwara School from three
aspects. The first was consultation. The SDS was active and the parents stated that teachers
consult parents and accept suggestions on how to improve the school environment. The
second is discussion and dialogue on issues related to children such as discipline, performance,
and achievement. The third was discussion and dialogue between teachers and students
regarding performance and achievement and informing parents when parental support is
required. Parents are also involved in planning cultural and sports events and there is an
attempt to expose both parents and students to other cultures though cultural events, and
discussion and dialogue. The other two schools did not demonstrate such good practices62.
Positive Discipline (see Annex 4.2 for the complete assessment)
The analysis for positive discipline focused mainly on the child and his/her changing social
environment, and how parents, teachers and school principals interact and support the child.
62 Access and information from the Watawala Sinhala School was limited due to the restrictions imposed on
account of the COVID 19 Pandemic.
48
The process for planning and the quality of the school development plans were outputs of the
Project as all schools were expected to develop action plans to implement the positive
discipline project. The participatory process for developing School Development Plans, though
rated as high in almost all schools and conformity with SDP standards, is also equally high but
the inclusion of positive discipline practices in SDPs is not evident. As defining such activities
implies a process of social mobilization and consultation with key stakeholders the schools
should have been trained separately for this process. An analysis of the school development
plans, and the activities implemented across the schools shows that such comprehensive
planning to include positive discipline practices in schools and at home has not taken place
across the schools (Table 4.4).

An analysis of the facilities of the schools shows that the schools do not have adequate facilities
that are conducive for learning and social and emotional growth. This lack of recognition of
the importance of providing structure and environment conducive for the development of
children especially at primary grades has affected the full implementation of the project (Annex
4.2).
The Likert scale was used to assess the social skills of children especially relations with adults
and peers and positive behaviours, as well as emotional development which included the
concept of self-control and self-expression (Table 4.5). The most noteworthy of this analysis is
that: 3.2% of children did not feel safe and protected at school and another 4% did not feel
protected and safe at home, 10% did not feel that teachers engaged them interactively and
9% did not like to work in groups and in supporting peers, 21% did not feel they had the ability
for tolerance and anger management. However, it has to be noted that the overall level of
skills and abilities as assessed by the students was high and 98% liked attending school which
is indicative of the fact that school is a supportive environment. However, in the absence of
baseline data it is not possible to attribute the positive trends to the project, especially given
that the project has not reached the schools as a modular process that addressed the different
levels of change.

The evaluation also assessed the practices of parents to understand how the project has
imparted the knowledge, attitudes and skills related to parenting styles, handling behaviour
problems and parenting for children with special needs (Table 4.6). Discussions, especially
pertaining to negative effects of physical punishment and positive methods that can be used
in disciplining children and adopting good parenting styles shows that 89% of the parents
continue to beat children as the most effective form of discipline; 42% use harsh language;
33% do not establish rules of behaviour and encourage good behaviour through praise; 29%
do not have a daily routine or structure at home, and supervise children; and 24% do not
demonstrate anger management and self-restraint. What is evident from this analysis is that
significant changes have not taken place in the way parents discipline children although, there
is an absence of baseline data.

Conclusions from the school assessment are as follows:
• Analysis of information from the three schools shows that only one school had installed
the equipment and was using the equipment. This school demonstrated good practices in
using technology in the teaching and learning process. The success of this school
depended on the preparedness of the school to use technology, change teaching and
learning processes, and create a conducive governing and physical environment for the
project to gain ground and be “owned” by the school community;
• The evaluation was not able to establish progress towards outcomes (most outputs are
under development) on the concept and practice of social cohesion mainly because (i)
there was no common understanding of a working definition of social cohesion among
the respondents, and (ii) as there was no comprehensive theory of change and outcome
mapping to guide the translation of concept to practice by the implementing partners. An
overview of the studies and draft modules reiterates that a lack of common understanding
has resulted in varied interpretations and a lack of understanding of strategy.
• A sound project monitoring system at the output and immediate outcome level would
have given sufficient insights to identify factors that have constrained the project.
Discussions with a technical partner indicated that cooperation and coordination from the
school community and the Provincial Ministries of Education were a determining factor for
the success of the E-platform. The transfer of technology, therefore, should have been
accompanied by a process of social mobilization of the school community.
51
• Social cohesion has been a part of the Education Sector Development Project (December
2005 to June 2011) of the World Bank and other donor agencies for nearly 15 years. These
projects have been extended to approximately 10,000 schools. The focus has been on
multi-ethnic student and teacher interactions. However, there is very little documentation
of the successes and failures of these projects over the last 15 years and the loss of learning
and evidence-based project designing is seen as an issue as the concepts and practice of
social cohesion is an evolving process.
• The evaluation of the positive discipline component of the project shows that the Project
would have been effective if (i) it had a baseline study, (ii) had technically sound common
modules with provision for adaptation across the Provinces and sectors of living, (iii)
established a process of mobilization and monitoring at school level, and (iv) had a project
review.
Component 3 (WHO)
Much of the policy and strategy development work is unfinished, largely due to the delays of
the Ministry of Health. It is imperative that policies and plans are approved by MoH; without
achieving this step, it is not possible to assess progress towards outcomes in the
policy/strategy arena. The Project is continuing its dialogue with the Ministry internalise the
strategy work developed by the Project.
The community-based interventions such as the Manohari programme and the Multi-
Stakeholder Alcohol Abuse Prevention programmes provided mechanisms to improve
community coping skills.
The outreach activities undertaken by CSOs are promising, and show results on the ground.
The CSOs are committed to programmes of this nature, but their future efforts will be only if
funding is available. The Project has not attempted to institutionalise these outreach work in
the MoH and link the CSOs to MoH for continuation of community work.
Overall, the evaluation did not come across any unintended consequences of the results or
negative impacts63.
4.5 Sustainability
The likelihood of sustaining project activities is examined component-wise64.
• Component # 1: The closure of SCRM, which was the main Government partner
in this component has significantly affected sustainability of the peacebuilding
component. It transpired that most SCRM staff were secondees from UNDP; thus, there
are no 'remaining' staff in the Government who have an institutional memory of work
that was done. Added to this is that ONUR was shifted to the Ministry of Justice and
has been dormant without any staff. The Government, in the run-up to the 46th session
63 Key Evaluation Question # 30 & 34 (Table 3.1)
64 Key Evaluation Question # 23, 24, 25 & 26 (Table 3.1)
52
of the United Nations Human Rights Council in March 2021, is considering
reconstituting ONUR65.
The Project's technical inputs towards developing a module for introducing
reconciliation and peacebuilding to new entrants of the Government Administrative
Service resulted in conducting two training sessions. The sustainability of this
component could not be assessed due to difficulties of obtaining information from
SLIDA.
In the recent times, reconciliation at the community level has had setbacks largely due
to very divisive election of 2019, Easter Sunday attack of 2019 and the COVID-19 burial
issues. Sustainability can be ensured only with continued advocacy on socio-cultural
issues that tend to separate communities and prevent social cohesion. The Project's
efforts are unlikely to pan out to a broader field to continue the approach adopted by
the Project. The social tensions arising out of ethnic and other differences appear to
continue unabated, which is a concern on integration of the different communities.
Some of the awareness programmes and outreach programmes conducted by
implementing partners have been incorporated into their own work programmes. All
three CSOs, National Christian Evangelical Alliance of Sri Lanka (NCEASL); Sirahunani,
and Prathibha Media Network have pledged to continue awareness programmes,
albeit with difficulty due to paucity of funds.
The individual livelihood support provided to ex-combatants provide a minimal
support at the household level. In most cases, they are at best supplementing family
earnings. The most vulnerable are those who received animal husbandry support
without adequate extension support.
• Component 2: The UGC has established a process for redress for incidence of SGBV
though its circular issued in August 2020, but it was not possible to get an insight on
how the UGC plans to implement Phase 2 of the project as there is uncertainty
surrounding the future work. The UGC is the apex administrative body but the
Universities enjoy academic autonomy as per the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.
Therefore, the draft module on social cohesion has to be revised, finalized, approved,
and presented to the Vice Chancellors for mutual agreement on how the module will
be integrated to higher education courses delivered by Universities. It is also important
to note that the AHEAD Project (https://ahead.lk/) implemented with funding from the
World Bank has a result area for integrating social and emotional skills to the higher
education curriculum. Departments and Faculties have received funding and this work
is ongoing. UNICEF should have an understanding of how to interface with such
ongoing technical developments so that outputs meet technical standards and are
synchronized with structured ongoing activities within the higher education sector.
The NIE has expressed that they would continue with the curriculum revisions initiated
with UNICEF, but the final revisions would depend on the revisions planned by the
government for general education. A discussion with the Secretary of the
State Ministry for Education Reforms indicated that skills for social cohesion would be
scanned across the general education curriculum at lower secondary level through a
range of experiential learning methods replacing the silos approach to education.
65 https://island.lk/a-new-agenda-for-onur-once-led-by-cbk/ (The Island – 8 February 2021)
53
The E-platform, S4D and the Music for Social Cohesion are innovative strategies that
provide students with a range of experiences that fall within the global citizenship
framework. Therefore, the evaluation is of the view that the project needs a
comprehensive exit strategy, which builds on prior learning which is not evidenced at
present. All of the stakeholders expect UNICEF to provide a second phase of funding
and the sustainability of the project depends on this phase.
• Component 3: WHO has worked towards continuation of project results beyond the
project period through key stakeholders and the relevant institutions. The capacities of
the frontline health staff and the volunteers have been improved linking civil society
partners interested in working together in this direction.
Sustainability of some initiatives cannot be assessed as work has not been taken to a
completion (e.g., policy formulations, action plans etc.). The Manohari programme has
transcended beyond the trained frontline health staff in some locations where it has
been extended to schoolteachers, CRPOs, WDOs etc. who have a mandate for similar
work. It is unfortunate that this programme could not be institutionalised in the MoH.
The evaluation notes that there are barriers to mainstreaming programmes into MoH's
systems. These include: inadequate resources for 'unbudgeted' activities, inability to
deploy competent staff, bureaucratic attitudes towards mental health staff where
mental health and the related professionals have not been given the proper
professional status through official recognition including registration.
Scaling up
• As many of the key components have not been completed, no comment can be made
on scaling up the efforts. However, once the interest of Government agencies such as
the NIE, UGC and Ministry of Health is restored, there is likelihood of project
interventions being replicated66.
Some notable activities that have the potential to be scaled up are (a) use of technology
in the teaching and learning process curriculum development for civic education and
positive discipline, which can be scaled up to other schools depending on the results,
and (b) mental health approaches, once the strategies developed by the Project are
accepted by the Ministry of Health.
4.6 Cross Cutting Considerations on Gender and Conflict Sensitivity
This section examines two cross-cutting areas, viz., Gender and Conflict Resolution.
Gender67
In keeping with the framework of the Peacebuilding Priority Plan of Sri Lanka, the Project has
to implement a strategy to systematically mainstream a gender equality lens to its work. The
Project's Gender Marker Score is 2 (projects that have gender equality as a significant objective).
In Component 2, the curricula revision was expected "to pay special attention to issues related to
gender norms in Sri Lanka and ensure gender equity is promoted and delivered through the
66 Key Evaluation Question # 27 & 28(Table 3.1)
67 Key Evaluation Questions 11 and 16 (Table 3.1)
54
revised content." In Component 3, the Project was also expected to ensure "psychosocial
support to the beneficiaries ensuring the inclusion of vulnerable communities such as FHHs and
victims and survivors of gender-based and sexual violence".
Furthermore, in keeping with the UNICEF Gender Action Plan68, it is expected to apply its
gender strategies across programmes by ensuring that all research studies have gender
disaggregated data and issues, and findings are analysed around the specific needs of both
girls and boys. Such evidence-based programming takes into consideration the structural and
gender normative behaviours when developing programme strategies and activities.
The information and data gathered were analysed component-wise, as reported below:
Component # 1
This component has one indicator explicitly addressing gender inequality (% women members
in dialogue/early warning platforms). However, there have been no specific interventions
towards achieving this indicator. There have been many awareness programmes and trainings
in this component; however, the Project has not maintained gender disaggregated data in
terms of these capacity development initiatives.
In the sub-component where ex-combatants were supported with livelihoods, criteria for
selection of beneficiaries were not available to determine whether there was gender equality
consideration. The evaluation used 33 beneficiaries as its sample for study; this comprised of
20 men and 13 women.
Component # 2
Of the three sub-components in this Component, one sub-component (2.1) has a specific issue
statement of addressing sexual and gender-based violence in Universities and other higher
education institutions. The evaluation did not find explicit gender transformative activities in
the other two sub-components, 2.2 and 2.3.
The issues statement of the social cohesion and bullying in schools' component do not have
specific reference to gender inequality and social exclusion, especially with reference to those
of non-binary gender identities and other excluded groups such as children living with physical
disability, children with learning disabilities and children from the “poor social class”. However,
it is assumed that social cohesion covers all forms of social and economic stratification and
differentiation69.
The study on ragging and SGBV is expected to develop a strategy by UGC with a specific focus
on gender equity. The draft report Ragging and Sexual and Gender Based Violence in Sri Lankan
State Universities, has a comprehensive desk review of secondary studies of gender dimensions
of ragging and SGBV. The report also discusses some of the structural factors for ragging and
SGBV at Universities. However, the following observations are made by the Evaluation Team:
68 UNICEF Gender Action Plan 2018-2021
69 Giddens, A, Sociology, Blackwell Publishing Limited (2004)
Social stratification- This represents a process whereby different social groups are ranked higher or lower on some
form of scale, usually, but not exclusively, in terms of categories such as class, age, gender and ethnicity.
Differentiation- the relative worth (or status) between people. It involves judgments of the relative worth between
people, and acknowledges that people are not merely ‘different’, but that the difference is significant because it’s
rooted in the nature of their relationship. Inequality comes from forms of difference that have a higher level of
social significance (status) than others.
55
• How discriminatory social values and norms that are derived from ideology and culture
are not discussed;
• There is no reference to the experiences of those in the spectrum of sexual orientation
and gender identities (SOGI) [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ)];
• The study does not have definitions of the gender concepts and terminology used in
the study.
The report on the Prevalence and Drivers of Bullying has gender disaggregated data and
discusses some norms and values that are discriminatory but there is no “inclusion lens”
applied across the study to understand the experiences of girls and boys based on ethnicity,
religion, social and economic classes, and other social differentiations.
Although there is no dedicated human resources for gender, expertise within UNICEF has been
utilized for review of project documents and concepts. However, this technical expertise has
not been consistently utilised across project implementation and neither are the implementing
partners trained on transformative programming. The evaluation team examined this situation
at depth and found that transformative programming has suffered due to inadequate
understanding of gender equality programming and monitoring amongst Partners. The
Partners' performance could have been enhanced if they had a comprehensive understanding
of UNICEF's gender perspectives of non-binary gender identities [spectrum of sexual
orientation and gender identities and continuum for analyzing projects (from gender
discriminatory to gender unaware, gender sensitive, gender responsive and transformative).
Such perspectives would enable them to monitor and review projects using the inclusive
gender lens and to take affirmative action to address gender unaware projects, and will also
empower them to formulate correct analytical questions that will highlight context/culture
bound discriminatory norms and practices to make projects gender sensitive.
The evaluation has no documented insights as to how the project has provided technical inputs
on gender equality and inclusion to the draft curricula and modules developed by the NIE and
the UGC.
Component # 3
One of the indicators in this component sought to examine gender-wise positive behaviour
regarding conflict. The work programme of this component does not have specific
interventions targeted at women. There have been a number of interventions addressing
mental health issues, but the Project has no gender disaggregated data to carry out an analysis.
The Project initiated an independent study to evaluate the impact on behaviour among
beneficiaries, but the study was on hold at the time of evaluation due to difficulties of engaging
with the communities due to COVID-19 pandemic.
There are no discernible efforts made within this component to ensure gender equality and
women participation across the implemented activities.
Conflict Sensitivity70
The Project has been implemented against a background of three decades of internal armed
conflict causing considerable loss of lives, extensive damage to infrastructure, displacement
and missing people, loss of livelihoods, and permanent woes in the minds of the affected
70 Key Evaluation Questions 32 & 33 (Table 3.1)
56
inclusive of female-headed families. The project approach upheld as its bedrock the principle
of diversity and inclusion so that conflict sensitivity analysis, vulnerability and gender
assessments have been built into the project cycle through planning and implementation.
In relation to the Project's approach to address conflict sensitivity, the following notes are
provided:
• During project implementation phase, the project has followed conflict analysis as a
central and cross-cutting component to promote conflict sensitive practices of the
project. This was evident in the discussions with implementing agencies as well as with
beneficiaries. The approach focussed on understanding the conflict related context of
project intervention to avoid negative impacts and maximize positive ones.
• The Project took actions to follow the principle of Do No Harm relating to its
interventions and made aware of the actual and potential causes of conflict and
violence to its stakeholders.
• Locations for implementing project interventions were selected representing
geographical and ethnic diversity so that they were scattered cover conflict affected
Northern and Eastern (Tamil and Muslim communities), Southern, Uva, Western
(Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim Communities) and Central Provinces (Plantation Tamil
Communities). The Project demonstrated its sensitivity by these actions.
• The Project provided clear instructions to the partners to keep away from the
conflicting situations created due to ethnicity, religion, caste, sex, age etc. They were
asked to play the role of the whistle blowers and keep the Project informed of any
conflicting situations in the project area. The project also encouraged partners to serve
in inter- ethnic peace committees and work with CBOs for peacebuilding initiatives.
The project strictly followed the instructions provided by the government security
forces for prevention of conflicts.
• The Project demonstrated its sensitivity during the emergency support it provided
following the communal violence in some parts of the country (May 2018) and
following the Easter Sunday attack of 2019. In these instances, the Project adopted the
principle of neutrality so that it could work with different ethnic and religious groups
equally without any discrimination.

4.8 Overall assessment and Rating
The performance71 of the Project on a scale of 1 to 4 is summarised as follows:
• Relevance of the project: ‘Highly Satisfactory’ (4), as it addresses priorities of the
Government, District and local authorities, communities, UN Agencies and its Partners,
the Peacebuilding Priority Plan for Sri Lanka, and the UN Peacebuilding Fund.
• Effectiveness of the Project: Less-than-Satisfactory (2). Even before the events which
set-back progress, implementation of the Project has been delayed particularly in the
early stages of the Project. Dissolution of the SCRM by the Government in 2020 also
contributed to the delays which, however, has not been captured by a risk analysis and
action for mitigation. Less than satisfactory inter-agency coordination, lack of dialogue
amongst implementation partners, limited common understanding of the Project by
implementing partners, and ineffective monitoring and evaluation have affected this
grading.
• Efficiency of the Project (Limited assessment): Less-than-Satisfactory (2). The Project
expenditures have not been assessed as the relevant information was not available. A
number of outputs are yet to be delivered/completed and have not been achieved in
a timely manner.
• Sustainability of the Project: Less-than-Satisfactory/Satisfactory (2.5). Work in
Outcome # 1 cannot be sustained due to no fault of the Project; Outcome # 2 requires
further work to consolidate educational outcomes; Outcome # 3 is affected by the
inaction of the Ministry of Health. The voluntary mental health care work is struggling
to maintain the services, although the community members and implementing
partners are willing to provide their support.

5. Evaluative Conclusions
5.1 Conclusions
Whilst the Project's design has considered the pathways for peacebuilding, its Theory of
Change does not capture the philosophy of UN Joint Programming reflecting integrated
responses to the issues. However, the evaluation noted that the Project carried out work as
three discreet Projects (akin to sub-projects) with minimal interaction and coordination. The
ToC did not capture the nuances of joint programming and implementation and was not
explicit in requiring integrated responses needed in joint programming to achieve the changes
sought in the ToC. Ineffective coordination between implementing agencies and delays in
delivery.
The Project suffered delays in delivery. Due to lack of a dedicated Project Manager, the pace
of implementation suffered with uneven delivery. The situation has been exacerbated due to
(a) change of the President of Sri Lanka in November 2019 and the formation of a new Cabinet
of Ministers following the Parliamentary Elections in mid-2020, (b) Easter Sunday attack of
2019, and (c) the COVID-19 pandemic since early 2020. The Government counterparts are also
responsible for the delays, which is indicative of their limited ownership of project outcomes.
As a result, the Project substantially under-performed, and very few targets have been met.
Some of the key deliverables have been delayed due to inaction by the relevant Government
agencies; some others are delayed due to quality issues.
There is uncertainty on the sustainability of the Project interventions. A redeeming fact is that
some of the initiatives are in the core programmes of the relevant UN Agencies, who have a
responsibility to complete the unfinished work.
Oversight and results-based management were insufficient and contributed to less-than
desired project performance. The implementing UN agencies worked in isolation; the
evaluation observed a missed opportunity for the agencies and its Partners to act together in
the spirit of Joint Programming. Added to this shortcoming is the fact that some CSOs were
not adequately familiar with the project objectives, and worked within their own programmes.
5.2 Recommendations
Although the Project ended on 31 December 2020, the Terms of Reference for the evaluation
requires recommendations. The recommendations therefore address implementation
strategies in any future initiatives of similar nature.
Recommendations relating to (a) Project design/Joint Programming, (b) implementation
delays and under-performance, (c) sustainability, and (c) oversight and results-based
management are listed below:
(a) Project Design/Joint Programming
(i) In developing Joint Programmes of this nature, special attention should be made to
formulate the Theory of Change to capture the essential approaches to deliver
integrated solutions to issues identified, and the roles of UN Agencies and the
Government, so that the Government will 'own' the results. Additionally, mechanisms
should be set in place for better interaction amongst UN Agencies, amongst Partners,
59
and between districts in order to improve delivery and quality, backed by a rigorous
monitoring mechanism, to improve delivery (UNDP/UNICEF/WHO).
(ii) The appointment of a ‘Project Manager’ at the lead agency, who would be
responsible and accountable for proper implementation and coordination is
recommended in future joint projects (UNDP/UNICEF/WHO).
(iii) Analyse the interfaces between peacebuilding and psychosocial support to ensure
that there are strategic and operational complementarity between the outcomes of
the three project components; namely peacebuilding, education, and psychosocial
support (UNDP/UNICEF/WHO)
(iv) The relevancy of designs in the Education Sector could be enhanced by developing
a knowledge management process to capture successes and failures of past projects
on social cohesion to understand the contextual factors that contribute to the
effectiveness of strategy and delivery of positive outcomes (UNICEF).
(b) Implementation Delays and under-performance
(v) The Project should develop an exit strategy which should include avenues for
completion of unfinished work and phasing out strategies for education and
psychosocial components72 (UNICEF/UNDP/WHO).
(vi) Structured and systemic assessments to understand existing pre-conditions in
schools before the transfer of technical and programme knowledge to operational
partners at all levels is imperative. Such comprehensive preliminary assessments will
give insights of the governing and physical environment to adapt concept and
strategy to the operating context and for the development of viable phase-out
strategies of positive outcomes of the Project. Related to this, set in place a process
of social mobilization of the school community and establish process monitoring to
make all stakeholders receptive to the use of technology, new concepts and teaching
and learning methodologies (UNICEF).
(vii) Develop technical manuals for the positive discipline component of the Project to
ensure that common concepts, technical specifications and standards are practiced
across the four Provinces (UNICEF).
(viii) The transfer of technical knowledge and competencies for excellence in
programming should be a structured with (i) programme concept notes elucidating
how to translate concept to practice, (ii) working definitions, (iii) technical guidelines,
(iv) output specifications (quality assurance), and regular technical supervision at
least at the pilot stages to the Implementing Partners (both CSO and Government
agencies). Related to this, it is recommended that the technical skills of implementing
agencies be enhanced by developing and using a modular system based on UNICEF's
gender definition to enable them to formulate and implement activities, monitor and
review projects using the inclusive gender lens, and to take affirmative action to
address gender unaware projects (UNICEF).
72 The evaluation notes that some of the activities will continue beyond the Project life as they are part of the core
programmes of the UN agencies.
60
(ix) Given the results of livelihood support for ex-combatants, and considering the vast
experience already gathered on small-scale livelihood support, the Project should
reassess the appropriateness of small-scale agriculture and animal husbandry
ventures for individuals (UNDP).
(c) Sustainability of Interventions
(x) The project should develop a sustainability mechanism for a phase out and scaling
up phase, particularly in the Education and Health sectors. It is recommended that
the project manager(s) work with the implementing partners and technical experts
to capture information on: process, good practices, cost effectiveness and acceptance
to develop scalable models especially for pilot projects (UNICEF/WHO).
(xi) The Manohari programme has shown promising results, and the Project should
follow-up with MoH to institutionalise this within MoH and expand the programme
with other relevant Ministries and agencies. It is also recommended that lessons from
this programme be documented for replication (WHO).
(xii) The changes that have taken place at the community level in the general thinking,
conceptual understanding, improvement of self-confidence, deployment of
volunteers from the families of mental patients have to be captured and documented
as good practices for replication (WHO).
(xiii) Future projects should carefully choose a gazetted nodal Ministry /Agency as the
nodal point and for liaison with the Government to ensure continuity of work as such
entities cannot be dissolved without transferring the responsibilities to another
formal entity (UNDP).
(d) Oversight and Results-based Management
(xiv) Adopt a more rigorous and systematic M&E protocol that identifies constraints for
implementation and delays in implementation, highlights stakeholder concerns and
strengthens institutional linkages needed to improve implementation and adopt a
more comprehensive output-based reporting at each RUNO which will help in
understanding project's progress (in particular planned vs achieved). This could be
used to prepare the donor report on outcomes and will serve as a centralized
information system (UNICEF/UNDP/WHO).
(xv) Organize regular meetings of partners to understand, document, and disseminate
learnings from different interventions as well as joint programming
(UNICEF/UNDP/WHO).
5.3 Lessons Learnt
There are five key programming lessons from the evaluation.
(a) Project Design: A more realistic bottom-up approach to the design of the Project would
have been useful in designing the Project. The ToC should better reflect the philosophy of
UN Joint Programming and should contain the view pints of both UN agencies and the
Government. The evaluation has struggled to find the binding pathway between the three
components; the evaluation cannot help but state that the design demonstrates three
separate projects brought together for convenience, rather than logically connected. The
context, process and sectoral elements articulated in the Project’s Theory of Change do
61
not reflect adequately in the Outputs. Timelines for project implementation should have
been followed more rigorously so as to ensure that the interventions can be stabilized and
sustained. Regular monitoring of the status of indicators in the Results Framework would
have alerted the agencies of the risk of non-delivery of outputs in a timely manner.
(b) Implementation Modality: The Project has used a good approach of using Government
Partners and CSOs. Unfortunately, in Component # 1, the main Government Partner has
been dissolved without any institutional memory. In Components 2 and 3, the RUNOs used
traditional partners including government agencies but did not provide adequate
oversight to ensure that work is done as per the required standards. There has been much
delay in work relating to the MoH.
The CSOs worked within their own framework and, in general, provided a satisfactory
service through their own expertise, commitment, and field presence. This model could
have been made more effective by having a closer collaboration and integration as well as
sharing of experiences between CSOs both inter and intra districts. Better CSO integration
could have been realized with closer collaboration between UN agencies as well as CSO
partners.
(c) Education component: The understanding of the concept of social cohesion and gender
implications in the Eastern Province is better than in other Provinces mainly due to prior
experiences of implementing UNICEF-funded projects. However, this level of
understanding is not adequate for a project of this nature that seeks to translate complex
concepts and strategy to a practical operational framework. The project has missed an
important stage in the project planning process, namely: the operationalization of
concepts, mapping of the levels and dimensions of change (child, youth, mothers, fathers,
caregivers, teachers, school administrators and opinion leaders) how partners will mobilize
communities and process and output monitoring.
(d) Working with government agencies: The Project's results have demonstrated the need
for regular dialogue with Government agencies on the implementation of work packages
transferred to them to ensure that work is carried out in a timely manner to the expected
quality.
(e) Mental health and Psychosocial Support: The Project has re-affirmed the earlier findings in
Sri Lanka that mental health, psychosocial support and peacebuilding are inherently
interlinked and inseparable. Sustainable peacebuilding cannot happen without integrating
the full range of psychosocial factors into the peacebuilding process. The activities have
shown that the use of neutral and appropriate language free from racist and religious
fundamentalist ideas create a positive climate and constructive dialogues to avoid
potential conflicts thereby contributing to peacebuilding.
Engagement of community mental health professionals to address lingering post conflict
mental health issues particularly affecting women (female-headed families) youth and
children has shown promise. The success shown has enabled similar approaches (e.g.,
training teachers) to be taken in the aftermath of the Easter Sunday attack to help affected
communities.

Annex 2.3 – Assessment of Livelihood Support
This component was focused on supporting the ex-combatants with income generation as
well as providing social support to enable them to integrate with the society. UNDP
supported the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, Resettlement and
Reconciliation, Northern Province Development, Vocational Training and Skills Development
and Youth Affairs ('Ministry') to implement the programme via District Secretariats of Jaffna
and Kilinochchi districts.
This component was expected to focus on providing services to vulnerable ex-combatants,
including women affected by the war and disabled ex-combatants through targeted
interventions designed to meet their specific needs.
UNDP undertook a participatory needs assessment with the stakeholders to identify the
interventions required. This assessment identified the following needs:
• Assistance towards providing/improving livelihoods;
• Development of skills including soft skills
• Linking ex-combatants with private sector organisations to facilitate employment
The programme undertook to improve vocational skills, noting however that many lacked
adequate education, business development skills, and on-the-job training aimed at
employment. As per the Report73 of this activity, approximately 350 ex-combatants and their
family members received support from the Project. The technical support provided by UNDP
included training in developing business plans, product diversification, improving product
quality and forming market linkages.
The evaluation expected to undertake a telephone interview based on a structured
questionnaire from 5% of the ex-combatants who received assistance from the Project.
However, in spite of repeated requests, the Project was only able to provide a list of 65 ex-
combatants who received support from the Project. Lack of basic documentation on the
beneficiaries was a major obstacle for the evaluation. It is noted that the Ministry has also
raised this short-coming74.
The sample for telephone interview had to be selected from four lists provided by UNDP
(Table 1).

Vocational Training
Nine respondents had exposure to some form of vocational training arranged by the security
forces when they were in camps. They were unsure whether such training was supported by
the Project. The respondents were of the view that all trainings received were satisfactory.
However, none of them really made use of that training in a significant way; the Project
supported them for other livelihoods. This analysis is presented in Table 3.

Other observations
• All respondents appreciated the assistance provided by the Project to support their
income generation;
• The Project's support provided supplementary income to the families;
• Excepting in two cases, the Project did not follow up with the beneficiaries to
ascertain progress with livelihood work.
• None of the respondents were aware that the support was provided by UNDP.
• Overall, results from the animal husbandry ventures were marginal. A number of
beneficiaries lost their animals due to disease, consequent to the recent floods.

Annex 2.4 - Education Framework
For purposes of analysis the study uses the following framework to facilitate a logical analysis
of the activities that were carried out in the context of the schools. The following gives a
summary profile of how the education system is structured, its expectations and some of the
salient characteristics that have a bearing on the delivery of an overall school curriculum that
promotes social harmony and addresses “interpersonal violence” or bullying in schools. The
curriculum in this context looks at the overall learning system made up of “planned learning
activities which consists of content of subjects of study, lists of subjects, and experiences
offered to learners within the school.” 77 The overall curriculum also specifies the combination
of people, materials, facilities and equipment and procedures that interact to achieve 8
common national goals and 7 basic competencies which have been defined to contribute to
goal 4 of the Sustainable Development Goals. 78 The framework also look at how; inclusion of
diversity in ethnicity and religion and disability, gender equality and human rights are
mainstreamed across the overall school curriculum. The following analytical framework was
developed through an analysis of: (a) secondary studies of the Education System79 and (b)
discussions with a range of education stakeholders mainly; teachers, academics, parents and
students over a period of 5 years. The framework serves as an “analytical” tool not only to
analyze the relevance of the interventions of the project but also to understand how the
project interventions contribute to the overall school curriculum. As ECD is not part of the
formal system this important component is not included in the Framework.

Annex 3.1 - Terms of Reference
The primary objectives of the evaluation are to:
• Assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability of interventions
implemented and results achieved in line with Theory of Change (ToC) and results
framework.
• Document the best peacebuilding practices and lessons learnt
• Assess to what extent the PBF project has made a concrete contribution to reducing
conflict factors in Sri Lanka as identified in the conflict analysis.
• Assess whether the project has been implemented through a conflict-sensitive
approach.
• Evaluate the project’s implementation strategy, institutional arrangements as well as its
management and operational systems and value for money.
Evaluation Scope
• Geographic scope:
➢ For outcome 1, the interventions have been primarily implemented at a national
level, while piloting of campaigns and awareness raising initiatives have been
implemented across North, East, South, West and Central provinces. Many of the
activities under outcome 2 have been carried out at the national level since they
relate to system strengthening in Education. Meanwhile, certain pilot initiatives
and targeted trainings will be implemented in Northern, Eastern, Central and Uva
Provinces. For outcome 3, the geographic focus has been in North, Central and
Uva Provinces, particularly in the districts of Mannar, Batticaloa, Nuwara-Eliya
and Monaragala.
➢ Thematic scope: The evaluation will cover all the three outcome areas mentioned
above especially from a peacebuilding angle.
• Period: The evaluation review period will cover the programming period from April
2017 to December 2020.
• Given the current context of COVID, the PBF and UNICEF guidelines for evaluations
discourages social contacts for staff or hired consultants. Virtual data collection
methods are to be deployed as alternatives for face-to-face data collection. As this is a
sensitive project, and given the current political context, it is important that this
evaluation can be safely as well as rigorously conducted remotely. An assessment of
risk and protection issues need to be taken under with an overall do no harm
approach in planning the evaluation, in view of COVID-related issues as well as those
pertaining to sensitivities related to the project’s topic.
• The evaluation will integrate gender equality and human rights based approaches and
be guided by the principles of do no harm, impartiality, transparency, inclusivity and
participation.
• Sampling Scope: The evaluation will be limited to the interventions implemented
under all three outcomes of the project by UNDP, UNICEF and WHO targeting
children, adolescents, youth and adults in the provinces/districts mentioned under
‘project location’. Interventions under outcome 1 have been implemented in the
Northern Eastern, Western and Southern provinces targeting war widows, youth and
77
ex-combatants in the war affected areas. Further, capacities of District Planning
Officers and CSOs were build. Interventions we also implemented at the national level
benefitting civil servants and conflict affected communities across the island. Outcome
2 included interventions both at national and sub-national levels. School level
interventions are being implemented in around 600 schools directly reaching
education administrators, child-care duty bearers and wider school communities
including principals, teachers, students and patents in North, East, Uva and Central
provinces. National Level interventions are delivered through the Ministry of
Education, National Institute of Education and the University Grants Commission.
Under outcome 3, the project targeted community mental health professionals, Public
Health Inspectors (PHIs) and civil society stakeholders. In addition, staff of the Mental
Health Unit of the District Hospitals and RDHS Offices in Mannar, Nuwara-Eliya and
Moneragala districts were reached through the project. The staff the Directorate of
Mental Health received capacity development interventions and convened the
interventions at national level. Overall, the project evaluation would include 10 Focus
Group Discussions (FDGs) and 20 in depth interviews with key Informants. Further,
the Sampling methodology to be discussed and agreed with UN agencies during
inception stage.

Annex 4.1 - School Assessment (Social Cohesion)
General Information: The evaluation assessed three out of eight schools in which the social
cohesion interventions were implemented. The child population of the schools shows that
the Watawala School is a smaller school with a low child population compared to the Al-
Munawara Junior College which has a higher child population than the other two with
significant enrolment of boys than girls [Table A.4.1 (a)].

An analysis of general information that should be displayed at the school have proxy indicator
for (1) structure of administration that sets the vision, mission and norms and values that
enable teachers and stdents to connect in a stable social and emotional setting, and (2) creates
a school climate in which a sense of school spirit and community is built. Table A4.1 (b) shows
that the Al-Munawwara Junior College conforms to all of the standards and the Watawala
school emerges as the weakest80. The absence of the school catchment area map also indicates
that monitoring of enrollment and prolonged absenteeism is not a priority of the school.
However, it has to be noted that data collection in this school was limited due to the COVID
19 Pandemic and additional background information was not accessible.

The school plant which comprises of the school buildings, water supply facilities, garden and
play areas are an important part of the condicive learning envirnment and the availability of
infrastructure and facilities enables students to learn in new ways. Providing a safe and secure
learning environmen is also an important part of providing expereiental learning for students.
As the current curriculum is weighted to academic learning the space and facilities for activity
based learning is seen as an important part of the overall curricuum. In terms of safety and
security; 2 of the schools had a fenced in area that was safe for chidlren, a safe water supply,
adequate numbers of toilet for girls and boys and for male and female teachers, nameboard
and sign boards and notice boards to display information. The Watawala Sinhala School, has
the least facilities which includes a lack of a safe fence, play areas and equipment for children.
All 3 schools had audio visual equipment given by the project but the Al-Munawwara school
that has the highest number of students, and facilities did not have a computer laboratory but
the school did have a smart classroom that accommodates 20 students. The general
information also shows that all schools do not use sustianable energy and that facilities across
the schools vary [Table A4.2 (c)].

three schools. The data shows that 62% of the students were Tamil speaking students from
the Tamil and Muslim communities. The children also had relatively stable families as 85% lived
with both parents and 15% with their mothers and 75% had lived in their current locations all
their lives. Given that the study covered schools from the Northern and Eastern Provinces that
had experienced displacement and resettlement only 25% had resettled. Almost all of them
lived in communities of mixed ethnicities mainly Tamil and Muslim and the children from the
Watawala School live in communities comprised of Sinhala and Plantation Tamil Communities.
Except for 15% of the children, the rest participated in religious instruction commonly known
as “Sunday school” conducted by religious institutions and 77% attend extra coaching classes.
It is also important to note that 10% of the children reported of frequent disturbances at home
due to domestic violence and another 10% reporting of sporadic violence at home [Table A4.1
(d)].

Annex 4.2 - School Assessment (Positive Discipline)
The analysis for positive discipline focused mainly on the child and his/her changing social
environment, and how parents, teachers and school principals interact and support the child.
The student population covered by the positive discipline project is much higher as the
project was expected to reach nearly 800 schools and the evaluation had a sample of eight
(8) schools. There is also a wide variation between the numbers of students in the schools as
the project has covered mainly type 2 and 3 schools (Table A4.2 (a)).

Table A4.2(b) on conducive environment for stable social and emotional growth of children
shows that schools such as the Passara Maha Vidyalaya and Gamini Maha Vidylaya have many
information gaps. Important information such as the school catchment area map which helps
to monitor school enrolment and prolonged absenteeism of students, school values and ethics
and school safety plans are not displayed across the schools. The inferences are that the
training provided to teachers to implement the positive discipline project did not cover
important aspects such as creating a conducive environment for students to imbibe skills and
values and set the structure to practice positive discipline.

The process for planning and the quality of the school development plans were outputs of
the Project as all schools were expected to develop action plans to implement the positive
discipline project. The participatory process for developing School Development Plans
though rated as high in almost all of the schools and conformity with SDP standards is also
equally high the inclusion of positive discipline practices is a different process for which the
schools should have been trained. An analysis of the school development plans, and the
activities implemented across the schools shows that such comprehensive planning to
include positive discipline practices in schools and at home has not taken place across the
schools [Table A4.2(c)].

An analysis of the facilities of the schools shows that the schools do not have adequate
facilities that are conducive for learning and social and emotional growth. This lack of
recognition of the importance of providing structure and environment conducive for the
development of children especially at primary grades has affected the full implementation of
the project. This was most evident in the Passara Maha Vidyalaya and Gamini Maha Vidylaya.
According, to the staff at the latter the project has not been implemented in this school apart
from one visit by an ISA [Table A4.2(e)].

The student profiles show that children have relatively stable families as 87% live with both
parents and 87% have lived in the same location indicating that they have not been
displaced and resettled. However, it has to be noted that 19% of the children reported of
frequent disturbances and violence in their homes and another 12% of sporadic disturbances
in their homes. These aspects of the children’s lives have not been sufficiently addressed in
the Project as evidenced from the FGDs and discussions with teachers and school principals.
It is also evident that the project has not strategized around addressing violence and bullying
at multiple levels; namely community, family, school, classroom and at the individual levels.
The outcomes at these different levels should have been mapped and the project monitored
according to the allied delivery of outputs and outcomes [Table A4.2 (f)].
