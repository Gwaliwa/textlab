The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report is produced as part of the Formative Evaluation of the Domestic Violence
Prevention Programme (hereinafter referred to as DVPP or the Programme) designed and
implemented by the National Family Safety Programme (NFSP), a semi-government entity that
operates under the Ministry of National Guard (Health Affairs). The Programme was rolled out as
a pilot to educate and sensitize communities to the risks of domestic violence (DV) and child abuse
(CA) - with particular focus on women, girls, boys and older people.
At the request of NFSP, UNICEF Gulf Area Office (GAO) commissioned this formative evaluation
which was implemented parallel to the pilot roll out. AAN Associates17 was contracted to plan and
implement this evaluation (undertaken between November 2020 to October 2021). The
evaluation’s implementation and analysis (of programme effectiveness and efficiency) were
constrained by the absence of key documentation such as a proposal, results framework, budget,
progress reports and expenditure statements. Where appropriate and plausible, primary data was
gathered to deepen understanding of the intervention, obtain findings (around achievements and
challenges) and draw conclusions and recommendations. The report comprises five chapters and
a series of appendices.
Context and Intervention
The Government of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (GoKSA) recognises both issues of DV and CA. Data
(2010-2015) suggest that one in every three women in KSA is a victim of domestic violence and
the lifetime prevalence of DV ranges between 39.3% and 44.5%.18 In KSA in 2020, there were
approximately 1,601 cases of CA recorded, subjected to at least one form of child abuse.19 The
breadth and the relative acceptance of these violations justifies the need for intervention. There is
growing realization within the GoKSA of the need to address the issue by promoting prevention
and instituting measures to effectively respond to DV and CA cases. One key institutional response
by the GoKSA includes the formation of NFSP (in 2005), with a mandate to support policy and
advocacy actions to help end DV and CA in KSA.
Object of the Evaluation
The DVPP is a pilot intervention led by the NFSP. The Programme aims to strengthen the capacity
of educators, social workers, childcare providers, families and parents to advocate for prevention
of DV and more effectively respond to child rights violations. Though originally planned to be rolled
out in 2020, implementation was delayed by a year due to COVID-19 related restrictions. The
pilot’s implementation was initiated in January 2021 for an anticipated 12 months. Implementation
of the pilot was initially planned for Riyadh and one other location; however, Programme’s
geographic scope has been expanded to all 13 provinces (nationwide).
The Programme has three strategic pillars or components i.e., forging partnerships to leverage
partners’ outreach to target communities (with seven public sector and CSOs);20 training and
capacity building of partners’ staff (mainly the staff that interfaces with the communities at large,
including social workers, educators, childcare providers and others); and community education
and awareness through the cadre of trained network of extension workers (referred to as
Awareness Specialists).
The NFSP developed a training package of eight modules comprising: 1) First thousand days of
life (module for infant and mother health); 2) Do not shake me (Shaken Baby Syndrome);21 3) We
wish you safety (prevention module on child neglect) 4) Your family your safety (prevention module

on parental treatment of children); 5) My child is my responsibility (prevention module on sexual
violence against children); 6) No bullying (prevention module on peer violence); 7) They are
success (prevention module on violence against women); 8) Charity (prevention module on
violence against elderly). The plan included training of Master Trainers (by the NFSP), where each
Master Trainer is expected to train at least 100 frontline staff, who in turn organize community
sessions and train 200 community members. The Programme’s sensitisation approach included
application of interpersonal communication approaches (IPC) to reach out to community members
to educate them about the problem, causes, manifestations, rights and available recourses, to
enable them to take effective preventive and response actions.
Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Scope
This evaluation is formative in nature. It was commissioned with the intent to focus on learning to
inform future design and implementation. The purpose of this evaluation is to systematically assess
the design and implementation of the pilot; identify gaps and challenges; and outline
recommendations to inform the future scale-up. Evaluation objectives include: i) assessment of
the training package for appropriateness to the local context and alignment with national and
international standards; ii) obtain feedback from the trainees (Master Trainers and Awareness
Specialists) on the training contents and delivery approaches; iii) document perceptions of
community members on perceived changes in knowledge, awareness and practices around DV
and CA; and iv) identify gaps and challenges and outline recommendations for future upscaling.
The evaluation scope includes assessment of activities undertaken in the pilot phase, implemented
in all 13 provinces of KSA from November 2020 – October 2021. The evaluation followed the
selected OECD-DAC (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's - Development
Assistance Committee) criteria i.e., relevance, effectiveness and efficiency. Keeping in view the
nature of the social problems (DV and CA) and evaluation expectations, the evaluators added
dimensions of the Human-Rights-Based-Approach (HRBA), gender equality (GE) and equity,
considered as cross-cutting programming priorities (addressed as non-DAC criterion).
Evaluation Design, Methodology and Limitations
The evaluation is participatory22 whereby all key stakeholders were consulted, and their opinions
have informed the evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations. The evaluators applied
a Hybrid evaluation design23 featuring two sub-designs i.e., descriptive content analysis24 and
contribution analysis25 (more details are available in the report).
The evaluation relied primarily on qualitative methods. A total of 12 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs)
were conducted with stakeholders including NFSP, Implementing Partners (IPs) and UNICEF GAO
(six male and six female participants). Moreover, 8 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were
conducted with 23 male and 33 female participants (including Master Trainers, Awareness
Specialists and community members). The evaluation team also observed two training events. The
evaluators interacted with 68 participants (including 29 male and 39 female participants) who
informed the evaluation findings and recommendations. The evaluation is further informed by the
findings from the desk research of 72 internal and external documents. The evaluation design,
methods and implementation placed a considered focus on the integration of human rights-based
programming, gender equality and equity. Integration was ensured by developing separate
evaluation questions, tools, analysis and findings sections for three cross-cutting programming
priorities.
22 Participatory Evaluation is an approach that involves the stakeholders of a programme or policy in the evaluation process.
This involvement can occur at any stage of the evaluation process, from the evaluation design to the data collection and
analysis and the reporting of the study
23 Hybrid design combines specific elements of particular study designs to maximise the quality and rigour of the study output.
24Descriptive content analysis examines the quantitative and qualitative data collected through methods such as e.g.,
document analysis and literature review with the aim of summarising the informational contents of these data with respect to
the research question. The informational content is presented in a straight and descriptive summary structured according to the
needs of the study.
25 Contribution analysis explores attribution through assessing the contribution a programme is making to observed results.

Limitations of the evaluation include: remote data collection (created a selection bias for those with
access to tools such as internet and phones); lack of documentation (compensated for by collection
of primary data); and reduced field data collection (planned FGDs were reduced due to
considerable delays in roll out of community sessions).
Evaluation Findings and Preliminary Conclusions
Relevance
The Programme is concluded to be ‘Relevant’ for prioritizing two widespread, multi-faceted social
problems (DV and CA) that carry serious consequences for women, boys, girls and older persons.
The significance and relevance are illuminated for the fact that these are prevalent issues in Saudi
and are embedded in upbringing processes and affects infants, girls, boys, married women and
older persons. Over time, there has been growing realization by public authorities to take
appropriate policy and institutional actions to address these issues. Prioritization of the issue is
evident from the fact that these issues are registered in public sector documents such as Saudi
Vision 2030, Child Protection Law (2014) and Regulation on Protection against Abuse (2012),
among others. The fact that a NFSP-sponsored initiative is currently being implemented shows the
importance that these issues have attained over time. The contents (of the training modules) are
largely appropriate, however with an overwhelming focus on addressing behavioural causes of CA
and DV. The content excluded the legislative, policy and socioeconomic causes contributing to
perpetuation of such behaviours.
Effectiveness
Keeping in view evaluation expectations, the evaluation team used the three Programme
strategies/components for assessment of effectiveness including: i) multi-stakeholder
partnerships; ii) training and capacity development of partners; and iii) community education and
awareness. For partnerships, the Programme is assessed as ‘Partly Effective’ for successfully
engaging 7 of the 10 planned partners. Moreover, selection of partners offers a mix of public sector
and CSO partners, with outreach and technical capacities. There are evident gaps around
formalization and coordination/management of partnerships. Similarly, the training and capacity
development component is assessed as ‘Partly Effective’. Reasons include: i) successful
development of eight training modules; ii) application of cascade training approach whereby NFSP
trained the Master Trainers, who in turn train Awareness Specialists, expected to organise
sessions for community members; and iii) evident coherence and consistency of training contents
with national and international norms and standards. Gaps in training content include: lack of
relevant information on available response mechanisms for lodging complaint against perpetrators;
insufficient training delivery time (e.g., 8 modules in one session highlighted by extension workers);
and absence of in house roll-out plans (e.g. duration for completion of planned workshops and
target audience) affected the timely completion of the pilot phase. The community awareness
component was not assessed, as the Programme is significantly behind schedule (only one IP has
managed to conduct26 limited community sessions). Feedback from community sessions indicate
that communities are appreciative of the initiative and are hopeful for the trainings to change public
perception on DV and CA over time.
Programme design and implementation thus far is marked by multiple enablers and disablers. The
key enablers include: commitment and capacities of NFSP to lead this intervention (with
established rapport in the sector); training contents being useful to the communities; and
availability of willing and capable partners that provide wider outreach to target communities. The
achievements were undermined by multiple disablers including: gaps in formalizing engagement
with partners resulting in limited clarity around roles and expectations between NFSP and partners;
and limited/no incentives for partners’ staff to participate in the Programme. The evaluators noted
gaps in the training content and delivery. These include: limited clarity around goals and objectives
for each module; inappropriate and missing citations; limited focus on persons with disability
26 As of the start of data collection for this evaluation, i.e., October 1, 2021.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia III
(PWDs); and insufficient training delivery time. Gaps in the monitoring system included reliance on
self-reporting and lack of instructions to use evaluation tools.
Efficiency
Based on available information (drawn mostly from primary sources), the approach of leveraging
partnerships (using the staff and volunteers from IPs for wider outreach) is deemed cost and time
efficient. Programme implementation is behind schedule and the key reasons for delay include:
delayed nominations of Master Trainers and finalisation of their agreements; lack of clarity and
timeline (from NFSP) for IPs to roll out internal training and community sessions; and unavailability
of partner staff due to long breaks from work for observance of rituals (such as Ramadan and Hajj).
These delays affected the progress thus far and it looks unlikely that Programme will be completed
in the planned 12 months. Using existing human resources (within IPs) undercuts the need for
funds. In terms of human resources, adequate staff and volunteers are available with the IPs.
However, there are evident capability gaps (mostly in terms of training background of Master
Trainers and Awareness Specialists), coupled by limited incentives and motivation for staff and
volunteers. This being a pilot, the focus has been on rolling out the programme using the planned
approach, rather than exploring alternatives. The evaluators nevertheless looked at successful
examples of behavioural change programmes and cited two examples (Egypt and Democratic
Republic of Congo), which highlight the use of mass media (including social media) and
engagement with influencers (social and religious leaders) for better outreach and influence on
changing behaviours around under-discussed issues of the community.
Gender Equality, Equity and HRBA
Gender Equality: The findings suggest partial integration of gender equality principles in the design,
implementation and tracking of results. The training contents demonstrate a considerable focus on
causes, manifestation, implications, needs and recourses for women, girls, boys and older
persons. This shows a demonstrated focus on creating contents based on sex and age. The
trainers (both Master Trainers and Awareness Specialists) include a noticeable number of women
trainers. This bodes well as these women are likely better able to reach out to women and children,
whilst overcoming sex-based segregation. The shift to online training (of trainers and the
community sessions) is likely to enable more women and girls to participate. However, the
Programme does not focus on tracking gender-based results.
Equity: The training contents highlight groups at greater risk e.g., married women, women from
low economic strata or low education level, children from broken families or single parents, and
others. This bodes well for equity integration in terms of contents. There are gaps, such as limited
focus on PWDs, non-citizens and others.
HRBA: The Programme was assessed on key elements of HRBA (often referred to as PANEL).27
The Programme is in compliance with: a) Partnerships: for forging partnerships with relevant
actors; b) Empowerment: whereby community members know about their rights; and c) Legality:
for aligning with national and international laws. The Programme falls short in complying with the
principles of non-discrimination and equality (given the Programme’s implementation excluded
non-Arabic speakers and people without access to internet to online training), and accountability
(implementation lacks a complaint or reporting mechanism).
Conclusions
Given the enormity of the scale and consequences of DV and CA for victims and the community,
the evaluation team concludes that the intervention is much needed for a context like KSA. While
the intervention merits continuity, evaluators underline the need for sweeping yet urgent design
and operational changes to help women, older persons, boys and girls to benefit fully and widely.
The aspects around which a considered re-thinking is needed include: partnership formalisation

and use of mass media and local influencers; and greater technical support from partners such as
UNICEF and others. Given the fact that only limited community sessions have been rolled out, the
evaluators are unable to comment on their utility and possible influence on larger communal
thinking and behavioural changes. The NFSP may need to keep in mind that the problems are
multi-faceted, hence would require parallel work around legislative, policy and institutional reforms,
besides the DVPP driven community centric behavioural interventions.
Lessons Learned
▪ Formalization of NFSP-IP Engagement: The Programme’s partnership approach is
helpful in leveraging human resource and wider outreach. However, implementation has
been hampered by gaps in engagement that have resulted in ambiguities around roles and
expectations, accountabilities, coordination, planning and reporting. This could primarily
be attributed to lack of focus to formalize the relationships at the highest level via an
agreement or contract.
▪ Unrealistic or Ambitious Planning: The Programme implemented a cascade training
model which is assessed as appropriate given the scope and scale of the pilot. The
expectation for each Master Trainer to train 100 Awareness Specialists, who (each one)
are required to train 200 community members before the end of this year seems ambitious
(given the community sessions roll out has just started). This coupled with the lack of
planning and timeline have resulted in significant delays in the roll out of in-house training
by the IPs.
▪ Utilizing Technology to Deliver Training: The Programme successfully adapted to the
COVID-19 assembly-related restrictions by redirecting to online training. The shift has
saved time and cost and has enabled the NFSP and IPs to train 683 participants. However,
the trainer’s technical capacity and training duration merits considered rethinking around
setting pre-qualifications and scope of training contents and expectations.
Recommendations
The evaluation team suggests a series of recommendations at design and operational levels:
Design-Level: These recommendations lay the ground for the NFSP to revisit the
Programme design before scaling-up:
1. The NFSP is advised to leverage internal capacities and seek technical assistance (from
partners) to develop the package of essential documents to enable clarity around design
and to guide implementation, including a: proposal, Theory of Change (ToC), results
framework, budget, work plan, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan, and others. Key
actions include:
a. Engage with technical agencies to seek assistance in training (in-house capacity
development in Programme design) of NFSP staff and secure support of a
consultant/contractor to help draft the key documents;
b. Plan and undertake assessments to deepen the understanding of the problems
(DV and CA). Use these assessments to inform Programme design;
c. Identify key NFSP staff to work closely with the consultant/contractor to develop
the essential package of documents (in a consultative manner);
d. Engage with existing and potential partners (IPs) and seek their inputs in the
development of key documents, and commitments to contribute financially and/or
materially;
2. Formalize partnerships with IPs (both public and CSOs) by signing formal Memorandums
of Understanding (MoU)/agreements. The formalization of engagement must clearly spell
out roles and responsibilities between NFSP and IPs, lay out planning, coordination and
reporting mechanisms with enabling tools, where appropriate. Key actions include:
a. NFSP to plan and implement a stakeholder mapping exercise and identify a list of
potential partners based on commonality of mission and mandates;
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia V
b. NFSP to reach out to existing and potential partners and seek highest level
commitments and support for the Programme. Use the opportunity to seek financial
and material commitments and include those in the formal engagement;
c. Formalize engagement by drafting and signing a contract/MoU with each IP, whilst
defining the roles and responsibilities, as well as modes of coordination and
communication, accountabilities and resource contributions, and others.
d. Work with each partner to develop partner specific work plans and targets, which
should be realistic and attainable;
e. NFSP to keep regular contact with IPs and encourage cross-partner engagement,
site visits and learning exchanges.
3. Revamp the training contents and delivery mechanisms. Continue using the cascade
model, however develop separate training kits/products for Master Trainers, Awareness
Specialists and community participants.
a. Engage with and seek technical assistance from agencies (such as UNICEF) to
support with review of training contents together with NFSP staff. The review
should lay out training delivery strategy and should cover aspects such as duration,
remote vs. in-person training, trainers’ pre-qualifications, pre-post assessments.
b. The future training packages may need to be tailored for layers of participants -
Master Trainers, Awareness Specialists and community participants.
c. Training design and delivery should continue to follow the cascade model. The IPs
should be encouraged to set criteria for selection of trainers.
d. NFSP should revisit and update its Programme design and implementation to
include gender equality and address the needs of vulnerable groups (like PWD,
non-Saudis, non-Arabic speakers, non-citizens etc.).
Operational-Level: Following recommendation and associated actions are suggested to
improve programme implementation.
1. NFSP to develop an internal M&E system, and where required, lend assistance to IPs to
develop and implement organization specific M&E plans:
a. NFSP to develop an M&E plan as part of the exercise of developing essential
documentation for the Programme. M&E planning should focus on input versus
outputs and tracking and should prioritize seeking community feedback to help
improve design and delivery.
b. NFSP to allocate 7% of the intervention’s overall resources for M&E activities and
assign responsibility within the institution.
c. Engage with technical agencies, research and academic institutions to seek help
with developing and implementing the M&E plans.
d. Undertake periodic baselines, research, reviews, evaluations, and other exercises
to gather monitoring data to assess progress and ideas for improvisation.

CHAPTER 1
Introduction and Object of
the Evaluation –
DVP Programme
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 1
This report is produced as part of the Formative Evaluation of the Domestic Violence
Prevention Programme (hereinafter referred to as DVPP or the Programme) designed and
implemented by the National Family Safety Programme (NFSP), a semi-government entity that
operates under the Ministry of National Guard (Health Affairs). The Programme was rolled out as
a pilot to educate and sensitize communities to the risks of domestic violence (DV) and child abuse
(CA) — with particular focus on women, girls, boys and older people.
NFSP planned to implement DVPP with the support of relevant public entities and civil society
organisations (CSOs), drawing on the wide network of community level workers and volunteers.
Under the aegis of NFSP, the intervention was rolled out in partnership with six ministries
comprising the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education; Ministry of Human Resources and Social
Development; and Ministry of Media. Along with these public sector entities, the Programme
envisaged partnering with three CSOs namely Al-Mawaddah Institute, Al-Waqar Institute and
Princess Noura Bint Abdulrahman University.
The Programme aims to strengthen the capacity of educators, social workers, childcare providers,
families and parents to advocate for prevention of domestic violence and more effectively respond
to child rights violations. Though originally planned to be rolled out in 2020, programming was
delayed due to COVID-19. The pilot’s implementation was initiated in January 2021 for an
anticipated 12 months. Moreover, the pilot was planned to be implemented in Riyadh and one
other location, however, the geographic scope has been expanded to 13 provinces (nation-wide).
The NFSP sought technical assistance from UNICEF Gulf Area Office (GAO) to support with
engagement of consultants to undertake the formative evaluation. UNICEF GAO engaged AAN
Associates for the evaluation which was planned and implemented in parallel to the Programme’s
roll out (from November 2020 - October 2021). It is pertinent to underline that DVPP does not have
a documented proposal (including logframe and work plan) or a budget. Where appropriate and
plausible, primary data was gathered to deepen understanding of the intervention, obtain findings
and draw conclusions and recommendations.
The intent of the evaluation has largely remained same as outlined in the Terms of Reference
(ToR) (Appendix 1). However, changes in geographic scope of the pilot (from two planned
locations to nation-wide) and delayed implementation (training of extension workers and
community sessions are currently being rolled out by partners) required the evaluators to adapt.
The evaluation team extended the timeline for field data collection i.e., until October 2021, to
engage with community participants who had attended sessions (only two community sessions
were organized during this time period). The NFSP attributes COVID-19 related restrictions and
weaker coordination with partners as key reasons for considerable delays in implementation. To
complete the evaluation within the agreed timeline, the primary data collection for community
sessions was reduced (more details are included in Chapter 3).
This report comprises five chapters and a series of appendices as depicted in Figure 1.

1.1 Intervention Context
This section lays out the broader context in which the intervention was planned and implemented,
including a brief introduction to the country, as well as the policy, institutional and political
environment surrounding domestic violence.
1.1.1. Country Profile
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) lies in the southernmost Figure 2 Map of KSA
part of western Asia. With an area28 of 2,149,690 sq.
kilometres (km), the Kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian
Peninsula. It is bordered by the Red Sea to the west; the
Arabian Gulf, UAE and Qatar to the east; Kuwait, Iraq and
Jordan to the north, and Yemen and Oman to the South.
According to the recent estimates (2021), the population of
Saudi Arabia is 35 million29 of which 42.3% are females and
58% are males.30 Saudi Arabia’s economy is mostly
dependant on oil. However, the nation has undergone
significant transformation over the past four decades from a
subsistence economy mainly dependent on traditional small-
scale agriculture and trade to a modern, albeit developing,
economy characterized by growing diversification of production and income, evolving inter-sector
linkages, and expanding regional and global economic integration. This transformation was also
complimented by the national strategy known as the “Saudi Vision 2030”, developed in 2016 that
used the windfall of wealth in social and economic development.31 The politico-administrative map
of Saudi Arabia is illustrated in Figure 2.32
1.1.2. Domestic Violence and Child Abuse: Global and Regional Context
DV and CA are prevailing social issues
Figure 3 Global Prevalence and Types of DV
globally. According to the literature, DV is
“actual or threatened physical or sexual
violence, or psychological and emotional
abuse” inflicted on a victim,33 whereas child
abuse is the “act or failure to act on the part of
a parent or caregiver that results in death,
serious physical or emotional harm, sexual
abuse or exploitation”34 of a child. Globally, one
in every third women faces violence. It is
worthy to note that victims of DV usually suffer
from fatal outcomes, including homicide or
suicide, injuries, psychological disorders like
anxiety, depression, eating disorders, as well
as other health effects including pain or
physical disorders.35 Underlying reasons of DV
are highlighted in Figure 3.
With regards to child abuse, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that up to one billion
children between the ages of 2 to 17 have experienced physical, sexual, or emotional violence or

neglect in the past year.36 Violence against children usually occurs in one or more of the six main
types of interpersonal violence including maltreatment, bullying, youth violence, intimate partner
violence or domestic violence, sexual violence and emotional or psychological violence.
Underlying causes of CA include: lower levels of education, lower levels of income, lack of
emotional bond between the child and parent, poor parenting practices, family separation or
dysfunction, social acceptance of violence, and inadequate social protection. CA has resulted in
severe injuries, negative coping behaviours, negative health risk behaviours, impairment of brain
and nervous system development, in addition to a wide range of non-communicable diseases.37
In the Gulf Area, there are no regional statistics available to indicate the extent of DV38 and CA,39
however, different studies conducted locally have highlighted the occurrence of DV and CA.
1.1.3. Domestic Violence and Child Abuse in KSA
Domestic violence is considered a public health issue in Saudi Arabia as well as a violation of a
fundamental human right.40 Eleven studies conducted in six cities41 (Riyadh, Jeddah, Madina, Taif,
Arar and Al-Ahsa) revealed that one in every three women in Saudi Arabia is a victim of domestic
violence and the lifetime prevalence of DV ranges between 39.3% and 44.5%. In 2012, a total of
292 child abuse cases42 were registered by the NFSP—that is mandated to address and prevent
the issue of DV and CA. Out of the 292 cases, child neglect constituted 41.3% of cases, 27% of
which were emotionally abused. According to the National Family Safety Registry (NFSR) — a
national registry of DV and CA under the NFSP—boys in KSA are more likely to experience
physical maltreatment and neglect than girls, while girls are more likely to experience sexual and
emotional maltreatment than their male counterparts.43 According to a 2020 NFSR report, most
perpetrators of CA were parents—with fathers at 29% and mothers at 25%.44 Underlying causes
of DV in Saudi Arabia include, amongst others, poverty, gender inequality and early marriage.45
Leading risk factors of CA in Saudi Arabia include lack of understanding of children’s needs,
children with physical or mental disabilities, poverty, unemployment, substance abuse, as well as
social acceptance of corporal punishment.46

However, the magnitude of the problem in Saudi
Arabia even in these settings, was not known due to the lack of accurate statistics.48
In 2004, Saudi Arabia had a series of high-profile child fatalities that attracted the attention of the
national media. These developments encouraged governmental and non-governmental bodies to

establish agencies focused on preventing child abuse.49 As a result, the Ministry of Social Affairs
established the General Directorate for Social Protection. The Human Rights Commission and the
National Society for Human Rights were also founded during this time. On November 2005, Royal
Decree No.11471 established the National Family Safety Program (NFSP), a body that is
administratively linked to the Ministry of National Guard (Health Affairs). In 2008, the Saudi Cabinet
of Ministers issued a resolution that sets out prevention and protection guidelines to address the
issue of DV. The Government of Saudi Arabia issued the Saudi Law on the Abuse System, and
the Saudi Child Protection Act, in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
Though CA and DV are recognised as public priorities, both are prevailing issues in Saudi Arabia.
Between 2017-2019, there were 3,471 recorded cases of DV,50 decreasing to 2,318 cases in
2020.51 In the same period, Saudi Arabia recorded 2,994 cases of CA.52 In 2020, 1,601 cases were
recorded, with children being exposed to at least one form of abuse.53
National Family Safety Programme
Figure 4 NFSP Interventions in KSA
On 18 November 2005, NFSP was
established, a semi-governmental
body that is administratively linked to
the Ministry of National Guard.
NFSP’s goal is to support policy and
advocacy to end domestic violence
and child abuse and neglect in Saudi
Arabia, done through partnership,
advocacy at both national and
community levels, service provision to
those affected by violence and
referral as necessary. Details of
NFSP interventions are given in
Figure 4.54
Currently, the NFSP is preparing policy and programmatic recommendations to end DV and CA in
Saudi Arabia. It is building partnerships between the various groups working on these issues in
Saudi Arabia in order to foster joint national action, raising awareness about the dangers that DV
and CA pose as well as appropriate responses to these issues.
1.2 Programme Introduction (Object of Evaluation)
This section describes key aspects of the Programme that have been evaluated. As outlined
above, the non-availability of programme documentation—mainly the proposal, logframe and
budget—constrained a detailed write-up of this section. The evaluators thus convened several
meetings with NFSP to make up for the documentation gaps.
1.2.1 Programme Overview
This is a NFSP-led (planned, resourced and implemented) intervention that aims to raise
community awareness of the causes and implications of different forms of DV and CA. The intent
is to achieve awareness to help prevent violence and abuse of particular groups and at the same
time raise demand for better response services by the service providers.
The NFSP has three departments which include Prevention and Research, Community Services
and Training Operations. The Prevention and Research Department is focused on creating
evidence-based training programs, the Community Services Department includes a child helpline
services as well as advocacy and awareness-raising activities, and the Training and Operations

Department covers all staff training, finance, IT, HR and strategic planning. The Programme is led
by the Prevention and Research Department and has four parts:
1. Form partnerships with multiple public sector organisations and CSOs to engage in
community-based education and awareness. Partnerships formed with seven partners55
(initially planned for 10 partners). Each partner is expected to appoint a focal point for
oversight of activities assigned to the partners such as training of field level staff (with a
range of different staff available for these entities) and coordination and reporting to the
NFSP.
2. Develop a training manual for training of public sector organisations and CSO partners and
their staff and volunteers. The training package comprises eight modules with one on each
of the following: 1) First thousand days of life (module for infant and mother health); 2) Do
not shake me (shaken baby syndrome); 3) We wish you safety (prevention module on
neglecting children) 4) Your family your safety (prevention module on parental treatment);
5) My child is my responsibility (prevention module on sexual violence against children); 6)
No bullying (prevention module on peer violence); 7) They are success (prevention module
on violence against women); 8) Charity (prevention module on violence against elderly).
3. Train partner entities through a cascade training approach to build a cadre of trainers for
community-level awareness sessions. The NFSP trained Master Trainers from each
partner. Each Master Trainer is expected to train 100 extension workers e.g., Awareness
Specialists, through at least four training sessions of 25 participants each.
4. Trained Awareness Specialists to organise community awareness sessions. As per the
plan, each trained Awareness Specialist was then expected to organize multiple
awareness sessions to train 200 people.
The plan (refer to Figure 5) indicates how the trainings are implemented:
Figure 5 Training Levels of DVPP Implementation
1.2.2 Programme Goal
The Programme’s overall goal is “to disseminate valid information on preventing domestic violence
and child abuse to different segments of the Saudi society.”56 The specific objective is “to educate
the community on the importance of protecting families and to empower its members of all ages to
build a thriving economy, hence contribute to the Kingdom's vision and future strategies”.57
55 Implementing partners includes Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social
Development, the Ministry of Media, Al-Mawaddah Institute, Al-Waqar Institute and Princess Noura Bint Abdulrahman University.

1.2.3 Programme Strategies
Figure 6 Key DVPP Strategies
In the absence of formalized strategies, the evaluators have
utilised DVPP goals as programme strategies (refer to Figure 6
for details).
1. Forging partnerships with the public and CSOs.
2. Building capacities of partners from public and CSOs.
3. Community education and awareness through inter-
personal communication.58
1.2.4 Geographic Spread and Implementation
Status
The DVPP is a pilot programme which was
Figure 7 Number of MTs per Province
originally planned to be rolled out in Riyadh and
one rural area59 followed by a national rollout
throughout the country. However, NFSP has rolled
out the Programme nationwide across all 13
provinces. The change in plan as explained by
NFSP indicate that rolling out the Programme in
one phase was more feasible, as compared to
contacting different implementing partners over
different phases of implementation. Refer to Figure
7 that displays the number of Master Trainers
trained by NFSP per province during the pilot
phase.
1.2.5 Programme Stakeholders and their Role
The Programme involves a range of stakeholders including UNICEF, NFSP and partners (the
Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Education (MoE), Ministry of Media (MoM), Ministry of Human
Resources and Social Development (MoHRSD), Al-Mawwadah Institute, Al-Waqar Institute and
Princess Nourah Bint Abdul Rahman University). Table 1 below shows the list of partners that
NFSP is currently engaged with to implement the Programme.

1.2.6 Programme Participants (Beneficiaries)
The Programme has three groups of beneficiaries: the public sector (ministries and their respective
departments) and CSO staff who were trained on the DV and CA training package; the NFSP who
benefited from improving capacities in relation to the Programme’s design, development and
implementation; and community members (including parents, caregivers, social and religious
leaders, adolescent and young boys and girls (students) who benefited from knowing more about
the types of DV and CA, causes and implications and prevention mechanisms. The evaluation
team did not have data on the intended number of participants NFSP aimed to accomplish for each
beneficiary group.
1.2.7 Programme Resources and Donors
As outlined above, there is no official budget for the intervention.61 The Programme is designed to
minimize costs as partners who are engaged and trained for community education are either public
sector workers or CSO-supported staff and volunteers. Therefore, the intervention will not incur
additional human resource costs.
1.2.8 Significance of the Programme
Find below an overview of significance as identified by different programme stakeholders:
1. The Programme is a demonstration of the deep interest and commitment of the NFSP in
addressing the prevailing issue of DV and CA in Saudi Arabia. As such, the Programme is
aligned with national policy instruments, particularly Saudi Vision 2030.
2. The Programme is significant for its multi-stakeholder partnerships approach that aims to
raise awareness of the general public and front-line staff on the needed preventative and
response actions to address cases of violence and abuse.
3. The Programme is also significant for its potential engagement with development partners
(such as UN agencies) to advise on and assist in improving Programme design and
implementation. The current formative evaluation of the Programme is an example of such
efforts.
4. The Programme’s success in implementing a multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder
partnership approach to building capacity could be exemplary for other Gulf countries to
replicate.
1.3 Theory of Change
The Programme is being implemented without a documented Theory of Change (ToC). However,
during the inception phase of the evaluation, the evaluators developed and used the following
intervention logic (Figure 8) based on the description shared as part of the ToR.

Evaluation Purpose,
Objectives, Scope, Criteria
and Questions
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 10
This chapter summarises the evaluation purpose, objectives, criteria and questions as an outline
of the scope of the evaluation. The chapter further lays out the significance of the evaluation,
relevant stakeholders, and their role and interest in evaluation findings.
2.1 Evaluation Purpose
This is a ‘Formative Evaluation’, with a demonstrated learning focus. The purpose of this evaluation
is to systematically assess the design and implementation of the pilot phase and document the
achievements against the intended results. The evaluation recommendations are expected to help
improve the future design, rollout and replication of DVPP across KSA.
2.2 Evaluation Objectives
The following evaluation objectives were refined based on discussions with NFSP during the
inception phase of the evaluation. These objectives are largely aligned with the evaluation
objectives as listed in the evaluation ToR.
• To assess the Programme’s training package to ensure that contents are appropriate to
the local context and international conventions and standards and suggest how these could
be further improved.
• To evaluate how trainees (both Master Trainers and those in the field) have assessed the
training contents and delivery approach/es during the evaluation timeframe and identify
changes that should be made for improvement.
• To engage with community groups (men, women, caregivers, community leaders, children,
and adolescents—both boys and girls) who attended the virtual sessions within the
evaluation data collection phase and assess what could be improved.
• To document key challenges and gaps in Programme design and operation and outline
recommendations for improvement and roll out in the future.
2.3 Evaluation Scope, Criteria and Key Questions
This section outlines each of the above evaluation aspects separately:
2.3.1 Evaluation Scope
Below are the details of the thematic, chronological and geographic scope of the evaluation.
• Thematic focus includes an assessment of
Figure 9 Thematic focus of DVPP Evaluation
i) training content, ii) rollout plan, iii) training
delivery approaches and iv) monitoring and
evaluation system as indicated in Figure 9.
• The chronological scope included all
activities implemented in the pilot phase
intended to begin at the end of 202062 and
continue for one year. The expectation was
that evaluation fieldwork would be initiated
three months after the trainings were
delivered. However, the first training session
for the Master Trainers was conducted in

2.3.2 Evaluation Criteria and Key Evaluation Questions
The evaluation criteria (as displayed in
Figure 10 Evaluation Criteria
Figure 10) were based on the components
prescribed by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development's (OECD)
Development Assistance Committee
(DAC)63 including relevance, effectiveness
and efficiency. As this is a formative
evaluation (of pilot phase), impact criterion
was not part of the ToR nor was assessed
as part of the evaluation. The non-DAC
criterion included the Human-Rights-Based-
Approach (HRBA), gender equality (GE) and
equity. HRBA and equity were not part of the
evaluation ToR but were added by the evaluators to meet UNICEF’s cross-cutting priorities.
The evaluation questions (as listed in the ToR) were critically reviewed, discussed and rephrased
to fit into the Evaluation Matrix (see Appendix 2 for the complete matrix). The Evaluation Matrix
was developed following the scoping discussions to establish consensus and evaluation
expectations between the Evaluation Steering Committee (ESC) and the evaluation team. Below
is the final list of key evaluation questions for DAC and Non-DAC criteria (Table 2).
Table 2 Key Evaluation Questions
Evaluation Criteria Key Questions
Relevance EQ1 – To what extent DVPP (the Programme) addresses the needs of
children and prioritization of capacity development is aligned to the national
priorities of the GoKSA?
Effectiveness EQ2 – To what extent has the pilot roll out of DVPP achieved the intended
outcomes (including any unintended outcomes), and the training contents
are consistent with local needs and context, and national and international
standards?
EQ3 – What design and operational improvements are required to scale-
up DVPP to the national level, including a monitoring system (to track
achievement of results)?
Efficiency EQ4 – To what extent did DVPP use resources (funds, technical and
human resources and partnerships) to achieve maximum cost efficiency,
and consider/identify plausible alternatives for improved efficiency?
HRBA, Gender EQ5 – To what extent did DVPP (design, content, implementation,
Equality, and Equity achievement of results and monitoring) demonstrate compliance with
gender equality, equity and HRBA principles and approaches?

2.4 Evaluation Significance
This section outlines the evaluation significance for different stakeholders including NFSP, public
sector and CSO partners (IPs), UNICEF GAO and the communities.
• NFSP: This evaluation is significant in terms of offering an objective assessment of the roll
out of the pilot phase, and exploring how has this contributed to the achievement of
intended results. This evaluation has identified possible improvements in Programme
design (training contents, delivery, partnerships, and coordination, M&E) and
implementation before possible upscaling to a wider audience. By assessing the alignment
of the prevention programme with national and international standards and frameworks,
the evaluation enabled the NFSP to advocate and work with relevant public authorities on
continuation and national implementation of the DVPP. Additionally, this evaluation
improved NFSP’s needs-based approach to planning. Furthermore, this process helped
NFSP improve its documentation and processing by adding risk mitigation and alternative
approaches.
• UNICEF GAO: This evaluation enabled UNICEF GAO to better position itself in terms of
future engagement (in terms of technical assistance) with respective governments in the
region. Moreover, UNICEF GAO will help other countries to benefit from the pilot roll out of
the Programme by adopting and/or improving countries’ similar planned interventions.
• Implementing Partners: This evaluation enabled the implementing partners to use better
practices in their deployment of resources to roll out the Programme at advanced level and
improve their delivery for the greater good of the Saudi community.
• Communities (particularly women, children and older persons): The evaluation
enabled communities to share their experiences and suggestions to help improve future
roll out. Interaction with communities has, in fact, empowered people by providing the
space for community members to voice their opinion about the issue.

CHAPTER 3
Evaluation Methodology,
Quality Assurance and
Ethics
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 14
This chapter describes evaluation design, methodology and data sources, sampling strategy, data
analysis approach, compliance to United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) norms and standards,
limitations and mitigation measures, and evaluation implementation and management.
3.1 Evaluation Design
The evaluation was guided by the participatory64 approach as it engaged all key stakeholders
during all stages of the evaluation—planning, implementation, analysis and dissemination
(including the ESC). The evaluation was informed by the opinions, experiences and suggestions
of key stakeholders, including implementing partners from ministries and CSOs (master trainers,
awareness specialists, focal point); rights holders (men, women); technical and financial partners
(UNICEF GAO and NFSP).
The evaluators used a Hybrid Evaluation Design featuring two Figure 11 Evaluation Design
sub-designs i.e., descriptive content analysis65 and
contribution analysis66 (refer to Figure 11 for visual
representation of evaluation design). The descriptive content
analysis sub-design was used to assess the training contents (of
eight modules) for consistency with global and national
standards and norms. This was undertaken by the training
content development expert and compared with training
packages or literature available around the issues. The content
was analysed on two bases by making a specific criterion for
pedagogical analysis and technical analysis. The contribution
analysis sub-design helped in assessing how the Programme
interventions have contributed to improved knowledge and
influenced behaviours around DV and CA in the targeted population. This was done qualitatively
by reaching out to different respondent groups at three levels (Master Trainers, Awareness
Specialist and community members) regardless of their field of expertise or social role.
3.2 Evaluation Methods
The evaluators have used a qualitative Figure 12 Evaluation Methods
approach for this evaluation. The approach
enabled cross-verification or validation of
data gathered from different sources,
including the secondary evidence. The
methodological approach enabled
achieving depth and coverage, authenticity,
reliability and triangulation of findings. The
methods used for the evaluation are
illustrated in Figure 12.
These methods have been elaborated in the
following sections.
3.2.1 Desk Review
The evaluators reviewed 72 documents that included internal and external sources. The desk
review continued throughout the evaluation and enabled better understanding of the context,
64 Participatory evaluation is an approach that involves the stakeholders of a programme or policy in the evaluation process.
This involvement can occur at any stage of the evaluation process, from the evaluation design to the data collection and
analysis and the reporting of the study.
65Descriptive content analysis examines the quantitative and qualitative data collected through methods such as e.g.,
document analysis and literature review with the aim of summarising the informational contents of these data with respect to
the research question. The informational content is presented in a straight and descriptive summary structured according to the
needs of the study.
66 Contribution analysis explores attribution through assessing the contribution a programme is making to observed results.

intervention, results, challenges and learning. A systematic approach was applied during desk
research which entailed initial screening and classification (whereby documents were organised
and catalogued according to the type of documents), broader themes were identified (while
keeping in view the Evaluation Matrix), and relevant information was extracted through general
reading. The information gathered was used to appropriately respond to evaluation questions
either on its own or with the support of the primary data collected through field research. Table 4
below summarises the broader categories of available Programme documents (refer to Appendix
4 for complete list of documents reviewed).

3.2.2 Qualitative Data Collection
The evaluators conducted key informant interviews (KIIs), focus group discussions (FGDs) and
field training observations to collect qualitative data. The evaluation team planned to obtain the
views of all key stakeholders (national, district and community). Data collection was conducted in
parallel to the rollout plan (i.e., trainings at three levels) of the DVP Programme. However, due to
delay in pilot implementation and limited number of key stakeholders who were aware of the
Programme, the evaluation scope of qualitative data collection was revised (agreed with UNICEF)
and includes a reduction in numbers of both KIIs and FGDs. The details are in the following
sections.
KIIs: The evaluators initially planned to conduct a total of 24 KIIs at various levels. However, the
scope was reduced to 12 interviews after discussion with UNICEF GAO and NFSP. The evaluators
conducted KIIs with key decision-makers at the national level to understand their views,
suggestions and perceptions on Programme design, implementation, achievements, challenges,
lessons learned and scalability. The respondent’s selection was guided by the respondents’ role
and position in the Programme design and implementation. Open ended and semi-structured
guidelines were used at various levels (refer to Appendix 5 for the KII guides). Table 5 below
reflects the interviewed key informants:

FGDs: The evaluators initially planned to conduct 12 FGDs after three months of trainings67 to
understand and explore the knowledge, opinions, perceptions, behaviour, and practices of the

rights holders and service providers. However, due to the delay in rollout of community sessions,
the scope was reduced to 8 FGDs after discussion with UNICEF GAO and NFSP (refer to Appendix
6 for FGD guides). The delay was mainly attributed to the IPs not being able to roll out the trainings
in the agreed timeframe (one year of the pilot phase). Thus, analysis of FGD presents only the
views of participating IP (Al-Mawaddah Association) and not of the ones who still have not rolled
out the trainings. The distribution of FGDs is given below in Table 6 below. Each FGD had
approximately 4 to 10 participants who were primarily chosen by NFSP based on the participant’s
availability instead of being randomly selected by the evaluation team, as planned originally.

Training Observation: In light of the COVID-19 related precautionary restrictions, NFSP
conducted all trainings virtually. The evaluation team, therefore, virtually participated in 2 online
trainings to observe implementation and the trainer’s performance. The team used the training
observation checklist (refer to Appendix 7 for the checklist).
3.3 Training and Quality Assurance of the Data Collection
The evaluation team was responsible for overall
Figure 13 Quality Measures Implemented
data collection and quality assurance in the
process, and therefore services of relevant local
sector experts were engaged as per identified
need.
The evaluation team trained the field team on data
collection tools (KIIs, FGDs and training
observation checklists). For the KIIs, a training
session (led by the international team68) was
conducted to train the national experts. Prior to
national experts conducting the KIIs
independently, mock interviews were recorded
and shared with the international core team for
quality assurance purposes. For those national
team members involved in conducting the FGDs,
a separate training session was organized. The
training followed a structured agenda (see
Appendix 8) and focused on providing an
orientation to the field staff on Programme
interventions, coverage, evaluation purpose and
objectives. Special emphasis was given to explain
UNEG/UNICEF guidelines, norms and field
protocols to ensure all ethical guidelines are completely understood for correct application during
virtual data collection. Refer to Figure 14 for a summary of quality measures undertaken by the
evaluation team.
3.4 Data Processing and Analysis
Qualitative data analysis was carried out simultaneously with the data collection phase, wherein
MaxQDA69 software was used in a systematic and structured way. The analysis entailed an in-

depth review of the collected data and summarized the unstructured textual content into
manageable data relevant to the evaluation criteria. This process was followed by identifying
relevant data and its coding which was categorized into common themes. The summarized and
analysed data was organized into matrices to extract the matching patterns on different
programmatic aspects and perspectives of participants. All key findings were triangulated with
secondary sources to make valid judgments and conclusions. The evaluators also utilised and
analysed data from secondary sources to develop a contribution narrative.
3.5 Integration of HRBA, Gender Equality, and Equity in Evaluation
Design, Implementation and Reporting
Evaluation design, implementation and reporting took into consideration UNICEF’s cross-cutting
programming priorities that included HRBA, gender equality and equity. These priority areas were
factored into the design and methods of the evaluation matrix, tools used for data collection, and
the analysis and reporting of the findings. This report also includes a special section on the findings
and results around HRBA, gender equality and equity, as well as related recommendations. Below
is a synopsis of how the evaluation for each priority area was completed:

is important to note that the respondent selection was primarily done
by NFSP and not the evaluators (the bifurcation of number of
respondents per category is given in Figure 13).

Equity: The evaluators faced limitations in inclusion of vulnerable groups in the evaluation
process. This is primarily because the Programme itself excluded children, PWDs, non-Saudis and
non-citizens from its target audience for the trainings. This in turn, has led to the lack of
representation of the vulnerable group in the evaluation sample and findings.
3.6 Compliance to UNEG and UNICEF’s Ethical Norms and Standards
The evaluation adhered to all applicable UNEG ethical norms and standards,70 and UNICEF
procedures on ethical standards71 as are prescribed in the relevant key guiding documents. The
description below outlines key aspects of each dimension (for a detailed description, refer to
Appendix 10-11):
• Integrity: The selection and deployment of the evaluation team was undertaken after
ascertaining that none of these members have an evident conflict of interest, nor has had
any role in the design and implementation of the Programme. Similarly, the team was both
guided and enabled to perform tasks without any influences.
• Accountability: The evaluation team has provided justifiable findings with consideration
to stakeholder judgements while ensuring the evaluators independence for transparent
and accountable reporting.

Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 18
• Credibility: The evaluation was conducted by AAN Associates. In the past decade, AAN
has conducted over 100 evaluations across 35 countries, working extensively with a range
of development partners including UN agencies. A competent and professional evaluation
team was deployed to work independently and impartially to implement this evaluation.
• Avoidance of Harm: Evaluation team took pre-emptive measures for any unforeseen
events in the field and responded accordingly. In light of COVID-19 restrictive measures,
the evaluation team virtually conducted the evaluation field work.
• Privacy of Participants: The participants were informed of who will have access to their
private data, and that an authorised team member will remove all identifying information.
All the data was saved in a separate folder which was end-to-end encrypted and accessed
by only the core evaluation team.

3.8 Evaluation Management
This section covers the evaluation management arrangements, evaluation team and functions,
implementation phases and deliverables under each evaluation phase.
3.8.1 Evaluation Management and Oversight – ESC’s Role
The evaluation involved multi-layered oversight and management system that included UNICEF
Regional Office and UNICEF GAO. An ESC was formed with representation from governmental,
non-governmental and UNICEF staff.72 Moreover, a Multi-Country Evaluation Specialist based in
UNICEF Djibouti served as the Evaluation Manager. The Evaluation Manager and UNICEF GAO
in general remained the main focal point for interaction with NFSP during this evaluation.
3.8.2 Evaluation Team and Roles
AAN Associates was the primary contractor and designed, planned and implemented the national
evaluation. The evaluation team was comprised of two local training experts who led the field data
collection. A core team of international experts provided the technical support for data collection,

Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 19
triangulation, analysis and report writing. The team had adequate representation of female team
members (please refer to Appendix 12 for team composition and roles).
3.8.3 Evaluation Implementation Phases and Deliverables
The evaluation was implemented from November 2020 to October 2021. Implementation faced
some delays owing to the lag in programme implementation (the training roll out was delayed at
the NFSP’s end). The evaluation was implemented with a participatory approach engaging all
relevant stakeholders through ERC. The evaluation followed a phased approach with five key
phases i.e., pre-inception, inception, fieldwork, data processing and analysis, and reporting and
dissemination. Each phase had a series of activities/tasks (implemented both concurrently and
sequentially) and associated deliverables as indicated in Figure 9. The evaluation followed an
evolving work plan appended as Appendix 24.

CHAPTER 4
Evaluation Findings,
Analysis and Preliminary
Conclusions
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 21
This chapter presents the evaluation findings, analysis and preliminary conclusions. The
description includes key findings for each sub-questions under each criterion. The findings are
drawn from both primary and secondary data sources. Preliminary conclusions for each question
are placed at the end of each sub section.
4.1 Relevance
EQ1 – TO WHAT EXTENT DVPP ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND
PRIORITIZATION OF CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT IS ALIGNED TO THE NATIONAL
PRIORITIES OF THE GOKSA?
The relevance criterion has one key evaluation question with two sub-questions. For evident
overlaps between the sub-questions and the findings, the evaluators have opted to merge the
findings for both sub-questions. The description ends with preliminary conclusions.
EQ1.1 - Are domestic violence and child abuse priority protection issues in KSA (for
communities and for the government) and does DVPP address the underlying causes?
EQ1.2 - To what extent do DVPP supported capacity building interventions (of public sector
and civil society actors) align with national priorities (the Saudi government’s) to end
domestic violence and child abuse in KSA?
The findings are structured in three parts:
i) Situation Analysis of DV and CA in KSA;
ii) Overview of DVPP Strategies Addressing Underlying Causes of DV and CA;
iii) Public Policy Prioritisation of DV and CA for GoKSA.
4.1.1 Situation Analysis of DV and CA in KSA
This section looks at the prevalence of DV and CA. It lays out findings around types, causes,
implications and groups at greater risk, for both DV and CA. The findings are drawn primarily from
the secondary data. The readers may take note that there is limited secondary data available,
particular with respect to reliability and availability of recent data. The findings are given below:

• The literature suggests that women and girls Figure 15 Status of Women at Risk (2018)
are subjected to DV. Those at greater risk
include younger women, financially
dependent women, women married to
illiterate/less educated men, women with
husbands having aggressive/abusive
behaviour, women in low-income families.75
• Reportedly, DV negatively affects women’s
mental, physical and reproductive health.
Violence also negatively impacts the well-
being of children. Figure 15 shows the
relationship between marital status and risk of
facing violence.76
• Key stakeholders interviewed as part of the
evaluation referred to the prevalence of DV
and its varied forms. The stakeholders referred to women being the primary victims and
perpetrators being male family members. Moreover, they referred to general apathy or
wider acceptability of DV in the communities.

Box 4: Preliminary Conclusions: Relevance
• RELEVANCE 1: The DVPP is concluded to be relevant on multiple counts. It is relevant
because the two social problems that it aims to addresses are widespread and have serious
consequences for both women and children. Initiation of a NFSP-led pilot Programme is a clear
reflection of prioritisation of the issue. A series of national development plans including sectoral
plans (Saudi Vision 2030, Saudi Child Rights Policy, Protection against Abuse) acknowledge
the existence of the problem and prioritise addressing these social problems, which also reflect
the issues are public policy priorities.
• RELEVANCE 2: The determinants are varied. Underlying reasons for DV include: use of
alcohol, spousal unemployment, accepting attitudes towards violence, early marriages, low level
of education (in husbands) and gender inequalities. Underlying reasons for CA include: parental
unemployment, large family size, divorced/single/step-parent households, cultural and societal
attitudes towards CA, low education level (in parents), poverty, substance abuse and disability
in children.
• RELEVANCE 3: The Programme strategies are relevant for addressing the behavioural causes
of CA and DV, including general acceptability of DV and CA and poor parenting/spousal support
(leading to neglect). The Programme is engaging with and building capacities of the public and
CSO; using a widespread network of community/extension workers to reach out to community
members; and educating and raising awareness of community members on their entitlements
and the recourses available to them. However, the Programme design does not address
legislative, policy and socioeconomic causes of DV and CA.
• RELEVANCE 4: The DVPP is partially aligned (in terms of objectives and strategies) with the
Government of KSA’s development and sectoral plans. The Programme’s objectives are aligned
with Saudi Vision 2030, Regulation on Protection against Abuse (2012) and Child Protection
Law (2014). The strategies are, however, partially aligned mainly due to the fact that there is
limited focus to improve the reporting of DV and CA cases. The legal landscape offers limited
focus on DV compared to CA.
4.2 Effectiveness
As outlined above, the absence of key Programme documents—proposal, results framework
(including indicators), work plan and budget—affected the measurement of effectiveness and
prevented the use of a conventional evaluation framework in which planned and achieved results
are compared. Keeping in view the formative nature of the evaluation, the assessment of
effectiveness has been undertaken using the successful implementation of Programme
strategies/components (including contribution to intended results).
EQ2 - TO WHAT EXTENT HAS THE PILOT ROLL OUT OF DVPP ACHIEVED THE INTENDED
OUTCOMES (INCLUDING ANY UNINTENDED OUTCOMES), AND THE TRAINING CONTENTS
ARE CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL NEEDS AND CONTEXT, AND NATIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS?
The effectiveness criterion has two evaluation questions, where each has one sub-question.
EQ2.1 - To what extent DVPPs pilot rollout has been Figure 16 Framework for DVPP
successful in achieving the intended and unintended
outcomes?
Keeping in view evaluation expectations, the evaluation team
applied the following framework (refer to Figure 16) comprising
three elements including: i) multi-stakeholder partnerships; ii)
training and capacity development of partners; and iii)
community education and awareness. The analysis is followed
by a list of enabling and disabling factors that have affected
Programme implementation.
Find below key findings for the three components.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 26
4.2.1 Multi-stakeholder Partnerships
This section presents findings around the partnerships that NFSP formed with public sector entities
and CSOs to leverage the outreach and train/equip their staff to engage with target communities.
Find below key findings around partnerships formed and managed so far.
• NFSP planned to engage with 10 other partners for the implementation of the pilot phase.
The Programme has managed to partner with seven entities84 ranging from public agencies
to CSOs that offer a wide outreach to target communities. Each partner has appointed a
focal point for oversight of activities assigned to the partners, including training of field level
staff (range of different staff available for these entities) and coordination and reporting to
the NFSP.
• NFSP has engaged with the partners by signing agreements with the Master Trainers and
focal persons (nominated for each partner to undertake coordination of delivery of
trainings). As these agreements are at the individual level, there are no guidelines on the
roles and responsibilities (for both NFSP and partner organisations) to effectively carry out
the planned activities.
• The IPs are expected to implement the cascade training model for all eight modules
(analysis on the training content in the subsequent section). Some of the IPs who were
interviewed showed little interest in delivering trainings on modules that were not related
to their organization/agency’s mandate or scope of work.
• Limited communication between IPs and NFSP was recorded as a challenge that the IPs
faced during Programme implementation. For example, many focal points were unsure of
who to reach out to in order to share the Master Trainers’ contract agreements or quarterly
reports.
• Discussions with public extension workers indicate that they are partly aware of their roles
and responsibilities. Master Trainers were aware that they need to train 100 Awareness
Specialists on eight modules. However, Awareness Specialists who were interviewed were
unclear about the number of training modules they need to deliver and the number of
attendees that must be trained. Some public extension workers expressed their
dissatisfaction with the lack of incentives (due to the additional workload). It was also noted
that some of the Awareness Specialists have decided to withdraw from the Programme
owing to the lack of motivation/incentive.85
4.2.2 Training and Capacity Development
For ease of understanding, the evaluators have divided the findings into three parts, as mentioned
below:
• Training Content Analysis
• Consistency with National and International Standards
• Training Delivery
Training Content Analysis
NFSP primarily developed the training modules. The training package comprises eight modules
on the following topics: 1) Child neglect; 2) Shaken baby syndrome; 3) Peer violence in school; 4)
First 1000 days; 5) Parental treatment of children; 6) Violence against the elderly; 7) Violence
against women; and 8) Sexual violence against children.
The evaluators assessed the training content at two levels: pedagogical and technical. The two
assessments have been undertaken separately and a detailed analysis for each is annexed as
Appendix 13-21.
84 Implementing partners includes Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social
Development, the Ministry of Media, Al-Mawaddah Institute, Al-Waqar Institute and Princess Noura Bint Abdulrahman
University.
85 Some trainers expressed their personal preference to have any form of incentive. Evaluators do not have access to exact
number of Awareness Specialists that withdrew from the Programme.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 27
Pedagogical analysis: The training contents have been assessed using the model developed by
Donald L. Kirkpatrick “Evaluating Training Programmes”. The training contents are assessed
against the following levels: Reaction, Learning, Behaviour, Results. To avoid any redundancies
or repetitions, assessment for pedagogical category on all eight training packages have been
merged as one commentary in Table 11.
Technical analysis: The evaluators have conducted an analysis of each training package
separately. The technical analysis assesses each module’s structure, local specificities, problem
identification, legal framework and content’s comprehensiveness.

Consistency with National and International Standards
The consistency assessment of training modules with national and international standards is given
below. The reader is advised to refer to Appendix 22 for a detailed analysis.
• Consistency with national standards: The national standards include Saudi Vision 2030,
National Transformation Programme 2016-2020, Saudi Child Protection Law of 2014, and
Regulation on Protection against Abuse (2012). Details on the Programme’s alignment
with national standards are given under section 1.1.3.
• Consistency with international standards: The international standards and conventions
include the Convention on the Rights of Child (CRC), Sustainable Development Goals
Agenda 2030 (SDGs), and UNICEF’s INSPIRE Framework. All DVPP’s eight modules are
consistent with international standards.
Training Delivery
• The Programme uses a cascade training approach to deliver the trainings. This meant that
NFSP trains the identified Master Trainers
from each partner who is expected to train “The trainer was professional, capable and had a
great way of training. Its information is integrated, and

sessions of 25 participants each. These Source: Focus Group Discussions
extension workers organise multiple
awareness sessions to train 200 people.
• At the time of the evaluation, the Programme has virtually trained 683 participants (266
Master Trainers, 230 Awareness Specialists, 10 focal persons and 177 community
members). The evaluators did not receive information on the number of sessions and
duration of each session.
• Discussions with training participants indicate that the trainers were capable and had
strong communication skills. The trainers were also praised for their ability to explain
modules and relate the content to attendees’ daily life experiences. However, some of the
trainees shared that the training sessions were not interactive and followed a lecture-like
format.
• Respondents shared their satisfaction with the redirection to online trainings. For instance,
community members favourably assessed online training, stating that it allowed more
attendees to participate in the training (who would have otherwise been unable to attend
because of commute or personal commitments).
• Discussion with community members revealed their positive assessment of the training
sessions they had attended. According to the respondents, trainings were well structured;
content was simple to grasp and understand; and language and examples used closely

Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 29
resembled their needs. However, they expressed their reservation on the duration of the
sessions citing inability to grasp information in the allocated time.
4.2.3 Community Education and Awareness:
The evaluators were unable to conduct the planned number of FGDs with community members
(only two were implemented) due to delays in roll out of community sessions. The evaluation team
was unable to confirm the number of sessions delivered by NFSP.
• Discussions with community members indicate

• Community members shared that the
common drivers of DV and CA include inherited violent beliefs, cultural understandings of
gender roles, exposure to violent media content, prevailing cultural norms, psychological
disorders and poor communication within families.
• FGD participants expressed their satisfaction

trainings will help in creating a platform and
generating a conversation on DV and CA. Some of the respondents shared that
identification of reporting mechanisms and available resources in training content would
have helped the participants (or people they know) to report violent incidents to relevant
authorities.
4.2.4 Enabling and Disabling Factors
Table 13 lists the enabling and disabling factors that either facilitated the delivery of the Programme
or hindered its delivery.
Table 13 DVPP Enabling and Disabling Factors
Enabling Factors
Factor Implications on Programme implementation
Established reputation NFSP’s long-standing reputation as a pioneer in Saudi society in
and in-house capacities of addressing DV and CA has given the DVPP much-needed
NFSP to lead such an legitimacy to execute a programme that focuses on a sensitive
intervention topic. Additionally, the NFSP’s ownership facilitated establishing
partnerships with public entities and CSOs to design and deliver
the Programme.
Training contents being DVPP stands out given the comprehensive design of the training
useful to the communities modules that address the needs of all age groups and genders
(from early childhood to elderly). In addition, the modules
emphasize providing real-life skills and tips rather than merely
focusing on intellectual development.
Partnerships enabling The Programme has strengthened partnerships with appropriate
wider outreach to target partners that have wide outreach to target audiences. The
communities at minimal availability of existing human and technical resources within
costs selected partners enabled the Programme to save costs and use
their expertise to implement activities.
Disabling factors
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 30
Absence of key The absence of essential documents (workplan, targets and
programme documents - budget) has caused confusion on different levels of implementation
targets, work plan and in terms of number of modules to be included in one session;
budget targets (for number of trainees); and selection and eligibility criteria
for the trainers. With no workplan, IPs could not be held
accountable for not delivering trainings on time which may have
contributed to overall delay in implementing the pilot phase.
Mismatch in expectations / Due to lack of legal agreement (in the form of an MoU) with IPs,
roles between NFSP and Programme implementation lacks consistency and accountability.
partners – for non- Discussions with stakeholders suggest there is a discrepancy in
documentation or expectations from NFSP and IPs which may stem from lack of
formalization of understanding around roles and responsibilities. There is limited to
partnerships no communication between NFSP and IPs.
No incentives for IP staff The lack of incentives and rewards was identified as a demotivating
to participate in the factor for trainers. Several stakeholders shared that the retention
Programme rate is low88 amongst Awareness Specialists (this claim was not
validated as the evaluators did not receive any secondary
information on the retention rate). Several respondents were not
motivated enough to implement additional tasks without any
monetary or significant non-monetary benefits.
Unintended Results
The secondary and primary data do not indicate any unintended results.
EQ3 - WHAT DESIGN AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO SCALE-UP
DVPP TO THE NATIONAL LEVEL, INCLUDING A MONITORING SYSTEM (TO TRACK
ACHIEVEMENT OF RESULTS)?
This section consolidates different design and operational deficiencies, either shared by the
stakeholders or noted by the evaluators. The description below lists the gaps identified while the
solutions are outlined as recommendations in the following chapter.
EQ3.1 - What improvements (design and operational) are needed for DVPP to upscale to the
national level?
For ease of the reader, the design and operational gaps have been structured into three categories
including:
1. Training content and delivery
2. Programme’s monitoring system
3. Assessment of institutional capacity needs (of existing and additional stakeholders)
4.3.1 Gaps in Training Content and Delivery
The summary of the gaps in content design and training delivery are presented below, however, a
detailed analysis on the gaps (based on pedagogical and technical analysis) for each module are
discussed under the section on Effectiveness (EQ2.1). A rigorous analysis (including gaps) can be
found in Annex 13-21.
• Lack of separate goals and objectives is hindering the identification of learning goals for
each module.
• Modules are not properly referenced which may breach intellectual property rights.
Additionally, the data referenced are outdated, for instance the literature presented in the
module on sexual violence against children is twenty years old, hence the modules are
missing recent information around the issues of DV and CA.
88 The evaluators do not have access to the exact figure of the Awareness Specialist retention rate.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 31
• Trainer notes are not structured under one
“I have a note on the presentations of the training
section. The current format requires the reader
that does not attract the audience. It was designed
to go back and forth to understand the in a very ordinary way. I hoped that the
guidance notes. presentation would be more attractive.”
• References made to the section on “legal “The slides were not clear and there was nothing

frameworks” in the modules are not tailored
Source: Focus Group Discussions
according to the specific topic (e.g., bullying,
violence against women, violence against children, etc) resulting in lack of understanding
around implications of the relevant laws for each module/topic.
• All eight modules do not focus on PWDs, who are at-risk members of the community.
• Most of the modules fail to include preventive measures for potential victims of DV and CA,
and how to protect and/or treat them in case of violence.
• Time allocated for the delivery was noted as insufficient to conduct all activities/exercises
included in the modules. This resulted in virtual trainings being non-interactive and lecture
based.
• Training delivery is not audience centric as the content is not tailored according to the
educational level of participants (i.e., Master Trainers/Awareness Specialists and
community members), in terms of lecture formats, structures, pre- and post- tests,89
learning activities, etc.
4.3.2 Gaps in Programme Monitoring System
• The Programme lacks a structured monitoring system and mostly relies on a self-reporting
mechanism by IPs which is not currently being implemented and/or utilized by trainers and
the community.
• The evaluation tools developed to gauge knowledge after the training session are designed
in a generic format (i.e., pre- and post- tests are in true/false format). Furthermore, tools
do not include guidelines or instructions for the trainers to administer them.
• The Programme lacks a feedback mechanism to enable participants to register their
complaints/feedback for potential course correction.
4.3.3 Assessment of Institutional Capacity Needs
• The Programme has selected IPs who are responsible for delivery of all modules. Some
of the IPs who were interviewed showed little interest in delivering trainings on modules
that were not related to their organization/agency’s mandate or scope of work.
• The Programme is being implemented without a workplan. Additionally, IPs (especially
government partners) had conflicting priorities and some of them were unable to deliver
trainings leading to delays in implementation.
• Lack of clarity on roles and responsibilities has created confusion among the IPs. Trainers
were unsure about the number of sessions they are required to administer trainings (for
each module), number of hours for each module, and number of trainees to include in one
session.
89 The evaluators did not observe the implementation of pre-and-post tests in the field. The reference here is based on content
analysis (singular template of pre-and-post questions in the training kit) that is used across different implementation levels
(Master Trainers, Awareness Specialists and community level).
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 32
Box 5: Preliminary Conclusions: Effectiveness
• EFFECTIVENESS 1: The assessment of the Programme’s effectiveness remained incomplete
and inconclusive due to absence of key documentation (including log frame, proposal, budget,
workplan). Keeping in view the evaluation expectations, a three-pillar effectiveness framework
was applied including) multi-stakeholder partnerships; ii) training and capacity development of
partners; and iii) community education and awareness.
• EFFECTIVENESS 2: The Programme is assessed as “partly effective” for engaging with different
public and CSO partners that had outreach and capacity to be part of the community education
and awareness drive. There are evident gaps around formalization and
coordination/management of partnerships.
• EFFECTIVENESS 3: The training and capacity development component is concluded to be
“partly effective” for multiple reasons. These include successful development of a comprehensive
training manual/package by NFSP (with eight modules); applying a cascade training model (by
training cadre of Master Trainers and Awareness Specialists) who would in turn run the
community sessions; and training contents largely being consistent with national and
international norms and standards. There are gaps such as training content deficiencies around
inclusion of reporting mechanisms for victims; insufficient training delivery time and
internalization of training; absence of in-house training rollout plans amongst partners and others.
These deficiencies have compromised the effectiveness of the component.
• EFFECTIVENESS 4: The evaluators administered only two FGDs with community members as
part of the evaluation, hence the community awareness component is not assessed. Feedback
from community sessions indicate that communities are appreciative of the initiative and are
hopeful for the trainings to change public perception on DV and CA (in due time).
• EFFECTIVENESS 5: A range of issues enabled and disabled implementation. Key enabling
factors are: the NFSP leading this intervention, training content useful to communities and high-
risk populations, enabling partnerships with minimal costs. The most significant disabling factors
included lack of clarity on roles and expectations between NFSP and partners and no/limited
incentives to staff.
• EFFECTIVENESS 6: Gaps identified in training content and delivery include: lack of separate
goals and objectives, improper citation, exclusion of PWDs in modules and insufficient delivery
time. Gaps in monitoring systems included reliance on self-reporting and lack of instructions on
use of evaluation tools. Institutional capacity assessment indicates that the lack of a workplan
and unclear roles and responsibilities have caused gaps in implementation. Areas of
improvements are identified in the Recommendation section (Chapter 5).

RESOURCES AND PARTNERSHIPS) TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM COST EFFICIENCY, AND
CONSIDER/IDENTIFY PLAUSIBLE ALTERNATIVES FOR IMPROVED EFFICACY?
The efficiency criterion has one evaluation question with two sub-questions. The efficiency analysis
remains incomplete due to absence of key Programme documents such as budget, expenditure
statements, and targets and performance reports. The evaluators used the primary data to conduct
a basic efficiency analysis.
EQ4.1 Did DVPP use the resources (time, funds and human resources) to achieve maximum
cost efficiencies?
The evaluators have conducted a basic efficiency analysis in terms of time, financial and human
resources based on extended interaction with NFSP and other stakeholders.
4.4.1 Time-Adequacy
• NFSP had planned to roll out the pilot (in two locations) in a year. The time is deemed
reasonable as it involved the cascade training approach and partners had the infrastructure
and commitment to roll out the trainings across two locations.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 33
• Based on discussions with stakeholders, the evaluation team identified that the
Programme was initially planned to roll out in 2020. This was delayed by a year because
of COVID-19 related restrictions (in 2020).
• Programme implementation is behind

component. To the evaluation team, this
could be attributed to planning and documentation gaps in terms of the workplan (between
NFSP and IPs) and not to the timeline being inadequate.
• From the discussions with stakeholders, multiple factors contributed to the delays. The
initiation did not go as planned as a result of delays in receipt of nominations (from IPs);
signed commitment letters from the IP-nominated prospective Master Trainers; and
delayed delivery of training kits. The observance of rituals such as fasting during Ramadan
and Hajj, and regular summer breaks (for public sector workers who tie their annual leaves
with the summer months) further delayed the implementation.
• Key achievements of the pilot include the remotely managed training of Master Trainers by
the NFSP in which 266 Master Trainers have been trained. The shift to remote training
helped in training more people in one session (despite reservations on the quality of
delivery).
4.4.2 Financial Resources
• There is no budget or expenditure document

sessions.
• The partners shared that they did not require any additional funds for planned activities,
nor did NFSP have plans to fund any activity. Moreover, they shared that they had
adequate manpower and allied resources for them to organize community sessions.
• While the originally envisaged in-person (face to face) trainings required additional costs
(venue, logistics and refreshments), the shift to online training removed the need for
anticipated resources. However, moving forward (with limited to no COIVD-19 related
restrictions) the IPs are expected to bear the logistical and transportation costs of
conducting in-person trainings.

quality perspective, engaging existing staff compromised the quality of human resources

where most of the trainers do not bring an adequate training background and/or
professional exposure to the eight modules covered in the training package.
• There are evident gaps around selection criteria of Master Trainers and Awareness
Specialists which affected their ability to understand and disseminate messages to
communities with full command. Their participation is voluntary with no financial incentive.
The only incentive is for the Master Trainers who receive a certificate of participation from
the NFSP. This is likely to affect the continued interest, commitment and participation of
the trainers.
EQ4.2. – Did DVPP consider/identify plausible alternatives (approaches and interventions)
to achieve improved efficacy?
The readers may note that the intervention has been rolled out as a pilot, with considered focus
on learning and adaptation. The following section is primarily driven by the motivation to identify
alternatives that may help improve efficiency.
The evaluators note that the Programme’s inter-

media campaigns and community leaders to broaden Source: Focus Group Discussions
the outreach. This gap was also highlighted by
implementing partners and trainers. The evaluators have therefore outlined two country case
studies (Box 6), where engagement with influencers and use of mass media (including social
media) facilitated wider outreach to the target audience. NFSP may need to consider these aspects
for future implementation (expanded further in the recommendations).
Box 6: Regional and Global Case Studies on the Use of Media and Local Influencers
Regional Case Study
Egypt presents a solid example of a recent regional intervention that was cost effective and used time efficiently
to address CA. In 2019, a national campaign to end violence against children was launched. The campaign
was led by the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood in partnership with the Egyptian Ministry of
Education and Technical Education and UNICEF Egypt. The campaign used social media, particularly
Facebook, to publish videos, posts and a #hashtag that was aligned with the campaign’s slogan Calm Not
Harm (with a hashtag #CalmNotHarm). The campaign was successful in spurring participation of social media
users who joined the campaign by sharing videos and using the official hashtag of the campaign. The campaign
ran for six weeks on broadcasted channels. Additionally, three Public Service Announcements were made that
called for action. On ground, the campaign disseminated publications at youth centres, megastores, and fitness
clubs.90
Global Case Study
Another example of a cost effective and efficiently run project was in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
From 2015 to 2018, an initiative, led by a faith-based charity called Tearfund and a hospital called HEAL Africa,
trained faith leaders (Muslims and Christians) to share messages on gender equality and non-violence in their
sermons, prayer and youth groups. The initiative involved males and females to transform understandings of
masculinity, address stigma and improve the support for survivors within communities. As such, religious
leaders addressed the root causes of violence that stem from gender inequality and harmful social norms. The
initiative also trained 15 men and 15 women to be Gender Champions, with each carrying out community
dialogues for over six weeks, following a curriculum. According to Tearfund and HEAL Africa, along with their
partners, the initiative was deemed successful in reducing over 50 per cent of physical, emotional and sexual
abuse by an intimate partner between the baseline and end line.91

Box 7: Preliminary Conclusions: Efficiency
• EFFICIENCY 1: The efficiency analysis remains incomplete and inconclusive due to the
absence of key documents. Based on available information (drawn mostly from primary
sources), the approach of leveraging partnerships (using the staff and volunteers from IPs for
wider outreach) seems cost and time efficient. Programme implementation is running behind
schedule (despite considerable time given for the implementation of a pilot of this scale). The
key reasons for delay include: delayed nominations of Master Trainers and their commitment
letters, no clear plan and timeframe for IPs to roll out internal training and community sessions,
and observance of rituals and summer breaks. These delays have affected time efficiency of
the pilot roll out as it is unlikely that it will be completed in the envisaged one-year cycle. On
funds adequacy, the approach of using existing human resources undercuts the need for a
large amount of funds. In terms of human resources, adequate staff and volunteers are
available with the IPs. However, there are evident capability gaps (mostly in terms of the
training background of Master Trainers and Awareness Specialists), which are exacerbated
by limited incentives and motivation for staff and volunteers that are involved.
• EFFICIENCY 2: This pilot has so far been implemented with pre-defined approach with
modifications were deemed appropriate e.g., shift to remote training. From the successful
examples available, the implementers can consider the use of mass media (including social
media) and engagement with influencers (social and religious leaders) for wider outreach for
issues that are often branded as sensitive and not openly talked about in religiously and
socially conservative societies.
4.5 Gender Equality, Equity and the Human Rights Based Approach
To demonstrate a concerted focus on evaluating integration (in terms of the Programme’s design,
implementation and results) of cross cutting priorities (for UNICEF), a separate criterion has been
added that includes assessment of gender equality (including UN System-wide Action Plan),92
equity and HRBA.
EQ5 - TO WHAT EXTENT DID DVPP (DESIGN, CONTENT, IMPLEMENTATION,
ACHIEVEMENT OF RESULTS AND MONITORING) DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE WITH
GENDER EQUALITY, EQUITY AND HRBA PRINCIPLES AND APPROACHES?
The criterion has one key question with three sub-questions, one each for the three cross-cutting
priorities.
EQ5.1 – To what extent did DVPP integrate gender equality principles and approaches in
design (including training contents), implementation and monitoring and benefitted boys,
girls, men, women and older people?
Find below the key findings around integration of gender equality in design, implementation and
results levels. A light touch analysis of integration of UN-SWAP has also been incorporated.
4.5.1 Integration of Gender Equality in DVPP Design, Implementation and
Results
Programme Design:
• The Programme design has partly benefitted from the available secondary literature;
however, a dedicated gender assessment was not carried out to deepen understanding
around gender-specific determinants and consequences of DV and CA. Discussions with
stakeholders suggest that women and girls are at more risk to DV and CA (as victims).
• With the absence of results framework and budget, the evaluators are unable to assess
gender integration in Programme results and resources allocations.

The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 36
• NFSP has not given any guidelines to the partners on gender (either sex or age)
considerations as part of the selection criteria for Master Trainers and Awareness
Specialists. The selection is primarily driven by the candidate’s roles (in their respective
institutions) and competence.
• The training contents do include age and sex driven content and can be categorised as
gender sensitive. The women-specific module covers violence against women and the
module focusing on children includes: child neglect; shaken baby syndrome; peer violence
in school; mother and baby (First 1000 days of life); parental treatment; and sexual violence
against children. There is a separate module focusing on issues affecting the elderly
namely; violence against elderly. While the modules highlight underlying reasons behind
domestic violence against women, boys, girls and older people and suggest groups at
greater risk (discussed further in the equity section below), only limited modules offer
contents that outline gender-specific preventive and response measures. For instance, for
the bullying module, the differences between what girls and boys experience with respect
to bullying are inadequately reflected.
Implementation:
• NFSP did not provide any gender-specific

• As per the documentation received from NFSP, the Programme has trained a total of 683
participants. However, age or sex-based disaggregation of the trainees was not available.
UN-SWAP: The evaluators used the available programme information to assess if the design
incorporated gender equality principles as per UN-SWAP 2.0.93 There are 17 performance
indicators under six main-areas; result based management, oversight, accountability, human and
financial resources, capacity and knowledge communication and coherence. Of the 17
performance indicators, only three could be assessed due to the limited documentation available
(in terms of programme budget, log frame, etc.). Of the indicators, DVPP meets requirements of
one indicator and does not meet requirements for two indicators on gender equality (GE). Refer to
Appendix 23 for the evaluation team’s assessment on the Programme’s compliance with UN-
SWAP 2.0 indicators.
EQ5.2 – To what extent DVPP’s design and implementation appropriately assessed,
identified, and addressed the special needs of vulnerable groups?
For not having a clear guidance on the equity dimension from NFSP, evaluators have used
UNICEF’s definition94 of ‘equity’ for equity assessment. For UNICEF, equity means that all children

have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential without discrimination, bias or
favouritism. Find below the evaluation team’s assessment on of the Programme’s compliance with

contents are generally equity neutral when it comes to identification of preventive and
response measures available for vulnerable groups.
Implementation:
• NFSP did not provide any equity-specific implementation guidelines or standards to the
partners for the roll out of Master Trainers or Awareness Specialists (in terms of selection
of trainees or delivery mechanisms).
• Guidance on the required logistical arrangements for in-person trainings (including pens,
boards, paper, projector etc.) mentioned in the modules lacked special arrangements that
may be required for PWDs.
• Due to COVID-19 restrictions and the redirection to online trainings, the Programme’s
implementation may have resulted in exclusion of a segment of the population that lacks
access to internet and or technological resources to participate in online training.
Results:
The Programme results do not offer disaggregate results on equity parameters for evaluators to
offer any commentary on them.
EQ5.3 – To what extent the Programme (in both design and implementation) incorporated
the HRBA principles?
In this sub-section, the evaluators have assessed the Programme’s compliance with the human
rights-based approach (HRBA) principles. Key elements of HRBA95 include Participation,
Accountability, Non-Discrimination and Equality, Empowerment and Legality (often referred to as
PANEL).
4.5.3 Integration of HRBA in DVPP Design, Implementation and Results
Table 13 provides key findings and analysis on DVPP’s compliance with HRBA principles:

(CSOs). Evidence suggests that DVPP was designed after a wider national-
level consultative process among NFSP, relevant government ministries and
CSOs. This provided the platform for shared responsibility and participation in
Programme design and implementation. However, community-level
discussions suggest that elders and religious/social leaders were not included
in the Programme’s design or implementation which could have potentially
helped in obtaining community’s participation and ownership.
Accountability:97 Findings from fieldwork suggest that the Programme lacked consistency with
the accountability principle, whereby there is no formal feedback mechanism
for Master Trainers (and extension workers) to register their complaints or
feedback. Moreover, there are no clear instructions or guidelines prepared for
the Master Trainers that could potentially hold them accountable on the
delivery of the trainings (in terms of duration of training and workplan with
defined timelines on when to schedule trainings, etc.)
Non- The Programme is partially compliant with the principle of non-discrimination

the language barrier that have restricted inclusion of non-Arabic speakers/
non-citizens from benefiting the trainings. Additionally, the COVID-19
restrictions and the redirection to online trainings may have resulted in
exclusion of a segment of the population that did not have access to internet
and or technological resources to participate in online training.
Empowerment:99 The evaluators found that the Programme’s design and implementation
empowers rights bearers by increasing their knowledge through trainings on
their rights and what constitutes a violation to their rights in terms of DV and
CA. Discussions with community members (who have participated in trainings)
further reflected that awareness has increased amongst them.
Legality:100 The evaluators found that the Programme was consistent with international
human rights conventions such as CRC (1989). It is also aligned with the
national laws and frameworks including the Saudi Vision 2030, Child Rights
Policy and the Protection against Abuse.
97 Accountability: Duty-bearers are held accountable for failing to fulfil their obligations towards rights-holders. There should be
effective remedies in place when human rights breaches occur.
98 Non-discrimination and Equality: All individuals are entitled to their rights without discrimination of any kind. All types of
discrimination should be prohibited, prevented, and eliminated.
99 Empowerment: Everyone is entitled to claim and exercise their rights. Individuals and communities need to understand their
rights and participate in the development of policies which affect their lives.
100 Legality: Approaches should be in line with the legal rights set out in domestic and international laws.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 39
Box 8: Preliminary Conclusions: GE, Equity, and HRBA
• GENDER EQUALITY 1: The DVPP reflects partial integration of gender equality into design,
implementation and results. The design level integration is evident in terms of modules or
contents that are focused on married women, girls, boys and older people. The modules
highlight groups that are at greater risk based on age and sex. Despite not having clear
guidelines (from NFSP), the pool of Master Trainers and Awareness Specialists include a
significant number of females who are better placed to interact with women, boys and girls, in a
conservative environment. The shift to online trainings is enabling more women and girls to
attend sessions. The results tracking lacks gender integration.
• EQUITY 1: The equity integration is partly evident in terms of training contents highlighting
groups at higher risk (married women, women from low economic strata or low education level,
children from broken families or with single parents and others). The training content does not
generally address PWDs, non-citizens and others. Neither NFSP nor partners have clarity on
encouraging participation of groups at greater risk or those who are relatively more vulnerable.
• HRBA 1: The Programme is concluded to be largely consistent with the HRBA principles of: i)
Participation (by building partnerships with relevant actors); ii) Empowerment (community
members feel empowered to know their rights); and iii) Legality (for ensuring consistency with
local laws and child rights provisions and commitments enshrined in national and international
laws). The Programme is assessed partially compliant with i) Non-discrimination and equality
(the Programme’s implementation excludes non-Arabic speaking participants and people
without internet access) and ii) Accountability (lack of compliant/feedback mechanism and
guidelines for master trainers to deliver the trainings).

Conclusions, Lessons
Learned and
Recommendations
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 41
This chapter presents the evaluation conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations. The
conclusions are drawn from the findings and the preliminary conclusions as listed in Chapter 4.
Towards the end, the evaluation team’s recommendations are listed for the key stakeholders to
inform the future of the Programme.
5.1 Conclusions
Relevance: The Programme is concluded to be relevant in terms of the need for intervention due
to prevalence, magnitude, types, sensitivity, severity and seriousness of impact (for victims) of DV
and CA. The victims (women, older persons, boys and girls) are often unaware of rights and
recourses available to either prevent and/or respond effectively by leveraging the mechanisms
available. Given the fact the perpetrators are often male family members, the victims face stronger
social pressure to not seek support. The two issues are gaining greater recognition on public policy
agenda for the GoKSA. The Programme’s strategies are partially aligned with those of GoKSA’s
as outlined in the sectoral plans and policies such as Saudi Vision 2030, Saudi Child Rights Policy
and Protection against Abuse. This is mainly due to the fact that the training package offers limited
focus to improve the reporting of DV and CA cases.
Effectiveness: The assessment of effectiveness remains incomplete and inconclusive due to the
absence of key documents (results framework, work plans, progress reports). Keeping in view the
evaluation expectations, the evaluators applied a three-pillar framework (comprising
strategies/components i.e., partnerships, trainings and capacity development and community
education and awareness). The partnership strategy or component is found to be ‘Partly Effective’.
The selection of partners with wide outreach and availability of human resources has been
successful. However, there are evident gaps in engagement stemming from lack of formal
agreement or MoU. The training and capacity development component is assessed as ‘Partly
Effective’. The training package comprises eight modules and is implemented through a cascade
model (NFSP trains the Master Trainers who train the extension workers, who in turn organise
community sessions). Gaps in training contents and delivery were found around inclusion of
reporting mechanisms of victims; insufficient training delivery time; absence of in-house training
roll-out plans amongst partners. The community sensitisation component was not assessed due
to limited number of community sessions. Feedback from community members indicates wider
appreciation of the initiative (often considered sensitive) and need to educate and sensitize masses
around these issues.
Programme enablers include the NFSP being the appropriate entity to lead the intervention;
training contents being useful to communities including high-risk groups; and appropriate selection
of partners. The disablers include: absence of key Programme documents (logframe, workplan,
budget, reports, etc); non-formalisation of partnerships; no/limited incentives for IP staff.
Efficiency: The assessment of efficiency remains incomplete, hence inconclusive. The evaluators
noted that the allocated time of one year was adequate for the pilot rollout. The DVPP is behind
schedule for multiple planning and implementation reasons (the community component is yet to
rolled out by most IPs). The Programme is not cost-heavy for leveraging available human
resources of IPs. For human resource adequacy, the IPs have adequate number of staff and
volunteers. However, there are evident gaps in training background and professional exposure of
staff. The future intervention could benefit from leveraging mass media tools (TV, radio, social
media etc.) and messaging through key influencers (social and religious leaders), as experiences
around the world suggest greater benefits of such alternatives to inter-personal communication.
Gender Equality, Equity and HRBA:
Gender Equality: The Programme has partially integrated gender equality in its design,
implementation and results. The Programme’s content has highlighted at-risk groups based on
age and sex to include girls, boys, married women and older persons. Although the Programme
lacks guiding principles on gender integration, a significant number of females were seen as
trainers and facilitators who joined the Programme.
Equity: The equity integration is assessed as ‘partial’. Some integration is evident from its training
content that addressed at-risk groups including women from low education levels, married women,
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 42
children from broken families or with single parents. Key aspect that undermined equity integration
of the Programme is the lack of focus on PWDs, non-citizens, non-Saudi and others in the training
content.
HRBA: The Programme is largely consistent with the HRBA principles of a) Participation (by
building partnerships with relevant actors), b) empowerment (community members feel
empowered by knowing their rights), and c) legality (for ensuring consistency with local and
international laws). The Programme falls short in its compliance with non-discrimination and
equality (Programme’s implementation excludes non-Arabic speaking participants and people
without internet access), and accountability (lack of feedback mechanism and guidelines for master
trainers to deliver the trainings).
Conclusions
Keeping in view the evaluation expectations, the report offers an extensive assessment of training
contents (refer section 4.2.2 and in Appendices 13 – 21), hence meets Evaluation Objectives 1
and 2 (as listed in the evaluation TOR). The evaluation offers only limited information on influence
on community behaviours (Objective 3) for the fact that intervention implementation is seriously
delayed whereby the community component has not been rolled out at scale (refer section 4.2.3).
The evaluation met Objective 4, as it outlines both design and operational recommendations for
improved planning and implementation of the intervention.
As for the future, keeping in view the enormity of scale and consequences (for victims) the
evaluators conclude that the intervention is much needed for a context like KSA. Where the
intervention merits continuity, the evaluators underline the need for some design and operational
changes. The aspects around which a considered re-thinking is needed include partnership
formalisation and management; training content improvements and delivery improvisation;
engagement with and use of mass media and local influencers; and greater technical support from
partners such as UNICEF and others. Given the fact that only limited community sessions have
been rolled out, the evaluators are unable to comment on their utility and possible influence on
larger communal thinking and behavioural changes. The NFSP may need to keep in mind that the
problems are multi-faceted, hence would require parallel work around legislative, policy and
institutional reforms, besides the DVPP driven community centric behavioural interventions.
5.2 Lessons Learned
The evaluators have identified the following best practices and lessons learned from the
Programme design and implementation. These may help to shape the future planning and rollout
once the pilot phase ends.
▪ Formalization of NFSP-IP Engagement: The partnership approach remains at the core
of Programme delivery, driven by the motivation to leverage the nation-wide presence and
outreach of partners (through field staff and institutional presence) to engage them in the
community education programme. Where the identification of partners seems appropriate
(in terms of availability of staff and commitment to contribute), the implementation has so
far been hampered by gaps around engagement with and management of partners by
NFSP. There are ambiguities around roles and expectations, accountabilities,
coordination, planning and reporting. This could be attributed to lack of focus to formalize
the relationship at highest level via partnership agreements or contracts. The formalization
of engagement (through a carefully drafted MoU or agreement between NFSP and IPs)
may help address the gaps and may enable open communication, mutual accountability,
effective coordination and efficient delivery.
▪ Unrealistic or Ambitious Planning: The cascade training approach is deemed
appropriate, however the expectations to have each Master Trainer train 100 Awareness
Specialists, who are each, in turn, required to host sessions for 200 community members
seems ambitious (especially when they are asked to deliver this alongside routine tasks).
The limited planning within IPs (around in-house roll out) with no clear directions from
NFSP around the timeline has resulted in delayed implementation. IPs may need to work
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 43
together with NFSP to create mechanisms to set realistic targets and incentivize people
involved.
▪ Utilizing Technology to Deliver Training: The shift from in-person to remote training has
proven useful in terms of saving costs and time and enabling NFSP and IPs to train 683
participants (reported by NFSP) so far. The duration of the training and the limited
relevance of the training background (of Master Trainers and Extension Workers on
specialised health and nutrition issues) remains a concern and merits considered
rethinking around setting pre-qualifications and scope of training contents and
expectations.
5.3 Recommendations
Find below a series of recommendations and associated actions drawn from the evaluation
findings and conclusions. These have been refined further based on the feedback received from
UNICEF GAO and NFSP.
The recommendations have been framed using an over-arching recommendation (defining scope),
followed by a series of suggestive actions that fall under the domain. The description relates the
actions to the findings/preliminary conclusions (marked as PC), and at the same time each one is
tagged for in terms of the relevant stakeholder and on the priority order.101

I) Engage with technical agencies to seek assistance in training (in-house capacity
development in programme design) of NFSP staff and secure support of a
consultant/contractor to help draft the key documents;
II) With guidance from the consultant/contractor, the Programme should plan and
undertake research and assessments to deepen understanding of the problem, causes,
manifestations, vulnerable groups, intervention strategies and entry points. Use these
research and assessments to inform Programme design;
III) Identify key NFSP staff (including other partners if appropriate) to work closely with
the consultant/contractor (with demonstrated intent to build internal capacities) to develop
an essential package of documents (in a consultative manner) – proposal, TOC, results
framework, budget, work plan, M&E plan and others;
IV) Engage with existing and potential partners (IPs) and seek their inputs in the
development of TOC, results framework, budget and commitments to contribute financially
and/or materially;
V) The design of the future Programme must underpin the continuity of the existing
strategic model of partnerships, capacity development (of partners), and community
education and awareness. The community education component may need to integrate the
key influencers and use of social media for desired behavioural changes.

Revamp the training contents and delivery mechanisms. Continue using the cascade NFSP, UNICEF Short-to-
model, however develop separate training kits/products for Master Trainers, medium term
Awareness Specialists and community members. Lay added focus on integrating
cross-cutting elements i.e., gender equality, equity and human rights.
Please note that following recommendations may be read in tandem with series of
recommendations (on training contents) appended as Appendix 13-21. The recommended
actions include:
I) Engage with and seek technical assistance from agencies such as UNICEF, to
support review and improvisation of training contents together with NFSP staff. The review
should lay out training delivery strategy and should cover aspects such as duration, remote
vs in-person training, trainers’ pre-qualifications, pre-post assessments, etc. The
engagement with technical partners/consultants should encourage building in-house
capacities of NFSP in content development and training delivery;
II) NFSP, where appropriate, may produce (or tailor) IP specific training contents and
packages (as per the mandate, potential audiences, and training background of potential
Master Trainers and Awareness Specialists/extension workers). The future training
packages may need to be tailored for layers of participants - Master Trainers, Awareness
Specialists and community respondents;
III) Training design and delivery may continue to follow the cascade model. The IPs
may be encouraged to set criteria for selection of trainers. As and when COVID 19
restrictions are lifted, NFSP should encourage IPs to organize face to face trainings;
IV) The training contents should encourage Master Trainers/Awareness Specialists to
improvise training contents as per their own needs and profile of participants;
V) NFSP to conduct training sessions between the NFSP and the gender and human
rights expert to better understand the importance of adopting a gender, equity and HRBA
lens in the Programme design and implementation.

Program
Background
Regional background
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which forms the basis of UNICEF’s work,
establishes every child’s right to protection from all forms of violence. The 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development established in 2015 has reaffirmed a global commitment to protecting
children from all forms of violence and to the related goal of gender equality.
The Gulf Countries; the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and other Gulf countries including Bahrain,
Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE. These countries have some of the highest per capita income in the world,
but the 2014 global downturn in oil prices led to decreased national revenue.102 In some cases,
decreased national revenue in Gulf countries has led to decreased safety net programming for children
and their families while the Gulf countries attempt to diversify their economies through a variety of
initiatives.103 According to the GAO Country Programme (CP) 2019-2023, the issues that UNICEF can
best support these Gulf countries with include pervasive gender inequality, low levels of enrolment in
early child development (ECD) programs, adolescent mental health challenges and substance abuse
patterns and other more general child protection concerns.
While all of the aforementioned countries have child protection clauses in their constitutions. However,
the Committee on the Rights of the Child has noted that these protections fail to sufficiently address a
number of issues, including discrimination against children with disabilities, minority groups and
migrant children.104 The Committee on the Rights of the Child has also expressed concern about the
quality of services available for child victims of sexual abuse and regional child labour, particularly in
regards to female children working as domestic laborers. The Committee has also noted low levels of
public awareness of alternative forms of violence against children like cyber and in-person bullying.
As all five Gulf states are considering changes to their economic structure in an effort to become less
financially dependent upon oil revenues, they are also undertaking significant reform efforts to improve
their national child rights protection prevention and incident response systems.
UNICEF GAO
The UNICEF Gulf Area Office (UNICEF GAO) supports these efforts by providing Gulf countries with
research, technical and advocacy support. As noted in the CP, none of the Gulf countries have
sufficient data to effectively monitor country-level plans to improve child-related indicators. Data
collection and research has therefore become one of the areas in which UNICEF is providing
substantial support to Gulf countries. For example, a 2017 UNICEF assessment found that data was
unavailable for 68 per cent of child-related indicators in Saudi Arabia.105 UNICEF is also working
closely with its national partners to provide technical assistance to Gulf countries that will strengthen
the capacity of Governments, partners and counterparts to optimize existing child protection schemes.
UNICEF is simultaneously working to raise awareness of issues impacting children in the Gulf states
and to mobilize resources that will benefit children in the Gulf states.
UNICEF GAO supports the KSA and other Gulf countries with their goals of advancing the rights of
children under the framework of a sub-regional programme ending in 2023. This programme
emphasizes four priority areas: promoting early childhood development (ECD), strengthening child

protection systems, improving the collection and quality of data, and strengthening partnerships to
amplify results for children.
Saudi Arabia Background
The KSA is a country of 33.7 million people106, of whom approximately one third are migrant
workers.107 Like neighbouring countries, Saudi Arabia is in the midst of an ambitious economic
restructuring initiative intended to decrease the country’s dependence on oil production revenues. This
plan, titled Saudi Vision 2030, has also led the country to amplify its efforts to address educational and
protection challenges facing the country’s children. As part of the 2019-2023 CP, the KSA has
budgeted USD 800,000 to address ECD and child protection each, USD 600,000 to increase evidence
on issues facing children, USD 400,000 to forging partnerships for children and USD 150,000 to
programme effectiveness initiatives for the 2019-2023 period.108
In terms of ECD, pre-primary education is free, but not compulsory, for all citizens. Regionally, 1 in 5
children eligible for pre-primary school do not attend pre-primary school.109 There is also a need to
increase public awareness about the importance of nurturing care and early stimulation.110
The national response to domestic violence generally, and to child protection from violence and
neglect particularly, has been rapidly evolving in the KSA. The first child abuse and neglect case
reported in the KSA was in 1990, and these issues continued to be underreported throughout the
1990s; support for victims was largely provided by private citizens in an ad hoc manner during the
1990s, despite the KSA’s 1996 ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).111
The public began to more widely recognize child abuse and neglect as national issues in the 2000s.
The World Health Organization (WHO) described child abuse and neglect as a global, culturally
embedded problem in 2002, and in 2004 Saudi Arabia had a series of high-profile child fatalities that
made it into national media. These developments encouraged governmental and non-governmental
bodies to establish agencies focused on preventing child abuse. During this period the Ministry of
Social Affairs established the General Directorate for Social Protection. The General Directorate for
Social Protection runs 17 Social Protection Committees in various provinces that provide services to
all victims of domestic abuse, including children.112 Each province’s committee includes
representatives from the social affairs, justice, health and education directorates as well as other
related officials who provide both long and short-term response services, including counselling, home
visitation and rehabilitation for victims and perpetrators.113 The Human Rights Commission and the
National Society for Human Rights were also founded during this time period.
On November 2005, Royal Decree No. 11471 established the National Family Safety Program
(NFSP), a body that is administratively linked to the Ministry of National Guard (Health Affairs). The
NFSP’s three departments are Prevention and Research, Community Services, and Training
Operations. This semi-governmental body’s goal is to support policy and advocacy to end domestic
violence and child abuse and neglect. It does this through partnership, advocacy at both national and
community levels, providing services to those affected by violence and providing referral as necessary.
The Prevention and Research Department is focused on creating evidence-based training programs,
the Community Services Department includes a child helpline services as well as advocacy and
awareness raising activities, and the Training and Operations Department covers all staff training,
finance, IT, HR and strategic planning. The NFSP partners with public and private agencies as well as

international organizations to achieve these goals. The NFSP played a crucial role in the creation of a
national law to protect those affected by domestic violence.
The NFSP’s work currently consists of preparing policy and programmatic recommendations to end
domestic violence and abuse in Saudi Arabia, building partnerships between the various groups
working on these issues in Saudi Arabia in order to foster joint national action, raising awareness about
the dangers that domestic violence and child abuse pose as well as appropriate responses to these
issues
A number of significant changes have taken place in Saudi Arabia since 2005 in terms of responding
to domestic violence. Firstly, in 2008, the Saudi National Health Council (NHC) agreed to establishing
its own child protection teams (CPTs) in major hospitals across Saudi Arabia’s provinces.114
Healthcare providers refer any suspected cases to multidisciplinary CPTs that have received training
and supervision from the NFSP.115 If a case is confirmed, it is referred to one of the 17 Social Protection
Committees.116 In 2008, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Health also endorsed a mandatory reporting law
that required healthcare professionals to report child abuse and neglect cases to the National Family
Safety Registry (NFSR). This web-based system was instituted in order to gather information on the
prevalence of child abuse. The Child Helpline also falls under the auspices of the NFSP and is another
child protection resource.
The Family Affairs Council is another governmental body that collaborates with national and local
authorities to ensure better services for the family unit by increasing intra-governmental collaboration,
identifying challenges facing families, raising awareness about family members’ responsibilities in an
Islamic context, and facilitating some family services
According to NFSR findings thus far, in Saudi Arabia boys are more likely to experience physical
maltreatment and neglect than girls, while girls are more likely to experience sexual and emotional
maltreatment than their male counterparts.117 According to the upcoming prevention programme’s
manuals, a 2005 study found that 40-45% of perpetrators of child abuse in the Kingdom are relatives
of the child victim.
Programme Background
UNICEF GAO in KSA is working closely with the NFSP to support national efforts to strengthen the
capacity of educators, social workers, childcare providers, families and parents to advocate for
domestic violence prevention and more effectively respond to violations of child rights. The NFSP has
also played a crucial role in cultivating a national commitment to developing the upcoming National
Family Safety Program.
The NFSP’s Prevention and Research Department is in the process to design a prevention and
capacity building programme. The programme seeks to be an example of excellence in the field of
violence prevention. It aims to accomplish this by providing prevention and support programs,
spreading awareness based on scientific evidence and building professional partnerships with
specialists. These specialists will include governmental and non-governmental organizations as well
as international organizations working to ensure a safe family environment. The programme plans to
roll out through a training of trainers (ToT) process focused on preventing harm to children in Saudi
Arabia; the goal of the program is that trainers who have participated the NFSP training programme
will then go back to their own localities to train the public and put into practice the principles covered
in the training modules. This program aligns with Saudi Arabia's 2030 Vision because it is focused on
enhancing the quality of life as well as family and community security of individuals in Saudi Arabia.

The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 51
The prevention programme that is the subject of this evaluation is composed of a series of three days
courses. The programme, after an initial piloting phase, is intended to be rolled out nationwide. The
courses were initially designed to strengthen the capacity of social workers’ and educators to respond
to concerns in eight subject areas: bullying, neglect, child abuse, mental security, women
empowerment, elderly, the first 1000 days and shaken baby syndrome. Two additional components
—gaming and disability—have been added since the programme was designed because of emerging
national needs. The courses are planned to occur over either four consecutive weeks or over the
course of two-week periods twice per year.
Programme participants who will receive these courses will be primarily public educators and social
workers. The NFSP will be the central institute responsible for the training of trainers (TOT). The NFSP
will also be responsible for monitoring program activities at the sub-national level, certifying attendees
and maintaining high program quality standards.
A team from the NFSP designed the program manuals, which were finalized in March 2020. Experts
from various fields reviewed the scientific materials included in these manuals throughout 2019. The
manuals lay out three days of programming per module, with an estimated four hours of programming
per day. Each module therefore requires roughly 12 hours of instruction.
A pilot of this programme will take place either during the second half of 2020 or early in 2021. The
piloting period will last one year.
Theory of change
The general theory of change upon which child protection activities in Saudi Arabia are based
stipulates that if Saudi Arabia can accurately diagnose and document domestic abuse and violation of
child rights in the country, then Saudi Arabia will be better positioned to appropriately respond to these
issues. Saudi Arabia must then build legislative, institutional, and workforce capacity to prevent and
respond to domestic abuse and violations of child rights. If Saudi Arabia can deliver on all of these
goals, then the country will be well positioned to decrease the incidence of domestic violence and
abuse nationally.
This particular programme fits squarely into the capacity building area of this theory of change. If this
programme is successful in providing participant trainers with the skills and desire create behavior
change in the wider public on child protection topics, then these trainers will go on to change the
behavior of the wider public in a variety of child protection areas. The theory of change of this
programme in particular therefore relies on a few assumptions. The most notable of these include the
assumption that there is sufficient political and financial support to run this program at scale and that
the training modules will prompt behaviour change.
Purpose and Scope
Purpose
Given that the programme is at the early stages of being rolled out, evaluation activities will accompany
the roll out of the programme so that the evaluation can serve the purpose of improving the programme
and documenting its successes and challenges. In a second phase, the evaluation will contribute to
measuring the programme’s impact at scale once it is running nationally.
Objective:
The objective of this formative evaluation, which is the first of two evaluation phases for this
intervention, is to provide evidence on whether the programme’s training materials and operations are
working well. This formative evaluation will examine the content and operations of the pilot Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme as well as the pilot’s relevance, effectiveness and efficiency in order
to ensure that lessons from the pilot are captured and integrated into programme strategy before the
programme goes to scale. More specifically, the objectives of the first phase of the evaluation are to:
- Help the NFSP to understand how the package is affecting practices of child protection in practice.
- Provide suggestions on how to fine tune the package before being rolled out at scale across the
Kingdom.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 52
- Facilitate the measurement of programme impact by establishing a baseline and by providing
specific guidance on what data implementers should collect as part of programme measurement
and monitoring activities in order to facilitate a future impact evaluation.
The second phase of the evaluation will assist the NFSP to ensure that the impact of the programme
over time will be well documented. It will do this by analyzing the data collected throughout the
programme and using this data to measure the impact that the programme has in terms of its ultimate
goal of protecting vulnerable children.
Scope
Timeframe: Chronological scope of evaluation
Geographical scope: kis jaga, not only data collection scope – national level intervention -
chronolocial, geogratphical, thematic: what’s my thematic scope, 8 components
Thematic scope:
This initial evaluation is planned to occur in parallel with the pilot programme and will set the stage for
a subsequent programme evaluation that will occur after the programme is rolled out at a national
level.
The evaluation plans to take advantage of NFSP being involved at this early stage of the evaluation,
while the programme is still prepared to be rolled out. Discussions on how to best roll out and generate
data that will help the evaluation will improve the methodology.
While the prevention programme will eventually cover the entire country, the pilot programme will
target Riyadh and one rural area. The present evaluation will cover all areas in which the pilot
programme operates, and evaluators will also choose one or two other comparable locales to analyze
as a point of comparison. Given the diversity of geography in the Kingdom, the evaluation methodology
will allow for a means of gathering input from regions outside the capital. The process for doing this,
the tools to be used, and the approach will be developed under the guidance of UNICEF GAO and the
NFSP.
The pilot program will take place over the period of one year, beginning at the end of 2020. The
evaluation team will begin an evaluation three months after a complete round of trainings has been
completed as part of the pilot. The evaluation will examine both the training materials as well as the
operational aspects of the pilot to date.
Evaluability
As mentioned above there is a general theory of change for child protection in KSA and the intervention
is based on literature reviews, training packages and awareness campaign materials. The topical
literature reviews consist of global and regional data for each component, which will be useful in this
formative evaluation.
While there is no formal data from the programme since it has not yet begun, Government of the KSA
has undertaken a number of research studies in partnership with the WHO to determine the long-term
impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACE Study) and to determine the extent to which the
government is prepared to prevent these experience (Child Maltreatment Prevention Readiness
Study).118 From 2010 to 2012, the KSA also conducted research on The International Child Abuse
Screening Tools (ICAST) with UNICEF and the International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse
and Neglect (ISPCAN).119 Reports produced by the Government in partnership with UNICEF and other
research institutions, NFSR records, and CPT and Social Protection Committee records may provide
additional background data for this evaluation.
The evaluation will take advantage of the ability to discuss the rollout with NFSP and ensure that some
relevant data are generated during the rollout. With this approach monitoring data from the first rounds

of the pilot programme will be available to the evaluation team and will be an important data source
for this evaluation. This data will include post-training satisfaction surveys as well as follow-up surveys
with workshop participants XXX months after their initial training workshops.
Evaluation questions:
The key questions for this evaluation were formulated based on the OECD DAC criteria. The following
evaluation questions are not exhaustive and are expected to be further refined during the inception
phase, with a particular eye towards analyzing the programme’s integration of equity, human rights
and gender equality principles. Since this is a formative evaluation for a programme that has only been
initiated in the form of a pilot program, the other DAC criteria of long-term change and sustainability
did not seem appropriate at this stage.
The assessment will look at relevance, efficiency and effectiveness to determine how well positioned
the intervention is to achieve its goals and what improvements can be made before national rollout.
The evaluation aims to answer the following questions:
Relevance
• To what extent is the prevention programme addressing the most pressing needs of children
in Saudi Arabia?
• To what extent are the capacity building measures relevant to bridge the capacity gaps
identified in national strategies and priorities?
Efficiency
• To what extent did the pilot programme use resources in a way that allows for cost monitoring
and maximizes utility per dollar of investment?
• To what extent did the NFSP consider alternative methods of programme delivery and
successfully identify the most effective delivery method?
Effectiveness
• To what extent is the content of the capacity building workshops evidence-driven and
consistent with local, national, and global standards?
• To what extent were the goals set out for individual components of the pilot programme
achieved?
• Were there any unexpected results (positive and negative) in the pilot program?
• To what extent is the proposed national program likely of a size and approach that the NFSP
will be able to roll it out across the country?
• How could monitoring systems best track the impact of the capacity building interventions
(upcoming prevention program courses) in the short and long term?
Gender
• To what extent does the programme design, content and monitoring take gender into
consideration?
Stakeholders
The following stakeholders have been identified for this evaluation:
• UNICEF GAO
• Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development
• Ministry of National Guard (Health Affairs) and the NFSP
• Ministry of Education
• Related NGOs
• Commercial Human Development Training Institutes
• Child Protection Teams (CPTs) in hospitals

• Social Protection Committees
• National Health Council
• Family Affairs Council
Methodology
This section provides the preliminary direction of the methodology. The methodology is based on
UNEG norms and standards and refers to relevant UNEG and UNICEF guidance materials such as
the guidance on integrating human rights and gender into evaluation. It will be further elaborated
during the inception phase in the annexes of the inception report, which will include the research
instruments and evaluation matrix.
The Evaluation Team will apply a mixed methods approach that is as participatory as possible.
Information from the different lines of inquiry will be triangulated to improve the reliability of the findings
and to ensure that the recommendations are grounded in the reality. Documents to be reviewed will
include but are not limited to: government strategies and policy documents, UNICEF strategic
documents, reports produced by the Government in partnership with UNICEF and other research
institutions, NFSR records, available CPT and Social Protection Committee records, and pilot
programme monitoring data.
Key informants, especially from the government partners, implementing partners and UNICEF should
be interviewed to get a deeper understanding of the relevance of the intervention for the various
stakeholders. Focus groups might be conducted with implementing partners, UNICEF staff or with
beneficiaries as appropriate. Geospatial data, government surveys and other general country
information will be reviewed, but it is not foreseen that additional information at that level is generated.
The NFSP will discuss at the design phase of the evaluation which data can be realistically generated
to help evaluate the success of the programme, these might include training satisfaction
questionnaires, measures to see if the material is understood, and applied.
Most of the data to be analyzed for the evaluation is qualitative in nature. Analytical work will be
conducted through a desk review of the secondary data and complemented by key informant
interviews and focus group discussions. Special attention will be given to the disaggregation of data
by gender and other relevant groups, such as migrant workers. The methodology will ensure that the
numbers of men, women, boys and girls are sufficient to disaggregate findings by gender where
appropriate.
As a formative evaluation, the methodology will use qualitative methods to take stock of various
stakeholders’ perspectives on the planned intervention and its pilot. This evaluation is expected to
guide the NFSP as it seeks to improve its capacity building intervention to decrease domestic violence
in Saudi Arabia.
The evaluation team is expected to work with NFSP to identify two districts that are not involved in the
pilot programme. The evaluation team will do some preliminary data collection in these districts and
will use this data as a point of comparison to highlight any differences between districts that receive
and do not receive the programme’s capacity building intervention.
Based on the proposed purpose and scope of the evaluation described in this TOR, the selected
Evaluation Team is expected to submit an inception report that includes a detailed methodology. The
Inception Report’s methodological proposal will incorporate the following components:
• Desk review: In-depth document review of all relevant packages from capacity development
interventions, reviews, studies, M&E reports and other documents;
• Key Informants Interviews: Face-to-face interviews with participants of capacity building
interventions and programme/project staff, including programme managers;
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 55
• Cost-effectiveness analysis: A cost-effectiveness analysis through the collection of financial
data to calculate cost-effectiveness of capacity development interventions. This analysis will
include a discussion of comparative capacity building cases from other contexts.
• Guidance for future evaluation: A set of clear recommendations on how to collect data and
roll-out the intervention nationally in a manner that will facilitate a future impact evaluation or
rigorous evaluation of another type. Specifically, this guidance will provide detailed
recommendations for assessments that will be conducted pre and post capacity building
workshops.
The evaluation methodology will follow UNICEF guidelines on research and the ethical participation
of children. In addition, all participants in the study will be fully informed about the nature and purpose
of the evaluation and their requested involvement. Specific mechanisms for feeding back results of
the evaluation to stakeholders will be included in the methodology. All the documents, including data
collection, data entry and analysis tools, and all the data developed or collected for this evaluation are
the intellectual property of UNICEF. The evaluation manager will be responsible for assisting the
evaluation team with obtaining research ethics permission as necessary.
Limitations
There are several potential limitations to the evaluation. Firstly, robust baseline data to support the
evaluation process is not available; pre-/ post-activity assessments will be conducted to measure the
capacity development interventions outcomes, but this will be the only direct data resulting from the
intervention itself. Secondly, given the recent development of the intervention, it will be difficult to
assess effectiveness. Thirdly, the intervention is not in its final form, which means that the evaluation
team may need to examine multiple iterations of the intervention design.
Additionally, all relevant documents and course materials are in Arabic. The majority of national
officials prefer to speak Arabic in workshops, interviews or FGDs. The evaluation team will mitigate
language constraints by employing a national expert who will work with the international evaluator to
conduct the interviews, FGDs etc. This approach will save time that otherwise would have gone to
translation and interpretation.
Governance
The evaluation team will report to the Multi Country Evaluation Advisor, who will serve as the
Evaluation Manager. The Evaluation Manager will be responsible for facilitating the research
permissions process and supporting efforts to coordinate meetings in the data collection phase. The
Evaluation Manager will provide comments on the inception and draft reports.
The Evaluation Manager will also convene and select members for the Steering Committee. The
Steering Committee is a group of stakeholders that provides input and guidance during the evaluation
process. The Steering Committee will discuss and approve the terms of reference. The Steering
Committee will also endorse all evaluation deliverables, including the inception report, draft evaluation
report and final evaluation report. The Steering Committee will also provide feedback on preliminary
findings.
Any unforeseen events and challenges that the evaluation might face should be discussed in the
Steering Committee. Terms of reference of the Steering Committee will be shared and discussed by
the members.
The Executive Director of the NFSP and the Director of Prevention and Research will ensure that all
relevant documentation is available to the consultants. They will also support the arrangement of
meetings with relevant stakeholders, including partners.

• 50 percent on completion of all deliverable to the satisfaction of UNICEF
Location
The work will be home-based, and the consultants can work remotely except for the duration of the
fieldwork. The consultants must have at least one mission in Riyadh to conduct the FGDs, interviews
and fieldwork.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 58
Official Travel
All travel arrangements, including insurance and visas, will be managed and paid by the institution.
Therefore, expected travel costs must be included as a budget item in the financial proposal.
ICT considerations
The evaluation team will require access to some of the UNICEF internal databases and documents.
Ethical Considerations
The individual consultants and team working on this project must demonstrate personal and
professional integrity during the whole evaluation process. He/she/the team must respect the right of
institutions and individuals to provide information in confidence and ensure that sensitive data cannot
be traced to its source. Further, the team must respect research ethics while working with children,
including using age appropriate consent forms, age appropriate data collection, and principle of do no
harm. The team and its members must take care that those involved in the evaluation have an
opportunity to examine the statements attributed to them. The evaluation process and consultants
must be sensitive to beliefs, manners, and customs of the social and cultural environment in which
they will work. Especially, the consultants must be sensitive to and address issues of protection,
discrimination and gender inequality. Furthermore, the consultants are not expected to assess the
personal performance of individuals and must balance an assessment of management functions with
due consideration of this principle. Finally, if the consultants or team uncover evidence of wrongdoing,
such cases must be reported discreetly to the appropriate investigative body.
The Firm / Evaluation Team will not publish or disseminate the Evaluation Report, data collection tools,
collected data or any other documents produced from this assessment without the UNICEF’s express
permission and acknowledgement.
Evaluation Process of the Proposal
Given that the company has been preselected in the LTA process, proposals will be assessed based
on whether the CVs of the proposed team members match the evaluation ToR’s requirements as well
as the overall team’s availability and the price. Financial proposals will be weighted based on their
clarity and appropriateness.
All proposals should be sent to afalosaimi@unicef.org. A Bid Selection Committee will review all
applications as they arrive. All proposals must meet the minimum requirements described above, and
those unable to meet these requirements will not be considered.
Unsatisfactory Performance
In case of unsatisfactory performance, payment will be withheld until quality deliverables are
submitted. If the selected organization is unable to complete the assignment, the contract will be
terminated by notification letter sent 30 days prior to the termination date. In the meantime, UNICEF
will initiate another selection process to identify appropriate candidate.
Conditions and Administrative Issues
The contractor will work on their own computer(s) and use their own office resources and materials in
the execution of this assignment. They are expected to arrange for insurance coverage for any
eventuality throughout the entire duration of the consultancy. The contractor's fee shall therefore be
inclusive of all office administrative costs. However, all expenses incurred on local official travel will
be reimbursed upon invoice.
Granting access to UNICEF ICT resources for consultants/non-staff is considered an 'exception,' and
therefore shall only be granted upon authorization by the head of the office on justification/need basis.
This includes creation of a UNICEF email address, as well as access to ICT equipment such as laptops
and mobile devices.
All evaluation consultants must uphold the UNEG Code of Conduct for Evaluation in the United Nations
system. All persons engaged under a UNICEF service contract, either directly through an individual
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 59
contract, or indirectly through an institutional contract, shall be subject to the UN Supplier Code of
Conduct: https://www.ungm.org/Public/CodeOfConduct

APPENDIX 13 – PEDAGOGICAL ANALYSIS
Domestic Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP)
Training Content Analysis
Introduction
Testing newly produced training materials requires their evaluation against a set of criteria related
to the content, usefulness and overall quality. This Formative Evaluation of the “Domestic Violence
Prevention Programme” (DVPP) aims at providing feedback to implementers and users alike, while
focusing on possible areas for improvement of the training manuals, rather than a rejection or
acceptance. Additionally, this analysis will take the form of ‘Formative Assessment’. It will identify
potential and actual problems/ gaps and recommend possible solutions.
The analysis will be divided into two key categories: pedagogical and technical analysis. To avoid
any redundancies, the feedback for the pedagogical category for all eight training packages has
been integrated into one commentary. This category will entail different criteria and elements of
analysis, i.e.: a) Training Goals; b) Training Objectives; c) Training Methodologies; d) Referencing
and Bibliography; e) Evaluation Tools, and f) Trainer’s notes.
Inversely, the technical category of the assessment will be analyzed separately for each training
package. Analysis criteria for this category will include a) Course structure/plan; b) Local
Specificities; c) Problem Identification; d) Legal framework; and e) Content Comprehensiveness.
1. PEDAGOGICAL ANALYSIS
This category of the analysis draws upon the evaluation model developed by Donald L. Kirkpatrick
“Evaluating Training Programmes: The Four Levels”,120 since this model has been widely used
and accepted among scholars, practitioners and international organizations (including WHO).
Kirkpatrick’s four levels of evaluation:
• Level 1. Reaction: Immediate reaction of trainees and how satisfied are they.
• Level 2. Learning: To what degree do participants acquire the intended knowledge, skills
and attitudes (based on the learning objectives).
• Level 3. Behaviour: How trainees apply their new knowledge and skills when they are back
on the job.
• Level 4. Results: To what degree targeted outcomes occur as a result of the training and
its impact on the work progress.
1.1 Training’s Instructional Goal(s)
Is the overarching goal of the training clear? What changes are expected as a result of the
training?
Findings:
• Instructional goals have not been identified in any of the training packages. It is pivotal that
instructional goals be added to the training content of each course to ensure clear training focus
with regards to knowledge, skills and behaviours. Learning objectives are the way to acquire
the knowledge of knowing how to perform the needed skills, and probably also adopting certain
behaviours by the trainees.
• Additionally, clear goals will guide the evaluation team at later stages (Level:3) to find out
whether the community level trainee is putting the training goals into practice. In other words,
“Is the trainee using the knowledge, skills and behaviours gained during the training and how
are they changing his or her work performance?” Hence, it is of the essence to set an
instructional goal(s) for each of the training courses.
Recommendations:
Add clearly defined objective(s) to the beginning of the training content and ensure that objectives
are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound). It must state what
120 Based on the latest edition published in 2006.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 93
activity the trainee is expected to be able to carry out after completing the training. To ensure that
an evaluation could be undertaken, the training design should take into consideration elements
such as competencies, instructional goals and learning objectives. The evaluation process must
be based on a clear description of all those elements (e.g., a logical framework).
1.2 Learning Objectives
Are the learning objectives clearly defined? Are they achievable and realistic? Are they
aligned with the training goals? Do they provide learners with a clear purpose? Are they
too broad, too many or too complex?
Findings
Training objectives are not clearly defined, which makes it difficult to specify the learning outcomes
for different levels of trainers. Although there is an activity about participants’ expectations from
the training, which creates a great sense of engagement, there is still a need to have learning
objectives defined for each target audience. In other words, training objectives for training health
practitioners and teachers should be different from training objectives for the community (audience-
oriented). Clarity regarding expected changes facilitates the evaluation process (including
designing pre-and post-tests).
• Instructions for training of trainers (TOT) have not been provided and detailed session
plans are missing.
• There is no reference to conducting ‘mock’ sessions by trainers for practice purposes.
Recommendations
1. A learning objective is a precise and measurable statement of what specific things the
trainee should know or acquire during and after the training. The word “measurable” is
important because learning objectives are what will be tested in a level 2 evaluation
(Learning level). Objectives need to be clear, precise and realistic. One of the key basic
rules of defining learning objectives is that they must be action-oriented (e.g., explain,
define, describe, identify, analyse, etc.) and be actions that an instructor/evaluator could
see a learner perform. As explained above, these training objectives must be defined
based on the audience.
2. A detailed session plan with session objectives for each session may be provided in the
manual.
3. The TOT may include mock sessions by participants (trainers) for practice and feedback
on their training skills and subject knowledge for improvement.
1.3 Referencing and Bibliography
Acknowledgment and respect intellectual property rights. Have there been
acknowledgments of contributions from other writers? Are there accurate references to
allow readers to trace the sources of information used?
Findings
• It has been noticed that appropriate citation/referencing is missing across all training
packages (with very few exceptions). It is critical to address this, not only to avoid
intellectual copyright violations, but also because it helps participants access the resources
used, whenever needed. There have been some references made (annexed),
nonetheless, these are frequently inaccurate or too generic (i.e, using just a link for WHO
or MoJ or to a local institution, etc.).
• Examples (Ihsan Module: P.22 is quoted from WHO, risk factors section).
Recommendations
1. It is of the essence, to revise all training packages using proper citation and referencing
while making direct and accurate references to the information used. It should also be
reviewed against spelling mistakes (common).
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 94
1.4 Training Methodologies
Are there a variety of activities and training methods designed for different types of
learners/audiences? Do the materials allow opportunities for group work, problem-solving,
and peer evaluation, to make the training more active?
Findings
All training packages contain a wide range of training methods. There are six and sometimes seven
different learning activities (excluding pre-and post-tests) that include, discussions, case studies,
brainstorming, games and roleplays. Since the best way to engage learners and help them
remember and understand information is to make sure that they actively participate, one can say
that the training packages do fulfill this criterion.
Nevertheless, the following has been noticed:
• Training methodologies did not consider the target audience of these trainings. In other
words, lecture format and structure, training content, pre-and post-tests, learning activities,
and facilitator guides have to be designed based on the target audience. In the context of
DVPP, the training audience could be divided into three clusters:
o Master Trainers
o Awareness Specialists
o The public (whether they are adults or children, should also inform the training
methods)
• The number of activities used in a training should be proportionate to the training duration,
which is not necessarily the case in most of the training packages. Some training packages
(e.g., Bullying and Child Neglect) include three consecutive activities of 1.5 hours duration,
whereas the total training duration is only set for five hours.
• Most of the training activities are intended to be done individually. Although they could be
adapted to work for a group format, there are some activities such as the case studies and
program design activities that would be hard to adapt in a way that all trainees could
participate.
• One of the activities on “designing a prevention programme” (based on the training subject)
is the most important/critical part of the whole training. There is a reference to such a
lecture in the agenda used in the facilitator guides, but it doesn’t exist in the training
curriculum of all packages. Nonetheless, the training materials of all packages don't have
any sessions devoted to this.
• Some of the activities are based on showing a video. Nonetheless, the source/link of these
videos is not provided in the content.
• All of the training packages immediately begin the second day with a substantive activity.
However, it would be more beneficial to begin with a recap/summary of the 1st day of
training.
• Role-play activities include a limited number of thought-provoking questions to guide the
trainer on how to best run the discussion.
• Each activity is followed by a discussion session (adequately timed) to allow for reflection
on training outcomes.
• The training package recommends that trainers receive two days of training per package
(16 days in total). However, FGDs suggested that both Master Trainers and Awareness
Specialists have received only 3-4 hours of training in lecture format, as opposed to TOT.
As a result, none of the trainers have received adequate training on activities or the
facilitator’s guide.
• The proposed methodologies are limited and require limited interaction from participants.
Recommendations
1. It is suggested that training packages be delivered exclusively to professionals working on
targeted subject matter i.e., professionals working in the education sector/schools
(teachers, mentors, student supervisors, etc.) would only be trained on the packages
related to violence against children, and not modules about violence against elderly or
shaken baby syndrome.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 95
2. Training methods (in addition to the content used, tests, activities, etc.) should be informed
by and designed based on the target audience. For the DVP implementation, the audience
can be clustered into Master Trainers, Awareness Specialists and the public (adults and
children).
3. Ensure that recommended training durations reflect time required to complete training
activities.
4. Include group work and quizzes in the training manual to make it more interactive and
useful.
5. It is strongly recommended to train Master Trainers and Awareness Specialists in a ToT
format rather than a 3 to 4 hours lecture-based format (to improve retention rates). This
will help these trainers are able to use training content and tools and improve training
effectiveness. Based on extensive research, the National Training Laboratories
(NTL)121 developed an effective Learning Pyramid that demonstrates a clear relationship
between the teaching method of choice and content retention rates.
1.5 Evaluation Tools
What levels of evaluation are included? Pre- and Post-tests, knowledge checks during the
training, etc.
Findings
The type of evaluation used is pre-and post-tests. The purpose of this type of evaluation (Learning/
Level 2) is to assess the knowledge and skills gained by trainees in each of the training conducted.
However, the following should be noted:
• Pre- and post-tests used in all training packages are identical for all levels of trainers (i.e.,
the tests for Master Trainers, Awareness Specialists and the community are all the same).
• The tests for each of the training modules do not adequately assess the information
provided in the content of the manuals.
• The questions of the test are ambiguous and depend on the memorization of many trivial
details. Similarly, the content of the test focuses on a few sections of the manual, rather
than covering most parts of the content.
• There are no clear instructions on how to administer these tests (random numbers method,
self-rated, peer-rated). There is also no guidance on when to share the results.
• There is no mechanism for immediate feedback from the participants on training sessions.
Recommendations

The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 96
1. Make separate tests based on the materials covered in each level of the training and the
learning objective of each training. The knowledge level expected of a Master Trainer
should not be equivalent to that expected of a community member. Additionally, pre- and
post-test questions need to be based on specific training objectives (one question per key
objective).
2. Adding some clear instructions for trainers on how to administer tests (using random
numbers, self-rated, peer-rated) and when to share the results will help in the successful
assessment of change in knowledge. Trainers must be told that results of the pre-test could
be used as a guide to focus on certain topics, and post-test results to adjust the curriculum
to focus more on the areas where most students scored low.
3. Reliability and validity of the test tool should be measured by using experts in the field
before applying them in the modules.
4. The Likert scale can be used to assess the change in knowledge more effectively.
5. It is also advisable to design and apply some feedback forms whose purpose will be to get
continuous in-process feedback from the participants to find out how they react to the
training.
6. Pre-test, post-test, and a key to the pre- and post-test should be included in the training
manual.
1.6 Trainer’s Notes/ Facilitator Guide
Are there enough instructions for trainers on how to best deliver and run the training? Do
these instructions take the target audience into account?
Findings
Overall, all training packages include instructions on how to deliver the training and how to run the
different activities. Nonetheless, the following has been noticed:
• Facilitator guides did not take the target audience into account. Although, there is a
separate section in each training package about delivering the training to the community
(nothing about Awareness Specialists), there are not enough instructions about teaching
these modules to different segments of society. Additionally, the selection of modules and
activities for this level of training could be further enhanced (e.g., in the Ihsan module, two
of the four lectures delivered to the community are about the international and local legal
framework of violence against older persons).
• The notes are not structured in an easy-to-use format. The first few pages only include
the duration and order of the sessions, the subsequent pages briefly explain the format of
the session, while any guidance on the different activities is provided as separate annexes
in a different section of the content. This way of structuring the content forces the reader
to go back and forth throughout the module to find the full instructions on any given session.
• In the introduction session in all training packages, trainees are asked to fill in a registration
form. Evaluators observed that trainers were not provided a registration form for
participants to use.
• Master Trainers and Awareness Specialists should receive two days of training, however
this is not being implemented in the roll out plan (see 1.4 above).For the community
sessions, the duration for the training is set as Six (6) hours122.
• The training agendas used in the facilitator guides are different from the ones presented at
the beginning of each training package and, sometimes, from how the sections are
ordered. Training agendas also include different titles for the lectures, which could confuse
trainers. The evaluation team was unable to locate some of the topics referred to in the
agenda (e.g., lecture 6,7 and 9/p.76 in the Ihsan Module).
Recommendations
1. Revise the structure and format of the facilitator guide section to make it more user-friendly.
It might be a good idea if the notes on every lecture/activity are included in the training
material itself (maybe as footnotes to the trainers to make them more accessible).
122 However, evaluators couldn’t observe the community sessions due to delayed programme implementation. Details in
Chapter:3
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 97
2. The agenda/index used in the training material and the facilitator guide have to be similar,
using the same titles and lecture order.
3. It would be much more efficient if there was one unified format/template for the
registration form to ensure that the required data is collected. This would guarantee a
coherent data set and make it easier for NFSP to integrate all data collected on one master
sheet. Also, to avoid redundancy, there is no need for the trainees to write down their
expectations from this training on the registration sheet as the 1st activity after the pre-test
is about expectations for the training.
4. Given the current pandemic, it might be a good idea to include some instructions and
guidance, whenever applicable, for online training formats (e.g., simulators, virtual reality
tools, etc).
5. It is strongly recommended that the training agenda be revised for the community training.
The selection of the lectures could be further enhanced to include topics that are relevant
to the community (such as how to respond to and report domestic violence and child
abuse).
6. Detailed session plan for trainers may be included with process, instructions, and
methodology.
7. Develop PowerPoint slides for the Master Trainer to use in lectures and provide these in
each session plan.

APPENDIX 14 – TECHNICAL ANALYSIS -1
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
National Child Neglect Prevention Programme
“We Would Like Your Safety”
2.1 Course Structure/ Module Plan
Is the material presented in a logical sequence? Is it consistent with the proposed learning
objectives and outcomes? Are the essentials covered? Are the learning hours adequate?
Findings
• The general definitions section is not structured in a comprehensible manner. There was
more focus on defining the goals and objectives of the “Child Protection System” than child
neglect.
• There are not enough visuals in the training material. Especially in the statistics section
(p.18-22) which is only full of text, numbers and percentages. For example, data from the
Saudi Health Council (National Index) on p.21 is descriptively stated only.
• The Statistics section is too long and there is no context or explanation included in the text.
Additionally, it has been noticed that most of the international studies referenced were
more than 20 years old.
• References included in the training package do not follow a standard referencing style;
some hyperlinks do not open, others are incorrectly numbered, etc.
• There is a lot of unnecessary information in Chapters 2 and 3 that could be removed
without affecting the quality of the content.
• The content contains lengthy paragraphs and sections in written form. Trainers and
trainees may find it difficult to track and comprehend.
• Point 5 of Chapter 1 states that general negligence includes two or more types of child
neglect. However, these types are not explained in the text.
Recommendations
1. Align the topic of the training manual with its content and keep the focus on giving solutions.
For example, Chapter 4 must be tailored to child neglect prevention mechanisms and
strategies.
2. Include more informational graphs, charts and pictures to help catch the readers’ attention.
The presentation of p.21 in graphical form is shown as an example below:
3.
Figure: Types of Child Abuse in Saudi Arabia
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 99
4. Content should be divided into brief sections with headings, titles and numbering to help
trainers and trainees to better understand the material. The current presentation of Content
causes the reader to lose interest. For example, gender segregation data can be presented
better in the following form:
Figure: Gender Segregation for Each Type of Abuse
5. In order to highlight the importance of the topic, the statistics section should be moved to
the beginning of the training. It is strongly suggested to shorten this section as well.
6. Referencing in-text and in the bibliography should use proper referencing styles (e.g., APA
or Vancouver) and recent studies should be cited (not older than 2015) to inform the reader
about the recent statistics and the current situation.
7. Section 5 of Chapter 1 needs to be explained, and two types of child neglect should be
further elaborated.
2.2 Locally Driven
Does the content of each module take into account the local context? Is any national data
presented? Local examples?
Findings
• The Statistics section included several national and local studies, which provided a local
perspective to the problem. It also helps explain to the participants how prevalent the issue
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 100
of neglect is. According to all studies mentioned, neglect is one of the dominant forms of
child abuse in Saudi Arabia.
• The study done by Al-Saud in 2005 showed child neglect by 87.3 %. This percentage
dropped to 45.3% in the years 2011-2016 as per the National Register of Child Abuse and
Neglect in the Health Sector of Saudi Arabia. Data after 2016 and reasons for the reduction
in child neglect has not been provided.
• There is a chapter that focuses on the national level legal framework, institutions working
on child protection, prevention projects and community level institutions. This chapter
included some key national programs that work on child protection, nonetheless, the
following has been noted:
- There was no mention of the DVPP as part of the national efforts to prevent/combat
child abuse.
- Most of these projects mentioned have objectives similar to the DVPP, accordingly,
it is important to highlight how this training programme/project is any different from
the other programmes running already.
Recommendations
1. Provide recent data to present the current scenario on child neglect. The reasons for the
reduction in child neglect should be explained.
2. Include reference the DVPP programme, especially as part of the national efforts in Saudi
Arabia to prevent child abuse.
2.3 Problem/Issue Identified and Solutions have been provided
Does the content explain the problem and its various manifestations, causes (e.gbeliefs,
customs, and perceptions)? Does it provide any solutions?
Findings
• The problem of child neglect has been clearly articulated with its different manifestations,
causes, effects and types.
• Using the socio-ecological model to identify risk factors provides a comprehensive
approach to identifying risks that can lead to child neglect. This is valuable because it
recognizes the shared responsibility among individuals, families, communities and society.
• There is emphasis on the fact that many parents do not set out to neglect their children,
but some parents are not able to adequately meet a child's needs. Sometimes neglect is
unintentional, such as in the case of a young parent who does not understand basic child
development (this was also confirmed in FGDs).
• The material includes five types of neglect: physical neglect, emotional neglect,
educational neglect, medical neglect, and general neglect. There are enough examples to
explain each form of neglect, except for the last type (general neglect).
• There is more focus on the problem than providing solutions. In other words, there is more
emphasis on defining what is neglect, its types, impact and risk factors, than on how to
respond to cases of neglect or how to prevent it from happening.
• The prevention section (p. 23-27) presents interesting tips to parents/caregivers on how to
prevent dangerous incidents from happening. Nevertheless, all these elements only
address physical neglect/ harm that children might face.
• Chapter 4, which focuses on prevention, is copied in all eight training packages (word for
word) without tailoring it according to the training topic.
Recommendations
1. Expand on the effects that neglect could have on children, which could also extend to their
adulthood.
2. Provide more focus on response and prevention mechanisms. Starting with identifying
some warning signs that could help in recognizing cases of neglect.
3. Chapter 4 needs to be tailored and examples applied according to the topic of training.
2.4 Legal Frameworks
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 101
Are contents aligned with international/regional norms and standards? Also, is it coherent
with national laws and regulations?
Findings
• The material is compliant with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the 1924
Geneva Declaration, and other international and regional child protection laws, policies
and standards (e.g., Charter of the Arab Child Charter).
• The section entailing details of the international legal framework is too long. References to
international laws and treaties are made in a detailed fashion. It is also worth highlighting
that this section is repeated in all training packages (verbatim).
• The International Practices section includes several examples of different prevention
programmes (e.g., Triple P, programmes provided by the National Institute of Justice in the
US), nonetheless, the reason behind choosing these specific examples is not mentioned,
which might give a sense of haphazardness to the reader. Additionally, some of these
programmes are covered in an unnecessarily detailed manner (one of the examples takes
two pages to explain).
• Projects and activities and the community institutions in the international practices section
also include many examples of different international activities/projects related to child
abuse and neglect and child protection. Nonetheless, the reason/logic behind choosing
these specific examples is not mentioned.
• The national legal framework section includes references to key national laws/royal
decrees that relate to child protection. Nonetheless, there was more focus on listing the
key national child protection stakeholders and explaining the national protection system,
rather than presenting different laws/policies that address child abuse and neglect.
Recommendations
1. Include more references to laws and policies, especially on the national level, that address
the issue of child neglect and abuse rather than focusing on institutions working in the field.
2. Many details about these programmes could be removed and interested participants could
do further study by themselves, as long as an accurate reference is included.
3. Both Chapters 2 and 3 could be shortened and merged.
2.5 Content Comprehensiveness
Does the module cover all pivotal issues/sub-issues? Does it provide the substantive
knowledge needed? Which parts of the curriculum should be strengthened? Which parts
should be removed?
Findings
• The effects/impact of neglect section does not provide a comprehensive understanding of
the consequences of neglect. Hence, the following elements were underemphasized:
o When children are neglected, this maltreatment impacts their overall health
development. Neglect has been linked to later physical, psychological, and
behavioural consequences that extend to a person’s adulthood.
o Cognitive impairment: A lack of appropriate stimulation could lead to enduring
intellectual problems. Children with a history of neglect are more likely to have
academic problems or delayed or impaired language development.123
o Health and development troubles: Malnourishment may harm brain development.
A lack of adequate immunizations and attention to medical problems could lead to
a variety of health conditions.
• There are no warning signs for child neglect included in the material.
• Response and reporting are two key elements that were absent in the training content.
There was no emphasis on how one can respond to a child neglect case (if proven or
suspected), nor how to report it. These are some key elements of any prevention process.
Chapter 1. 123 Sylvestre, Audette & Bussières, Eve-Line & Bouchard, Caroline. (2015). Language Problems Among Abused and Neglected
Children: A Meta-Analytic Review. Child Maltreatment. 21. 10.1177/1077559515616703.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 102
Since this training will be delivered to the wider community, it is important to explain what
to do if someone is reluctant about reporting or in doubt of the case. And how to report it.
Etc.
• The materials only highlighted mechanisms of prevention that focus on physical harm of
children, and not any other forms of neglect (e.g., emotional, medical, etc.). In the
prevention section (p. 23-27), some good tips were provided for parents to prevent physical
harm to their kids. It listed the following: burns, suffocation, falling, poisoning, drowning,
injuries, electrical shocks and car accidents.
• The manual provides substantive knowledge about child neglect. However, it is a bit
lengthy. The section on local experience on preventing child neglect is about 16 pages.
• The career training guide provides some basic information regarding duration, topics,
training methods but is not comprehensive. The training methods are named but have not
been elaborated.
• Some participatory activities have been suggested in the manual as annexes. However,
the activity in Appendix 8 is unclear. Does it relate to Activity 7 and is it a continuation? If
Activity 8 is separate, the instructions to participants and the process are missing.
Recommendations
1. Develop the section further by covering the impact of child neglect, to reflect on how neglect
can also affect a person’s adulthood.
2. Add a section about some warning signs that could indicate the possibility of child neglect.
This way it could help teachers/school administrators to address the issue and prevent
further deterioration of the situation.
3. It is strongly recommended that more emphasis be placed on the response and reporting
mechanisms for suspected or proven child neglect cases.
4. Not to focus only on preventing the physical type of neglect, but also include prevention
mechanisms that cover other forms of neglect.
5. The redundant content of the manual may be reduced and important points should be
highlighted.
6. The length of the manual may be reduced to make it more focussed and meaningful.
7. Under the Career Training Guide, training methods need to be elaborated.
8. Instruction to participants for Activity 8 of Appendix 8 should be provided for clarity.
9. The manuals should add warning signs in manuals that can help teachers/school
administrators to identify children who are witnessing (suspected) neglect. Some of the
signs that could indicate the possibility that a child is being neglected include frequent
absences from school; lack of needed medical care; stealing or begging for food; etc.

APPENDIX 15 – TECHNICAL ANALYSIS – 2
2. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Module One: Ihsan (National Preventive Program for Violence Against Older Persons)
2.1 Course Structure/ Module Plan
Is the material presented in a logical sequence? Is it consistent with the proposed learning
objectives and outcomes? Are the essentials covered? Are the learning hours adequate?
Findings
• Overall, the course is structured simply and coherently. However, the section on the
statistics of violence against older persons (p.18-22) is not well structured. Chapter 4 is the
least consistent/coherent part. It includes sentences such as: “according to last month/last
year’s statistics” and does not include proper referencing, so it is not possible to know
which month or year the reference refers to.
• The introduction provides clear background information about violence against older
persons, including data and statistics (with no references) to emphasize how important the
topic is. However, the introduction lacks an explanation of why violence against older
persons should be dealt with as a key issue along with domestic violence and child abuse.
There are no references to situational analysis or Training Needs Assessments (TNA) in
the manual.
• The section on Alzheimer’s Disease disrupts the flow of the content and the reason for
choosing to focus on this specific disease was not mentioned. It is not clear how
contextually relevant it is—for example, is it common in the local context? Do most of the
victims of elder abuse suffer from Alzheimer’s? Are elders with this disease more prone to
experience violence?
• Section C of Chapter 2 (Activities and Projects), includes international
conferences/summits related to violence against older persons which seem to negatively
affect the smooth flow of the material.
• Some sections do not have a brief introduction at the start to explain why these specific
examples or projects have been selected. Examples include: Prevention Programs (p.34-
35), Activities and Projects (p.36-37), and Community Institutions (p.38-39). These
examples are ambiguous and falsely give a sense of randomness.
• There is duplication on pages 54 and 55 (Ikram Org.). This section has been written twice.
The order of topics in the training package (pdf version) is different from what is being
presented in the PowerPoint version.
• The training manual does not refer to correct page numbers. For example, the index in the
manual refers to Chapter 5; the Training Guide for professionals on p. 71, which is not
correct. The index has been developed manually.
• There are mistakes in the titles of the manual e.g., on the second page of the index (p.7)
“Prevention of violence against children”. A similar mistake is on page 69.
Recommendations
1. Restructure the statistics section. To ensure a smoother and more logical flow, switch the
location of the statistics section with the risk-factors section (p.12-14). This way, the risk
factors will be followed by the prevention section, and the statistics section will follow the
general concepts section.
2. Add another introduction (or improve the existing introduction) that lays the foundation for
the rest of the modules. In other words, emphasize how all forms of violence negatively
affect society, its security and development. Provide a section detailing typology of
violence, while focusing on the most common types in Saudi Arabia. For example, Deborah
Prothrow-Stith from Harvard School of Public Health stated that: “Gang violence is
connected to bullying is connected to school violence is connected to intimate partner
violence is connected to child abuse is connected to elder abuse. It’s all connected”.
Hence, the choice of these eight specific modules.
3. Move the Alzheimer’s section to a different chapter and provide local context and impact
of the disease.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 104
4. Section C of Chapter 2 could be moved to the legal section to improve the flow.
5. Add a preamble for each chapter at the beginning of the chapter itself. This will make it
easier for participants to understand what each chapter will cover (there are many sections
and sub-sections that are at times puzzling.
6. The document should be reviewed for spelling mistakes and incorrect titles, which are
common.
7. Revise the selection of lectures to be covered in the community training.
8. Use automatic formatting for the index to ensure that the page numbers are correct.
2.2 Locally Driven
Does the content of each module take into account local context? Is any national data
presented? Are there local examples?
Findings
• The local context is integrated across the module. There are clear explanations of the local
dimensions for identifying the risk factors using statistics generated by King Abdulaziz
Centre for National Dialogue (KACND).
• Chapter 3 focuses exclusively on the local context (legal frameworks, prevention programs,
activities and projects, community institutions).
• The module has not highlighted the contribution of NFSP in the local context section.
Recommendation
1. Add more references to the national legal framework section. Currently, it only includes
one Royal Decree.
2. The contribution of NFSP should be added (if any). This would be a perfect opportunity for
the participants to know more about NFSP, its objectives and approaches.
2.3 Problem/ Issue Identified and Solutions have been provided
Does the content explain the problem and its various manifestations. Does it explain causes
such as beliefs, customs and perceptions? Does it provide any solutions?
Findings
• The issue of violence against older persons has been articulated with its different
manifestations. The first three chapters provide the theoretical framework of the issue while
emphasizing its general concepts, risk factors, legal framework, and international and
national application. While the last chapter (Chapter 4) can be understood as the
application/ implementation section which aims at building the participant's capacities in
the area of prevention with its different levels and strategies.
• Application of prevention tools used in the module is not focused. For example, using the
INSPIRE model was perfectly fine for providing an all-inclusive approach to prevention, yet
most, if not all, prevention strategies detailed in the model are to be carried out and
implemented by the national government (strategic level). There is a need to present some
other prevention and response mechanisms that address the tactical level (level of
communities, public and caregivers).
Recommendations
1. Revisit Chapter 4 while including some focus on prevention and response mechanisms on
the level of individuals/communities, rather than only the national level. It is important that
participants at the end of the training should be equipped with the knowledge and skillset
needed to know how to prevent/respond to a case of violence.
2.4 Legal Frameworks
Are contents aligned with international/regional norms and standards? Also, is it coherent
with national laws and regulations?
Findings
1. The content provides a comprehensive legal framework internationally (UN, WHO).
However, there is room for improvement in the section on regional legal frameworks. It
would be helpful to include more references to the key regional treaties/declarations.
2. Chapter 3, which focuses only on the local context, covers the legal framework for violence
against older persons. However, it does not catch the reader’s attention. For example, this
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 105
section listed (verbatim) the 17 articles of a Royal Decree about violence against older
persons.
3. The citation/reference is either missing or inaccurate (ex. UN, WHO, p.31 Reference 2).
Recommendations
1. Re-write the legal framework section under Chapter 3, while adding further local
references.
2. A summary/brief about the 17 articles of the royal decree would suffice. It would be helpful
to move the information about the decree to the end of the section. A proper reference to
the decree (including the link to where it can be accessed) should be available to enable
participants to read further about the details if required.
2.5 Content Comprehensiveness
Does the module cover all pivotal issues/sub-issues? Does it provide the substantive
knowledge needed? Which parts of the curriculum should be strengthened? Which parts
should be removed?
Findings
• Using the socio-ecological model, with its four levels, provides a comprehensive way of
looking at risk factors for violence against the elderly. The only addition to this section could
be, how these factors can inform strategies focusing on preventing violence against old
persons.
• The content has listed a comprehensive list of different types of violence against older
persons (physical, emotional/psychological, sexual, financial and neglect) with clear
definitions and examples. However, details regarding preventing the recurrence are
missing.
In Chapter 2, mentioning different prevention programs available internationally and
regionally was very useful in highlighting best practices at different forums. But the purpose
of mentioning them here remains unclear.
• The first three sections of Chapter 4 (concepts of prevention, importance of prevention,
and levels of prevention) are not very well structured, and they do not fully reflect the titles
of the sections. In the third section i.e., levels of prevention; it was very useful to cover
prevention phases in such a comprehensive way. However, this section lacks examples to
further explain each of the prevention levels.
• The INSPIRE model was developed by WHO to address violence against children. It
seemed to be copy-pasted without adopting it to address violence against the elderly
(p.68). Additionally, the use of the fifth section i.e., the ability of prevention is not clear.
Recommendations
1. Include more strategies in the prevention section. This would shed light on key prevention
principles that could help practitioners select, modify or create more effective programs.
2. Add information on preventing recurrence of violence. For example, how
practitioners/caregivers should deal with the victims and help in preventing recurrence.
3. A base statement for mentioning the purpose of providing such examples will add to the
content of the module. For example, if the purpose was to achieve geographical diversity
(UAE, USA, S.A, Tunisia).
4. Revisit Chapter 4 for structure, formatting and articulation.
5. Apply the INSPIRE model to violence against older persons.
6. Restructure the section on the ability of prevention by re-integrating it into strategies
section.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 106
APPENDIX 16 – TECHNICAL ANALYSIS – 3
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
4 Module Two: National Preventive Program for Mother and Infant (1000 Days of Life)
2.1 Course Structure/ Module Plan
Is the material presented in a logical sequence? Is it consistent with the proposed learning
objectives and outcomes? Are the essentials covered? Are the learning hours adequate?
Findings
• The content of the module is repeated several times. For example, there is repetition in
Chapter 1 in the section about the main pillars of the programme (p.11-15) and the negative
impact of neglecting the importance of the 1000 days (p.21-23). This repetition negatively
affects the flow and the length of the material.
• The content is not ordered in a structured format. For example, there is a prevention section
in Chapter 1 (p. 27-29), whereas there is another Chapter 4, which focuses exclusively
prevention itself.
• Many parts of the content are written as a policy brief, rather than a training material.
Especially, Chapter 1 lacks infographics, pictures and visual content, especially for key
data.
• The following sections have been repeated (verbatim) in all child protection training
packages irrespective of their relevance with the topic under discussion:
• Chapter 2: The legal framework section (international)
• Chapter 4: The legal framework section (national)
• Entire Chapter 4
• The agenda for the community training and the selection of the lectures/topics to be
covered does not fully deliver the message behind this training package. According to the
material, the community should be receiving seven lectures: 1) Introduction to the First
1000 days; 2) Breastfeeding; 3) Anaemia; 4) Malnutrition; 5) Stunting; 6) Low birthweight;
7) Obesity. This seems over time-consuming.
• There is redundancy in the content of the module. For example, Chapter 4 highlighted a
few modules e.g., levels of prevention and INSPIRE strategies. However, it is not being
applied to the training subject (First 1000 days). It covers violence against children in a
very general manner and will not add value.
• The title of Chapter 3 is wrong (p. 49).
• The manually developed index does not contain page numbering and the link with the
relevant session/ section is missing.
• Tables and graphs are not available (except a few) for comparative analysis.
Recommendations
1. The material should be reviewed for repetition and smoother flow/structure. For example,
the material would flow more logically if the general statistics section (p. 24-26) about the
First 1000 days was moved to the beginning of the chapter (part of or after the introduction).
Similarly, the prevention section in Chapter 1 should be moved to Chapter.
2. The introduction section could be further developed to build a stronger foundation for the
importance of the First 1000 days to show the participants how vital this phase is.
3. The selection of lectures for the community must be reviewed (it is missing some key
elements of the training).
4. Dedicated time per lecture should be revised by covering all the elements/ topics for the
first thousand days that could be captured in only one lecture. This will allow time to cover
other key parts of the training (e.g., prevention mechanisms, available national and local
support, etc.).
5. The entire Chapter 4 must be reviewed for its value and relevance to the training
programme.
6. It might be beneficial to add a section about COVID 19 and its impact and relevance to the
First 1000 days section. This will guarantee that the program is relevant to the current
context.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 107
7. Create the Index (Table of Contents) using the autoformat tool in MS Word.
8. Graphs and tables may be included in the manual for comparative analysis and better
presentation.
2.2 Locally Driven
Does the content of each module take into account local context? Any national data
presented? Local examples?
Findings
• The content lacks information for the public regarding their legal rights and ways to achieve
those. For example, on the national and local level, working mothers can be provided with
information about their legal rights that are relevant to the First 1000 days (e.g., maternity
leave, paid vs. unpaid leave, etc.).
• It has been noticed that in the community training agenda, lectures covering local agencies
and institutions that are relevant to the First 1000 days, are not included. It is pivotal for
the community to know of such services (raising awareness).
• Chapter 4 needs to be examined against its relevance to the training subject (First 1000
days). All prevention concepts, levels and strategies mentioned have to be applied to the
subject of the training, preferably using national/local examples.
Recommendations
1. Put more emphasis on national laws that are relevant to the First 1000 days e.g. access to
paid sick leave; right to paid maternity leave; local programs to support new parents; etc.
2. Include some local data/statistics around the pillars of the First 1000 days.
3. Including some data on the national or local level would be very useful while delivering this
training, especially for the community. Data could include local statistics around maternal
mortality, low birth weight, obesity, etc.
2.3 Problem/Issue Identified and Solutions have been provided
Does the content explain the problem and its various manifestations, causes such as
beliefs, customs and perceptions? Does it provide any solutions?
Findings
• There is no section in Chapter 1 to emphasize the importance of the First 1000 days.
• The topic of the training packages has been clearly articulated. However, there is a lot of
emphasis in the curriculum on the problem itself, rather than providing
participants/communities with the tools and services needed to overcome it.
• The projects and activities section (p. 41-44) includes the following: 1) A workshop on
malnutrition conducted in Syria in 2017; 2) A study on childhood obesity from age 9-15; 3)
A national program in Egypt targeting primary school students, and 4) A breastfeeding
training that took place in Dubai in 2017. The value of mentioning such activities is unclear.
Additionally, some of these activities are not even related to the core subject of the training.
Similarly, in the “Community Institutions” section (p. 45-48), the selection of these specific
institutions is not clear. The purpose of these for the participants is unknown.
• Chapter 3 (the Activities and Projects section) includes a list of different local and national
services that the public can use whenever they need support during the First 1000 days.
Which is very useful for the participants (needs to be included in the community training).
However, a few of the listed institutions and agencies are not relevant to the programme
and the content is missing information on different types of services (e.g., to cover working
moms, low family income, etc.).
Recommendations
1. A section answering the following questions is required to be a part of the content explicitly
on explaining to the community the significance of the First 1000 days? What do a healthy
1000 days look like? What are the differences at each stage of the 1000 days?
Furthermore, there should be a section focusing on the impact of care in these 1000 days,
not only on a person’s childhood but also his life.
2. In Chapter 2 (international experiences), the following could be done:
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 108
a. Including international best practices or references (e.g., the Australian parenting
website) is very useful, as participants could always use these types of resources
as references.
3. Shortening/removing some sections of the content (non-relevant institutions and
agencies), would create an opportunity to add new sections that focus on issues like mental
health, local data, statistics, and national/ local support programs available, etc.
4. The training directed to the community does not provide the full picture around the First
1000 days. Hence, it is highly recommended to review the selection of lectures directed to
the community.
2.4 Legal Frameworks
Are contents aligned with international/regional norms and standards? Also, is it coherent
with national laws and regulations?
Findings
• Contents are aligned with international and regional laws (Convention on the Rights of the
Child, Geneva Declaration, Arab Charter on the Rights of the Child, etc.).
• The legal framework section includes both international and national levels and has been
repeated in all child abuse training packages (verbatim).
• The value of sharing the international prevention programs mentioned in the material (three
programs in Egypt, one in UAE, and one in Australia) is unclear (p. 37-40). Why these
programs specifically? Do trainees need to know all these details about these programs?
Would mentioning them as an example be enough? Would it negatively impact the training
objectives if this section was removed?
Recommendations
1. Further highlight the national laws that are relevant/applicable to the First 1000 days
(especially to make the community and working moms aware of their legal rights during
the First 1000 days of their children’s lives.)
2. To review the relevance/value of the sections about international experiences (legislative
framework, prevention programs, projects, etc.) as many parts of this chapter could be
removed without affecting the training’s comprehensiveness.
2.5 Content Comprehensiveness
Does the module cover all pivotal issues/sub-issues? Does it provide the substantive
knowledge needed? Which parts of the curriculum should be strengthened? Which parts
should be removed?
Findings
• It has been noticed that the programme focused only on six factors in the First 1000 days
(p.11-15), which are: 1) Malnutrition; 2) Anaemia; 3) Stunting; 4) Low birth weight; 5)
Breastfeeding; and 6) Obesity. All these elements start with the infant’s birth, and does not
extend to cover the pregnancy phase (which is a key part of the First 1000 days).
• The element of malnutrition for mothers during pregnancy has been underemphasized,
although it’s a very important stage of the First 1000 days. Most of the focus was placed
on malnutrition for babies and its negative impact.
• The section discussing the negative impact of neglecting the importance of the First 1000
days is not comprehensive. It only includes the aforementioned six elements, nonetheless,
there are other ways in which a person could be impacted by his First 1000 days (e.g. brain
development, long-term mental well-being). Generally, there needs to be some reflection
on how this impact could go beyond the childhood stage and that it the person’s general
health for the rest of his/her life.
• It has also been noticed that the training delivered to the community (Agenda p. 94-95) is
not comprehensive enough, and it is missing some crucial parts of the training. Hence, the
selection of the lecture needs to be revised.
• The section covering the national legal framework (p. 50-55) is comprehensive. It entails
the key entities/ committees working on child protection in the kingdom.
• In the community training agenda, the section covering the local programmes supporting
the First 1000 days, is not included. Such programmes/services should be a key message
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 109
during the community training to raise/create awareness about any support options
available to the community (p. 58-60).
• Chapter 3, local context, includes many national institutions working on relevant protection
issues, in addition to some projects and activities relevant to the First 1000 days.
Nevertheless, there is still a need to provide more information (especially to the community)
on many other relevant services that could assist during this stage, if they exist e.g., are
there any national programmes for food insecurity, wherein low-income families can get
support to ensure that during the First 1000 days they can get the nutritious diet needed?
Are there any national/local centres that provide antenatal classes, especially for first time
parents? etc.
• The professional training guide lacks certain details. There are no notes available for the
trainers.
• The guidance to process the sessions is not available in the manual.
The trainings were mostly lecture-format and did not reflect use of interactive tools for capacity
building.
Recommendations
1. Put more emphasis on the pregnancy phase of the First 1000 days. In other words, add
some pillars to the programme that speak directly to the pregnancy phase, rather than
focusing only after the baby is born.
2. Shed more light on active national/local programmes that provide support, access to
nutrition, and care to mothers during the First 1000 days.
3. Mental health was an absent element in the training. Adding it would be very useful to the
programme to spread awareness about possible mental health issues that parents,
especially mothers, could face. It would also be useful to train participants on how to stay
mentally healthy during and after pregnancy.
4. Details may be provided for trainers in the professional training guide section.
5. The steps and processes may be elaborated to conduct the sessions.
6. Group work and quizzes may be included in the manual for interactive and participative
sessions.

APPENDIX 17 – TECHNICAL ANALYSIS -4
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
National Prevention Program for Parental Treatment
“Your Family…Your Security”
2.1 Course Structure/ Module Plan
Is the material presented in a logical sequence? Is it consistent with the proposed learning
objectives and outcomes? Are the essentials covered? Are the learning hours adequate?
Findings
• The importance of lending support to parents and families in strengthening communities
and achieving the best outcomes for children and young people, was highlighted in Chapter
1.
• The structure of the training curriculum was not tailored according to the target audience.
For example, the way the material is structured could only be delivered to parents (not
health workers, teachers, social specialists, etc.).
• The Statistics section is only using text.
• Overall, the issues detailed in the “Parental Treatment” training package are not structured
or demonstrated. Accordingly, the objectives of this training are not clear. Some parts of
the curriculum focus on “Child Maltreatment” and in that case, this whole training package
could be combined/merged with the “Child Neglect” training package. In other parts of the
training, the focus is called: “positive parenting programme”. However, the training does
not provide enough strategies/tips for increasing positive interactions between children and
parents.
• The Statistics section is lacking some key data/figures regarding the importance of parental
treatment and its impact on children.
• In Chapter 2, sections covering examples for prevention projects, activities and examples
for community institutions seem redundant. Similarly, Chapters 2 and 3 have been
unnecessarily stretched in several sections.
• The agenda for the community training and the selection of lectures must be reviewed. The
agenda includes titles for sessions that do not match the training material.
• The content is missing some key information on reporting and response mechanisms, for
registering identified cases of parental maltreatment.
• The flow and structure of chapters are not reader-friendly. The reader gets lost or distracted
while going through the module.
• The Hickman Curve and the seven INSPIRE strategies pack does not directly link to or
explain the relevance of parental treatment.
• The training guide lacks any guidance or instructions for trainers and merely elaborates
topics and timings.
• In Chapter 5, training methods (dialogue/ discussions, workshops and brainstorming) have
been mentioned. However, an explanation of these methods is missing.
• Chapter 6 on the community training guide lacks instructions and/or guidance and
resembles Chapter 5. The community training guide requires a bit different training
methodology.
Recommendations
1. This training package could be merged with the child neglect package, so it could cover
child neglect and maltreatment.
2. The flow and the structure of the training material could be further enhanced. Many parts
of the training include unnecessary information.
3. It is highly recommended to use more visuals in the training.
4. The community training agenda should be reviewed.
5. The chapters may be divided into different numbers, sub numbers, and headings and
subheadings to create a logical flow. This will make the trainings more user-friendly and
keep the attention of the readers.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 111
6. Chapter 2 and 3 need to be shortened and merged.
7. The link and relevance of parental treatment may be established with the Hickman Curve
and seven INSPIRE strategies.
8. Guidance and clear instructions may be provided for trainers. This will help trainers to
administer the session and topics.
9. In Chapter 5, training methods (dialogue/ discussions, workshops and brainstorming) may
be explained briefly for the ease of trainers.
10. A focussed community training guide with training methodology may be provided and be
explained briefly.
2.2 Locally Driven
Does the content of each module take into account the local context? Any national data
presented? Local examples?
Findings
• Chapter 3 focuses exclusively on the local context. It presents the national legal framework
along with the national child prevention system and its key institutions.
• The references to a wide range of national projects/activities and to community institutions
that work on parenting issues are missing important information about whether these
programmes are open for the public or not, where are they taking place, and how
participants can join.
• The training material does not focus on transforming restrictive and harmful gender and
social norms around gender equalities.
Recommendations
1. The goal of the programme should also be to spread awareness about national efforts and
initiatives whose services can be better achieved if the public has a better understanding
of their rights. Hence, it will be useful to provide this information to participants during the
community sessions.
2. Incorporate a gender aspect into the training material. Gender inequalities are one of the
obstacles that should be covered in the parental treatment discussion.
2.3 Problem/ Issue Identified and Solutions have been provided
Does the content explain the problem and its various manifestations, causes such as
beliefs, customs and perceptions? Does it provide any solutions?
Findings
• Using the socio-ecological model in identifying factors that influence parenting helped in
classifying a wide range of factors that are related to parents, children, community, and
social which impact parenting styles.
• The link between parenting and violence prevention was not demonstrated. In other words,
violence prevention-focused parenting was not streamlined in the training material,
especially since this package is part of a larger programme that aims at violence
prevention.
• The section covering healthy parental treatment of children (p. 17-22) provides some basic
positive approaches on parenting, e.g., acceptance and caring, democracy, equal
treatment, motivation and rewarding. These could be considered as generic parenting
techniques that do not appropriately address the complexity of parenting. There are no tips
or suggested techniques on how to deal with challenging behaviours that a child might
have based on the age group, nor it provides any problem-solving skills.
• There is no mention of any symptoms and signs of child maltreatment. This should enable
teachers or health and social workers to identify cases of child maltreatment.
• There was no focus on any response mechanisms. What actions could be taken if a
teacher, for example, was able to identify a case of parental maltreatment in any of the
students?
• Chapter Four (prevention) addresses violence against children in a very general manner,
it is not tailored to the training subject by any means (it is copied word for word in all eight
packages). Especially, that parenting is one of the seven key INSPIRE strategies.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 112
• Module contains reasonably good data and figures but lacks proper presentation.
Recommendations
1. It is highly recommended to place more emphasis on parenting interventions that prevent
and respond to violence against children. Also, there should be some focus on the
identification of maltreatment cases.
2. Tables and graphs may be inserted for meaningful presentation of data to make it attractive
and eye-catching.
2.4 Legal Frameworks
Are contents aligned with international/regional norms and standards? Also, is it coherent
with national laws and regulations?
Findings
• Training content is aligned with international and regional norms and standards. There is
a section dedicated to the international legal framework and another for the national legal
framework, both sections have been repeated in all other training packages (verbatim).
• The section covering international experiences and examples for prevention programmes,
must be revisited. The programs mentioned (except Triple P) have been copied word for
word from a translated document124 without adding much value to the reader nor any
information on where these programs are taking place or how to join them.
• Similarly, the section discussing international activities and projects (p. 42-44) entails
examples for workshops and seminars that were conducted in other countries around the
subject, without highlighting any outcomes for these activities. Hence, the value of
including such types of activities (regular workshops and seminars) is highly questionable
for the reader. Likewise, the section covers community institutions. Reasons for choosing
these specific institutions are unclear, not their value.
Recommendations
1. There is room for improvement in the structure and content of the legal framework section.
There need to be more references to international norms and practices, as well as any
national laws that directly address the subject if any.
2. There is no value in listing regional or national workshops and seminars that discussed the
issue of parental treatment unless any of these events had some milestone outcomes.
3. There is room for developing this material by using some of the best practices, policies,
and guidelines developed by organizations like UNICEF, CDC, etc. An example of that is
the UNICEF guidance note on “Designing Parenting Programmes for Violence Prevention”.
2.5 Content Comprehensiveness
Does the module cover all pivotal issues/sub-issues? Does it provide the substantive
knowledge needed? Which parts of the curriculum should be strengthened? Which parts
should be removed?
Findings
• There is a noticeable absence of any gender considerations in the training material. There
must be some gender focus when we discuss parenting, especially in shaping the child’s
understanding and beliefs about gender equality.
• The importance of including violence prevention and response, against children and all
forms of gender-based violence, within the training material was not demonstrated.
• The impact of child maltreatment was clearly explained. Nonetheless, there needs to be
more focus on the long-term impact, i.e., how the impact of maltreatment extends behind
childhood, that it could last for the rest of a person’s life.
• There has been more focus on the problem itself than on solutions. There is no emphasis
placed on the identification of cases of parental maltreatment. Not being able to identify
cases of maltreatment will preclude any response efforts.
Chapter 2. 124 [Internet]. Iacapap.org. 2021 [cited 15 July 2021]. Available from: https://iacapap.org/content/uploads/A.12-Parenting-ARABIC-
2017.pdf
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 113
• There has been a lack of focus on response mechanisms. What could be done in case
maltreatment has been identified? How to report it? Etc.
• Providing positive parenting tips for each stage of the child’s life (infant, toddler, middle
childhood and teenagers). This division will help parents further understand emotional and
social changes in a child’s life, which will enable them to better deal with their children.
• No particular focus was paid to adolescences. However, evidence shows that parental or
caregiver input remains as essential for adolescent wellbeing as for younger children.
• The module covers pivotal issues/sub-issues and good effort has been made to ensure
comprehensiveness. However, it is lengthy and difficult to grasp.
Recommendations
1. Include a gender perspective in the training material (helping parents overcome restrictive
local gender norms, help in shaping the child’s beliefs around gender issues, etc.)
2. Elements such as ways to identify cases of maltreatment, and reporting and responding to
cases, must be included in the training (including the community sessions).
3. The content may be made simply and easy to understand.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
National Preventive Program for Peer Violence in Schools
“No to Bullying”
2.1 Course Structure/ Module Plan
Is the material presented in a logical sequence? Is it consistent with the proposed learning
objectives and outcomes? Are the essentials covered? Are the learning hours adequate?
Findings
• This module with its current structure could be delivered to parents and teachers.
However, if this is meant to target children, then it needs to be structured in a
completely different way.
• The introduction section could be further developed. For example, it would be helpful
to explain the reason for referring to the bullying programme implemented in 2016, in
partnership with UNICEF and MoE. It was unclear how this programme is any different
from the one introduced in this training package.
• Listing different types of bullying, with examples, provides a broader angle for looking
at bullying. However, the current position of this section is affecting the smooth flow of
the content.
• There is no use of any visuals in the training material. For example, sections that
include numerous facts and figures. The statistics section consists of seven pages full
of text (p. 23-29).
• The position of different sections is affecting the flow of the content throughout the
module. For example, the statistics section would flow more smoothly if it was moved
to the introduction section, to highlight how important/critical the issue of bullying is and
emphasize how severe/prevalent it is in the local context. Additionally, this part of the
training is full of numerous studies that became more of a literature review. Hence,
studies need to be reviewed and grouped in a more structured fashion.
• Few chapters have redundant information that is increasing the length of content
unnecessarily. For example, the text in Chapter 2 (International Practices) and 3
(National Practices). The content provides useful information on the topics and covers
the essentials. However, the readers may get lost while reading lengthy sections and
be distracted.
• The training agenda for the community training must be reviewed, as some of the key
elements related to response and prevention mechanisms are not included.
• Chapter 4 is repeated in all eight training packages, word for word. This chapter, which
includes prevention strategies, needs to be tailored based on the training subject (a
comment that was brought up several times in the FGDs).
Recommendations
1. It is strongly recommended to do some amendments in the training content/structure based
on the target audience (especially children).
2. To eliminate any unnecessary information (especially with chapters two and three) and
replace it with new sections that cover the absent elements of the training (mentioned
below).
3. It is suggested to include more visuals. Using more infographics, charts, pictures or key
messages boxes would make the material more intriguing to the reader.
4. The contents may be reduced and divided into sub-topics/ sub-sections for smooth flow of
the manual.
2.2 Locally Driven
Does the content of each module take into account local context? Any national data
presented? Local examples?
Findings
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 115
• The statistics section includes several studies applied to the local context, which is key to
the training. Nonetheless, the results of these studies need to be better articulated and
presented in the training. Rather than just including the main findings as part of numerous
studies and figures in the statistics section, it can be presented in a way to emphasize how
prevalent the issue is in the local context, how different the types of bullying that boys vs.
girls face (gender mainstreaming), and what is the reporting rate based, etc.
• Chapter 3 of the content only focuses on the local context. It includes the national legal
framework, key prevention programmes, local projects and activities, and community
institutions.
• Two of the programmes mentioned in the training (“Refk” and “Bullying Prevention National
Program”) were very similar to the DVPP in their objectives and target audience.
Nonetheless, it was not explained how these programs complement each other and how
DVPP is any different.
• There is redundancy in a few sections that are part of the chapter. For example, the need
for including meetings/conferences about bullying as part of prevention projects and
activities is not clear, especially, if these were one-time meetings that have taken place
years ago.
• The presentation of national data lacks tables and graphs for easy understanding and
comparison.
Recommendations
1. Include more references and explanations to national laws/policies that are tailored to
bullying, to help the community to understand their rights and ways to get them if they face
peer violence.
2. The national data may be presented in the form of tables and graphs wherever possible to
make it eye-catching.
2.3 Problem/Issue Identified and Solutions have been provided
Does the content explain the problem and its various manifestations, causes such as
beliefs, customs and perceptions? Does it provide any solutions?
Findings
• The problem of bullying has been well defined and articulated with causes, risk factors and
impact. However, the following questions were not answered:
- The element of the power imbalance as a factor of bullying was not clearly explained
in the materials (what constitutes power imbalance?)
- The fact that there are similarities and differences among boys and girls in their
experiences with bullying was not emphasized. How gender makes the difference?
- Why children and youth are reluctant to report being bullied?
- In the section dealing with impact of bullying, details are missing. For example, impact
of “kids who bully others” should be mentioned separately for clarification.
- There has been more focus on the problem itself and its manifestations rather than
approaches to prevent/combat the problem. For example, the section on prevention
(p.30-31) is only stating issues.
Recommendations
1. Put more emphasis on the response and prevention mechanism and not only on the
problem itself, its causes and its impact. Therefore, the prevention section needs to be
more comprehensive to include do’s and don’ts for parents and teachers on how to respond
to bullying along with key intervention strategies to combat any negative effects caused by
bullying.
2. To address the missing elements of training. For example, if children will be attending this
training as part of the community, then the material needs to also include some tips to
children on how to handle bullying and deal with bullies.
2.4 Legal Frameworks
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 116
Are contents aligned with international/regional norms and standards? Also, is it coherent
with national laws and regulations?
Findings
• The material used is compliant with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and
other international and regional child protection laws, policies and standards. It is also
worth highlighting that this section (international legal framework) is repeated in all training
packages (verbatim).
• In the international practices section, there are references to six specific bullying prevention
programs: Olweus; KIVA; Peer Mediation Programs; Nursing Care Program; Character
Education & Social Emotional Learning (CE&SEL); Bullying Prevention Guide in the UAE.
Nonetheless, the reason behind choosing these specific programs is not mentioned. Were
they selected based on geographical location? Have they proven successful? Or were they
just randomly chosen? Also, mentioning such details of the programme feel redundant and
make the text look heavy.
• Similarly, the section covering international projects included five specific international
projects/activities without identifying the reason behind choosing these programmes
specifically.
• As for the national legal framework section (p. 47-52) it is being repeated in all eight training
packages (verbatim). Hence, it is suggested to add any additional national laws/policies
that are more tailored to the training subject (bullying).
Recommendations
1. Include references to national laws/policies that are more related to bullying if there are
any.
2. Explain to participants why these specific international programs, activities have been
included in the training and not others.
3. Since there will not be a need for the participants to retain the details of each of the regional
bully prevention programmes, it is highly suggested that only mentioning them as an
example would suffice, instead of mentioning so many details about each of these
programmes.
4. Shorten Chapters 2 and 3 of the content, as much of the information included could be
removed without impacting the comprehensiveness of the content. Also, this will create
some room to add new sections to cover any training missing element (e.g. immediate
response mechanisms, prevention tips, etc.).
2.5 Content Comprehensiveness
Does the module cover all pivotal issues/sub-issues? Does it provide the substantive
knowledge needed? Which parts of the curriculum should be strengthened? Which parts
should be removed?
Findings
• Applying the socio-ecological model to identify risk factors for bullying provides a
comprehensive view of the issue. Additionally, applying the model to both the one who does
the bullying and the victim was useful in identifying children at risk of being bullied as well
as those who are more likely to bully others.
• There is not enough focus on the response mechanisms. There must be more emphasis on
how to respond to bullying cases. In this regard, a few questions remained unanswered for
example, if a parent/teacher/school administrator suspects a child is being bullied, what
actions should be taken? What are the most effective steps he/she should take to protect
the victim? Etc.
• There are no tips for parents/guardians of children involved in bullying, for example how to
make them aware of the issue and how to prevent such events from continuing.
• Cyberbullying is a key contemporary form of bullying. No such type is mentioned in the
module.
• There is no mention of how someone (especially teachers/school administrators) can
distinguish bullying from other negative behaviors, for example hazing.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 117
• Prevention of extreme results of bullying are not mentioned. For example, who is more at
risk for suicide if bullied? In other words, are there any personality traits or markers that
parents and teachers should look for when they know a child is being bullied?
• There is no gender perspective mainstreamed in the training content. For example, how
girls and boys are similar/different in facing different forms of bullying and who tends to do
more reporting, etc.
• Career Counselling Guide is too general and explains duration, schedule and training
methods. However, the training methods have not been explained.
• In Chapter 5, the instructions in the guides for lectures and activities are too brief. The
process and explanations are missing.
• Overall learning objectives have been provided in the manual. However, session objectives
are missing.
• Instructions/guidance for trainers to process the sessions and methodology is missing.
Recommendations
1. Place more emphasis on the response mechanisms (especially for parents and teachers)
in cases where bullying is conducted or suspected.
2. Add tips for parents whose kids are involved in bullying others. This is important to help
parents deal with this situation effectively and healthily.
3. Add a section about cyberbullying, its prevalence and risk. Especially that cyberbullying
has unique concerns in that it can be persistent, permanent and hard to notice. Hence, it
would be useful to provide parents, teachers and children themselves with enough
guidance on how to deal with cyberbullying and how to report it.
4. Focus on gender mainstreaming across the training content and how boys and girls differ
when it comes to bullying.
5. Under Career Counselling Guide, training methods should be explained in detail.
6. Process and explanation of activities may be provided with sufficient detail.
7. Instructions/guidance for trainers to process the sessions and methodology may be
included in the manual.

APPENDIX 19 – TECHNICAL ANALYSIS – 6
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) Prevention Programme
“Don’t Shake Me”
2.1 Course Structure/Module Plan
Is the material presented in a logical sequence? Is it consistent with the proposed learning
objectives and outcomes? Are the essentials covered? Are the learning hours adequate?
Findings
• Most importantly, since SBS is a very specific/narrow subject that is not as complex as
other subjects covered in other training modules (e.g., bullying, sexual violence), and
given the fact that it is easily preventable, this training package should be structured
differently from the other training packages. It was not necessary to include the same
number of chapters and sub-chapters as in other training packages and should not take
the same duration to deliver the training. It is strongly suggested to abbreviate the
training material so this specific package could be delivered in one to two hours,
at the most.
• The content is lacking a connection in explaining SBS as a form of abuse linked to crying
babies. It first briefly defines the syndrome and its causes in the introduction and general
definition section (p. 10-14). This is followed by a focus on why babies cry and when, and
then explaining the PURPLE crying concept.
• The fact that SBS is 100% preventable was not highlighted, though, it is important to
emphasize this to all participants. It starts with making sure all parents, caregivers,
nannies, etc. understand the danger of vigorously shaking a baby.
• Both Chapters 2 and 3 are long and could be shortened and merged. Many parts could
be eliminated (e.g., risk factors, statistics, etc.). For example, in Chapter Two, the
prevention section (p. 29-32) does not flow smoothly. Information around the PURPLE
programme was very useful, however, the WHO section is irrelevant and could be
removed. Similarly, there is no need to share several local examples from the US about
similar projects or training programmes on SBS.
• The content is text-heavy and does not use any other form of presentation.
• The Pedagogical Analysis has not been undertaken to address training overarching goals,
module structure/module plan, training methodologies, evaluation tools and trainer’s
note/facilitator guide.
• The index is not correct since it has been developed manually. For example, Chapter 5
refers to page 73, when it is actually on page 75.
• The bibliography/referencing has not been done according to prescribed standards and
readers may find it difficult to search and find a referenced text.
Recommendations
1. Add a brief section about the immediate response. Some babies will stop breathing after
being shaken. If this occurs, CPR can keep the baby breathing while parents wait for
medical personnel to arrive (Red Cross offers a list of steps to follow).
2. A smoother transition between different paragraphs/sections is much needed (i.e., between
the definition of the syndrome, babies crying, symptoms of the syndrome, etc.).
3. Shorten the training curriculum and make it brief, as the subject does not call for such a
lengthy training. Remove the whole section of US examples. This will not affect the
effectiveness of the programme. The names of these programmes and their reference links
could remain.
4. Pedagogical analysis may be undertaken to analyze training goals, session objectives,
session plans, training methodology, evaluation tools and the trainer’s notes / facilitator’s
guide.
5. Using more visuals (charts, pictures, etc.) would be much easier for the reader, especially
with sections that include several facts and figures like the statistics section.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 119
6. The index (table of content) should be developed by inserting an table of content with help
of MS word. The formatting of the module may be done to ensure consistency in fonts and
spacing.
7. The references and bibliography should be standardized (e.g., APA style and Vancouver).
2.2 Locally Driven
Does the content of each module take into account local context? Any national data
presented? Local examples?
Findings
• Including some national data in the statistics section was useful. This seems to be helpful
for the participants in giving them awareness related to the prevention of SBS and its side
effects.
• There have been detailed references to national laws, policies, institutions and projects
related to SBS.
• It has been noticed that most of the local prevention programmes (p. 45-47) included in
the material are irrelevant to the training subject (SBS), it is more applicable to other
training packages covering violence against children. For example, the “Weladty” project
(p. 52).
• There is a mention of a few relevant local projects and activities (p. 48-53) in the module.
The details of the projects are given exhaustively which seems redundant because their
durations have surpassed already. Since these projects are ended now, so mentioning
such projects would not add any value to followers of current modules. An example of this
is the “SBS Prevention Programme”.
• It has been noticed that there is no mention of DVPP, which should be added to the local
projects/activities targeting SBS.
Recommendations
1. Include some national statistics related to the burden of SBS and remove references to
national/local projects and initiatives whose durations are completed already.
2. Include a reference to the DVPP programme as one of the national projects aiming at
preventing SBS
2.3 Problem/ Issue Identified and Solutions have been provided
Does the content explain the problem and its various manifestations, causes such as
beliefs, customs and perceptions? Does it provide any solutions?
Findings
• The problem of SBS has been well articulated. Nonetheless, its preventability was not
underscored. There has been less focus on mechanisms and approaches to prevent this
problem from happening or how to immediately respond when it happens (first aid/ primary
care).
• It has been noticed that sections covering local projects and programmes about SBS are
not part of the training agenda for the community training. It is important to raise
community awareness of all services available, including these projects.
Recommendations
1. The training agenda for the community training needs to be revised. Include information
about national and local services/resources that the community can use if needed.
2. Put more emphasis, not only on the problem and how it happens, but also on its
preventability and immediate response for parents and caregivers.
2.4 Legal Frameworks
Are contents aligned with international/regional norms and standards? Also, is it coherent
with national laws and regulations?
Findings
• Repetition of the same text (verbatim) is observed in all training packages. Such reiteration
is not only making the content redundant, but also such duplicated sections lose their
importance for the reader. Details are given below:
• International legal framework section: Although the content is aligned with international
and regional laws and policies (Convention on the Rights of the Child, Geneva Declaration,
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 120
Arab Charter on the Rights of the Child, etc.), mentioning it in all training manuals without
tailoring it for the subject area makes it uninteresting.
• National legal framework section (p. 39-44): There are references to national laws and systems
about child protection in all training manuals.
Recommendations
1. Tailor the (above-mentioned) sections according to the training subject (i.e., SBS) to make
it useful for the module. Otherwise, such portions could be removed to maintain content
consistency.
2. Chapters 2 and 3 should be merged.
2.5 Content Comprehensiveness
Does the module cover all pivotal issues/sub-issues? Does it provide the substantive
knowledge needed? Which parts of the curriculum should be strengthened? Which parts
should be removed?
Findings
• The content is less focused on explaining how SBS is 100% preventable. Furthermore,
risks and prognosis because of trauma-related to SBS lacks details.
• The prevention section (p. 22-23) does not provide techniques, especially for first time
parents, on how to deal with a crying baby (e.g., five S’s approach: shushing, side
positioning, sucking, swaddling, and swinging gently).
• The guide is not structured to be easily passed on to guardians other than parents e.g.,
relatives, nannies, etc.
• Chapter 4 (Prevention) is copied word for word in all eight training packages. It includes
some key information about prevention (e.g. levels of prevention, INSPIRE strategies),
however, it is not being applied to the training subject. Chapter 4 could be removed
from this specific training module, as the subject of SBS, unlike other modules, is not
a complex issue that requires complex solutions.
• Generally, the material could be considered largely comprehensive, however, some of
the missing material includes: home-based first aid to a baby who has been exposed
to SBS, how to prevent choking if a baby vomited after being shaken, and information
to help parents better cope with a crying baby, like; tips to soothe the baby along with
healthy ways to deal with frustration and anger.
• Tables and graphs have not been developed for comparison or easy understanding by
the target audience.
• The Hickman Curve and seven INSPIRE strategies have been repeated in all four
modules.
• The “Career Training Guide” (Chapter 6) does not provide required details to trainers.
It gives general information, schedule, etc. and session plans are not elaborative.
• The “Community Training Guide” gives some basic and generic information about
topics and timetables. However, it lacks the guidance for trainers to plan and conduct
the session effectively.
• Pre-test, post-test, and key to pre and post-test for self-assessment have not been
provided.
Recommendations
1. Again, since the issue of SBS is not a complex matter like other forms of violence against
children (i.e., bullying, or sexual abuse), the training material should not also be complex. It
needs to be precise and brief. Accordingly, the training should only focus on the following:
Definition of the problem (SBS), its main causes and effects; Some national
figures/statistics; How this issue is 100% preventable; Techniques to prevent (primordial
prevention) SBS from happening (for parents and caregivers); Local
programmes/institutions that parents could reach out for support when needed; First aid,
prognosis, and how could it be treated
2. Tables and graphs may be provided wherever possible to catch the attention of readers.

Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 121
3. The Hickman Curve and seven INSPIRE strategies should be provided in all modules, in
case the trainers groups are different. Otherwise, repetition may be avoided and a summary
may be given only (if required).
4. The chapter on career training should provide required details to trainers. The session plans
may be made more elaborative.
5. Chapter 6, “Community Training Guide”, should provide a detailed plan and instructions to
conduct the session effectively.
6. Pre-test, post-test, and key may be attached for easy access in aiding self-assessment.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
Sexual Violence Against Children Prevention Program
"White Campaign"
2.1 Course Structure/ Module Plan
Is the material presented in a logical sequence? Is it consistent with the proposed learning
objectives and outcomes? Are the essentials covered? Are the learning hours adequate?
Findings
• The introduction section is not elaborative. It should better explain the critical importance
of the topic and why it is part of the programme. It would be helpful to mention some
national statistics and facts, along with explaining the impact of sexual violence on the
future life of children. Additionally, no information is provided about support systems for the
victim at different levels.
• Chapter 1, Section A (general concepts), does not flow smoothly. This is a very important
section as it provides an introduction to the course. Paragraphs are not connected, which
negatively affects the logical flow of the material.
• The statistics section is in the wrong plae in the section. As a result it loses its importance
in the structure of the module.
• The prevention section in Chapter 1 includes several repetitions in the “Tips for Parents”
section (pg. 30-32) which affects the flow.
• The presentation of content is mostly “text-based”. For example, the statistics section
consists of six full pages of text.
• There is noo evidence of the baseline assessment done to address overarching goals,
module structure/module plan, training methodologies, evaluation tools and trainer’s
note/facilitator guide.
• The preface of the module does not talk about “sexual violence” and refers to “domestic
violence” which is not the focus of the module.
Recommendations
1. Add a new section that focuses only on response and support mechanisms at different
levels (e.g., for children themselves, for parents, for caregivers, teachers, etc.)
2. Improve the flow and the structure of the module by moving the statistics section to the
beginning part of the general concepts section.
3. The selection of lectures for the community training must be reviewed to ensure that they
include key information (fewer activities are also suggested).
4. Pedagogical analysis should be undertaken to analyze training goals, session objectives,
training methodologies, and evaluation tools.
5. The preface of the module should include information on sexual violence to break the taboo
attached to the subject.
6. Use more infographics, charts, pictures or key message boxes to make the material more
intriguing to the reader. Two charts taken from National Index Report 2011-2015, the local
study referred to in the statistics section, are given below:
Figure: Victims of sexual violence according to gender

Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 123
Figure: Types of Perpetrator/ Offenders
2.2 Locally Driven
Does the content of each module take into account local context? Any national data
presented? Local examples?
Findings
• The local context has been mainstreamed in most parts of the training content. Most
specifically in the statistics section, which includes results from different local studies
and diverse national statistics/data around child sexual abuse in the Kingdom.
• The literature mentioned in the manuals was outdated (a few were 20 years old) and
there is a lack of reference made to local studies (KSA). Instead, literature mostly
focused on regional studies in other Arab countries.
• The national data/statistics in Chapter 1 provide clear evidence of the problem.
Nonetheless, the way it is presented in the material belittles its value.
• Listing child abuse-related activities (even single-time events) and old projects (e.g., p.
60) is common in the module. However, the purpose of mentioning such events is not
clear.
• In the “community institutions” section (p. 65-67), there is no clarity on the use of
institutions for the community and participants.
Recommendations
1. Keep training goals in mind while listing various references to policies, projects and
activities, so the material does not deviate from these goals. In other words, put more
emphasis on projects and activities that could be of use to the community, and identify
where the community can reach out for help and support if needed.
2. Articulate the national data section more appealingly, so that it attracts the participant’s
attention. It must be highlighted as a key message rather than just some numbers under
the statistics section, especially those that address the local context, e.g.:
3. Relation between the size of the family and the occurrence of sexual abuse.
4. Boys are more prone to sexual violence.
5. Housekeepers (servants) are amongst the highest perpetrators.
6. Include ongoing and current activities as well as laws and policies to make the community
aware of their rights related to the subject under discussion, rather than mentioning
outdated projects.
7. Community session should include information on how and when to reach out to help
centres or mentioned institutions when needed.
2.3 Problem/ Issue Identified and Solutions have been provided
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 124
Does the content explain the problem and its various manifestations, causes – beliefs,
customs, and perceptions? Does it provide any solutions?
Findings
• The causes of the problem and its various manifestations and impact have been clearly
articulated in the content.
• In Chapter 1 (introduction and definitions), the definition for types of sexual violence
i.e., sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, sexual harassment, and sexual assault
are not explained for the participants.
• Chapter 1, Section D, covers the impact of sexual violence against children in a
resourceful manner. This section presents the impact of violence as an identification
mechanism with a large set of indicators to highlight the risk factors for sexual violence.
More specifically, page 20-22 provides an extensive list of expected behaviours for
children (based on the age group) who might have witnessed sexual abuse, which
allows for early identification of victims (however the references for this section are
missing).
• The prevention section (Chapter 1) is focused only on prevention mechanisms to
prevent sexual violence from happening. It lacks information related to the following
questions: as a parent, what actions should I take if my child was exposed to any form
of sexual violence? When and how do I report? How do I ensure that my child is getting
the necessary care and support to avoid any long-term harm/traumatic reactions?
What actions should the victim take if (s)he faced sexual violence?
• The section about early signs for children as potential perpetrators, and how parents
could deal with this situation is very valuable and helps with early prevention strategies.
• Using the INSPIRE model is an acceptable way to provide an all-inclusive approach to
prevention, yet most of the prevention strategies need to be carried out and
implemented by national governments (at the strategic level), i.e., it is addressed to
policy and decision-makers. However, the design of the DVP program is meant to
target people at the household and community levels.
• Reference M10 is missing in the bibliography and referencing has not been done
properly.
• In Chapter 1, statistics on sexual violence against children (p. 23) contain relevant data
regarding Saudi Arabia and other countries. A notable graph has been developed for
comparison to engage the interest of the target audience.
• The Hickman Curve (p. 73) and seven INSPIRE strategies (p. 74) have been provided
in all four modules. If the target audience/trainees are the same, this duplication is
repetative for the reader.
• The “Career Training Guide” chapter (Chapter 6) does not provide required details to
trainers. It gives general information, schedule, etc. and session plans are not
elaborative.
• The “Community Training Guide” chapter gives some basic and generic information
about topics and timetables. The guidance for trainers is absent for planning and
conducting the session effectively.
• Pre-test, post-test, and the key to pre and post-test have not been provided.
Recommendations
1. Provide definitions for types of violence at the start of the module. This is because it will
help the reader to have an in-depth understanding of the violence type and comply with the
interchangeable terms in the training material.
2. Place more emphasis on response mechanisms. Make it clear for different audiences like
parents, caregivers, teachers or health workers, what actions should be taken as an
immediate response, what reporting mechanisms exist, or even on a longer term how to
provide support and care to the victim to overcome any negative impact. Additionally, the
above changes can be made separately at two levels: one for children (as an end-user) and
another section directed for parents, caregivers, etc.
3. At the tactical level (level of communities, ordinary citizens and caregivers) prevention
strategies need to be introduced in the manuals to make them more useful and applicable
for the desired audience.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 125
4. Chapter 4 (prevention) needs to shed more light on community-level interventions that aim
at changing norms and attitudes of individuals in communities towards sexual abuse and
exploitation.
5. Referencing/bibliography should be done in a standardized style (Vancouver, APA, etc).
6. Graphs and tables should be provided when possible to generate interest.
7. The Hickman Curve and seven INSPIRE strategies should be included in all modules as
long as trainers are different for each module.
8. The “Career Training Guide” (Chapter 6) may include details and steps to conduct sessions
effectively.
9. Chapter 6 may be revisited to provide detailed instructions/guidelines to process and deliver
the training sessions.
10. Pre-test, post-test, and key to pre and post-test may be provided.
2.4 Legal Frameworks
Are contents aligned with international/ regional norms and standards? Also, is it coherent
with national laws and regulations?
Findings
• The material used is compliant with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)
and other international and regional child protection laws, policies and standards.
• The international legal framework is too lengthy for the module. It is also worth
highlighting that this section is repeated in all training packages (verbatim).
• The importance of the prevention programmes, projects, activities and community
institutions (Chapter 2, international experiences, p. 42-51) is not clear. Additionally,
the effect of these specific international and regional examples on the training’s goal
and objectives is absent.
• The national legal framework section (p. 53-58), includes references to national laws
and child protection systems. This is repeated in all training packages (verbatim).
However, national laws or policies with a special focus on the area of sexual abuse
against children are lacking in this section.
Recommendations
1. Chapters 2 and 3 need to be reviewed to eliminate or shorten any unnecessary information.
It might also be useful to consider merging both chapters.
2. Include more information/references to any national laws/policies that focus on sexual
violence against children. Also, emphasize how these laws could be perceived as
preventive measures rather than reactive measures.
2.5 Content Comprehensiveness
Does the module cover all pivotal issues/sub-issues? Does it provide the substantive
knowledge needed? Which parts of the curriculum should be strengthened? Which parts
should be removed?
Findings
• Terms like sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation have
not been clearly defined. Rather, they have been used interchangeably.
• Gender has been well mainstreamed across the training material (both in terms of victims
and offenders).
• Using the socio-ecological model to identify risk factors for sexual violence against children
is considered a comprehensive approach.
• It is critical to note that sexual abuse against children includes acts that do not involve
actual physical coercion, and it can often be perpetrated through the use of authority,
allegiance, status, and misrepresentation of social norms. Hence, the section covering the
types of sexual violence is not elaborative.
• Online sexual violence, which is perceived as an emerging area of concern in the field, is
not covered in the training content.
• Chapter 4 (prevention) is copied word for word in all eight training packages. It includes
some important information (e.g. levels of prevention, INSPIRE strategies), however, it is
not applied to the training subject, The first 1000 days. This chapter covers violence against
children in a very general manner. Primary prevention education includes information on
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 126
the nature and extent of child sexual abuse, how to identify risks, and how to respond to
risks/violations.
• Some key issues have been either overlooked or underemphasized, such as:
- Instances where the recipient may not be aware of their victimization or that sexual
violence has been perpetrated against them. Such acts are serious crimes with
significant negative impacts on a child’s development and health.
- Teaching children to protect themselves, using child sexual abuse-specific school-
based prevention programmes that aim to teach pre-school and school-aged
children and adolescents skills to be safe from sexual abuse. Briefly referred to as part
of the white campaign p. 61.
- Online abuse school-based prevention programmes. School-based programmes
aiming to educate children, parents and teachers about the dangers posed by sex
offenders in cyberspace.
- Due to the complexity of the issues and the needs of those affected, almost all
responses to child protection issues involve working across several different service
sectors. Hence, coordinated multi-sectoral responses to child sexual abuse and
exploitation often combine prevention and protection activities delivered by a range of
different agencies (education, health, law enforcement, etc.). This concept of
complexity, integration and complementarity between institutions is not clearly
articulated in the material.
- Less attention has been given to the area of recovery and reintegration. Children
and adolescents who have been sexually abused or exploited require comprehensive
services that provide a package of multi-sectoral support to address their emotional,
practical and social needs to enable recovery and reintegration into communities.
Moreover, parents of victims might also need psychosocial and social support to learn
about the dynamics and impacts of sexual abuse so that they can better support their
children
- Justice system and how national laws/policies need to be preventative rather than
reactive.
Recommendations
1. Lay a stronger foundation in the introduction to emphasize how important these issues are
and how severe their impact could be on victims.
2. Review Chapter 4 (prevention) to focus on preventive measures that could be undertaken
by the community. Focus on signs to help with the identification of cases. The focus should
be awareness-driven to fulfil the goal of the training.
3. Add new sections addressing the above-mentioned overlooked key issues.

Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 127
APPENDIX 21- TECHNICAL ANALYSIS – 8
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
National Prevention Program for Violence Against Women
“Women are the Success”
2.1 Course Structure/ Module Plan
Is the material presented in a logical sequence? Is it consistent with the proposed learning
objectives and outcomes? Are the essentials covered? Are the learning hours adequate?
Findings
• It is unclear whether this training package is about women’s empowerment or preventing
violence against women and domestic violence. As such, the introduction section focused
primarily, on women’s empowerment and the national efforts towards achieving this goal.
Also, the course brochure focused exclusively on women’s empowerment. However, the
rest of the training material is focusing on violence against women (with its types, causes,
effects, etc.).
• Structure of the legal framework sections (in Chapters 2 and 3) needs to be reviewed.
Listing all articles of UN resolutions or Royal Decrees is not needed.
• Sessions (titles) included in the community training agenda do not match the sessions in
the training material.
• The preface of the module does not talk about women, even though the topic of the module
is violence against women.
• Chapter 1, Heading B (general concepts of violence against women) explains risk factors
leading to violence against older people. Heading A is missing in the content.
Recommendations
1. Review the structure of the community session agenda.
2. Review the structure of the legal framework sections (in Chapters 2 and 3). Such references
could be summarized into key messages/outcomes that participants could benefit from.
3. Preface should be revised to focus on violence against women.
4. Heading B of Chapter 1 (general concepts of violence against women) should be changed
to address risk factors leading to violence against women. Heading B should be corrected
if A is missing in the content.
2.2 Locally Driven
Does the content of each module take into account the local context? Any national data
presented? Local examples?
Findings
• Referring to national strategies and policies, Vision 2030, Royal Decrees, etc is very useful
in demonstrating national efforts on the strategic level towards achieving women
empowerment. It also showcases the importance of the training and how is it aligned to
national strategies.
• The section on women’s empowerment demonstrated the Kingdom’s efforts in empowering
women and strengthening their role nationally. Highlights how Saudi woman have become
an effective and integral part of the political, educational, governmental, private and
economic sectors.
• There is enough emphasis on national/local projects that focus on women’s empowerment
and protection. However, it has been noticed that the approach showcase efforts made in
this area, rather than focusing on the use for participants to know or benefit. Some of the
programs mentioned were not active any longer, yet they are included.
• National data has been included in the module comprehensively. Tables and graphs have
not been included.
Recommendations
1. Revise the selection of local projects and initiatives included in the training. The question of
how this will benefit the participants/audience must be the driving factor for selecting any of
these projects.
2. Tables and graphs should be included with data wherever possible.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 128
2.3 Problem/ Issue Identified and Solutions have been provided
Does the content explain the problem and its various manifestations, causes such as
beliefs, customs, and perceptions? Does it provide any solutions?
Findings
• Violence against women has been clearly defined with its different forms and
manifestations. The material presented the UN definition as well as definitions used in
academia. Also, the understanding of how violence against women is perceived as a result
of the deep-rooted and structured discrimination against women and the historical
imbalance of power relations between men and women was demonstrated.
• The socio-ecological model for identifying risk factors of violence only focuses on factors
that make women more vulnerable to intimate-partner violence without focusing on other
forms of violence.
• The positive impact of improving gender equality on individuals as well as on society was
clearly explained.
• The impact of domestic violence on children is not presented in the material. This type of
violence can affect children either directly (suffering abuse themselves) or indirectly
(witnessing it). Victimization of children as witnesses is also one of the key issues that were
discussed in the Istanbul convention.
• The section covering the prevention of violence against women exclusively discussed
women’s empowerment. It presented women’s empowerment as the only preventive
approach to end violence against women. Hence, solutions provided in the training to
address violence against women are considered incomplete.
• Accordingly, the majority of national laws, projects, and activities included in the training
focused on women’s empowerment in the local context, rather than protection of women
against violence.
• Chapter 4, focusing on prevention, is being repeated in all eight packages without tailoring
it to the training subject.
• There is no emphasis on the issue of reporting and response to cases of violence against
women. This should be an important aspect of the training, especially the community
sessions.
• The problems of violence have been identified clearly, but trainings do not present
solutions.
Recommendations
1. Make the distinction between violence against women and gender-based violence and
domestic violence.
2. Include more preventive measures, since women’s empowerment was the only measure
that the material focused on.
3. Include a section about reporting and response mechanisms.
4. Focus and strengthen the solution section.
2.4 Legal Frameworks
Are contents aligned with international/ regional norms and standards? Also, is it coherent
with national laws and regulations?
Findings
• On the international level, the only legal framework that the material covered was the UN
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women (VAW), proclaimed by the UN
General Assembly resolution 48/104 in 1993. It listed all elements included in the six
articles of the resolution (p. 26-33), which is unnecessary.
• In Chapter 2, international practices, the choice and value of the projects and activities
presented in the material are unclear. The same applies to the community institutions, the
reason behind choosing these specific examples remains unclear, likewise, its value for
the participants.
• In Chapter 3, the section on local practices includes the national legal framework, part of
which is the Royal Decree Protection System. The material included all 17 articles of this
decree, word for word (p.44- 49), which is unnecessary. Additionally, several other national
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 129
legal references have been made, most of which focus exclusively on women’s protection
and empowerment.
Recommendations
1. To diversify the legal resources/references made on the international and national levels.
Refer to other key legal frameworks, such as:
- Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 1993 “Recognizing elimination of VAW
in public and private life as a human rights obligation”.
- Convention of the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)
in 1979. Adopted by the UNGA
- Beijing Declaration in 1995
- Istanbul Convention in 2011
2. No need to list all articles for a resolution or a decree. A summary of the key highlights of
this decree would suffice.
2.5 Content Comprehensiveness
Does the module cover all pivotal issues/ sub-issues? Does it provide the substantive
knowledge needed? Which parts of the curriculum should be strengthened? Which parts
should be removed?
Findings
• Prejudices, customs, traditions and other practices based on the harmful notion that
women are inferior, or on gender stereotypes, further perpetuate violence against women,
as the primary reason behind the violence is the victim’s gender. This fact was not directly
presented in the training.
• Types of violence against women included in the training are not comprehensive. There
are some common forms of violence (especially in the local context) that were not
discussed, like forced marriage, female genital mutilation, etc.
• Domestic violence and violence against women were sometimes used as synonyms in the
training material, which is not accurate. Domestic violence is a form of violence against
women, but not the only form.
• This training mostly focuses on the prevention level, only women empowerment has been
identified as a prevention tool in this training.
• In Chapter 2, the abbreviation PTSD has been used and it has not been explained.
• Chapter 5 in the professional training guide is quite general and does not provide any
guidance to the trainer for the delivery of the sessions.
• Six activities have been included in the chapter and no explanation/guideline has been
given to process the activity.
• Chapter 6 on community training guide lacks guidance part for trainers and methodology.
• The link provided in Chapter 7 awareness materials does not open the referred document.
Recommendations
1. Include different types of violence against women, to spread more awareness. Spreading
awareness about patterns of behaviour used by an individual to control his partner is
important (e.g., cutting women’s access to finances, threats to take the children away,
using intimidation, etc.). All these actions serve to exercise power and control over the
victim.
2. Focus on different preventive measures other than women empowerment. However, there
are many other measures to strengthen prevention efforts, like (education about equality
between men and women, awareness-raising campaigns, challenging gender stereotypes,
programs for preparators, etc.)
3. Since preventing and responding to violence against women requires a multi-sectoral
approach, it is important to make any reference to the different pillars of response, or what
is called the 4Ps (Prevention, Protection, Prosecution, and Promoting Coordinated
Policies).
4. Reflect on the implications of the COVID 19 pandemic on the issue of violence against
women.
5. A complete explanation of abbreviation may be given for the first time or a glossary may
be included.
The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic
Violence Prevention Programme (DVPP) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 130
6. Guidelines for trainers may be included in Chapter 5 for delivery of the sessions.
7. Explanation/ guideline may be provided to the trainer for processing six activities.
8. It is also useful to include a section about the cycle of intimate-partner violence and its
phases (tension-building, explosion or violence occurrence, and honeymoon phase). This
cycle can only be broken by the woman herself or with the help of outside intervention.
9. Guidance for trainers and methodology may be explained in Chapter 6 on community
training.
10. It would be useful to refer to the RESPECT women framework for preventing violence
against women. It is a framework that has been endorsed by WHO, UN Women, and 12
other UN agencies. Each letter of RESPECT stands for one of seven strategies:
Relationship skills strengthening; Empowerment of women; Services ensured; Poverty
reduced; Enabling environments created; Child and adolescent abuse prevented; and
Transformed attitudes, beliefs, and norms.
11. Correct link should provide in Chapter 7 awareness materials to access guide to preventing
violence against women.
12. Finally, it would be very relevant to include a section on gender-based violence in the
context of COVID 19, especially since there have been several reports highlighting the
increase in the number of cases (25-30%) in the context of COVID.
