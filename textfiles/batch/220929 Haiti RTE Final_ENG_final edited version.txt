Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A. OBJECT, OBJECTIVES, AUDIENCE and METHODOLOGY
The evaluation team carried out a real-time evaluation (RTE) of UNICEF’s response to the earthquake
that struck the three southern departments of Haiti on 14 August 2021. The RTE reviews both the
emergency response phase (between August 14th, 2021 and October 14th, 2021) and the recovery phase
(between October 14th, 2021 and the RTE deployment).
The objectives of the RTE were:
a. to determine whether UNICEF’s response to the earthquake was appropriate/relevant, effective,
connected, coordinated and coherent;
b. to assess the extent to which UNICEF adhered operationally and programmatically, to the Core
Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action (CCCs);
c. to examine the extent to which UNICEF effectively responded to the needs of the most affected
population in a timely manner and identify gaps and appropriate strategies to improve operational
coverage and effectiveness (see Annexe 1 ToR).
The primary audience includes UNICEF’s management and staff at the field, country, regional and
headquarters levels involved in the response to the earthquake. The secondary audience includes: the
wider community of partners - governmental, UN agencies and other implementing partners
(international and national NGOs); populations affected by the emergency, the Executive Board and
interested member states; and donor agencies that support emergency programmes with technical and
financial resources at all levels.
The data collected for the evaluation came from a literature review, a large number of interviews with
stakeholders, and observations during field visits. Data collected was triangulated and then the findings,
conclusions and recommendations were validated through a series of workshops with staff from the field
office, Country Office and Regional Office. The evaluation team used different frameworks and
approaches for the two different phases of the response:
- For the emergency response phase the team used OECD/DAC evaluation criteria as the main
analytical framework combined with the procedure on regional emergency activation for L2
emergencies and the CCCs. The findings are presented in relation to these in the main report as
well as in annexes 5 and 6;
- For the ongoing recovery phase, the team opted for an iterative “real-time evaluation” approach
to trigger real time learning and provide “real time solutions”.
B. A COMPLEX CONTEXT
Over the last 20 years, Haiti has been affected by more than 20 disasters. The earthquake on August 14th
2021 further compounded a complex context which includes a) a political crisis related to the
assassination of the President on July 7th; b) an economic crisis that has been looming for years,
including regular gas shortages; c) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; and d) gang-related
insecurity which has made the transportation of supplies and aid extremely difficult. The rural areas of
the southern peninsula's three most westerly departments were the hardest hit. The damage was located
in a number of isolated communities that could only be contacted and reached after several hours. Two
days later, on August 16th, with people mostly sleeping in the open, tropical storm Grace hit, further
blocking roads due to landslides.

Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
The impact of the earthquake was significant with around 2,200 deaths, 12,700 injured and around half
a million children affected. As in other responses to natural disasters, UNICEF’s response to the 2021
Haiti earthquake had two main phases. an emergency phase, during which UNICEF conducted a series
of relief activities in health/nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), education and child
protection, and a rehabilitation phase to assist the affected areas and populations to recover from the
main impacts of the earthquake. The findings below are structured in relation to the following 7 criteria:
RELEVANCE/ APPROPRIATENESS: Despite its low level of emergency preparedness, to a large extent,
UNICEF’s emergency response was appropriate, with some variation in levels of appropriateness
between sectors. However, many remote rural areas received only limited assistance for some time due
to access difficulties. The response only started to be more comprehensive at the beginning of the
recovery phase. Regardless of the difficulties, most activities were organized in order to restore basic
services. UNICEF’s response was largely aligned with the CCCs (see annex N°6), with different levels
of success depending on the sectors. The strategy for the recovery phase was also relevant as it was in
keeping with local needs and priorities and despite significant constraints, including the lack of long-
term funding which limited the capacity to reach the most affected people at scale.
EFFECTIVENESS: During the emergency phase, with a rapidly changing situation on the ground, most
of the emergency response was reactive (sometimes at the expense of staff safety), and it focused on
emerging needs rather than on implementing and achieving planned targets. More planning was
developed for the recovery phase in coordination with the national and local authorities and other
agencies. During this phase, it was the reactivity and adaptability of the Haiti Country Office (HCO)
that made the response effective, rather than any longer term planning process. On another level, a
serious concern remains the extent to which the office was able to maintain business continuity for the
other programmes in the other parts of Haiti and to manage two crises simultaneously: the earthquake
and the urban crisis in Port-au-Prince. However, the office was not fully staffed as key positions
remained vacant despite requests for replacements made by the HCO. The L2 declaration with the
proactive engagement of the Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office (LACRO) and UNICEF HQ
was of great help in terms of solving some of the human resources issues, facilitating access to financial
resources and easing some of the bureaucratic procedures. Fundraising was only partly successful with
the main bilateral and multilateral donors but worked relatively well with NatComs. During the
emergency phase, the most urgent health and WASH activities were mostly timely. The mobilization of
Haitian health personnel and the means to support them, the water trucking, the existence of the office
in Les Cayes and the one month “open window” in Martissant greatly facilitated the timeliness of the
early response in the Southern Peninsula. However, UNICEF’s response in GrandAnse and Les Nippes
was insufficient compared to its response in the South Department.
Despite the existence of useful tools and a number of activities carried out prior to the earthquake, the
emergency preparedness activities (EPP) had little influence on the way the Country Office’s responded
to the earthquake. The constraints linked to the access to roads, the need to work with the UNICEF
Copenhagen Supply Division and internal difficulties within Haitian counterparts significantly affected
the speed of the supplies during the emergency phase. The recovery phase was significantly hampered
by the rainy season and the blockade of the bridge in Jeremie, in addition to the difficulties getting
convoys out of Port-au-Prince.
COVERAGE: Despite efforts, UNICEF encountered many difficulties in reaching the most vulnerable
groups (e.g. communities in hard-to-reach areas, IDPs, people with disabilities,
unaccompanied/separated children, and pregnant women) during the emergency phase as many national
bodies were inadequately staffed and equipped to deliver. Things improved significantly during the
recovery phase. Though we know the number of kits that were distributed, it is not possible to assess
the number of people assisted via programmes that target community infrastructure such as water,
health, schools, etc. Nevertheless, we can say that geographic coverage was relatively significant at the
time of the RTE.

Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
EFFICIENCY: Although the RTE mission did not have the means to carry out a proper cost-efficiency
analysis, the evaluation team observed that efficiency varies significantly depending on phases, subject
and territories. Some of the hindrances in this area are linked to internal choices made by UNICEF on
procurement (“petits et grands achats”). The speed of international and local procurements varies
significantly depending on who is in charge. The mobilisation of the fleet, in particular the fleet of
vehicles based in Port-au-Prince to support the operation, which was constrained by the Martissant
blockade, was apparently not optimal, and resulted in expensive car rentals in the South.
CONNECTEDNESS: UNICEF’s approach was broadly oriented towards ensuring that infrastructure and
local services could be properly rehabilitated, and such able to deliver services, as a component of the
exit strategy for its emergency response. This was particularly important in WASH (what to do after
water-trucking) and in education (what to do to ensure that education was able to resume promptly in
appropriate buildings than in tents).
COORDINATION: Coordination within UNICEF and with other actors was a key challenge in order to
ensure that there was effective coverage of very specific, scattered and multidimensional needs.
Internally, coordination was extremely time-consuming (for example, due to the large quantity of
information that LACRO and HQ wanted to received) and did not always lead to a sufficient amount of
multi-sector coordination. Externally, UNICEF’s support to strengthen national leadership was a key
factor for the appropriateness and effectiveness of its response. In the field, UNICEF was a key player
in sub-national coordination during the emergency phase at the les Cayes level and to a lesser extent in
the GrandeAnse and Les Nippes departments, both globally (COUD) and in its thematic areas of
responsibility.
GENDER EQUALITY AND INCLUSION: In Haiti, women and children are often victims of different types
of mistreatments and require proper protection. The earthquake was seen as an aggravating factor in this
regard. Gender and disability were taken into consideration as much as constraints and the characteristics
of the context permitted. UNICEF had to develop specific workstreams with specific national
institutions and with specialized NGOs to ensure proper management of these highly sensitive issues.
The policy on Protection Against Sexual exploitation and Abuses (PSEA) was well supported at the
political level and coordinated with the UN World Food Programme (WFP).
The report includes 11 main lessons which are drawn from the findings and conclusions. Lessons 1 to 7
have been drawn from the overall response and evaluations of previous disaster responses. Lessons 8 to
11 concern UNICEF emergency management procedures.
C. CONCLUSIONS
The conclusions below, are structured in line with the 6 objectives stated in the evaluation ToRs and the
Evaluation Questions:
A) UNICEF’s response to the earthquake was appropriate and relatively effective given the needs that
it created and the significant constraints. There was substantial effort to contribute to enhanced
coordination, including with the national institutions, and to connect the short-term response with
the longer term. The lessons from previous evaluations have not been fully integrated;
B) Both during the emergency phase and during the ongoing rehabilitation phase, UNICEF has made
a significant effort to adhere operationally and programmatically to the CCCs, despite major
constraints. UNICEF’s response was facilitated a great deal by the L2 declaration.
C) The level of preparedness was low, with key HCO staff absent despite the beginning of the cyclone
season. UNICEF was caught “off guard” by the earthquake. As such, the L2 declaration was of
great help.
D) The primary focus of the M&E system is to “report to the donor and HQ” rather than being “a tool
for steering complex operations in an unpredictable environment”.
10
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
E) UNICEF did all it could to effectively respond to the needs of the most affected population. The
level of political, security, logistical and access constraints made the timeliness of the response
variable although the L2 declaration was of great help. The high level of vulnerability of the
population even prior to the earthquake made needs overwhelming. Nevertheless, efforts were
made at the local and central levels, including through interagency processes to ensure the best
coverage of the hard-to-reach rural areas.
D. RECOMMENDATIONS
The recommendations are split into 3 main categories:
a) what to do to improve the ongoing response;
b) how to better prepare for the ongoing cyclone season; and
c) key elements to contribute to “risk informed and shock responsive” Haitian development.
11
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
Recommendations for the current recovery phase:
The first set of recommendations are related to the ongoing operations (timeline: immediate). HCO
Recommendation 1: Make UNICEF’s response more effective by:
Strengthening UNICEF field presence
• Open operational offices in GrandAnse and Les Nippes
• Ensure proper logistics for these offices and their local counterparts.
• Ensure proper inclusion of gender and disability in the design of the response in all sectors
This will help ensure that all programmes achieve their targets (both quality and quantity). Furthermore, each sector can be
further reinforced:
Strengthen Health/Nutrition -
• Establish an agreement with PROMESS to pre-position medicines in the country. HCO
• Look into ways of supporting hospital departments with fuel during acute fuel crises.
• Strengthen the visibility of health/nutrition interventions in GrandAnse and Nippes.
Reinforce the WASH sector –
• Ensure strong presence of staff to support the continuation of the OREPA rehabilitation work in the three departments.
• Fund OREPA directly to accelerate future fixing of broken SAEP.
Reinforce Education and Child Protection -
• Advocate for faster construction in order to ensure that more resources are available for this process. Ensure that kits are LACRO
available before classes are opened.
• Ensure involvement of DDE in all interventions (distribution, construction monitoring, etc.)..
• Advocate for an increase in the number of IBESR staff present in the Grand Sud to avoid slowing down certain activities.
Advocate to strengthen the operational capacity of state protection agents (the institutions in charge of protection)
Social Protection and Cash Transfer -
• Strengthen UNICEF’s cash response dedicated to supporting education processes.
• Improve the HCO’s capacity to design and implement emergency cash transfer programmes in order to better respond to
the needs of vulnerable populations, including women with young children and protection cases.
Limit the weight of silo approach and develop interconnection between the different sectoral programmes
• Develop multi-sectoral team work
• Engage more in inter-agency coordination (with PAHO/WHO, WFP and FAO)
12

The second set of recommendations are related to the urgent need to enhance disaster preparedness in view of the cyclone season.
N° EQ Conclusions Recommendations Targets
5, 6, 7 C, E, Recommendation 2: Ensure optimal readiness for the cyclone season with a multi-hazard approach. HCO
Support the replenishment of emergency stocks at the COUD levels. Ensure that stocks include water treatment equipment and Sypply
products, as well as bladders. Ensure that some basic medical equipment and medicine is available in the Grand Sud. division
Organise consultations with the affected population to revise the content of the hygiene kits and ensure that a certain ,
quantity of kits is available in the Grand Sud. Include cash options to make hygiene kits more appropriate (provided that a proper LACRO
market study is carried out)
Support the institutionalization of national emergency medical teams in coordination with the MPH and PAHO. HCO,
Run training sessions for all staff on UNICEF emergency mechanisms and procedures including the use of Cash In Hand LACRO,
for the HCO team. HQ
Ensure that disability and gender are taken into account as key parameters in preparedness efforts
Recommendations for UNICEF’s strategy in Haiti
These recommendations have been tailored to help the UNICEF Haiti office prepare the next Country Programme
N° EQ Conclusion Recommendations Targets
1, 3, 5, A, B, C, D, Recommendation 3: Ensure that Disaster Risk Management is incorporated into all programmes: “risk-informed development HCO,
7 programming”. LACRO
Systematically analyse the risks potentially affecting programme implementation. Partners must develop, together with
UNICEF and MENFP, mitigation strategies to enable activities to be carried out in areas of difficult access.
Support and improve the mechanisms for crisis management (contingency PCA activation, operation, etc.) especially in the most
vulnerable departments. Invest more in national/local NGOs/CBOs. Strengthen support to national coordination systems (DGPC
and/or coordination with OCHA, IOM, WFP) for a multi-sector response. For instance, having preparedness programmes in every
school and testing evacuation plans at the beginning of the hurricane season.
Support the government’s data collection capacity in order to increase national ownership & leadership in crisis management
Reinforce AAP strategy with greater support to U-Report, social networks.
Ensure that disability and gender are taken into account as key parameters in Disaster Risk Management. This should include
gender and vulnerability analysis as well as the design of specific measures
1, 3, 6, A, C, D, Recommendation 4: Develop UNICEF’s localisation agenda for Haiti HCO
7 Continue to support local actors in the implementation of strategies to encourage victims and their relatives to report cases
through a referral system while accompanying victims in legal procedures.
Increase support to decentralised structures and support their “mobility and capacity to reach out to the field”. Ensure that
UNICEF has its own offices in the departments to provide independent project supervision in each area of operation. Improve
logistics to facilitate the mobility of UNICEF field teams, their local counterparts and partners.
Ensure that the localisation agenda includes the role of people with disabilities and takes gender& equity into consideration.
13
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
5, 6 A, B, Recommendation 5: UNICEF should engage more in strategic planning with other UN organizations HCO,
E, Develop a comprehensive 5-year “multi-agency” programme in health (including GBV response) for the Grand Sud with PAHO LACRO,
and UNFPA as there are significant needs and a positive experience with the interagency health project SIAF.. HQ
Ensure that UNICEF keeps the PSEA agenda high in the interagency debates by regularly advocating and organizing PSEA induction
and programmatic integration for new staff
Develop a collaborative action plan with WFP and FAO for schools garden. This could improve nutrition and be a good entry point for
nutritional and environmental education
2, 4, B, D, Recommendation 6: Improve internal management for crisis response HCO,
6 E, - Ensure that key positions (Dep rep, etc..) are not left absent without clear OIC delegations and arrangements to allow them to LACRO,
make critical decisions when necessary. HQ
• Training all HCO staff for the implementation of L2/3 procedures (using SOP) with operational and administrative simulation exercises,
• Continue to implement a stronger staff wellbeing strategy.
• Rapidly establish a communication and visibility strategy.
• Ensure that ToRs and end-of-mission reports of surge experts are shared and discussed.
• Ensure that the period of the surge is longer to ensure more continuity in the efforts.
• Ensure to develop Response Plan and be shared with RO/HQ for proactive support.
• Ensure that all offices understand the importance of sharing the Emergency Response Plan with RO/HQ for effective and timely support.
Recommendation 7: Strengthen the M&E capacity in all sectors and zones by having a stronger M&E team and an M&E system that is HCO
more geared towards project steering than reporting to HQ and donors, with a system of sentinel indicators and a fast track to decision- LACRO
making levels
• Develop an M&E system which is design more towards operational steering than reporting to HQ and donors

1. INTRODUCTION
This Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF’s response to the 7.2 magnitude earthquake that struck Haiti on
August 14th, 2021, was commissioned by the UNICEF Regional Office for Latin America and the
Caribbean (Terms of Reference in Annexe 1). The earthquake caused schools, homes and health centres
to collapse, leaving 2,246 people dead, 12,763 injured and small rural communities in crisis in Haiti’s
three most southerly departments (Sud, Grand’Anse, and Nippes). The main challenge resided more in
timely reaching very specific and localized necessities in poorly accessible zone and institutionally
disconnected then in attending the sheer number of humanitarian needs.
1.1. Structure of the Evaluation Report
The Report is based on the Terms of Reference (ToR) (see annexe N°1).
After an introduction presenting the objectives of the Real Time Evaluation, section 2 outlines the main
elements of the methodology and the constraints encountered during the mission.
Section 3 presents an analysis of the Haitian context.
Section 4 then looks at UNICEF’s prior to the earthquake.
Section 5 briefly describes the earthquake's impact on UNICEF's main sectors of activity
Section 6 explores a series of key findings through the lens of 7 evaluation criteria (relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, coverage, connectedness, coordination and equity) with their overarching
evaluation questions and sub questions. It also analyses the impact of UNICEF’s L2 declaration and the
key findings for the ongoing recovery phase.
In Section 7, we outline the key conclusions based on the OECD/DAC evaluation framework and the
Core Commitments for Children (UNICEF’s key UNICEF operational framework).
Section 8 summarises the main recommendations for the ongoing recovery phase, for the preparation of
the cyclone season and for risk-informed, shock-responsive development programming.
The annexes include the Terms of Reference of the evaluation, the itinerary of the mission, the list of
people interviewed during both the inception phase and the field mission and of consulted documents.
1.2. Overview of the object and scope of the RTE
The RTE focused on UNICEF’s post-earthquake activities (WASH, Education, Health, Nutrition, Child
protection, PSEA) between August 14th, 2021 and May 2022 in the 3 affected departments (Sud,
Grand’Anse & les Nippes) as well as the support provided by the UNICEF Haiti Country Office (HCO),
the Latin America & the Caribbean Regional Office (LACRO) and UNICEF Headquarters (HQ).
As the evaluation process spread took longer than initially planned (availability of the team, complex
technical discussions on the evaluation framework, etc.), It is important to note that there were two
different processes to take into account:
- The evaluation of the emergency response: this turned out not a be a “real-time” evaluation but
more an “end-of-action” evaluation, in a context where with inconsistent flow of information, fast-
changing needs and fragile state institutions. As such, there was no static response plan to compare
with but more a set of adjustable targeted response activities which were regularly adapted as more
information became available and improvements in access to the most affected zones became
reality. Other factors affecting the need to remain flexible where the development of activities of
other agencies and the availability of resources;
- The “Real-Time Evaluation” of ongoing activities with different levels of implementation: the
regular evaluation questions developed in the Terms of Reference based on the OECD/DAC criteria
had to be adapted for an UNICEF RTE process with more emphasis given to the Core Commitments
for Children in emergency and to the effects of the L2 declaration.

Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
1.3. Purpose and objectives of the RTE
The ToR indicated that the purpose of the real-time evaluation is learning and accountability. The ToR
omitted the most important aspect of a real-time evaluation which is “the provision of real-time advice”.
According to the ToR, the objectives of the RTE are to:
a. Determine the appropriateness/relevance, effectiveness, coverage, connectedness and coherence
(coordination/partnerships) of UNICEF’s response.
b. Assess the extent to which UNICEF adhered operationally and programmatically to the Core
Commitments for Children (CCCs).
c. Examine the extent to which UNICEF effectively responded to the needs of the most affected
population in a timely manner and identify gaps and appropriate strategies to improve
operational coverage and effectiveness.
d. Assess the extent to which emergency preparedness and organizational readiness have enabled Haiti
to respond more effectively to rapid onset disasters, with the objective of identifying the
factors hampering/facilitating the response.
e. Examine the extent to which the Haiti CO incorporated gender and equity dimensions (e.g.
communities in hard-to-reach areas; people with disabilities; separated, unaccompanied
children, etc.).
f. Finally, the evaluation is expected to distil lessons and make recommendations for adjusting and
improving the response and planning for recovery after sudden onset emergencies.
This evaluation is seen as particularly relevant in view of UNICEF’s important involvement in the
response, newly developed or adapted tools (such as the L2 and CCC) and the recent history of multiple
disasters in the less developed nation of the Americas.
The conclusions at the end of the report indicates how much these objectives were achieved.
During the mission, it became clear that the results of the RTE should be used to prepare the new 5-year
Haiti Country Programme (2023-2028). As such, the primary audience of the RTE is UNICEF’s
management and staff at the field, country, regional and HQ levels involved both in the response to the
earthquake and to the wider perspective of future of UNICEF operations in Haiti. The secondary
audience includes: the wider community of partners (governmental, UN agencies and other
implementing partners); people affected by the emergency, the Executive Board and interested member
states; and donor agencies who support emergency programmes with technical and financial resources
at all levels, among others.
By definition, a RTE aims to inform decision-making. The current evaluation comes at a specific
time:
- HCO is preparing its new Country Programme Document (CPD), which will be influenced by the
content and recommendations of the RTE;
- The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 invites all countries and
institutions to explore key issues related to disaster risk management (DRM) and propose new
approaches based on lessons learned. The RTE could help Haiti to make a significant contribution
to this global process, with HCO and LACRO using the results of the RTE to improve the
contribution of UNICEF in disaster management;
- With the acceleration of climate change, as described in recent IPCC reports, severe climatic
events are going to become more frequent, more impactful and more unpredictable. The RTE
therefore includes recommendations for UNICEF and the Haitian population to improve DRM
programming.

2. METHODOLOGY
2.1. Evaluation frameworks and criteria
The ToR required the RTE to use an evaluation framework based on the OECD DAC evaluation criteria
revised and adapted for humanitarian action by ALNAP https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-
b-d&q=quality+frameworks+ALNAP+DAC. The ToR drawn up by UNICEF excluded the “efficiency”
DAC criteria as there would be no time to properly collect and treat all the information necessary to
carry out a proper “cost benefit analysis”. However, the RTE team felt that the evaluation would be
incomplete if this issue was not taken into account to some extent. In order to analyse the
data/information collected, the RTE team used a set of evaluation frameworks linked to UNICEF key
activities, the L2 declaration process and the Core Commitments for Children (CCC). Other well-tested
tools were also used, such as the 9 criteria of the Core Humanitarian Standard (CHS).1
2.2. Humanitarian frameworks specific to UNICEF: L2 and CCC
UNICEF’s L2 declaration and its Core Commitment for Children in Humanitarian Action make it a
somewhat unique institution within the UN in specifically addressing disasters response with its full
institutional weight at all levels. An L2 emergency is defined by UNICEF as a situation where a Country
Office (CO) needs additional and prioritised support from other parts of the organization (Headquarters,
Regional and Country Offices), and where the Regional Office (RO) must provide dedicated leadership
and support. L2 is designed for the UNICEF Country Programme’s response (sectors and cross-cutting
areas) to be timely, appropriately assessed, designed and executed according to the Core Commitments
for Children in Humanitarian Action (CCCs). The week after the August 14th earthquake, HQ approved
the L2 declaration.
The evaluation team initially proposed to use two UNICEF frameworks (L2 declaration, CCC
framework) in addition to the classical DAC/OECD criteria as a way to have a more specific analysis
of the response. This seemed logical as these frameworks impose specific criteria which could easily be
turned into evaluation criteria. Finally, this approach was integrated into a single framework linked to
the “evaluation questions” included in the ToR but specific paragraphes and an annexe have been
dedicated to the compliance to the CCC and to the impact of the L2 declaration. In order not to lose the
very interesting points related to the “L2 Declaration evaluation framework” and the “CCC evaluation
framework”, they have been attached in the annex.

The RTE process followed the following evaluation logic:
DIAGRAM N°2: EVALUATION LOGIC
2.3. Main criteria and overarching questions guiding the report
In line with the learning component mentioned in the Terms of Reference, and discussions with LACRO,
the evaluation focuses its analysis on the following:
a. UNICEF’s response to the earthquake vis-a’-vis 7 criteria with its corresponding overarching
questions:
1. Relevance/ Appropriateness: Overarching RTE Question 1: How appropriate has UNICEF’s
response strategy (present and planned) been in reaching the most affected populations at
scale?
2. Effectiveness: Overarching RTE Question 2: To what extent has UNICEF achieved/is
UNICEF achieving its intended results within the planned timeframe? (Consider HAC,
response plans, monitoring, adherence to CCCs etc.)
3. Efficiency: not initially included in the ToR, but still taken into account. Overarching RTE
Question 4: To what extent have the technical choices made by UNICEF made best use of
rare resources?
4. Coverage: Overarching RTE Question 3: To what extent has the affected population,
including vulnerable girls and boys, displaced persons and people with disabilities, been
adequately identified, targeted and reached by UNICEF and its partners?
5. Connectedness: Overarching RTE Question 4 To what extent has UNICEF’s response
contributed to longer-term goals of preventing future emergencies, mitigating the negative
effects of future natural hazards (resilience/sustainable solutions) and preparedness?
6. Coordination: Overarching RTE Question 5: How effectively and efficiently has UNICEF
coordinated its response both internally and externally (with key entities such as other UN
agencies, civil society organisations (CSO) development partners, national and local
governments)?
7. Gender and inclusion: Overarching RTE Question 7: To what extent have gender and
disability been integrated into the needs assessment, the planning, implementation,
monitoring and reporting of the response, as well as the recovery planning?
b. The extent to which UNICEF adhered operationally and programmatically to the Core
Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action (CCCs).
c. The extent to which UNICEF effectively responded to the needs of the most affected people in
a timely manner and identified gaps and appropriate strategies to improve operational coverage
and effectiveness.

2.4. Information and data gathering methodology
The RTE adopted a mixed approach which could be summarized as follows:
- a desk review of existing secondary data and documentation2 (e.g. relevant findings from earlier
UNICEF evaluations,3 parallel inter-agency evaluations, reviews; SitReps; HAC; needs
assessments; monitoring indicators and reports; funding information; HR data; supply data; COs
preparedness and contingency plans reflected in the Emergency Preparedness Platform (EPP);
- a series of semi-structured interviews were carried out during the inception phase with key
informants in the Haiti Country Office (HCO), the Latin America Regional Office (LACRO) and
UNICEF Headquarters (HQ) (for the list interviews, see list in Annex 3). These interviews were
complemented by
- participation by a member of the evaluation team in an internal lessons learned workshop in Les
Cayes organised by HCO and LACRO on 9-10 February, 2022 (see the agenda of the Les Cayes
workshop in the annexes).
As a result of this initial process, an Inception report was produced including some preliminary findings.
Following the inception phase, the field mission took place between April 24th and May 10th, 2022. It
included:
- A series of field visits in the three affected departments to exchange with the population, UNICEF’s
NGO partners, and local administrations in the different areas of operation of UNICEF. It is
important to recall that the mission collected qualitative information and did not engage in
quantitative data generation (the itinerary of the mission is presented in annexe 2 and the list of
persons met in annexe 3). These visits allowed field observations and analysis of the quality of the
work, the way disaster risks were being taken into account and the durability of infrastructure. They
also made it possible to review the different constraints that have affected, and are still affecting,
UNICEF’s response;
- interviews with a wide range of stakeholders (90 individuals) and 12 different group discussions,
with a purposive sample of beneficiaries from affected communities. Questions discussed covered
the situation before the earthquake, the activities carried out since, the areas where people were
satisfied and the areas where improvements were required. The perception of UNICEF’s role was
also discussed.
- After the visits to each Department, feedback sessions took place with the UNICEF staff to
triangulate and validate findings and analyses and to make some initial recommendations.
- This was complemented by a series of interviews in Port-au-Prince with UNICEF staff, Haitian
institutions, UN agencies and donors. To a large extent, the agenda for the different working groups
followed the format presented above for individual interviews. There were 12 focus group meetings
and about two thirds of the key informants were women.
- Before the evaluation team left Haiti, a workshop was held involving staff from HCO, LACRO and
UNICEF HQ to present emerging findings and initial recommendations.

2.5. Information sources, collection methods and information treatment
The RTE used existing primary data (Annexe 6 presents the list of consulted documents) which was
complemented with information from field visits and interviews with a wide range of individuals in
order to include the views of:
- National stakeholders in the response: collecting the views of these national actors (the Haitian
Civil Protection Agency, the Ministries of Health, Education, and Social Protection, the DINEPA
at both central and decentralized levels, and staff from the three most affected municipalities - Les
Cayes, Miragoane and Jérémie) was a key part of the RTE process;
- International actors: UN staff, including UNICEF staff in different positions, international and
national NGOs, donors);
- Haitian NGOs and CBOs: including mutual aid networks, and groups linked to the diaspora.
- Donors: ECHO, AFD, the French Embassy, etc.
- Representatives of coordination mechanisms: UN, NGOs, clusters, PCs, town halls.
- Haitians affected by the earthquake and targeted by the intervention, particularly the most
vulnerable (e.g. displaced persons, people with disabilities, hard-to-reach communities, and people
who have not left their homes but have endured significant difficulties).
Several social science tools were used and are presented below. Examples of interview guides are
presented in Annexe 3.
Sampling strategy
As there was no generation of quantitative data, the sampling strategy focused on qualitative approaches
in order to get the broadest range of perspectives on UNICEF activities. Site visits were chosen on the
basis of UNICEF’s activities in different environments:
- Activities in urban settings
- Activities in easily accessible rural areas
- Activities in hard-to-reach rural areas
In the different sites, the RTE team discussed UNICEF’s response with the local authorities, local primo-
responders, local managers of health and WASH facilities and the populations using them.
The mission conducted many field visits and covered the 3 departments of the Grand Sud, as shown on
the map below:
MAP N°1: ITINERARY OF THE MISSION
21
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
Timelines
Experience shows that establishing and comparing timelines is a way of objectifying, comparing and
validating narratives that may otherwise be difficult to reconcile. Several periods of time were discussed
during the interviews and focus groups.
- The month before
- The first 48 hours
- The first two weeks
- The first two months
- From the fourth to the sixth month
Testimonies and life stories
The recording of 'life stories' is one of the most powerful tools in the social sciences for gathering
perceptions, and listening and understanding complex facets of multiple realities. It was very
informative to have insight into a broad range of perspectives:
- Affected people (aid seen through the eyes of those it is supposed to serve):
o By age and by gender
o By socio-economic categories.
- Aid actors (aid as seen by those who implement it):
o Informal solidarity
o Traditional NGOs and International NGOs
- Authorities:
o National actors
o Departmental representatives of line ministries, municipal actors, etc.;
- Donors
- Coordination bodies
Information analysis and validation
The RTE did not engage in primary quantitative data production and gathered only qualitative
information. The information was collected through intensive field visits and discussed with different
types of stakeholders. Validation took place during a set of workshops both at the departmental and at
the Port-au-Prince levels where findings, conclusions and initial recommendations were presented, in
order to triangulate and verify them.
Without compromising the independence of the exercise, RTEs are participatory in nature and built
around regular interaction with key stakeholders. As such, the team participated in several workshops
after each departmental visit and a final workshop organised prior to their departure from the country.
These workshops were a key opportunity for the evaluators to share their findings and
recommendations at the country level, and for stakeholders, in turn, to validate the findings and
conclusions prior to the finalization of the evaluation report.
Information was systematically triangulated through document analysis, site visits, interviews in the
field and in Port-au-Prince and through video-conferencing. Information that was not triangulated was
not included in the report

TRIANGULATION
PROCESS
2.6. Limits, risks and mitigation measures
In a context such as Haiti, there is a very high level of risks and uncertainty. A number of possible
mitigation measures to offset the risks in conducting the evaluation were therefore developed prior to
the mission.
2.6.1. Contextual risks and uncertainty
The context analysis presented in the first part of the Inception Report and validated at the beginning of
the field mission underlined all the difficulties of operating in the Haitian environment
- Political and gang-related insecurity: this affects transport, access to the field, the choice of
locations for nights in the field, etc.
- Earthquakes: these are unpredictable.
- Extreme climatic events: During the cyclone season, these can be anticipated and monitored
relatively well thanks to existing specialized media and tools. The danger comes from the
growing probability of extreme events outside the normal season due to climate change.
- Health issues: In Haiti, there are significant health risks, including cholera, COVID, dengue
fever, diarrhoea, etc.
2.6.2. Difficulties in accessing information
- The quality of data and information: For an RTE taking place long after the events, there is
a risk that what people remember might, at best, be selective, and at worst, inaccurate. In
addition the design of the UNICEF M&E system (see paragraph 1.2.) did not provide
information in a timely and user-friendly manner. In fact, the team had to ask several times to
be given access to information that should have been readily available, not so much for the
evaluation itself but for proper programme steering;
- Many people had left the affected areas: after a few months, many international staff had
already left the Southern departments and even Haiti. However, many Haitian colleagues, and
of course the inhabitants of the affected areas, were still there and were able to be interviewed
properly.
- The limited development of planning, monitoring and steering mechanisms. Most of the
project management systems are related to programme outputs and outcomes but are not clearly
connected to contextual analysis, critical contextual indicators, or the flow of information to
decision-making levels in real time.
23
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
‘Evaluability’ depends on having a base with which you can compare the observed response (quality of
the programme design and availability of related information) and the context’s characteristics
facilitating or hindering the search of information. Issues to be dealt with during the mission were:
- There was only a limited level of information in terms of reactive planning for the emergency
phase. More documents were developed for the rehabilitation phase.
- Though access to and circulating within Port-au-Prince was highly problematic, access to the
affected areas and populations was only hindered by a few physical difficulties which were
easily overcome.
2.6.3. Mitigation measures related to the identified risks
Vigilance and continuous communication with the UNICEF team were required to manage the existing
risks. The team ensured that it had all the available means of communicating with UNICEF (radio,
mobile phones, satellite connections). Security briefings with UNICEF security staff and UNDSS took
place at the beginning of the mission to ensure that the team was fully aware of up-to-date information
on risks and related existing security measures for transport, overnight stays, etc. Dangerous areas were
notified when needed and UNICEF and UN field security processes were fully respected when access
was required.
2.6.4. Summary of risk management strategy
For each of these risks, mitigation measures were identified during the inception phase and had to be
deployed with context-specific and time-bound considerations during the mission:

Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
2.7. Ethical considerations
As for any process involving the collection and treatment of potentially sensitive personal and
organisational information, there were important ethical considerations related to protecting sources, so
no name is quoted unless permission was granted to the evaluation team. This is particularly critical as
many UNICEF programmes that are being evaluated concern children and women. The RTE team
referred to the following guidance documents in order to protect personal information and the security
of interviewed people:
• United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards for Evaluation in the UN System
2016; (including impartiality, independence, quality, transparency, and consultative process);
• Ethical Guidelines for UN Evaluations;
• UNICEF Ethical Guidelines and standards for research and evaluation;
• UNEG guidance on integrating human rights and gender equality and UN System-Wide Action Plan
(UN-SWAP) on gender equality;
• Relevant ALNAP guidance for evaluation and real-time evaluations of humanitarian action;
The evaluation team did their best to ensure that the people interviewed were informed of the
purpose of the interviews, with a presentation of the RTE objectives and processes. In addition, the
interviewees were informed that the source of any information used would remain anonymous.

3. HAITI: A COMPLEX OPERATIONAL CONTEXT
3.1. The Haitian political and socio-economic situation
Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita
of US$756 in 2019.4 It is ranked 170th out of 189 countries on the Human Development Index (HDI)
(2018), with an HDI value much lower than the regional average (0.510 compared to 0.766 for Latin
America and the Caribbean). The country's socio-economic situation is also marked by significant
inequalities in human development: the Gini index was 41.1 in 2012, ranking Haiti 57th in the world.
The main factors of inequality that can lead to exclusion are the living environment (rural or urban), the
department of residence, the level of family income and the educational status of the mother or head of
the family.
The latest poverty survey in 20125 puts the number of Haitians living below the poverty line (less than
USD 2.41 per day) at 6 million, i.e. more than half the population, including 2.5 million in extreme
poverty (less than USD 1.23 per day). According to the latest United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) report on the HDI in Haiti (2020) and based on 2016 data, 41.3% of the population lives in
multidimensional poverty and 21.8% are considered vulnerable to multidimensional poverty. Both urban
and rural contexts are affected by food insecurity, high levels of malnutrition and significant levels of
unemployment. In the last 20 years, the country has been affected by the earthquake of 2010, hurricane
Matthew in 2016, a cholera epidemic, and a series of political crises. Since 2018, it has been faced with
anti-government demonstrations, gang violence and kidnappings. The COVID 19 pandemic hit Haiti as
well. With the country already caught up in a major crisis that the authorities were struggling to cope
with, 2021 was a particularly difficult year socially and politically.

Increased criminal activity by armed gangs and related dramatic consequences
Since 2019, gang violence has made the situation in the Martissant area extremely difficult for the
inhabitants with the government unable to resolve the crisis. Due to the growing number of shootings
and attacks by armed gangs,6 thousands of Martissant residents fled7 the area in June 2021. National
Road 2, the main artery8 to reach the Grand Sud region, is regularly blocked by the gangs. Those who
take the road do so at their own risk. In December 2021, a bus carrying 38 passengers was attacked by
bandits9 and several people were injured. Between October and November 2021, the country had to deal
with a major fuel shortage due to armed gangs who blocked access to oil terminals. This paralysed
several institutions. Health centres had to stop receiving new patients. 2021 also saw a significant
increase in kidnappings. Between January 1st and December 15th, 2021, there were 949 recorded
kidnappings, with 55 foreign nationals among the victims. These events had significant repercussions
on humanitarian operations.
Constitutional controversy surrounding the end of the President’s mandate
In January and February 2021, there were protests10 about when President Jovenel Moise’s term in office
should officially end. The President and his allies contended that his term would end on February 7th,
2022,11 but the opposition parties and certain civil society groups12 argued that it should end on February
7th, 2021. Referring to the contested constitution, the President had ended the mandates of MPs and
certain Senators13 in 2020 rather than in 2021, leaving the legislative authority in an institutional
vacuum. As a result, the country had no effective legislative authority14 to control the actions of the
government.
Assassination of President Jovenel Moise
On July 7th, 2021,15 the country was plunged into a state of shock and uncertainty following the
assassination of the President at his residence. A few days before the President’s tragic death, he had
issued an order appointing a new government,16 but the latter was unable to take up its functions. The
outgoing government acted as the interim authority following the assassination.
Migration crises
In September 2021, there was also a major migration crisis. Many Haitians who tried to migrate to other
countries were repatriated. At least 165 pregnant Haitian women were deported by the Dominican
Republic back to Haiti.17 At the end of September 2021, the situation was also chaotic between the
Mexican and American border, where more than 3,700 Haitian migrants were repatriated to Haiti.18 The
combination of an ongoing political crisis, socio-economic challenges, food insecurity and gang
violence further deteriorated the precarious humanitarian situation. Some 4.4 million people, or nearly
46 per cent of the population, were in a position of acute food insecurity, including 1.2 million in an
Emergency situation (IPC Phase 4) and 3.2 million people in a Crisis situation (IPC Phase 3). An
estimated 217,000 children were suffering from moderate-to-severe acute malnutrition.

The COVID pandemic.
After the cholera crisis, which now seems to be under control, with no new cases over the last 3 years,
Haiti was hit by the COVID 19 pandemic. By the end of January 2022, there had been 29,323 cases and
876 deaths reported.19 The numbers continue to rise. The COVID pandemic further limited staff
movement and supplies. It also further increased pressure on the health sector, with 24 facilities affected
by the earthquake.
3.2. A disaster-prone country
Located in the Caribbean Sea, and crossed by a complex system of seismic faults, Haiti is significantly
exposed to both tectonic and hydro-climatic risks. Over the years, and particularly since the 2010
earthquake in Port-au-Prince (see table below), there has been significant effort to increase the response
capacity of Haitian institutions. The Haitian Civil Protection agency or DGPC had been transformed in
the mid-2000 into a fully-fledged disaster management unit with its own national emergency centre, the
COUN and several regional emergency centres (COUD). Significant resources have been invested to
strengthen Haiti’s disaster management system, with key donors including UNDP, the World Bank,
France and British Foreign aid (FCDO) and regional cooperation mechanisms such as CARICOM
(Caribbean Community) and Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM).
When there have been disasters in the past, the proximity with the US coast and with Dutch and French
territories and former territories has made it easier to rapidly mobilise significant levels of assets and
support. It is important to note that despite the regular occurrence of seismic events, most disaster
preparedness efforts are still focused on hydroclimatic events. However, efforts to strengthen response
capacity at the department level have had an impact at different times, particularly during Hurricane
Matthew.20
The table below presents the succession of different disasters that have taken place since 2004. One
important point that stands out is how frequently the Southern peninsula has been affected by
earthquakes, hurricanes and tropical storms over the last 20 years.21
Unfortunately, risks are probably on the rise as the environmental degradation of Haiti’s forests and land
mean that even heavy rains will cause significant damage, without mentioning tropical storms and
hurricanes.

4. UNICEF IN HAITI PRIOR TO THE EARTHQUAKE
UNICEF’s country programme document (CPD), which was duly evaluated in 2020,22 is aligned with
the United Nations Development Assistance Framework 2017-2021 (UNDAF), with a particular focus
on outcomes 2 (social services) and 5 (governance). It is also aligned with the 2030 Agenda and its
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). One can note that the new United Nations Sustainable
Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) was not used for the current cycle due to the
prevailing instability and the weakness of the national counterparts. The programming cycle has been
extended until February 2023.
The ultimate goal of the programme is “to ensure the survival, development, participation and protection
of children and their caregivers, with particular attention to the most disadvantaged and excluded
children”. It emphasizes that sector-based projects should converge programmatically and
geographically in order to best address the needs of Haitian children. The programme is structured
around the six following components: Health; Nutrition; WASH; Education; Child Protection; and
Programme Effectiveness. The Country Office has developed the Programme Strategy Notes (PSNs)
with theories of change for each sector. The programme effectiveness component, which does not have
a PSN, ensures that the following elements are shared across the entire office: coherence between
programmes, external relations and institutional communication, programme monitoring and evaluation,
integration of gender, communication for development (C4D), social policies and social protection.
The strategies implemented to achieve the objectives are as follows: political dialogue and advocacy;
provision of services; capacity building; generation of evidence; South-South and horizontal cooperation
with countries in Latin America, the Caribbean and other regions.
The country programme document (CPD) was finalised in October 2016. It placed great emphasis on
the cross-cutting integration of gender equality and women’s empowerment and insists on the
coordination efforts to be carried out at the national level. The Country Programme was reviewed in the
Strategic Moment of Reflection (SMR) exercise in 2019 and sectoral PSNs and Results Frameworks
were revised. The programme has the following six complementary approaches:
- Multisectoral convergence in priority departments, several of which have been affected by
natural hazards and cholera, particularly in border communities;
- Gender approach at all levels. Although the Country Office must have a gender specialist to
support staff guidance, it only has a very committed gender focal point (C4D national officer).
The CO doesn’t have a Gender Based Violence (GBV) specialist under the Country Programme
section either. It is a significant weakness as it is very difficult to put the proper emphasis on
gender equality in a Country Programme without appropriate human resources;
- An integrated and environmentally friendly approach, notably combining WASH interventions
and cholera control measures, in order to strengthen the complementarity and continuity of
humanitarian and development activities;
- Integration of HIV/AIDS interventions throughout the programmes;
- Integration of gender and adolescent programmes, with emphasis on combatting violence
against women and children as well as HIV prevention;
- The consideration, in each component of the country programme, of risk mitigation, emergency
preparedness and response;
- And an integrated approach to social and child protection in order to reach the most excluded
children.

Hurricane Matthew hit the south of the country in mid-2016, affecting 2.1 million people. The evaluation
of UNICEF’s response to that disaster generated a series of recommendations- 6 of which are
particularly relevant to this RTE and are highlighted in the box below.
Relevant recommendations from the Hurricane Matthew evaluation23
1- Advocacy towards donors for more flexible and rapid funding;
2- Efforts towards mapping hard-to-reach zones;
3- Integrating aspects of transition between emergency and development into
programming;
4- Expanding cash-based programming;
5- Unifying the different hotlines used by humanitarian actors during emergency
responses; and
6- Planning an evaluation of the Humanitarian Performance Monitoring (HPM)
system.
TABLE N°2: RECOMMENDATIONS FROM HURRICANE MATTHEW
Following a massive influx of funds for the response to Hurricane Matthew, the Country Office had to
immediately reorient its programmes towards humanitarian and recovery interventions, with changes in
the geographical coverage of the Country Programme Document (CPD) and an increase in its
operational capacities. The first two years of the CPD were therefore marked by a major emphasis on
emergency response.
In 2020, Haiti was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.24 On March 11th 2020, UNICEF declared a
worldwide L3 emergency which had significant repercussions for operations. Personal Protective
Equipment (PPE) was distributed to all staff and partners. Hand washing points were established
throughout the country. Meetings were systematically held online and, for a period, masks were worn
to enter offices and to visit colleagues.
Another key area touching different sectors of activities for UNICEF was disaster risk management (this
was made possible thanks to a DG ECHO disaster preparedness programme). Interviews in several
health and education institutions and WASH sites underlined the fact that UNICEF has made significant
effort to implement some ‘risk-informed programming’ and has continued to promote good practices in
disaster preparedness.

5. THE 2021 EARTHQUAKE: HOW THE EVENTS UNFOLDED
5.1. The earthquake
On August 14th, 2021 at 8:29 AM local time, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck the south-western coast
of Haiti causing large-scale damage across the country’s southern peninsula. The 10 km deep earthquake
occurred 13 km southeast of Petit-Trou-de-Nippes, in the Department of Nippes, the same region
devastated by Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Only two days after the earthquake, Tropical Depression
Grace led to extremely heavy rain in southern Haiti,25 causing flooding in the same quake-affected areas.
MAP N°2: MAP OF THE AREAS AFFECTED BY THE EARTHQUAKE (SOURCE DG ECHO)
There was great concern about the forecasted arrival of Hurricane Grace26 a few days after the
earthquake, especially given the devastation that had been caused by Hurricane Matthew a few years
before. Luckily, Grace became less violent, taking the form of a tropical storm accompanied by heavy
rains. Many of the areas affected by the earthquake were affected, making relief operations more
complicated, but the situation did not become as disastrous as feared.
Despite being much less catastrophic than the 2010 earthquake in Port-au-Prince, which had left more
than 220,000 people dead and 1.5 million injured, the impact of the August earthquake was still
devastating, despite the efforts made to enhance the country’s national response capacity. The Haitian
Civil Protection Agency reported 2,246 deaths, 329 missing persons and 12,763 injured.27 According to
the PDNA, almost 53,000 homes were destroyed and more than 77,000 sustained damage. About
800,000 people were affected and an estimated 650,000 people – 40 per cent of the 1.6 million people
living in the affected departments – were in need of emergency humanitarian assistance.

MAP N°3 : HUMAN IMPACT OF THE EARTHQUAKE (Source : Evaluation post désastre en Haïti, Séisme du 14 août
2021 dans la péninsule sud : DGPC/UNDP)28
The combined impact of the earthquake and tropical storm Grace29 left 650,000 people in need of
emergency humanitarian assistance. 500,000 were targeted by UN agencies and humanitarian partners
through the activities planned under the Flash Appeal for $187.3 million. Based on an initial impact
assessment, the government estimated that the damage exceeded US$1 billion, as national authorities
planned a more detailed assessment of damages, losses and post-earthquake needs in collaboration with
the tripartite partnership comprised of the World Bank, European Union, United Nations under the
leadership of the Ministry for Planning and external cooperation (MPCE).
5.2. The impact of the earthquake by sector and the global response
This chapter briefly describes the impacts of the earthquake on the population, including on each of
UNICEF’s sectors of activity.
The impact on health30
The Ministry of Health reported that 105 (78%) of the 136 facilities31 in the Grand Sud32 were either
intact or had only sustained minor damage. However, the issue was not so much the number of injured
per facility requiring medical treatment but the fact that previously hospitalised patients had to be treated
in the open due to fears that the buildings might eventually collapse. Long before the earthquake, there
was a chronic lack of medical supplies and basic services.33 Many of the injured and the high-risk
patients were only reached later or were unable to access health services as they were in deep rural areas,
without any means of transportation.34

It took several days for the authorities and the international community to realize that there was damage
along a broad strip on both sides of the fault line. As such, a large number of small, specialised health
services were required, rather than large field hospitals.
Life-saving activities were the priority during the first days. On August 14th, the MSPP activated its
Medical Information and Coordination Cell (CICOM – Cellule d’Information et de Coordination
Médicale), also referred to as the EMT Coordination Cell (EMTCC), to coordinate the efforts from all
Haitian medical staff and international Emergency Medical Teams (EMT) and the deployment for those
of the teams that were accepted by the Government of Haiti. As of August 30th, nearly 10 international
EMTs had been deployed – four in Sud and one in Les Nippes. National medical staff mobilised by the
Ministry of Health (MoH) were the first on site. Nutrition was not perceived as an immediate need by
the MoH. In the weeks following the earthquake, it re-established breastfeeding and other regular
nutrition programmes that had been interrupted before or due to the earthquake. 62% of health facilities
were affected, with 23% being too seriously damaged to be able to provide services. The MoH firmly
coordinated the technical nutrition group. It
took a couple of days to intervene in the
affected areas as the Ministry of Health
prioritized life-saving activities within the
first 48 hours. The population rapidly
indicated less interest in food aid and a
preference for agricultural assistance.
Southern Haiti is one of the most fertile parts
of the country and it recovered faster than
expected after Hurricane Matthew. In
addition, apart from the limited number of
cases where mothers are killed or are unable
to practice breastfeeding, the nutritional
impacts of earthquakes are often only seen
long after the event if food production and
accessibility are affected. PHOTO N°5: AN AMBULANCE MOBILIZED FOR THE MOBILE UNITS
WASH35
With thousands displaced and sleeping in the streets and water and sanitation infrastructure having
sustained extensive damage, vulnerable populations were becoming increasingly exposed to the risk of
infectious diseases, acute respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, malaria and COVID-19. As such,
there was a pressing need for access to safe water for consumption, sanitation services and hygiene
promotion. The effectiveness of international assistance was increased due to that of the national water
regulation agency (Direction Nationale de l’Eau Potable et de l’Assainissement (DINEPA)), and the
regional service delivery body (the Office Régionale de l'Eau Potable et de l'Assainissement du Sud
(OREPA-Sud)) which covers all 4 departments of the Southern peninsula. There is a lot of experience
in water trucking in Haiti among the WASH sector staff. The whole process was rapidly put in place,
including pumping water from rivers, using specific water treatment systems, transportation with
specialised trucks and storage (bladders, water containers, etc.). In view of the difficulty of rapidly
rehabilitating the many small sanitation and water distribution systems (SAEP) damaged by the
earthquake, or made weak by years of limited maintenance, water trucking had to be continued for a
few months. Rehabilitation work started in many geographical areas, although many difficulties were
encountered in the field. The transportation of supplies, including high pressure resistant polypropylene
pipes, connections, etc. was held up by the Martissant blockade.

Education36
Even before the earthquake of August 14th, 2021, the education system was facing major problems, such
as insufficient human resources, limited material resources, inadequate or non-existent facilities in some
places and unusable roads, especially during the rainy season, limiting the ability of inspectors to do
their jobs. According to the education sector report, the number of schools damaged or collapsed by the
August 14th earthquake was estimated at around 1,250. This included both the public sector and private
sector schools. However, the losses were higher in the private sector (66%). As for the departments
affected, the South was the most affected, with nearly 45% of the estimated damage and losses, followed
by the Grand’Anse department, with more than 30% of the damage and losses. This situation resulted
in the interruption of school services in the three departments and directly or indirectly affected 307,359
students. The effects of the earthquake affected 7,512 teachers and 1,000 school directors.
Child protection37
In response to the earthquake, many of the awareness-raising, recreational and psychosocial support
activities were practically finished at the time of the RTE as they were financed by the early emergency
6 month funds. But significant challenges on child protection are still present. Longer-term activities are
needed as it is difficult to rapidly change mentalities and to establish social mechanisms to cope with
the traumas after abuses. It is likely to require time and means as in Haiti, the violence against children
is deeply rooted in several causes in particular multidimensional poverty.
Equity Gender38
The direct and longer-term impacts are significant. According to several interviews, many men were
killed on their way to their fields, leaving behind their wives, who are now widows. It should be noted
that even though detailed gender analyses were carried out after the earthquake, they did not provide
detailed gender desegregated data on the death toll consequence of the earthquake. Many water facilities
and schools were destroyed, increasing the burden on women and girls due to additional work fetching
water and caring for children unable to attend school. The memories of abuse of power by humanitarian
professionals in previous disasters39 in the country were still present among humanitarian institutions.

The political instability and lack of trust in the Haitian political system was a significant obstacle in
terms of raising funds at the time of the earthquake. The rising financial needs related to the crisis in
Afghanistan and the war in Ukraine, and the prospect of a global food crisis, are likely to make
fundraising efforts even more difficult for Haiti.40

6. FINDINGS
The earthquake occurred at 08:29:09 EDT on Saturday August 14th, 2021. UNICEF’s response was
immediate. Within minutes several staff, both in Port-au-Prince and the Les Cayes sub-office, called
their counterparts in the department’s level. That morning, UNICEF participated in the first meeting
with the Directorate General for Civil Protection (DGPC) in Port-au-Prince. By the evening of August
14th, the first trucks with UNICEF supplies reached Les Cayes, thanks to its committed transporters who
were able to cross the gang-controlled area of Martissant. Rapidly, UNICEF deployed staff to Les Cayes,
a deployment facilitated by the existence of the Les Cayes office and a certain level of legitimacy due
to previous activities related to the cholera crisis, Hurricane Matthew and COVID-19. The response in
the field was based more on the level of resources available than on needs. Choices had to be made
based on resource availability, presence in the field, accessibility, and the presence of other agencies.
TABLE N°4 : FUNDING OF THE OPERATIONS (SOURCE UNICEF HCO)
The table above shows the significant funding gap in all sectors, with some more underfunded than
others, this partly reflecting inter-agency competition for funding. For instance, a large grant for WASH
was given to an NGO while UNICEF expected to receive it.
As requested in the ToR, UNICEF’s response to the 2021 earthquake is analysed below by criteria,
overarching questions and RTE sub questions or Evaluation Questions (EQ).
6.1. Relevance/ Appropriateness: 1
WHETHER THE RESPONSE IS IN LINE WITH LOCAL NEEDS AND PRIORITIES (AS WELL AS DONOR POLICY) AND HUMANITARIAN
ACTIVITIES ARE TAILORED TO LOCAL NEEDS,
Overarching RTE Question N°1 How appropriate is UNICEF’s response strategy (present and
planned) in reaching the most affected populations at scale? By and large, UNICEF’s response
strategy for the emergency phase was appropriate as it was extremely flexible and responded to
needs as they emerged. The response strategy for the recovery phase was more complex, based on
better knowledge of the earthquake’s impact. Both strategies nevertheless were constrained by
the evolving Haitian context. In many remote rural areas, the process took time. In addition, direct
engagement with communities by UNICEF remained marginal. Despite efforts made since Hurricane
Matthew, preparedness was still too underdeveloped to ensure it could fully play its role.
38
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
RTE Sub question
1.1. To what extent is UNICEF’s response aligned with and tailored to the needs of the most
affected populations? Relatively well. Here again, it is important to recall how long and cumbersome
was the process to access many remote rural areas. These areas were underserved by partners before the
earthquake and only started to get a meaningful response during the recovery phase. The absence of a
proper UNICEF office in Jeremie and Miragoane was a real hindrance from the beginning of the
response which led to insufficient needs assessment and analysis and affected the relevance of the
immediate response and the effectiveness of the recovery period in the Grand’Anse and Nippes
departments.
1.2. What tools (i.e. methodologies, situation analysis, needs assessments, data systems etc.) were
used to gauge these needs? /To what extent where these tools sufficiently appropriate to deliver
what they were design for? Due to the difficulty of gaining access to the affected areas immediately
after the earthquake, needs were gauged via phone calls, when feasible field visits and meetings with
local authorities and partners. Discussions between international actors and the COUN about using the
newly designed needs assessment form hindered the speed of the data collection and created some
disparities which were detrimental to the planning process. The national institutions were not always
able to play their role providing information, with significant differences between sectors. WASH was
far better than others due to the pre-existing network with the OREPA/URD and CAEPA teams. Data
systems remained sub-optimal with limited connectivity and staff shortages. For the recovery phase,
UNICEF had largely to base its assessment on partner reports rather on its own assessements. One of
the main issues on M&E is that the system is based on a process of data collection and treatment which
is largely designed to feed the internal UNICEF reporting system and facilitate donor reporting. Thus,
it is not a “project steering” system. The method and rhythm of data collection does not permit proper
project management. T here are no contextual indicators. A system of sentinel indicators that could be
collected and processed rapidly would provide information that informed decision making.
1.3. To what extent have affected populations been involved in the needs assessment, delivery and
management of humanitarian assistance? Affected people were interviewed during the assessment
phase, but were far less involved during the implementation phases. Local recruitments for some
recovery projects (in WASH and school reconstruction) also contributed to the engagement of local
people. One innovation was the system of U-Reporters - volunteers from the community who collect
information and send it to UNICEF. It is to be noted that UNICEF’s engagement with affected people
was marginal and often limited to the provision of work.
1.4. To what extent was a system of information management and disaster management in place
prior to the crisis? The initial response by the CO and RO was only marginally informed and enabled
by elements of preparedness. The initial response was most successful and impactful in places where
there had been pre- earthquake-preparedness activities, such as in Les Cayes, where staff were present,
or where supplies had been prepositioned. However, the level of preparedness was lower than expected
given the investment that is supposed to have been made in the country in recent years. The slow-
activation of the MENFP emergency plan,41 and limited efforts by DINEPA to have “emergency
latrines” available are two examples of this low level of investment in preparedness. It is important to
not that recent preparedness efforts focused on cyclones and not on the risk of earthquakes. In addition,
these efforts were not sustained enough to generate institutional operational changes.

1.5. How internally coherent/consistent has the response been between the various sectors of
UNICEF’s response? / how integrated was UNICEF’s approach across key sectors when
addressing key priorities (e.g. WASH, Child Protection, etc.)? Despite efforts both at field and CO
levels, UNICEF still functions by silos, each of them having is own budget, staff and reporting line, thus
making the intersector coherence a long term goal. At the field level, each sector tried to deliver
emergency assistance in a rush, and not necessarily in a coordinated manner with other sectors. In
addition, several interviews underlined the existence of a certain disconnect between the centre of
operations (Port-au-Prince) and the periphery (Les Cayes field office) despite significant efforts to
connect by telephone, meetings or visio-conferences. This impacted the work as field staff were not
always aware of or present at the arrival of supplies or surge team. The multitude of tasks and daily
meetings were additional constraints. The February lessons learnt meeting in Les Cayes underlined the
limits in internal cohesion both within the UNICEF Country Office and between LACRO and HCO.
These tensions were regularly mentioned during meetings at all levels. The pressure on staff was
enormous, with most people were working round the clock and spending up to six hours of meeting per
day, especially during the first few weeks. This did not create a working environment facilitating
intersectorial connections 42. Things improved significantly during the recovery phase as projects were
taken in a more holistic way, thus facilitating multi sectoral approaches.
1.6. To what extent was the response designed to complement the activities of other humanitarian
partners (NGOs, UN agencies, and of course Haitian institutions) operating in the most affected
areas? UNICEF’s response was largely designed in a coordinated manner with other partners. This was
done through the coordination mechanisms where UNICEF has a significant role: WASH, education,
child protection and health/nutrition. Another area where the strong involvement of UNICEF to support
the community of aid actors was frequently mentioned is PSEA. In terms of cash transfers, an area
where UNICEF had less expertise, it tried to coordinate with more experienced agencies, such as WFP.
However, there was also some competition between agencies. For example, there was competition with
WFP over the model of schools to be rebuilt.
1.7. How coherent is UNICEF’s response with the priorities/responses of the affected government?
UNICEF’s response was very coherent with the priorities of the Haitian authorities. It was in keeping
with the direction given by the Resident Coordinator to ensure proper leadership by the national and
local authorities. UNICEF embedded many of its strategic interventions within the coordination
umbrella of COUN at the central level, within the COUDs at the departmental levels, and also within
the line ministries (Education, Health, Social Affairs, DINEPA) and their departmental offices. There
were a few areas that required a significant level of dialogue to ensure proper alignment between
UNICEF and the authorities at the central and local levels, such as “temporary versus permanent
schools”43 or “how to deliver WASH services to IDP sites that were not supposed to exist”.44 Each time,
there was dialogue to find a solution to improve the situation of the population (see sectoral
paragraphs).45
1.8. How consistent has the response been with the core principles of humanitarian action? Several
core humanitarian principles relating to conflicts such independence and neutrality are not central to
earthquake disaster responses. However, coordination with national authorities is essential. During the
first weeks of the response, another key humanitarian principle, impartiality, was compromised due to
logistical and financial constraints, as aid was allocated not only on the basis of needs, but also on the
basis of access.

Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
The key issue here is the limited level of knowledge among UNICEF staff of International Disaster Law
and the Core Humanitarian Standard (CHS).46 Interesting to note that, despite this large ignorance of
these Core Humanitarian Standards, UNICEF’s post-disaster operations were relatively consistent with
them. Putting the government at the centre of operations meant that there was respect for national
sovereignty. Efforts to apply the “do no harm’ principle” were not obvious. For specific issues related
to CCC, the reader can refer to the dedicated paragraph below and in Annexe 6.
6.2. Effectiveness:
THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE RESPONSE ACHIEVES ITS PURPOSE, OR WHETHER THIS CAN BE EXPECTED TO HAPPEN ON THE BASIS OF
THE OUTPUTS
Overarching RTE Question N°2: To what extent has UNICEF achieved its intended results
within the planned timeframe? (Consider HAC, response plans, monitoring, adherence to L2,
CCCs etc.)
It is difficult to answer this question for the emergency phase as UNICEF had no real planned framework
beyond deploying response means to cope with a largely unknown and fast-changing situation.
UNICEF’s effectiveness was thus less related to “achieving intended targets” and more to do with its
capacity to engage rapidly and energetically in a series of emergency response interventions. This was
very appreciated by all actors, although the whole process was not as optimal as expected due to
confusion on the information form to use between aid agencies and the DGPC.47 Planning improved
during the recovery phase, but constraints did limit the achievement of some of the intended targets (In
particular in education where the reconstruction of schools proved more difficult than expected, and in
WASH, where supplies of goods were constrained by DINEPA procedures and by logistical problems).
RTE sub-question
2.1. How realistic/feasible are planned targets (e.g. in Humanitarian Action for Children) and to
what extent are they based on situation analysis and updated as new information becomes
available? During the emergency phase, there was no real Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC).
Most of the emergency response was reactive: it was implemented to deal with emerging needs rather
than linked to any “planned targets” as the situation was fast-changing, and operational plans were very
rapidly outdated. UNICEF nevertheless updated its HAC after the August earthquake. But the reliability
and seriousness of such a document, with very precise targets, is questionable in a highly uncertain
situation, with limited reliable data. There is also some concern about the level of competence within
UNICEF in terms of using data. UNICEF also provided support to the initial damage and needs
assessment in the most affected areas by collecting information through its network of key informants
and sharing it in interagency forums. More sector-based planning was developed for the recovery phase
in terms of supporting national and local priorities as defined by the different line ministries, and in
collaboration with other agencies (PAHO/WHO and UNFPA in particular, as well as with WFP).
UNICEF’s efforts to support initial assessments through its field staff and connections helped to plan
the first operations, in particular in Health and WASH. The response was constrained by access
difficulties and the complexity of the context, and many of the initial objectives could not be met. OCHA
launched a Flash Appeal a few days after the earthquake requesting $187.3 million to support the aid
response.

Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
2.2. What factors contributed to or limited UNICEF’s success? (HR surge; fundraising;
communication w/donors and UNICEF National Committees)/ What role the COs, the RO and
HQ play in this? During the emergency phase, the proactivity of the Haiti Country Office was key to
the response. A range of factors contributed to or limited the effectiveness of the Office. These are
summarized below.
Staffing
At the beginning of the response, the Haiti Country Office was not fully staffed. Some key positions (in
particular the Deputy Representative), remained vacant for a long period despite requests for
replacements. The absence of key staff such as the Deputy Representative or the Head of the Emergency
Sector, made the work rather complicated. According to all the interviewees, the arrival of highly
experienced staff on surge from UNICEF HQ, from LACRO and from other UNICEF offices was
critical in alleviating this deficit in human resources. With the L2 declaration (see below), additional
staff were externally recruited within a few weeks. However, tensions related to staffing at the beginning
of the response were regularly mentioned during the RTE. Combined with the months of restrictions
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the permanent fear linked to the security context, this resulted in
significant pressure on staff, leading to what was described as “near burn out” situations.
Field presence and the opportunities offered by the Les Cayes Office
Before the earthquake, UNICEF was in the process of moving its office in Les Cayes. It speeded up the
process and was able to move in within days of the earthquake. The building also hosts UNDSS, WFP
and PAHO/WHO. The fact that UNICEF was the only UN agency with an office in Les Cayes made the
UNICEF site a key hub for interagency coordination. This provided an opportunity to put the ‘One-UN’
approach into practice in Les Cayes with UNICEF, WFP and ILO organising a lot of joint distributions
and joint missions.
Access to information
Difficulties in gaining access to information are common in chaotic and fast-changing post-disaster
situations. Haiti was no exception. For example, the first flight over the affected zone did not provide a
view of the level of devastation in the rural areas.48 The delays in adopting the new Civil Protection
rapid assessment forms, the fact that the multi-sectoral assessment tools were not presented in a timely
manner, and the lack of a consolidated shared vision on what tools to use before the earthquake between
UNICEF, its NGO and UN partners and the different governmental agencies involved hindered the early
phase of the rapid assessment. During the first two weeks, the flow of information from UNICEF was
erratic, limiting contributions to the Flash Appeal and institutional visibility. However, within two
weeks, when the Sector Chiefs came back from rest and recuperation and a LACRO M&E member of
staff was deployed to Haiti, better information was compiled, meeting notes started to appear, surveys
were more structured and information channels became clearer at the level of the CO and with the
Regional and HQ Offices.
Activation and use of L2
On August 19th, UNICEF activated the L2 Emergency procedure for 3 months (until November 19th).
Following this activation, the Regional Director became accountable for the Emergency Coordination,
while the Representative remained responsible for the implementation and evaluation procedures and
the Haiti Country Office. This reorganisation of the system allowed stronger institutional support to
Haiti’s operations. It also led to new activities (Technical Emergency Team meetings; Regional
Emergency Management Team meetings, and an Emergency Coordination team), facilitated
administrative processes and provided immediate access to UNICEF Emergency Response Funds (ERF)
and Bridging Funds.
48 Interview with CIAT and DGPC
42
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
More than 60 surge staff were deployed, first from within the organization (LACRO, HQ and other
UNICEF offices), and then from the rosters attached to the global clusters. The LACRO office supported
the HCO in multiple ways, particularly in technical areas, such as WASH, as the LACRO-based WASH
Regional Coordinator had had a lot of experience in Haiti. The staff support given by LACRO at the
time of the PDNA was also very appreciated as it freed some internal HCO staff and allowed them to
concentrate on the field response.
One month prior to the expiry date of the L2 emergency Declaration (October 2021), the Regional
Director and the Director of the Office of Emergency Programmes (EMOPS) assessed the four criteria
(scale, urgency, complexity and capacity), and then presented several options to the Deputy Executive
Director of Programmes: deactivate the L2 emergency; extend the scale-up phase for another three
months; or support the transition to a stabilisation phase and specify if the complexity of the crisis
persists; The L2 Declaration was finally extended it until mid-February 2022.
The L2 Declaration: a vital element for an emergency response
The L2 status was activated within four days. However, and despite the fact that L3 had been declared earlier due
to the COVID-19 epidemic, it took the Haiti CO two weeks to implement it as most staff were not fully aware and/or
concerned of infringing rules and regulation that use to enforce in order to protect the organisation from
wrongdoings. Also, the L2 process was being fine tuned in the weeks before the earthquake, most staff were
relatively new (2-4 months in Haiti), and were still in the process of getting to know the country and its security
challenges, or had suddenly been repurposed from a more development perspective to an emergency response.
The L2 activation implied:
• Enhanced support from LACRO and HQ: the rapid mobilisation of LACRO and HQ staff was key as the Haiti
Country Office (HCO) was lacking key staff when the earthquake took place. This back-up was very appreciated
by the HCO team, in particular because it was provided by experienced people.
• Better access to surge capacity staff. However, it seems that the roster was too limited and that there was very
little prioritisation and arbitration about who came, especially given the need to speak French to work in Haiti
and the competing priorities for different emergencies at the global level.
• Faster procedures, such as a fast track for recruitments, an enhanced financial ceiling for local procurements,
and a quicker flow of resources. Two main internal mechanisms were activated (the Emergency Response
Funds worth 2.5 M US$ and the Bridge Funds worth 1.7 M US$). The rapid injection of these funds was very
useful, but it is important to remember that this money is “on loan” from the revolving funds systems and has
to be repaid.
• The rapid dispatch of money with a higher ceiling for fast disbursement. The mobilization of EPF allows financial
support even before donors are contacted. Yet, the absence of petty cash for staff on the ground was a
problem for life-saving activities in the first days and weeks of the response.
• The increased possibility of using “Cash-On-Hand” (CoHa) mechanisms despite the HCO’s poor past
performance using them. Specific procedures had to be introduced within the HCO to facilitate control CoHa
use.
• Coordination quickly became very demanding with valuable time taken up by long meetings. This reduced in
intensity when the Deputy Representative for Operations returned.

Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
Mobilisation of UNICEF on the basis of the overarching Core Commitments for Children (CCC)
The CCC are a fundamental aspect of UNICEF's crisis response policy. The UNICEF efforts in Haiti
to comply with the CCC commitments are presented here. The analytical framework that was used in
relation to the CCC is presented in Annexe 5.
Preparedness
Although efforts were made to reach some level of preparedness, as it is an overarching commitment
for country offices as was the case for almost all actors in Haiti, UNICEF was caught “off guard” by the
earthquake. This is because the main focus in Haiti is “extreme climatic events”. Tectonic phenomena
are a seen as marginal issue, despite the 2010 earthquake and advices from several specialists.49 The
efforts of UNICEF and the international community as a whole in response to Hurricane Matthew were
useful, but only limited financial resources had been allocated since to replenish emergency stocks in
the Grand Sud departments. More information on this overarching commitment is given in other
chapters of this report.
Coordination:
Coordination is also a key overarching commitment of the CCC. UNICEF Haiti CO was a key player at
all levels (central and field), as well as in UNICEF’s sectors of responsibility. Two points should be
underlined: a) there was a clear demand by the UN Resident Coordinator to ensure that the leadership
of the national authorities is seen as central; and b) due to the difficult experiences of 2010, the
authorities asked that the cluster system should not be activated.50 All the interviewees51 stated that
UNICEF had performed well in its coordination role with these two parameters framing the coordination
system (for more information see section 6.6).
Supplies and logistics
Supplies and logistics were key constraints in the operations, especially for the rehabilitation phase
which involved the transportation of sizeable quantities of goods. The security situation on the way out
of Port-au-Prince (gangs in Martissant), the state of the landslides in the affected areas, the damaged
Jeremie bridge and the impact of the rains both in 2021 (during the emergency response) and in 2022
(during the rehabilitation) made logistics a very difficult component of the operation. During the
emergency phase, airborne means made available for a few weeks and sea-borne means mobilized by
WFP were critical in alleviating these difficulties. UNICEF’s decision to divide supplies to its
operational partners between “big supplies” (large-scale procurements made by UNICEF supposedly
for economies of scale) and “small supplies” (to be covered by NGOs ) did not turn out to be as efficient
as expected (see more on this in the paragraph on efficiency).
Humanitarian access
The difficulties were mostly linked to the situation in Port-au-Prince, with the gangs controlling the
main exit road to the south. Some interagency efforts were successful in gaining access and getting
convoys through the “Carrefour” bottleneck for a few weeks, but at one point access was impossible. A
complex system of small barges and back-to-back transferral of goods from the barges to trucks was
established thanks to WFP. Inside the affected zones, some access issues emerged when the populations
in hard-to-reach affected areas felt they were receiving less assistance than the populations in easy-to-
reach areas.52 This was solved through programmatic adaptations.53

The humanitarian access issue remained long after the emergency phase and is linked to the complexity
of the Haitian terrain, as experienced during the RTE mission. The graph below represents the number
of schools visited per department. It was very difficult to reach a good number of schools for two major
reasons. Firstly, some schools are in very remote locations, which would require a whole day to visit.
For example, the national school in Dublée is inaccessible by vehicle, requiring a 4-hour walk to reach
the project site and a 4-hour walk back to where the vehicle has been left.54 Secondly, most of the
construction work is only just starting. It has been interrupted by rain and lack of materials due to supply
problems caused by gang violence.

DIAGRAM N°7: ACCESS ISSUES FOR THE SCHOOL SITES VISITED DURING THE MISSION
Protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA)
A critical issue for PSEA management is the level of understanding of the risk. UNICEF was very active
in relation to gender issues, both internally (including with its partners) and at the interagency level. The
existence of GBV was acknowledged by all the interviewees.55 UNICEF, in coordination with UN
Women and CARE, supported a Rapid Gender Analysis in the three most affected areas to assess the
differentiated impact of the crisis on women, girls and adolescent girls, and to design an evidence-based
humanitarian protection response. Tools used for data collection included four U-report surveys, which
aimed to reach young people and identify if the response was gender-equal. The new emergency
procedures for PSEA were considered, facilitating the mobilization of EPF funds for PSEA under the
L2. It was not easy for the HCO to adapt to this change in procedures as adaptation always takes time
and time was a “rare resource” during the earthquake response. Likewise, the deployment of surge staff
for PSEA was considered but it was very difficult to find people, it would also be important to accelerate
the processes of contracting personnel for the field to support the actions.There were some major
successes during the emergency response period. For example, a hotline was set up in close collaboration
with WFP; a sensitization programme aimed particularly at humanitarian assistance providers was set
up, partners and government counterparts were trained, audio-visual material was prepared, and 60,000
flyers were printed. Two additional staff were recruited to provide field support in the affected areas.
The Accountability Survey organised by UNICEF reported that issues do exist, and a more detailed
follow-up is needed in the following months in order to define and respond to the reported problems
more effectively. In October 2021, UNICEF recruited a GBV specialist for three months through a
stand-by partner. The UNICEF specialist produced a GBV analysis document and developed a strategy
for UNICEF to combat GBV.
Three months after the earthquake, the surge support had to be withdrawn due to lack of funds. In terms
of Communication for Development (C4D), UNICEF developed key messages on GBV prevention.

Accountability to affected populations
AAP was a key concern for UNICEF CO even before the earthquake. The support to the U Reporter
network and the engagement of UNICEF in the interagency AAP survey are key indications of their
commitment.56
Cash transfers
Cash transfers are not only a useful tool for human development in a context of growing poverty and
economic crisis, but they have also been proven to be a useful mechanism in emergency response.57
After the earthquake, the first cash transfers delivered by the United Nations in the field were made by
UNICEF using two Cash transfer programmes: through the GPE funds [1,200 vulnerable households
(HH) with school-age children with disabilities, incentives to 1000 teachers in 3 departments (Sud,
Grand’Anse and Nippes)] and through the MPTF multipurpose cash transfers to 1000 vulnerable HH in
Grand’Anse (Corail, Pestel and Cayemites) in partnership with FAO (in-kind assistance) and WFP
(targeting and connection with the longstanding social protection scheme). It is important to note that it
took time to activate the proper mechanism as UNICEF had to negotiate with a Financial Service
Provider for almost 12 months to have the contract signed. The internal lack of capacity (in terms of
human resources in the UNICEF HCO), the limited knowledge among UNICEF staff (both in the
programme and operations departments) and rare previous experience in implementing cash transfers in
humanitarian responses represented a key limit. In addition, the administrative complexity to establish
working mechanisms and contracts with FSPs, to develop existing partnerships (with NGOs, the
government and UN Agencies) was another significant hindrance For example, there was only one
social policy chief in UNICEF, who in addition had to take over the role of Deputy Representative at
the onset of the 2021 earthquake response. By comparison, WFP had 23 social protection staff including
12 internationals staff. UNICEF also put in place targeted cash transfer processes to facilitate the return
to school of the most vulnerable children and to help teachers in the resumption of their activities
Programme approach
Quality of Programmes:
There are two issues: the quality of the design and the quality of the implementation
- Quality of the design: The design of the emergency response programmes was largely geared by
existing national standards and site-specific characteristics.
- Quality of the implementation: this depended on the capacity of the implementing partners and
the capacity of UNICEF and its national counterparts to carry out proper monitoring and advisory
missions. Both of these were limited in terms of the human, financial and logistical resources
available to support field operations and help them overcome technical difficulties.
- Equity and targeting the most vulnerable: It is important to mention that, in a disaster situation
in a context of widespread acute poverty like Southern Haiti, supporting mobile clinics that are
treating wounded people, or establishing water distribution points, does not target a specific group
but aims to meet the needs of people affected by the impact of a disaster or the needs of a
community. However, special attention was paid to women and children to ensure that those with
especially difficult situations could be targeted first.

46
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
Multisector and integrated programming
Although it was relatively complicated during the early emergency phase, UNICEF efforts to target
specific sectors and their institutions, such as schools, health institutions, nutrition support mechanisms
or WASH systems, meant that a multi-sector approach was needed: schools without water or latrines
would not meet UNICEF’s or the MENFP’s standards for schools. Nutritional support without basic
health monitoring, vaccination, hygiene education and even basic mother education would not be in
keeping with UNICEF’s 58 Conceptual Framework on the Determinants of Maternal and Child Nutrition,
2020.59 Of course, organizational “silos” could undermine this approach but an internal coordination
system was established in the field to limit this risk.60
Linking humanitarian aid, development and peace (HDP)
This is directly related to the capacity of communities to ensure proper maintenance of the rehabilitated
infrastructures and therefore depends on their level of ownership of aid programmes. As has been the
case in the WASH sector since before the earthquake (with the SAEP management committees),
community members and users need to be integrated into the management and maintenance of schools.
They must take ownership of all interventions in their territory and understand the importance of any
projects in their community. Currently, MENFP is working on the creation of school councils who will
participate in school management along with the departmental directorates of education. 50% of schools
have had school councils since 2007, but these still struggle to participate in the effective management
of schools. During the RTE visit, the Departmental Directorate of Education (Direction Départemental
de l’Education - DDE) stated that by September 2022 all school councils should be in place.
Sectoral commitments
Health and Nutrition
UNICEF was instrumental in covering mobilisation costs and supporting the creation and operations of
local mobile teams in the south. Staff appreciated the fact that UNICEF’s first health supplies arrived as
early as the night of August 14th. Within two weeks, the Health Department responded to needs by
assembling mobile teams in which seven national professionals took part. These began to operate in the
first week of September in the South department and later expanded to Nippes and Grand’Anse.
UNICEF’s financial support made the scale of the operation possible. There were delays in payment due
to UNICEF’s internal procedures and governmental processes. However, overall, this support was very
positive as it empowered the DSS to identify people with health needs in the surrounding communities
who did not have access to health services. The mobile health teams provided healthcare on the spot but
also referred patients when needed. Efficiency was high as most staff were local. UNICEF enabled
health facilities and mobile teams to provide even better care than before the earthquake by delivering
chronically deficient medical supplies to health facilities, sometimes even crucial medicine. Over time,
the mobile teams evolved as access to communities and information transmission improved, and health
needs gradually changed. These supplies were paid for with a previous underfunded CERF, and the
stocks will be replenished with the earthquake emergency funding. During the few weeks following the
earthquake, national and international EMTs provided direct healthcare to affected people on the ground
in the impacted areas. They also supported health delivery systems in the health institutions affected by
the earthquake, including needs assessments, medical evacuations and post-earthquake GBV assistance
within the mobile clinics.
The national authorities were prioritizing EMT deployments with a concentration on EMT Type 2 with
surgical capabilities and EMT Type 1 with high capacity of orthopaedic trauma care. For UNICEF, the
strategic entry point in the operation was the Ministry of Health in Port-au-Prince, and the Health

Departments. The presence of a dedicated UNICEF national health professional who was well integrated
into the Ministry of Health was very useful in supporting the health response in the departments affected
by the earthquake. UNICEF tents and tarpaulins, which were used in hospitals and health centres, made
a major difference to the many patients who were unable to return to non-affected facilities due to
aftershocks and the fear of buildings collapsing. Within two weeks, UNICEF was able to support mobile
clinics in the three affected departments in close coordination with the Department of Health.
46 health infrastructures were affected. It took some time to properly identify them as the Ministry of
Health and WHO did not obtain the necessary information for a number of weeks, but this was
eventually included in the PDNA. UNICEF focused mainly on health centres, clinics, GBV and other
primary health care facilities. The speed of a medical response can make the difference between life and
death. Local and national health staff were the first medical staff available in the affected areas. By
covering the expenses of medical personnel mobilised by the ministry of Health, the HCO helped to
reduce death and morbidity.61 Some tents
arrived within the first 48 hours. Medical
professionals could have arrived in a more
organised fashion and could have been
better equipped.
Nutritional activities were not given a high
priority during the emergency response as
international experience shows that rapid
onset disaster have seldom a direct and
immediate nutritional effect. Yet, as the
nutritional situation was subject of concerns
in Haiti before the earthquake, nutrition
programmes were set up after the acute
emergency phase.
PHOTO N°7: NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMME IN LES NIPPES
WASH:
UNICEF’s WASH response is cited in several evaluations as a success (see Annexe 7).62 UNICEF’s
WASH response was possible thanks to strong institutional support to the national institution DINEPA
since at least the 2010 earthquake, reinforced during a prolonged cholera response. It is important to
note that UNICEF’s response to end cholera was not led by the WASH section but by the Emergency
unit. This resulted in a weak WASH leadership during those years and a strong leadership from the
Emergency Unit), the response to Hurricane Matthew and other emergency responses. In addition to
LACRO support, two WASH specialists were sent as part of the surge through standby agreements to
strengthen the national team. UNICEF support to the global WASH response made an even greater
impact because of the existing trust between DINEPA and UNICEF.

Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
The fact that the DINEPA is widely respected, and that it
combines emergency and development activities, was
indeed a great asset in terms of planning, coordinating, and
implementing the water and hygiene response. This
allowed the fast distribution of hygiene kits, the rapid
evaluation of water systems in the three affected
departments, the sharing of information within the WASH
sector, the early rehabilitation of certain systems thanks to
the adoption of rapid corrective measures (it was much
slower for many others, though), and water trucking. Here
again, the absence of petty cash for staff on the ground was
a problem for life-saving activities in the first days and
weeks of the response.
PHOTO N°8: FIELD VISIT TO LOOK AT WASH ACTIVITIES
Water trucking: UNICEF supported several treatment
systems as well as a fleet of trucks from the treatment sites
to the communities. It also facilitated the whole emergency
water response by providing spare parts, chemicals, etc.63
This response was effective but expensive, so there was an
incentive to move to SAEP rehabilitation in the early stages
of the response.
Hygiene kits: The rapid and wide distribution of hygiene kits is one of the success stories of UNICEF’s
involvement in the response. These hygiene kits comprise water treatment products, basic hygiene
products (soap, toothbrush, toothpaste and feminine hygiene products). According to the global survey
supported by UNICEF, these kits were very useful, but their content might need to be reappraised in
order to be “site specific”. Options for cash transfer, in order to increase the possible adaptation of the
content, might have to be further explored. As yet, there has been little analysis of local markets
(functioning, supplies, accessibility, and prices) and of the capacity of the population to purchase items
for hygiene kits, and this will require due attention.
Sanitation: Most of the affected rural areas have limited sanitation facilities apart from household
latrines, and there is still a high level of open defecation. Villages and small cities have better systems
which, luckily, were largely unaffected. In an emergency situation, it is difficult to work on behavioural
change and empowering communities’ involvement in sanitation systems. The situation was more
complicated in the informal settlements and the zones where people sought shelter after the earthquake.
On the one hand, the government policy was to try to avoid the creation of IDP sites, but for some
people, there was nowhere to go back to after the earthquake. A ”dry latrine” with a simplified design
developed by an NGO was used in certain areas following complicated negotiations.64

Education:
Since August 16th, together with MENFP, UNICEF has contributed to the assessment and collection of
data related to schools damaged by the earthquake. The need to ensure a “return to safe school” for the
children was a concern of the government and many humanitarian actors. Focal points were designated
in the three affected departments and all educational structures were assessed (public, private and
community) using a colour code (green, yellow or red) according to the level of damage/destruction. A
priority list was then established for schools to be rehabilitated. To facilitate the return to school,
UNICEF distributed tents that could be used for
school activities. In order to limit the economic
burden on poor families, it distributed school
kits for children with a bag containing pencils
and school books. In addition, it distributed
basic furniture to equip the tents and temporary
schools and established a cash transfer system to
help the teachers. It also encouraged the
clustering of schools to allow all students to
return to school quickly.65 A system of double
shifts was established, with mornings for the
children who would normally attend the school,
and afternoons for children from other
neighbourhoods. In a few cases, UNICEF ran
training seminars on risk and disaster
management, community management in
schools, and psychosocial support. PHOTO N°9: TENT USED AS SCHOOL

Child Protection
According to several interviews, there was already good collaboration between UNICEF and IBERS
even before the earthquake. UNICEF was a co-facilitator in the meetings of the Working Group for the
Protection of Children (WGPC). During its meetings, the following protection issues were discussed:
• Foster care. This is a structure created by IBERS whose mission is to take care of target children
and to avoid placing them in children's homes. These are families who voluntarily decide to take
in and take care of a child. These families are assessed and accredited by IBERS.
• Children/adolescents in conflict with the law;
• Children living in institutions;
• Street children.
Following the earthquake, UNICEF provided technical and financial support to IBERS for activities to
child protection. IBERS officers from the three departments are satisfied with this technical support
and reported several improvements:
• Many more people in the communities are aware of the existence and activities carried out by
IBERS.
• The creation of child protection committees.
• IBERS is able to make referrals and do an initial follow-up when faced with a case of abuse or
maltreatment of a child.
UNICEF partners receiving financial support for the implementation of child protection activities.
During the field mission in the far south, meetings were held with UNICEF partners who had received
financial support from UNICEF for the implementation of child protection activities. Interviews with
partners in the South and Grand’Anse departments showed that short-term funding limits the assistance
that is provided to beneficiaries. It is true that GBV existed before disasters, but with disasters there is
a huge risk that cases will increase, and there is some evidence that this may already be happening. In
the current context of weak data collection, it is difficult to conclude that cases are increasing. There
was a strong group within the Ministry of Social Action, and the department directorates, prior to the
earthquake. These received firm support from UNICEF. Indeed, many issues existed before the
earthquake, and were aggravated by it: children separated from their parents, children and adolescents
deprived of liberty, children with disabilities, children victims of violence, street children, etc. The
earthquake impacted a relatively limited number, but, especially when it comes to children, numbers do
not matter. Every single life must be protected from long-term effects. Within a few days, thanks to
UNICEF and its partners’ support to the IBESR, children and adolescents deprived of liberty were
separated from adult prisoners.66 Also with UNICEF support, quick monitoring of high-risk children
was carried out (street children, children in foster care, children in temporary settlements, etc.). UNICEF
staff were already in Les Cayes prior to the earthquake and additional staff were deployed to Jérémie.
A Child Protection specialist was sent as part of the surge to support the UNICEF response. The
combination of extremely dedicated governmental staff, the close interaction with UNICEF’s partners,
the Centre de Formation et Recherches en Appui Psychosocial (CFRAPS) and the quality of UNICEF
staff led to an effective response.

TABLE N°5: KEY ACTORS IN THE PSYCHOSOCIAL SECTOR
2.3. How timely was the response? In general, WASH responses were relatively timely, with water
trucking, the rapid dispatch of water treatment plants and the distribution of hygiene kits. On the other
hand, there were significant delays before work began on fixing even the smaller water distribution
systems. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, the mobilization of mobile medical teams, the
rapid provision of medical equipment, the distribution of tents for clinics or schools and the
implementation of child protection activities (the identification of at-risk children) were all extremely
rapid. There were significant delays, however, in reopening schools in keeping with the timeframe
promised by UNICEF. The office in Les Cayes and the fact that, during the first month, the Martissant
blockade was lifted greatly facilitated the timeliness of the response in Les Cayes. In contrast, there were
delays in Grand’Anse and Nippes, but the response there eventually came together (see para 6.4 on
coverage).
In the WASH sector, it seems that going through the DINEPA procurement system slowed down the
procurements as NGO could find alternative channels to ensure fast transportation of goods through the
difficult areas. The limited mobility of the OREPA team and the Unités Rurales Départementales (URD)
at the department level held up technical support and monitoring in the field was a key contrainst. The
countrerfactual was observed in GrandAnce with the high mobility of OREPA when the UNICEF surge
was present and able to rent a car and move with the OREPA staff to identify needs and monitor progress
in rehabilitation.
2.4. To what extent did emergency preparedness planning influence the CO’s capacity to respond?
Despite the fact that Haiti is a risk-prone country, the Emergency Preparedness and Planning (EPP)
process was largely sub-optimal. Even though UNICEF supported the COUN with contingency planning
training as part of the MoU with the General Directorate of Civil Protection (DGPC) from 2020 (prior
to the earthquake), preparedness efforts were insufficient to influence the response itself. The Southern
department civil protection system had no contingency stocks since Hurricane Matthew, and the issue
of earthquakes did not figure in discussions despite the likelihood of one taking place (see EQ 1.4.).
52
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
Les Cayes national staff left their affected dwellings within minutes of the earthquake to assess the
damage in the city and continued to work relentlessly despite the fact that they were sleeping in the open
with their families, and despite the rain and wind of tropical storm Grace during the night of August
16th. Port-au-Prince staff were mobilised from day one via convoys and flights. Despite repeated requests
from LACRO and HQ at Regional Management Team (RMT) meetings and others, no consolidated
Emergency Response Plan was ever shared with RO/HQ. This was a missed opportunity as it would
have allowed LACRO and other UNICEF divisions (HQ, in particular the Emergency Response and
Resource Mobilisation divisions, the Supply division in Copenhagen, etc.) to implement more timely
and focused technical assistance. Without the Emergency Response Plan, support from RO/HQ was
rather ad-hoc and reactive, as it was based on the requests of HCO. Opportunities for providing more
strategic and structured advice/actions (risk mapping, prepositioning, training, etc.) were missed by
HCO, which opted to give priority to an agile response rather than to planning.
However, thanks to the L2 declaration, the regional and HQ response was immediately triggered, and
international staff were mobilised as of the second day. The speed of the response was due to:
a) prepositioned assets (such as the UNICEF warehouse in Port-au-Prince);
b) the existence of the suboffice in Les Cayes;
c) the presence of staff familiar with the field conditions and the population’s needs, with close
relations in local authorities;
d) and the accumulated experience since the 2010 earthquake.
However, there were significant limitations due to the HR situation. For example, the Standby
Partnership Agreement based on a signed project document (PRODOC) were not as valuable as
expected. Partnerships with the Netherlands Red Cross and ACTED did not work partly due to
unexpected logistical and HR limitations among the partners and partly by the competition between
UNICEF and some of its partners for the same donor resources. Also, four key management staff (the
UNICEF Representative, the Deputy Representative for Programmes, the Deputy Representative for
Operations and the Head of Emergency) and three Heads of Sections were out of the country when the
earthquake took place: The Representative returned to the country immediately (on August 18th), the
Deputy Representative for Programmes returned a few weeks later and the Head of Emergency returned
on September 9th. The Head of the Health Section returned on August 15th, while the Head of the
Education Section returned later. On the other hand, surge staff arrived within days to assume key
coordination functions, support field operations, ensure security and provide technical support.
The example of preparedness in the education sector:
Preparedness and readiness in education for the coming Atlantic Hurricane season (known in Haiti as “the
cyclone season”) and the next emergency67
The Department of Education felt unprepared for a geological hazard. More preparatory drills in schools could have
reduced the number of injuries among children and teachers. The curriculum should cover all hazards more effectively in
order to familiarise students and their parents more with disaster preparedness and resilience. The schools to be repaired
or reconstructed by UNICEF will be built in two stages. The first with a solid foundation and light upper structure. The
second phase will replace the light structure by a permanent structure. This reconstruction of schools will provide an
opportunity to review the resistance of schools to all hazards. It remains unclear how the reconstruction process will ensure
that schools are hazard-resilient beyond UNICEF’s immediate responsibilities. In addition, the Ministry of Social Affairs
and its partners identified several weaknesses that need to be addressed rapidly in order to be able to respond more
effectively in the future. The following ideas were mentioned to rapidly improve the child protection sector’s ability to
respond to future disasters: developing a detailed operational contingency plan with partners’ responsibilities, updating
assessment forms for their use in emergencies, assessing buildings and homes where children are fostered for earthquake
resistance, and improving the organisation of the emergency operation centre and data collection by the Ministry.

Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
2.5. How aligned was the supply component with the overall emergency response? What were the
most significant contributions of supply to the response? The supply component of the overall
response varied significantly due to a variety of constraints: access to roads, the lack of prepositioned
supplies in the country, the lack of agreements with local suppliers (including the national central
warehouse responding to UN international standards), and the need to work with the UNICEF
Copenhagen procurement centre. Internal difficulties within UNICEF HCO in relation to procurement
and tendering procedures and among Haitian counterparts also significantly affected the speed of
supplies. The decision to separate small purchases and large purchases was an additional impediment.
The recovery phase was significantly hampered by the rainy season and the blockade of the bridge in
Jeremie, in addition to the difficulties getting convoys out of Port-au-Prince.
2.6. To what extent has UNICEF been able to adapt its response to the changing needs on the
ground? UNICEF was able to adapt relatively well to changing situations thanks, among other things,
to the capacity of the UNICEF Representative to take risks and the immense dedication of staff during
the emergency phase. UNICEF responded to emerging needs (in Health, WASH and Protection) in a
flexible and agile way and managed to maintain a high level of relevance. Using this agile and often ad-
hoc approach rather than attempting to stick to static plans,68 UNICEF HCO managed to respond
relatively well to the emergency. It became more complicated to adjust during the recovery phase due
to the contracting out of work to NGOs and firms, and the delegation of work to the national authorities.
2.7. What role has innovation played in needs assessments and the response? The decision to
immediately provide financial support for the deployment of Haitian emergency medical teams and to
support them with logistics and catering was highly beneficial as it was faster, cheaper and,
institutionally, more adapted to the most urgent needs of the population than international Emergency
Medical Teams (EMT).
The support to mobile medical teams in the days immediately following the earthquake was also original
in channelling the funds through the MoH. Another useful innovative approach was the work on
information gathering and communication with the U-Report system. This is a system that is able to
mobilize young Haitians in a very dynamic and creative way so that they are able to take action in favour
of their communities, in particular through their presence, and through the use of social networks, such
as Facebook or Instagram.
2.8. Did the humanitarian assistance have any unintended consequences (positive or negative)?
The situation created by the earthquake gave Haiti some visibility within the aid agenda and increased
the level of resources that it received. This did not last long, in particular due to the deteriorating situation
and growing needs in other parts of the world. There were a lot of expectations within the population,
and among national and local stakeholders and NGO partners which were not always met, such as the
rapid reconstruction of schools or the rehabilitation of hospitals. This caused some frustration which
was partly mitigated through dialogue and working closely with local actors to find solutions. On another
level, a serious concern remains the extent to which the office was able to maintain business continuity
for the other programmes in the other parts of Haiti and to simultaneously manage two crises: the
earthquake and the urban crisis in Port-au-Prince.

6.3. Efficiency
The evaluation ToR did not address the efficiency of UNICEF’s response, which would imply a lengthy
costing exercise and comparisons with alternative implementation approaches. However, given that
some decisions did raise the issue of efficiency during the RTE process, the evaluation team decided to
give it some attention. The main efficiency question was related to procurement: what became known
as “gros achats/petits achats” (small purchases/big purchases). The decision was made to split supplies
into two lines. One line was managed by UNICEF (big purchases), which concerned large quantities,
and was supposed to bring economies of scale and savings. The other was managed by partners (small
purchases) for the smaller inputs that were supposed to be procured locally. However, the ‘big
purchases’ were often delayed and local partners had to use their ‘small purchases’ envelopes to cover
for these delays. As a result, the expected economies of scale did not take place and it created a lot of
obstacles and tension between UNICEF and its partners. In general, however, UNICEF’s partners (past
and present) have a positive perception of UNICEF’s efficiency. The organisation was able to sign new
contractual agreements within four weeks, including with local NGOs, some based in the southern
peninsula. However, partners and staff within UNICEF highlighted long delays in payments that
sometimes took weeks or even months. This is very slow given that the context had been declared an
L2.69 Although UNICEF provides various tools and mechanisms to speed up this process as part of the
L2 declaration, organizational issues within the HCO, including the fact that, due to the COVID-19
pandemic and the insecurity in Port-au-Prince, many staff were still working from home, the absence of
key staff during the emergency response and the limited level of knowledge of L2 processes hindered
the smooth functioning of the administrative processes. As such, the surge was appreciated by all.
However, many surge staff did not arrive in the country as fast as expected for an L2 emergency despite
the speed allowed by the L2 SOPs. This was due to language constraints (the need for French-speaking
staff), the fact that the Emergency Response Team (ERT) members were teleworking both within and
outside Haiti, and COVID international air travel restrictions (fewer flights, testing requirements, and
people from the rosters tested positive).70
Field teams felt they were not sufficiently aware of new arrivals and received too little feedback on
information sent to Port-au-Prince, causing serious coordination, duplication issues and inefficient use
of this rare resource: the human factor. The HCO HR team, for its part, had significant challenges
obtaining responses from staff who had requested surge support. This difficulties in communication
made the preparation of required Terms of Reference (ToR) and to activate the administrative process
to get the surge support caused significant delays. Field teams would have liked to have more
administrative support, (for example, for lodgings and transport) even though the HR Department in
Port-au-Prince did its best to ensure that surge and other supporting staff (SBP, etc.) were systematically
provided with support in making travel arrangements, hotel reservations and in-country transport
arrangements (UNHAS flights etc.) or in some technical areas (data collection and management),
especially during the first weeks. The rapid changes in assignments, the sudden arrival of surge staff,
and the exhaustion of staff prior to the earthquake meant that additional flexibility and adaptation were
required, which some perceived as not being humanly possible. Funding was very quickly made
available but not easily accessible to technical staff due to time consuming internal procedures despite
the L2 Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). However, the Budget Officer rapidly created an excel
sheet to update the UNICEF Representative and all senior staff on a daily basis. A later inventory showed
that there were significant quantities of relief goods in the stocks but, according to some interviews, The
importance of having the full picture of combined existence of stocks available with UNICEF and its
partners as well as a proper understanding of the possibilities of local purchase was not fully understood
across the response team.

55
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
The fact that UNICEF did not have an established presence/office in both Jeremie and Miragoane
resulted in a lot of time and logistical resources to be used to move from Les Cayes to the two other
departments., This significantly held up the response in these two departments and compromised the
quality of the monitoring that took place, while increasing transaction costs. This negatively affected
UNICEF’s efficiency. In several interviews, the different operational choices made by UNICEF (direct
implementation through NGOs, ministries or private companies) were seen as having had different
levels of efficiency. Yet, UNICEF direct interventions often had limited efficiency but gave a high
visibility to the institution.
6.4. Coverage:
THE NEED TO REACH MAJOR POPULATION GROUPS FACING LIFE-THREATENING SUFFERING WHEREVER THEY ARE.
Overarching RTE Question 3: To what extent was the affected population, including vulnerable girls
and boys, displaced persons and persons with disability, adequately identified, targeted and reached
by UNICEF and its partners?
Immediately after the disaster, UNICEF targeted ‘affected people’ in general rather than any specific
categories; victims of the earthquake, regardless of any other parameters. Triage was carried out on the
basis of the seriousness of individual cases. Most of the post-disaster assistance targeted infrastructure
such as schools and water facilities. Only specific programmes, such as child protection, support to
lactating women, dedicated cash transfers and the distribution of school kits included targeting criteria,
although the level of poverty in rural areas is such that almost all children were in need.
RTE sub-question
3.1. How successful has UNICEF been in reaching the most vulnerable groups (communities in
hard-to-reach areas; IDPs; people with disabilities; unaccompanied/separated children; pregnant
women etc.)? UNICEF had relatively limited success in reaching the most vulnerable groups during the
emergency phase due to the scale of needs and the fact that national structures were inadequately staffed
and equipped to deliver. During the recovery phase, UNICEF targeted communities rather than specific
groups. The only area with specific targeting was protection.
Before the earthquake, UNICEF had opened an office in Les Cayes and scaled it up with unspent
Hurricane Matthew funding, and then had subsequently scaled it down due to financial limitations. After
the earthquake, the office had to be rapidly upgraded in order to ensure that it could serve as an
operational hub to facilitate the work of all actors, including line ministries who had response capacities
in place. The fact that most of the images of earthquakes are related to “urban contexts” made it difficult
to assess the impact of the earthquake from the airborne information gathered during the initial “fly over
missions”. This significantly slowed down the understanding of the scale and magnitude of rural disaster
affecting the Southern Peninsula. This meant that the situation in many hard-to-reach areas was
discovered only later.
3.2. How successful has UNICEF been in ensuring youth participation during the response?
UNICEF was relatively unsuccessful in promoting the participation of young people. Its main
achievements were related to the U-Report system. Youth movements are often weak, with limited
resources in contexts like Haiti where there is severe poverty. Indeed, the involvement of young people
in CSOs and U-Report activities is remarkable in a context where survival is often a daily battle.
56
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
What is U-Report ? (https://haiti.ureport.in/about/)
Developed by UNICEF, the U-Report is a free and anonymous online tool. It encourages young people
to become active citizens using surveys sent to their phones, via Facebook Messenger. U-Report makes
young people take part in social and political dialogue via surveys about their daily lives, the issues that
they face and their expectations. U-Reporters defend their rights and share their point of view with the
general public, the media and political decision-makers. U-Report is a tool for informing, raising
awareness, mobilising and encouraging the engagement of young people. It has three platforms : a
technical platform that allows questions to be sent to the U-Reporters’ telephones using Facebook
Messenger ; a website where survey results are shared in real time with the general public and informed
audiences (the media, public authorities, political decision-makers, etc.) ; and Facebook social network
which provides a platform for discussion and information sharing between the community of U-
Reporters and the general public.
6.5. Connectedness:
THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT ACTIVITIES OF A SHORT-TERM EMERGENCY NATURE ARE CARRIED OUT IN A CONTEXT THAT TAKES LONGER-
TERM AND INTERCONNECTED PROBLEMS INTO ACCOUNT
Overarching RTE Question 4. To what extent is UNICEF’s response contributing to longer-term goals of
preventing future emergencies, mitigating the negative effects of future natural hazards
(resilience/sustainable solutions) and enhancing preparedness?
Recovery considerations still have to be incorporated into planning and relief interventions
UNICEF’s contribution to linking relief, rehabilitation and development (LRRD) varied significantly
depending on the sector. It engaged significantly with the relevant national line ministries and their focal
points at the department level to ensure that its own recovery planning was in line with national
strategies. It should be noted that it did not engage to the same degree with municipalities, and therefore
was not integrated into communal recovery plans.
RTE Sub-question
4.1. How successfully have recovery considerations been incorporated into planning and relief
interventions? Activities for the recovery phase were in many instances planned as a continuation of
the emergency response implemented through NGO. These now need to be reviewed and oriented
towards supporting national and local institutions to recover and strengthen their operational capacities.
For example, by providing department-based institutions the means to supervise their activities and to
plan for their future operations was a key element in that direction. A critical element was the series of
attempts to develop exit strategies for most of the response projects. This was particularly important as
many of them were due to end in the coming months. For instance, in the WASH sector, how to develop
the access to water after the end of the water-trucking programmes? In education, the critical issue was
what to do to ensure that education can take place in shelters more durable than tents. The health sector
poses many “post emergency issues”: Health facilities still had medical supplies when the RTE mission
took place in May, but there is no clear plan for what to do when the funds dry up. In addition, how to
incorporate “disaster preparedness” as part of the recovery efforts ? Some tents distributed to health
facilities have not been used and could be re-assigned or stored in more appropriate places (COUD,
UNICEF warehouse) for further use in case of a new disaster. Other tents are still in use by other
organizations but not in optimal condition and will require longer term alternatives..
57
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
4.2. To what extent is UNICEF’s response specifically contributing to improving the resilience of
local government systems and their capacity to prepare, respond and mitigate the effects of an
emergency? UNICEF did not engage with the municipalities in the affected areas, according to the 3
meetings with mayors and municipal councils organized during the RTE. Yet, UNICEF engagement
with local representatives of the central ministries of the 3 Southern Departments worked relatively well.
Yet , the impact of these collaborations will have only a short duration if they are not sustained over
time as improving institutional resilience takes time.
By providing logistical support and resources for the
initial response, UNICEF helped national actors to
improve their response. In terms of crisis management,
UNICEF engaged significantly with the DGPC at both
the central level (COUN) and the departmental level
(COUD) by supporting their coordination efforts. It
also involved the COUD in some disaster preparedness
training for school personnel.
PHOTO N°11: EFFORTS TO MAKE SCHOOLS EARTHQUAKE
RESISTANT
4.3. To what extent has the response created the
condition on the ground to contribute to the
humanitarian development nexus? UNICEF was
reasonably successful in linking relief, rehabilitation
and development (LRRD), but this varied significantly
depending on the sector. In WASH, the move away
from costly water trucking and the engagement with the
OREPA to rebuild destroyed or dysfunctional
Systèmes d’Approvisionnement en Eau Potable
(SAEP) with more durable materials is significant. The
limiting factor here was UNICEF’s insufficient engagement with communities. In the Health sector,
there were three LRRD issues:
1) the rehabilitation of health infrastructures;
2) how to make the mobile clinic system sustainable, so that it can be reactivated in the event of
a shock; and
3) psychosocial and mental health care for traumatized individuals, in particular children and
women.
Regarding this last point, the lactating women programme is a great success. In the Education sector,
the shift from temporary schools to semi-permanent ones and then to permanent ones is still a subject
of much debate with the MNEFP. Another issue is adapting the curriculum to include DRR and climate
change. LRRD has been more limited in the Protection sector due to the weakness of the Haitian state
in this area. There appears to have been some tension between UNICEF and WFP regarding school
reconstruction. UNICEF was promoting local reconstruction, while WFP adopted a construction method
using prefabricated building elements from Port-au-Prince that were simply assembled in the south, thus
leaving little room for the involvement of local builders or the local authorities. One area where there is
potential to improve the links between emergency relief and development aid is cash transfers, by
building on the changes that have already taken place since the earthquake (HCT specialist on board,
training for HCO staff, etc.).
58
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
Programming for the post-earthquake rehabilitation
The programming for the rehabilitation phase was based on a series of documents:
- The Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), in which UNICEF invested significantly through
the deployment of a highly experienced Surge Team (Education and WASH in particular), and
which was published in November 2021;
- The resulting Plan de Réhabilitation Intégrée de la Péninsule Sud (PRIPS), published in
February 2022 and launched during a pledging conference;
- The 3-6-9 Strategy (the strategy for 3 months, 6 months and 9 months periods after the
earthquake), which clearly indicated four key pillars for the reconstruction: a roof for all
families, a return to school, access to basic social services (health, wash, social support) and a
return to food security. UNICEF has an obvious role in at least two of these pillars.
Nutrition
The nutrition response started early after the earthquake at the central level and within weeks at the
departmental level, both in new areas and by strengthening existing UNICEF-funded activities in areas
where UNICEF was already present. In order to link humanitarian aid and development, UNICEF
provided children with food supplements produced in Haiti, rather than being imported. In the past, food
distributions have been seen by some as undermining local producers, restaurants, and canteens. To limit
dependency on imported RUTF and specialized artificial milk, UNICEF has actively promoted
breastfeeding with the Ministry of Health and WHO. At the same time, it maintained programmes to
assist the limited number of malnutrition cases among under-5s. The Global Nutrition cluster also
provided training in nutritional emergency activities that the Ministry of Health was not familiar with.
As a result, the Ministry of Health decided to simplify several registration forms so that it can react
faster in future emergencies and be more efficient in non-emergency situations. The Nutrition
Department wants to be better prepared for future crises, and wants to organize a lessons-learnt session,
prepare a more operational contingency plan, design simple assessment forms and assess the resistance
of buildings where Nutrition staff work. Training on feeding infants and young children in emergency
situations71 was organised by UNICEF to support the MSPP, with input from the Global Nutrition cluster
Technical Alliance. At the sites visited during
the RTE, the evaluation team observed the ease
with which mothers (and sometimes fathers)
were able to speak about how their behaviour
had changed thanks to health education and
psychological support. The main strategy to
maintain the timeliness and quality of activities
was the funding of Agents de Santé
Communautaire Polyvalent (Multi-purpose
Community Health Workers – ASCP).
However, there were significant difficulties in
coordinating with government counterparts
involved in Nutrition. This caused significant
delays and slowed down the implementation of
UNICEF’s nutritional response on a number of
occasions. PHOTO N°12: HEALTH AND NUTRITION CONSULTATION

Education
Beyond the relief phase, UNICEF was involved
in the Education recovery programme designed
by the Ministry of Education and Professional
Training. as designed by the Ministère de
l’Education National et de la Formation
Professionelle (MENFP). The recovery
strategy included three phases: the first, for
short-term needs, represented 43% of the
budget (17,256 million HTG), the second, for
medium-term needs, 30% (12,276 million) and
the third, for long-term needs, 27% (10,750
million).

Financing the education sector: a key challenge for the Ministry of Education and Professional Training
(MENFP)
The financing of education in Haiti remains a great challenge. In the government's budget, only 13.3% is
allocated to the functioning of the MENFP, whereas in 2016 the budget was 20%. If we analyse the rectified
budget for 2020-2021, of the 12.9% of the budget that was allocated to the MENFP, 9.4% was destined for
the payment of personnel, with almost nothing left over for investment. The MENFP tends to rely on
investment from outside sources. Even the National Education Fund (FNE), which was created by former
president Michel Martelly, is exclusively made up of funds from the Haitian diaspora. In its three years of
operation, the FNE has invested more than 5.5 billion Haitian gourdes in efforts to increase access to
education. It should also be noted that at the national level, the Digicel Foundation has also been financing
school construction since 2007. After the earthquake, it announced that it would invest 1 million US dollars
in the reconstruction of destroyed schools. Meetings with the heads of the three DDEs showed that UNICEF's
funding is very significant and its support for reconstruction is very much appreciated, especially as UNICEF
is one of the few partners to agree to build schools in places with extremely difficult access. Currently UNICEF
is rebuilding 38 schools in the three affected departments, while the PDNA report revealed that 1250 schools
had been damaged as a result of the earthquake. As mentioned by the Minister, Nesmy Manigat, the Education
system is in a state of emergency as many children are still receiving education in tents, while the MENFP has
not received the funding that it had been promised by certain partners, without counting the Martissant
blockade. There is a real need for funding in the Grand Sud and particularly for the reconstruction of schools
with inadequate infrastructure and limited basic services.
It is true that, financially, the state does not have the means to invest more in education. However, from
the beginning of the earthquake, the government has been actively involved in collecting data and
inspecting buildings. The reports and interviews conducted show that there is some ownership of
reconstruction and psychosocial support projects. However, it should be noted that there are constraints
to effective ownership.
Apart from the problem of financing reconstruction, there is also the problem of financing the quality
of education, which goes far beyond the earthquake response. On the ground, the problem of
accessibility and availability of teachers was also raised. For example, in remote areas, it remains a great
challenge for the state to have teachers, let alone competent and qualified ones. When visiting the school
in Bélance in the commune of Beaumont, a teacher who teaches in tents mentioned that most of the
teachers come from the town of Beaumont.
60
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
When it rains, they are unable to come because they do not have the means to travel. In such a situation,
for the 6 classes, there may be two teachers living near the school to teach these children. Even the
headmaster cannot get to the school when the road conditions do not allow it, let alone inspectors who
ensure that the education provided is of a sufficiently high quality.
In the context of the reconstruction, the MENFP plays an important role in selecting the schools to be
supported by UNICEF. Within the MENFP, there is an engineering department that is responsible for
supervising school construction. The departments of Nippes and Grand’Anse have engineers on site.
However, in the southern department, there is no engineering school. Officials from the Departmental
Directorate of Education (DDE) have to rely on engineers attached to the MENFP central office in Port-
au-Prince, who also have to receive a per diem from UNICEF in order to be able to return to the
department to provide supervision in conjunction with UNICEF engineers.
During the evaluation, a number of questions were raised about the effective ownership of the UNICEF
project by the government and other community actors: during the meeting with the Nippes DDE,
officials expressed their concern about the number of classrooms to be built, since the Bernard reform72
provides for nine classrooms, whereas the UNICEF project aims for six. It is understandable that there
was no real debate on the management's needs in terms of the number of classes. Moreover, the criterion
of 100 pupils per UNICEF school was questioned by Nippes DDE insofar as some schools had reached
100 pupils before the earthquake and that following the earthquake, some parents who were afraid of
the building decided to put them in other schools further away. These children could well go back to
their local school. Another issue that was raised was the problem of fencing. When it rains, animals go
into the courtyard and classrooms. People in the community may also use the space inappropriately as
there is no barrier. This can also be a serious problem in terms of security, maintenance and sanitation.
The DDEs of the South and Grand’Anse departments placed a lot of emphasis on the sustainability of
the constructions and the setting aside of the FNE construction plan. The DDEs mentioned their concern
about the semi-permanent nature of the schools to be built. It seems that the dialogues between the
different stakeholders regarding the choice of construction model (UNICEF versus FNE) did not lead
to a real consensus about the model that would be more sustainable and adapted to the recurrent
hydrometeorological events in the Grand Sud region.
In order to help school children overcome psychosocial problems linked to trauma after the earthquake,
UNICEF trained trainers who will now be able to train teachers. However, UNICEF mentioned its
concern about the quality of the training in the sense that the trainers did not necessarily know how to
transmit the messages and they were not adequately prepared to assume such responsibilities.
6.6. Coordination:
THE SYSTEMATIC USE OF POLICY INSTRUMENTS TO DELIVER HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IN A COHESIVE AND EFFECTIVE MANNER
Overarching RTE Question 5: How effectively and efficiently has UNICEF coordinated its response
both internally and externally (with key entities such as other UN Agencies, CSOs and development
partners, national and local governments)?
Internal coordination
In Haiti, this was done through a very time-consuming series of meetings within the HCO, between
HCO and UNICEF les Cayes office. In addition, frequent meetings between HCO, LACRO and HQ
were organized. “Coordination meeting fatigue” was mentioned in several interviews, as many of these
coordination meetings were more about “information sharing” than “operational coordination”.
72 HAITI ESP Sept 2007.doc (unesco.org)
61
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
External coordination
UNICEF’s successes in supporting coordination processes were due to several decisions and actions.
First, it integrated lessons from 2010, by supporting rather than trying to stand in for the government’s
lead role in the response. Quickly after the earthquake, it very strategically embedded one person in the
Les Cayes COUD, while maintaining close collaboration and supporting the General Directorate of Civil
Protection (DGPC). This was highly appreciated by the authorities and gave visibility and inside
information to UNICEF.
The Civil Protection Directorate acknowledged the good work done in preparing the National
Contingency Plan but also found that it focused too much on extreme climatic events, and too little on
earthquakes. The assassination of the President five weeks before the earthquake, the absence of a
functioning Assembly and Senate, the firing of the Chief Prosecutor and an illegitimate PM, combined
with limitations to movement and gatherings, meant that all the ingredients were in place for
coordination to fail.
However, the Civil Protection Agency as well as all the senior technical positions in the ministries
remained operational. The COUN was strategically positioned at the centre of coordination before the
earthquake. When clusters are activated, their coordination system normally involves two co-leads (one
UN agency and one NGO). In Haiti, in the absence of cluster activation, the lead position was assigned
to specific line ministries or designated Departments. This was not always easy, and it delayed the initial
response due to many logistical and staffing difficulties on the Haitian side. With time, though, it was
generally effective in avoiding critical gaps in the response and in reducing duplication. UNICEF
immediately assisted technical departments at the central and department levels in coordinating and
sharing information respectively under the auspices of the COUN and COUD. All the interviews in Port-
au-Prince and the three departments confirmed that this coordination was effective and that UNICEF’s
role in it was widely appreciated. UNICEF’s fund-raising efforts were, unfortunately, only partly
successful. This is one area where the “coordination/competition” between agencies can raise tensions.
The high level of competition for funding and visibility between UN agencies limited the synergy that
would be expected from a “One-UN” approach. This was particularly apparent in communication and
fundraising activities. UNICEF collaborated with UN agencies for many activities in the field and at the
technical level (WFP, OCHA, HC/RC, UNFPA, WHO, UNDSS). The Nutrition Department of the
Ministry of Health perceived UNICEF as a key partner thanks to close relations and trust built up over
years of cooperation. UNICEF was Nutrition cluster co-lead.
RTE Sub question
6.1. How effectively has UNICEF balanced its ‘internal’ operations with cluster
coordination/leadership responsibilities? To what extent are considerations of comparative
advantage applied in designing and implementing the response and, as applicable, recovery
efforts? UNICEF was a key player in coordination during the emergency phase at the National and les
Cayes levels and, to a lesser extent, in Grand’Anse and Nippes, both generally and in its thematic areas
of responsibility. The lack of data collection capacity within UNICEF prior to the earthquake and the
lack of administrative support to the field team made the task of systematically producing factual reports
challenging. However, unstructured information was rapidly shared through multiple channels and
reflected in the media. Luckily, the responsibility to supervise UNICEF’s contribution to the Post
Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) was assigned to one specific team. This helped to highlight the
position and role of UNICEF relatively well.
62
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
6.2. How well did UNICEF support the government at different levels (districts, city, provincial,
central) in coordinating the response? UNICEF support to the different government levels varied a
great deal. The government decided that the cluster system would not be activated. However, UNICEF’s
financial and logistical support to coordination at the central and departmental levels was very effective
and widely recognized. UNICEF’s decision to accompany the government rather than act in its place,
meant that there was a quick start, appropriate actions were taken, and synergy with the Civil Protection
Agency and the line ministries. There were, nevertheless, some tensions. For instance, national and local
institutions shared their frustration on the issue of assistance in the IDP sites as this assistance to IDP
site was against national policy. They indicated that they could have interrupted the activities on the
sites, which they did not do for humanitarian reason. They also mentioned that if they had been involved
at the beginning, they would not have accepted semi-permanent constructions, because within two or
three years the wood and plywood will be damaged by rain, and they would have opted for concrete
block construction. During the field visit, the RTE team met with several municipal authorities (Les
Cayes, Chantal, Jérémie) to understand their involvement in the response to the earthquake. It appears
that the people in charge were not contacted, even though local authorities are the gateway to a town
and know the local context very well. Their ownership of projects being implemented in their
community is essential. They were very appreciative of the work done by UNICEF.
6.3. How effective was the CO in coordinating the setting up and the development of new
operational stations at the height of the crisis? The CO provided sufficient resources to strengthen
the Les Cayes office, but little was done to create a proper UNICEF presence in Grand’Anse and Nippes.
Logistical issues in Jeremie, due to the inability to cross the river, and the fact that Miragoane was
largely untouched (while the rest of the department was badly hit), were frequently mentioned to explain
this situation. This of course meant that UNICEF was less visible and less involved in the operational
follow-up and the dialogue with the authorities.
6.7. Equity (GENDER AND DISABILITY)
Overarching RTE Question 6: To what extent have gender and disability dimensions been integrated in
the needs assessment, and in the planning, implementation, monitoring and reporting of the response,
as well as in recovery planning? A part from the “all victims” approach taken during the emergency
phase and specific programmes established for the recovery phase, gender and disability dimensions
were not central to the design of the response.
RTE Sub question
7.1. What are/were the specific gender and equity dimensions of the emergency? What particular
challenges or good practices have arisen in working with vulnerable groups? In Haiti, women and
children are often victims of violence of different kinds and require proper protection. UNICEF had to
develop a specific approach to manage these issues properly. This entailed working with specific
national institutions and specialised NGOs. The strong presence of women within UNICEF teams was
also an important asset.
7.2. Were activities and practices (including assessments, innovations etc.) implemented based on
ethical principles (respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice)? The RTE team did
not find many traces of new activities specifically based on ethical principles, although the teams
involved in child protection and Protection Against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) did their
best to protect individual data.

7. LESSONS LEARNED
A series of lessons have been identified:
Lesson N°1: Humanitarian assistance has the greatest impact when local/national authorities are
leading the operations (related to the DAC criterion of ‘relevance’)
This earthquake’s impact was smaller than the 2010 earthquake. It was not part of the international
headline news, and therefore there was much less pressure to step over state institutions, as seen in
January 2010. Nonetheless, it is important to mention that UNICEF took into account some of the 2010
earthquake evaluation73 recommendations by accepting that the national institutions should have the
leadership of the response. National institutions lacked financial means, supplies, staff and advanced
technology, but their technical capacity, legitimacy and knowledge of the affected population helped to
make UNICEF’s response meaningful. UNICEF’s response had some limitations and sometimes was
delayed by national decision-making processes (particularly in Nutrition). However, in general, it was
very relevant as it was fast and appropriate over the period under review (see EQ 1.1) and was adapted
to needs due to being more embedded in the government response than in previous events (EQ 1.7). It
was also in keeping with humanitarian principles (EQ1.8).
Lesson N°2: Humanitarian assistance has the greatest impact when the population, local
grassroots organisations and community-based organisations are involved (related to the DAC
criterion of 'effectiveness’)
Actors at the local level have an appropriate understanding of the context, the impact of the earthquake,
the population’s needs and the true capacities of the local responders. Several local authorities are
disconnected from politics and are well rooted locally, which enhanced the relevance and effectiveness
of post-earthquake relief (DAC criteria). UNICEF’s response benefited from the involvement of local
people and organisations on a number of occasions: the reactivation of the U-Report system (EQ 1.3);
the establishment of a local office prior to the events (EQ 1.4, 2.2); the presence of local stocks of
supplies (EQ 2.2); by supporting local assessments (EQ2.1); by supporting local mobile health response
teams (EQ 2.2 health); immediate water trucking (EQ 2.2); and deep involvement in decentralised
entities like IBERS (EQ 2.2 Child protection). In addition, the mobilisation of these local capacities was
essential for the short-term response and will continue to be for the longer-term recovery and the chance
to develop proper disaster preparedness. The lesson is also identified as to reduce some of the limitation
in the field presence (EQ 6.1) or to stimulate closer involvement with municipalities (EQ 6.2. in the
future.
Lesson N°3: Field and institutional presence is effective to ensure proper preparedness and
response (related to the DAC criteria of ‘effectiveness’ and ‘efficiency’)
The decision to strengthen the Les Cayes office (EQ 2.2) and to facilitate UNICEF’s temporary presence
in Jérémie and Miragoane was key to the success of the response.74 It allowed for stronger links with
local actors and better accountability to the affected population. It also helped to enhance UNICEF’s
position vis-à-vis media exposure. The decision to further strengthen and increase the authority of the
local office will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of recovery programmes. The existence of
field offices and the embedding of staff in the Civil Protection Agency and in line with the ministries
should not depend on the availability of emergency funding.

Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
It should be an integral part of the development programme in a country where the agenda is likely to
be driven by socio-natural crises for the decade ahead.75 (EQ 4.3 nexus) However, after six months,
there was no longer a field office in Jérémie or Miragoane (due to lack of means), which hampered
UNICEF's field work. UNICEF’s major success in terms of response (direct assistance in the field,
coordination) was due to the dedication of its staff (EQ 2.6) and their ability to react quickly and take
advantage of opportunities when they arose despite fatigue and frustration due to the absence of key
staff and tensions resulting from the high demand from the leadership (EQ 2.2 use of L2, staffing.76
Lesson N°4: CCC, L2, and other procedures are clearly very useful mechanisms (related to the
DAC criteria of ‘effectiveness’ and ‘efficiency’)
The L2 activation facilitated the response a great deal. Although known only in a limited way, CCC was
regularly quoted as a useful framework for UNICEF staff,77 and planning with the CCC indicators will
help to improve future Country Programme Documents (CPD). However, this will require more than
additional regular training. It will require the development of simulation exercises, especially for
administrative staff who are responsible for managing resources effectively. The L2 activation requires
timely technical assistance from the RO to ensure the quality of UNICEF’s emergency response (EQ
2.2 L2 box, ccc). The difficulties that the CO encountered in sharing an Emergency Response Plan,
despite repeated requests from RO/HQ, were due to the complexity of developing a plan in an extremely
fast-changing situation where there is a lack of reliable information. This nevertheless led to a number
of missed opportunities. It hindered the capacity of RO/HQ to provide proactive technical support, to
properly support effective fundraising efforts, due to lack of information about the CO’s plans for the
response. This also limited the capacity of LACRO and HQ to develop strategic/political interventions.78
Many activities were implemented in the field, but mostly on a reactive and ad-hoc basis. The CCC, L2
and SOPs were too little known by the staff to be immediately implemented.79 The humanitarian
programme monitoring tool did not perform as well as expected. The ability to regularly update the
warehouse inventory were available within UNICEF and its partners. Local purchase possibilities were
at the disposal of all required personnel in order to reduce expensive and delayed procurements and
increase local purchase of supplies and services.
Lesson N°5: the central role of information management and M&E (related to the DAC criteria
of ‘effectiveness’ and ‘relevance’)
Information is critical to institutional positioning, fundraising, and coordination. For the first two weeks,
UNICEF did not perform too well as many key staff were absent (EQ 2.2 staffing). The Flash Appeal
was launched rapidly, and UNICEF contributed, but the quality of data was perhaps not very high (EQ
2.1). Each sector needs to work with their counterparts to prepare the collection of rapid assessment
information together. However, in order to ensure that the HCO could count on a strong M&E team, the
latter should not only be a “reporting tools” but a “programme steering instrument” with clear warning
systems and real-time transmission of information to decision-makers. The sectors (technical teams) and
administration/operations greatly contributed to the office M&E processes but the design of the system
limited their contributions for programme management. The absence of a data manager and the lack of
administrative support for the first response team overburdened staff who had to simultaneously manage
the response, provide accurate information and participate in complex ad-hoc coordination activities.80
The absence of the Programme Coordinator (Deputy Representative) further complicated the issue.
Similarly, recovery was not sufficiently included in relief planning, (EQ 4.1 and resilience 4.2)

Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
Lesson N°6: Financial management (related to the DAC criterion of ‘efficiency’)
There is a need to have a proper grant management system in place, under the Deputy Representative,
from the beginning of operations. All this financial information is available in UNICEF’s internal tools
(“insight” and “VISION”), but there was insufficient capacity in the HCO to do everything that needed
to be done. Funds that were available within the UNICEF system were not used. Many Section Chiefs
did not know how to manage their budget well enough in order to reallocate funds to other (emergency)
programmes and necessary guidance was not provided due to the prolonged absence of the Deputy
Representative for Programmes. There was not enough internal training on how to manage budgets for
grant management to take place. This information gap within the HCO led the CO management to
continuously request more funds (criteria 6.3 ‘efficiency’).
Lesson N°7: Two critical ingredients for a good response are staff and a functional organigram
(related to the DAC criteria of ‘efficiency’)
The absence of the four most senior members of the office was addressed through a number of effective
and opportune decisions, especially by the HCO leadership (EQ 2.2 staffing).81 This was made possible
with the immediate reallocation of HCO staff and the arrival of surge staff within a few days from other
parts of the organization (many people were outposted from their normal location for a few weeks) (EQ
2.2 Staff surge). However, the limits of short-term staffing quickly became apparent and the strategy
moved towards longer-term staffing in the Les Cayes office. Staff returning to the country were
reassigned to tasks that were not part of their normal functions/responsibilities if these were being done
by surge staff. The surge was highly effective but could have been much more efficient with a longer-
term vision based on previous emergency response activities.
Lesson N°8: Coordination is an essential component of a relevant, agile and effective response
(related to the DAC criteria of ‘coordination’)
From the onset of the crisis, the UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator indicated that
UN humanitarian coordination efforts should support the primary role of the national authorities, based
on previous evaluation reports and humanitarian principles. UNICEF fully endorsed this policy and
supported the national institutions engaged in their key sectors of activity (EQ 1.7 and 1.8). UNICEF’s
performance in inter-agency coordination requires new strategic engagements with WFP (school
canteens, nutrition) (EQ 1.6), OPS/PAHO and UNFPA for health system support, with FAO for school
gardens programmes and nutrition sensitive support for vulnerable families (DAC criteria:
coordination). The government refused to activate the Cluster mechanism. UNICEF was nevertheless
responsible for sector coordination in Nutrition, Education and WASH. UNICEF’s role in supporting
the national leads at the central and departmental level is widely recognised (EQ 6.1). Other
agencies/institutions/NGOS were also involved in this sector-based coordination (EQ 2.2 multi-sector
coordination) and most appreciated these nationally-led coordination systems, although their efficiency
varied over time and depending on whether it was the central or departmental level. It should be noted
that most coordination had to take place online because of the complex context in which the earthquake
took place (COVID-19, a political and institutional legitimacy vacuum and insecurity).
81 Interviews with HCO staff
66
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
Lesson N°9: Coordination with the private sector is still in development but could be very useful
(related to the DAC criterion of ‘coordination’)
Partnerships with private sector actors, such as DIGICEL, were original and useful (EQ 4.3 ). Private
sector organisations were involved in rehabilitating schools, providing transportation and re-establishing
telecommunications, among other things (EQ 2.5).82 However, suddenly embarking on new activities,
such as construction or Cash-On-Hand, exposed them to significant risks, and should be balanced with
partnerships with other UN agencies, such as WFP and IOM (EQ 2.2). The procedures involved had
many shortcomings that should be addressed before the next crisis (DAC criteria 6.3 efficiency). Should
UNICEF decide it has a mandate in these areas, it should establish a permanent programme to prepare
for better engagement with the private sector (for example, by clarifying what ‘good school design’
should be, or how to ensure that WASH teams have the right mechanisms for Cash-On-Hand
transactions, for quick repairs).
Lesson N°10: The better the emergency preparedness, the better the response and the higher the
impact (related to the DAC criteria of ‘connectedness’)
In a context prone to emergencies, after so many disasters in the recent past, and so many external
evaluations and lessons learned, the basics of emergency preparedness were just not sufficiently in place
(EQ 2.4), including in terms of supplies (EQ 2.5). This is particularly serious given the growing impact
of climate change and forecasts of increased tectonic activities.83 The fact that the country is still
insufficiently prepared to respond to emergencies has raised questions about the impact of international
efforts in DRR and the fact that too large a proportion of funding goes to response. However, the
successful aspects of UNICEF’s earthquake response both at the country level (stock available, DINEPA
capacity, the Representative’s relationship with the authorities, the Les Cayes office, etc.) and the
support from regional and HQ levels (surge, CCC, L2, SOPs, ERT, etc.) were immediately related to
preparedness activities (EQ 2.2, staff surge, field office preparation, L2 declaration, knowledge of CCC,
etc.). Likewise, most weaknesses, either internally (administrative processes) or externally (the late
discovery of new rapid assessment forms by the government) were related to lack of preparedness (EQ
1.4, 2.2 cyclone preparedness, etc.).84 Some can be quickly addressed through lessons learned or
simulation exercises or the revision of the Country Programme Document (CPD), but most will require
years of predictable investment. This should be included in the next CPD to ensure that training takes
place and plans are regularly up-dated. Ensuring that preparedness is included in all programmes in the
future in order to facilitate “risk-informed and shock-responsive development programming” would be
the best way to contribute to strengthening the resilience of Haiti.
Lesson N°11: The importance of Child Protection, Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse
(PSEA) and all activities related to gender and equity issues
Due to previous issues in Haiti (the OXFAM scandal),85 PSEA was given a high profile. All staff had to
sign the Code of Conduct. It was made prominent at all levels (HCO, field, COUN, COUD, etc.). The
accountability survey launched by UNICEF in the name of the interagency system in Haiti, as well as
several U-Report point out at serious concern (EQ 2.2 evaluation sexual exploitation).86 Despite many
functional difficulties and its relatively low visibility, the dedicated hotline is a major achievement,
maintaining the dialogue with all communities in order to attain UNICEF objectives in this area (EQ
1.6).87

Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
Ready-to-eat meals, school kits and recreation kits were dispatched to the field. Recreation kits were
specifically allocated to the child protection programmes to create child friendly spaces. In view of the
complexity of local procurement and changing needs according to the time of the operation and the
location, it was essential to deal properly with Cash-On-Hand (CoHa) processes with a rigorous and
flexible approach.88 A faster approval process should have been put in place very early in the crisis
management cycle. If the regular operation system had been functioning, there would not have been the
same problems increasing the speed and flexibility of the flow of cash during the emergency response.
The lesson learned here is that a CO in a crisis-prone context should never have four top managers
absent from the country at the same time (the Representative, both Deputy Representatives and the
Emergency Manager).89 At least two of them should be present in the country at any given time. There
is now a relatively strong capacity in Les Cayes, but this will soon be jeopardised if additional funding
is not forthcoming, and the capacities of local authorities and communities are not enhanced. UNICEF
still has insufficient capacities in the other departments to ensure a meaningful presence.90
Lesson N°12: Duty of Care
Staff were, and still are, in a very stressful environment, with insecurity, kidnappings, and difficult
economic conditions (DAC Criteria 6.3 efficiency) Staff morale was generally low even before the
earthquake. A lot of national and international staff felt the weight of this insecurity. Duty of care issues
need to be given sufficient attention and need to be dealt with early, especially in such a difficult
environment. Supporting caregivers and responders should be seen as a priority.91 Attending to
children’s needs requires well trained staff. The impact of the earthquake generated a sudden increase
in demand on staff who were already drained due to security issues (one staff member was killed and
one kidnapped prior to the earthquake), COVID-19 isolation and control measures, the reduction in staff
numbers due to reduced funding, the absence of a stable government and national counterparts and not
knowing if their homes or lodgings were earthquake resistant. Enormous pressure was created,
especially for existing HCO staff, due to the arrival of large numbers of surge staff who were not always
familiar with Haitian reality, slow administrative processes, changes in assignments, new demands from
the regional office and HQ due to L2 status activation, HCO’s constant requests for additional funding,
management who expected total flexibility and dedication, and the delays before the arrival of staff to
counsel surge staff.
Debriefings and discussions with specialists were organised and the two collective debriefing sessions
were highly appreciated.92 However, there were no proper structures and mechanisms to deal with Duty
of Care with clear benchmarks. Regular assessments of the different aspects that contribute to staff
wellbeing are needed (economic, security, the impact of home-based working hours, etc.) to ensure that
any deterioration can be managed proactively. Regular consultations are needed with staff to monitor
their state of mind. There should also be a clear, fully discussed office improvement plan, and a system
for staff support (psychosocial counselling). And proper mechanisms to facilitate the flow of information
from staff to management are needed (linked to CHS criteria N°8).

Lesson N°13: The importance of leadership
The involvement of the UNICEF Representative and their engagement with the UNICEF team, as well
as with the Authorities, the UN system and NGOs, was crucial.93 Their engagement with the Haitian
authorities was underlined and largely appreciated. Engagement with the UN system was good but
sometimes polluted by competition over rare financial resources and fear of mandate encroachment.94
The most critical issue for under-pressure management was distinguishing between staff support and
micro-management. The absence of key staff at the time of the earthquake made things even harder and
should have been addressed much earlier in order to ensure that there was a better response, more
predictable operations and more time devoted to duty of care and wellbeing of the staff.(EQ 6.6, 6.5
Criteria 6.3 ).

response (TOR a)
Relevance
In general, UNICEF’s response was in keeping with the Haitian government’s priorities. However, UNICEF
insufficient preparedness limited the effectiveness of the response. The HCO/LACRO UNICEF response lacked
internal cohesion, struggled to reach the most remote rural areas (“most affected populations”), and did not
engage directly with communities.
Effectiveness
The extent to which UNICEF achieved its expected results is limited. UNICEF’s effectiveness is less related to
“achieving intended targets” (non-existent) and more linked to its capacity to engage in a timely manner and
energetically in a series of emergency response interventions. This varied significantly depending on the sector
and the phase: highly effective during the health, emergency education and emergency WASH responses, but
less so during the recovery phase. Improvement is needed in terms of child protection
There were a few barriers and enablers in relation to effectiveness:
• Staffing: At the beginning of the response, a number of key staff, especially in the senior positions, were
absent. There was significant pressure on staff, leading to “near burn out” situations.
• The Les Cayes Office provided field presence and opportunities for strengthening coordination.
• Access to information: The challenges with the rapid assessment and multi-sectoral assessment tools and
the lack of a consolidated shared vision on what tools to use before the earthquake hindered the early
phase of the rapid assessment.
• The L2 Declaration was vital to the emergency response.
The level of effectiveness varied from one sector to the other. Health and WASH proved highly effective.
Education was effective during the emergency phase, though less so during the recovery phase due to
constraints that significantly held up the reconstruction of the school. As Protection and Nutrition are of
secondary importance during the acute phase, the efforts made were sufficient. Of course, protection efforts
increased significantly with time.
Efficiency:
Efficiency varied significantly depending on the sector, the phase and the area, depending largely on the
respective importance of item supplies in each of the programmes. It is clear that the choice made by UNICEF to
work in the most hard-to-reach areas created extra costs and delays and limited efficiency. Some of the direct
procurement and implementation efforts did not prove to be the most efficient way to proceed.
Coverage
During the immediate post-disaster situation, UNICEF targeted “affected populations“ in general and not
“specific categories”. Only some specific UNICEF programmes included targeting. Coverage varied by sector
and geographic area due to different levels of logistical constraints.
Connectedness
Recovery considerations were not fully incorporated into planning for relief interventions. Yet efforts became
more systematic as soon as the emergency needs had received a more sustained response. UNICEF engaged
significantly with the relevant national and departmental levels, but not with the municipalities, and UNICEF’s
LRRD contribution varied significantly depending on the sector. The links between UNICEF efforts in relief and
recovery are not sufficiently linked with disaster preparedness.
Coordination
While internal (UNICEF) coordination was not always optimal and was more a case of “information sharing”
than “operational coordination”, UNICEF’s contribution to external coordination was widely recognized and
highly appreciated in all sectors .

A. Background
Impact and damages of Haiti 2021 earthquake
On August 14th, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti, causing hospitals, schools and homes to collapse, claiming
hundreds of lives, and leaving communities in crisis. The three most affected departments include Sud, rand’ nse
and Nippes, while UNICEF estimates that about 2.200 lost their lives and 1.2 million people, including 540,000 children,
have been affected by the powerful earthquake. The earthquake's devastating impact was later compounded with
heavy rains from the tropical depression Grace on 17 August, causing flooding in the same quake-affected areas. The
combined impact of the earthquake and the Tropical Depression Grace have left 650,000 people in need of emergency
humanitarian assistance, of which 500,000 are being targeted by UN agencies and humanitarian partners through the
activities planned under the recently launched $187.3 million Flash Appeal. Based on an initial impact assessment, the
Government estimates that damages from the powerful 7.2-magnitude quake exceed US$1 billion, as national
authorities plan a more detailed assessment of damages, losses and post-earthquake needs in collaboration with the
tripartite partnership comprised of the UN, the European Union and the World Bank as well as the Inter-American
Development Bank. The back-to-back disasters are exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities. In fact, the persistent
political instability, is further compounded by socioeconomic crisis and rising food insecurity and malnutrition, gang
related insecurity and internal displacement, the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the Haitian-Dominican migration
sit ation. e F as ea states t at “At the time of the disaster, Haiti is still reeling from the 7 July assassination of
President Jovenel Moïse and still facing an escalation in gang violence since June that has affected 1.5 million people,
with at least 19,000 displaced in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince. The compounded effects of an ongoing
political crisis, socio-economic challenges, food insecurity and gang violence continue to greatly worsen an already
precarious humanitarian situation”.
UNICEF’s response
In response, UNICEF Haiti is supporting the Government and humanitarian partners to ensure the continuity of basic
services, including water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), education, health, nutrition, child protection and social
protection services, while facilitating disaster risk reduction, emergency preparedness, and interventions to address
violence against children as well GBV and prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse.
On August 19th, following the Haitian Government State of Emergency Declaration, UNICEF’s Executive Director
activated a Level 2 Corporate Emergency Activation Procedure (CEAP) for Haiti’s earthquake response for an initial
period of 3 months. On August 25th, an inter-agency flash appeal was launched requesting US$187.3M, US$73.3M of
which were requested by UNICEF, for a period of 3 months. In parallel, UNICEF Humanitarian Action Appeal (HAC) for
Haiti was reviewed in early September2, requesting US$122.2 million to meet the humanitarian needs of Haitian children
and their families. This includes US$ 73.3 million for the earthquake response and US$48.9 million to reach 1.6 million
people, including 800,757 children, over a 6-month period from August 2021 to February 2022. era UNICEF’s
response to Haiti earthquake was informed by the varying scale of the disaster and the differing contexts in each
department. Overall, in the first few weeks of the crisis, UNICEF provided critical life-saving assistance and recovery
support to affected populations, while strengthening its support to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) crisis in the
metropolitan area providing WASH, health, nutrition, education and child protection services, and strengthened disaster
risk reduction and emergency preparedness through various modalities including cash transfers. According to UNICEF’s
Appeal “UNICEF continued supporting access to essential health care services, including immunization and maternal and
child health, as well as prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition.” The health sector responses included the
provision of essential medicines, medical supplies, equipment and nutritional supplies as well as support for health care
services resumption. WASH response interventions “ensured access to sufficient safe drinking water for vulnerable
communities, provide emergency latrines, and hygiene services, including critical hygiene supplies, hand washing
facilities, and COVID-19 prevention” and “the rehabilitation/upgrade of damaged WASH facilities” as well as “hygiene
promotion and awareness raising in health centers and schools” for the prevention of “infectious diseases including
cholera, diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and COVID-19”. For education sector, " UNICEF promoted a safe return to school
through provision of school supplies for school reopening and access to distance learning programmes where needed.” to
respond to extended school closure. In earthquake affected areas, “UNICEF prioritised the rapid establishment of
temporary learning spaces and rehabilitate schools to provide a protective environment for 100,000 boys and girls while
providing mental health and psychosocial support to students and teachers.” UNICEF also supports national partners for
78
Haïti UNICEF RTE Evaluation report Septembre 2022
the provision of child Protection services “to children exposed to violence, including gender-based violence, exploitation
and family separation” as well as “psychosocial support, identification, referral and service provision for vulnerable
children, and community and family sensitization on child protection risks and preventative measures.” “UNICEF provided
emergency cash transfers to help the most vulnerable families meet their immediate needs” in order to mitigate the
negative socio-economic impacts of crises. “In collaboration with the Government, UNICEF leads the WASH sector,
continued to co-lead in education, nutrition, child protection sub-sector. Gender equality, Accountability to Affected
Populations (AAP) and Protection against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) was mainstreamed throughout the
response”. Approximately two months after the onset of the emergency, the immediate life-saving supply provision
mode of the response was gradually phasing out, the medium-term response still needs to focus on the resumption
of interrupted essential services and the continuation of essential services. The challenges linked with the recovery phase
are presenting themselves in different forms from immediate responses, yet with a common underlying query of how
to reconstruct and restore basic services, while laying the ground for increased resilience and more sustainable solutions
‘ o to i d ac etter’ gi en t e fact t at t e country have been facing multiple crisis and the disaster-prone
context remains.
Purpose and Objectives of the Evaluation
UNICEF’s CR is proposing a real-time e a ation R E of UNICEF’s res onse to Haiti’s 0 eart a e to generate
time y feed ac and earning on ey e ements of its res onse i e com ying it UNICEF’s Evaluation policy
requirements.3 Given that this is a rapid-onset emergency, the value of rapidly-available evidence-based findings, and
the support they can provide in informing the upcoming transition to the recovery phase, makes a strong case for an
RTE of the response to Haiti earthquake to be conducted at this point in time.
Purpose
e R E of UNICEF’s res onse to Haiti eart a e is ex ected to a e a strong earning r ose on se era fronts: i)
providing iterative feedback loops, both operationally and programmatically, into the initial phase of UNICEF’s res onse
to the crisis; ii) informing the direction of ongoing recovery efforts and planning of forthcoming response phases; iii)
identifying lessons to strengthen resilience and the future preparedness levels of UNICEF Country Office (CO) and
Government as well as key partners; and iv) supporting the learning of Regional Office (RO) and HQ vis-a’-vis the activation
of emergency procedures in the future. In this sense the evaluation is expected to yield learning that will be useful and
applicable not only the CO level but also it t e nationa as e as t e R e e . e R E i fina y strengt en UNICEF’s
accountability towards affected populations, as well as partners and stakeholders supporting the response at large, and
should be thus conceived as an intrinsic component of the humanitarian response itself. In line with this purpose, the
RTE is expected to generate actionable recommendations on how to strengthen ongoing recovery efforts from Haiti
earthquake and how to improve future preparedness, response and planning for recovery after sudden onset
emergencies in Haiti.
Objectives
The objectives of the evaluation are as follows:
a. In ine it t e earning com onent mentioned a o e t e e a ation i determine UNICEF’s response to Haiti’s
earthquake vis-a’-vis issues of appropriateness/relevance, effectiveness 4 , coverage, connectedness5 and
coherence (coordination/partnerships).6
b. Assess the extent to which UNICEF adhered operationally and programmatically, to the Core
Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action (CCCs)
c. Examine the extent to which UNICEF effectively responded to the needs of the most affected population in timely
manner and identify gaps and appropriate strategies to improve operational coverage and effectiveness.
d. Assess the extent to which emergency preparedness and organizational readiness have enabled Haiti to respond
more effectively. This should include reviewing the extent to which UNICEF has systematically incorporated
lessons learned from previous Independent Review of UNICEF’s
Operational Response to the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti7 and the 2019 ALNAP 16 lessons on responding to
earthquakes8 into its preparedness strategies in the current response; how the Emergency Preparedness Platform
(EPP), SOPS, HR/surge capacities; data and monitoring systems; social protection/shock responsive systems in
place, etc. have all enabled the Haiti country to respond rapidly. The experience on Huracan Mathew in the same
area of disaster will be used as reference8.
e. Examine the extent to which the Haiti Country Office have considered gender and equity during the response,
including how UNICEF has been gender-responsive across its efforts and sensitive to the needs of the most
vulnerable groups affected by the emergency (e.g. communities in hard-to-reach areas; people with disabilities;
separated, unaccompanied children etc.).9 Along these lines, the evaluation should be informative about the ways
in which Haiti earthquake affected different categories of people and the extent to which UNICEF has, in turn,
incorporated this knowledge as a key driver of its response.
f. Finally, the evaluation is expected to distil lessons and make recommendations for adjusting and improving the
response and planning for recovery after sudden onset emergencies.
By showcasing what UNICEF has done well so far and identifying key gaps and the areas that will require more focus
(in terms of efforts and funds) in the next stage of the response, the evaluation is also anticipated to have an
instrumental role in supporting fundraising efforts for the recovery phase.

Expected Users
The expected primary audience of t is R E is UNICEF’s management and staff at t e fie d co ntry regiona and HQ
levels involved in the response to Haiti earthquake; Secondary audiences include: the larger community of partners
(governmental, UN agencies and other implementing partners; populations affected by the emergency, the Executive
Board and interested member states; donor agencies that support emergency programmes with technical and financial
resources at all levels, among others. Finally, the evaluation report and its summary brief will be publicly available on
UNICEF’s Co ntry ffice and Regiona Office website page.
Special Considerations
The design and timing of the RTE will pay due consideration to the ongoing Formative Evaluation of UNICEF Haiti country
programme 2017-202311. The design and planning of the RTE will factor in the diverse magnitude of the crisis in Haiti
(including insecurity and displacement crisis as well as COVID-19). With the initial emergency phase covered by the
revised HAC 2021, largely over at the time the RTE will be conducted, the emergency response and recovery efforts will
be covered in equal measure by the exercise.
Evaluation Scope
The RTE will cover UNICEF’s response in Haiti, starting from mid-August 2021, when the earthquake struck the Sud,
rand’ nse and Ni es de artments. ood art of t ese de artments as affected a so y t e Tropical Depression
Grace dumping heavy rains in southern Haiti, causing flooding in the same quake-affected areas. Areas of these 3
departments, where the impact of the earthquake was the greatest, will represent a relatively greater focus of the
evaluation. Pre-emergency issues will be looked at only in relation to contingency planning and preparedness and the
extent to ic t ey affected UNICEF’s res onse to t e emergency. Given the real-time nature of the exercise, the
timeframe will cover the ongoing response until the evaluation team is deployed to the field. The evaluation will assess
UNICEF’s humanitarian action across urban and rural locations affected by the earthquake, including areas of displacement
(accommodation centres), return, relocation and resettlement, where present, and hard-to-reach areas, wherever
possible. Along these lines, primary data collection from key informants will be prioritised in the most affected areas of
the country including but not limited to the d rand’ nse and Nippes departments. Programmatically, the evaluation
will cover UNICEF’s multi-sectoral interventions across the areas of WASH, health, nutrition, education, C4D, child
rotection and socia rotection. e R E i co er UNICEF’s ro e as cluster lead, as relevant, as well as its responsibilities
to respond to the needs of affected populations in sectors where it has no cluster leadership obligations. The RTE will also
assess, from an operational standpoint, the availability and management of supplies, human and financial resources and
partnerships which feed into the response. Advocacy, communications and fundraising will also be assessed to the extent
to which they were factors that affected (facilitated/hampered) the response. A Post Disaster Needs Assessment of any
ongoing recovery programming t at does not ertain to UNICEF’s response to the earthquake is beyond the scope of this
evaluation. The RTE will gauge the ‘immediate effects’ that UNICEF’s humanitarian action contributed towards the affected
population. Yet, given the nature of the exercise and context it i not iso ate t e c ange and attri te it to UNICEF’s
specific intervention (or, in ot er ords e a ate ‘im act’ . s mentioned a o e gi en t e recurrent and cyclical nature
of natural hazards in Haiti and more specifically the 2010 Haiti earthquake response and the Southern Provinces following
Hurricane Matthew, the evaluation will try to reflect and gather evidence on the extent to which UNICEF has contributed,
over time, to improving preparedness/resilience to rapid onset disasters - with the understanding that considerations on
the specific impact of UNICEF’s response to the 2021 Haiti earthquake on future preparedness levels pertain to future
exercises. The RTE will also provide an analysis of UNICEF’s coordination/c ster res onsi i ities and o e it balanced

whether or not UNICEF the Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) has been effectively into consideration
in its programming in the context of Haiti 2021 earthquake response – however, it will not assess systematically the results
of such programming, given that this would require additional time and different sets of competencies. As part of recovery
efforts, it would be pertinent to consider how the Post Disaster National Assessment is planned and established based
on the recovery needs, and the role played by UNICEF in this exercise.
B. Indicative Evaluation QuestionIn line with the objectives outlined above, the following two tables list a set of
general overarching questions and a more specific set of queries/sub-questions, respectively, that will drive the
evaluation. They will be fine-tuned, revised and reduced, as deemed appropriate, to ensure relevance and utilization
of the exercise once the evaluation team is onboard and the RTE Reference Group established.

Approach and Methods
The RTE will adopt a mixed-methods approach, including a desk review of existing secondary data and documentation
(e.g. relevant findings from parallel inter-agency evaluations/ reviews; SitReps; HAC; needs assessments; monitoring
indicators and reports; funding information; HR data; supply data; COs preparedness and contingency plans reflected
in the Emergency Preparedness Platform (EPP); focus group discussions and key informant interviews with a purposive
sample of stakeholders (i.e. affected community members and leaders; UNICEF staff at country/regional/HQ levels;
Government representatives (national and subnational); implementing partners; development and humanitarian
partners and other UN agencies); and observation. To guarantee inclusion, accuracy and credibility of t e e a ation’s
findings, primary data collection and subsequent analysis will be sex and age-disaggregated, to the extent possible. Data
collection should further attempt to gather the views of the diverse universe of stakeholders/social groups affected by
the intervention, particularly the most vulnerable (e.g. displaced population; people with disabilities; hard-to reach
communities; populations who have not moved from places of origin despite loss but have encountered significant
destruction of assets and livelihoods; unaccompanied/separated children; returnees; resettled communities etc.). Data
and information collected will be triangulated to ensure soundness and cross-validated at key points in time, as deemed
relevant by the evaluation team, through in-country briefings with stakeholders. Without compromising the
independence of the exercise, RTEs are by design participatory in nature and built around the regular interaction with
key stakeholders. Along these lines, prior to the departure of the evaluation team from each country, an exit workshop
will be arranged as an opportunity for the evaluators to share findings and recommendations at the country level and
for stakeholders, in turn, to validate such findings prior to the finalization of the evaluation report.
Limitations and anticipated Challenges
Key limitations will include the typical time constraints affecting RTEs, access and availability of data in emergency
contexts and the need to balance timeliness with depth of information and well-substantiated findings. Further
challenges that can be anticipated relate to UNICEF’s humanitarian response in Haiti which does not only focus on the
earthquake response (insecurity, Government instability, access to some areas).
The potential limitations of the RTE as well as the mitigation strategies identified by the assessment team are presented
below:
Table. Limitations and Mitigation Measures
Limitations Mitigation measures

objectives are aligned with expectations.

extensive experience as a team leader in complex evaluation missions in difficult environments.
He has conducted a wide range of studies on disasters (including research and evaluation of
humanitarian programmes, risk management preparedness in Africa, Latin America, Caucasia,
Asia, and the Middle East) for donors, the Red Cross movement, the UN and NGOs. As a former
associate professor at the University of Paris XII, he also teaches at various institutions in Europe,
Canada and the United States. He has written numerous articles for specialist reviews and has

He has contributed to post-disaster needs assessment guidelines developed by OCHA (cluster),
WB- PNUD-ECLAC (PDNA) and WHO. He has been involved in a large number of missions in Haiti
since 1990 including casualty management plans, the creation of the Civil Protection department,
and recovery and resilience projects. He actively participated in the 2010 Haiti earthquake health
sector response and the cholera epidemic response (2014-2017). He was in charge of dialogue
high level authorities, assisted 35 countries, among other with funding of EU/ECHO, USAID, CIDA,
