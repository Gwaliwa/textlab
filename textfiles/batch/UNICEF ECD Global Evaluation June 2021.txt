PREFACE
UNICEF has, over the years, played a key role in setting the global agenda on Early Childhood
Development and advancing the realization of the rights of all children, especially the most disadvantaged,
as affirmed in the 2014 – 2017 Strategic Plan. During this period, UNICEF efforts contributed to the adoption
of Target 2 under SDG 4 on the importance of early childhood development that when the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted in 2015. Nonetheless, UNICEF global leadership and impact on
young children and their families have not been assessed; hence we launched this evaluation to ascertain
the conceptual underpinning of ECD work in UNICEF and to draw, from the past few years of
implementation lessons that can be applied for course correction alongside other the mid-term
assessments. The evaluation was structured around three themes that were arrived at after an extensive
scoping exercise: (1) UNICEF’s Global Leadership (2) System Strengthening (3) Program Quality and
Impact
UNICEF has positioned itself as an ECD leader and expert, policy influencer, capacity developer, and
service provider. In some countries where UNICEF generated evidence on children’s developmental status
or on public financing for ECD and combined this with advocacy and communications, there were notable
increases public investment in ECD in some countries. The Major challenges in implementing UNICEF
global change strategies were associated with (1) financial resources, (2) government allocation of
resources to implement the strategies, (3) political buy-in, and (4) adaptation to the country context. The
impact of COVID-19 on UNICEF’s strategies poses new challenges for the organization and has elevated
the importance of certain strategies.
The global evaluation team consisted of five international experts, with management provided by UNICEF’s
Evaluation Office and with support from UNICEF’s ECD Section within the Programme Division at
UNICEF’s International Headquarters in New York. Dr Pamela Wridt (Senior Monitoring and Evaluation
Expert and ECD Researcher) and Dr Philip David Zelazo (Senior ECD Researcher and Developmental
Neuroscience Expert) served as co-team leaders for this evaluation and were jointly responsible for the
overall conceptualization and quality of the evaluation. Dr Caroline Frobel (ECD Neuroscience Researcher
and Data Scientist) was primarily responsible for data collection, extraction and analysis procedures
associated with UNICEF’s corporate monitoring system. Mr. Jonathan Carter and Mr. Conrad Barberton
(ECD Scaling Experts) from Cornerstone Economic Research in South Africa were primarily responsible
for undertaking the scalability and systems strengthening component of the evaluation.
I would also like to express my gratitude to UNICEF colleagues to the PD ECD Section colleagues;
particularly Nada Elattar, the ECD Section focal person for this evaluation for coordinating technical inputs
in the ECD Section and ably facilitating data collection from regional and country offices. Other ECD Section
team members also provided valuable support and inputs: Pia Britto, Chemba Raghavan, Ana Nieto and
Aditi Shrikhande, the Regional and Country Office ECD Advisor, Specialists and focal persons for their
advice and support, and thought-provoking contributions.
Lastly, I would like to thank my colleagues in the Evaluation Office to see the evaluation through. Kathleen
Letshabo developed the evaluation approach, and Adrian Shikwe who managed the evaluation. As always,
Geeta Dey and Celeste Lebowitz provided strong administrative support throughout the evaluation. I
commend the efforts of all colleagues and believe that our colleagues in the ECD team will find the findings,
insights and recommendations herein useful and timely.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Evaluation Context and Purpose
Evaluation Background. During the period covered by this evaluation, UNICEF’s approach to early
childhood development (ECD) became more grounded in the neuroscience research, as summarised in
The Lancet series on Advancing Early Childhood Development: From Science to Scale (2017). This
publication was co-authored by UNICEF and was a pivotal publication that reflected a paradigm shift in how
ECD is defined, valued, and implemented by policy makers and practitioners on a global and local level. In
particular, the Nurturing Care Framework introduced in this series postulated that ECD is a synergistic
outcome of five interrelated components: 1) good health; 2) adequate nutrition; 3) opportunities for early
learning; 4) security and safety; and 5) responsive caregiving.
Evaluation Rationale. UNICEF programming strategies are in the process of shifting from siloed
approaches to multisectoral ECD packages, encompassing health, nutrition, HIV, WASH, education, child
protection, and social policy. This evaluation provides the first comprehensive assessment of UNICEF work
in Early Childhood Development (ECD), and early stimulation and responsive care, in particular, after
advances in neuroscience research underscored the importance of this period of childhood development
and placed it on the global development agenda. Thus, an evaluation of UNICEF’s leadership in early
childhood development is timely and warranted to assess the organization’s progress in advancing the
holistic ECD agenda through a multisectoral programming approach.
Evaluation Purpose: This is a formative evaluation in which the main purpose was to draw lessons from
policy, advocacy, and programming strategies and interventions to inform good practices and appropriate
course corrections in UNICEF work in ECD. The secondary purpose of the evaluation was to provide
evidence for accountability and oversight within UNICEF and relevant cooperating partners, and to provide
concrete recommendations for strengthening UNICEF’s impact on the lives of young children and their
families in the new strategic planning period.
Object of the Evaluation. This evaluation examines UNICEF’s global leadership in the broader field of
practice to promote ECD, as well as the organization’s support to national governments in ensuring parents
and adult caregivers provide appropriate early stimulation and responsive care to young children as a basis
for their healthy development, school readiness and on-time enrolment into pre-primary and primary school.
This includes a detailed examination of two components of the Nurturing Care Framework: (1) responsive
caregiving; and (2) opportunities for early learning.
Scope of the Evaluation. The evaluation focused on the early years of life - from birth to age of entry into
primary school (usually 0-5, noting that the age of school entry varies by country context). The evaluation
assessed all UNICEF goal areas for early stimulation and responsive care programmes and services on a
global, regional, and country level. The evaluation was both retrospective and prospective (forward looking),
examining the period from 2014 through 2021 (encompassing two Strategic Planning periods). It included
countries in all contexts and situations where UNICEF was or is implementing strategies to strengthen ECD
systems and services, including development, humanitarian, and peacebuilding contexts.
Evaluation Approach and Methods. The evaluation adopted an inductive and retroactive theory-based
approach primarily because the object of the evaluation (early stimulation and responsive care) was not
well defined or codified in the organization’s theory of change and results matrices. The evaluation methods
included a mix of qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis techniques on global, regional,
10
country, and programme levels. Data were collected in five phases using the following methods: (1)
secondary data from 157 countries; (2) document review of more than 400 reports, plans, studies, and
evaluations from 28 UNICEF Country Offices (COs), 7 Regional Offices (ROs), and 5 Headquarter (HQ)
Divisions; (3) institutional survey with 54 UNICEF COs; (4) remote key informant interviews/focus
groups with 21 UNICEF staff members and external experts; and (6) six case studies of UNICEF-
supported parenting programmes or initiatives (Jordan, Mali, Paraguay, Rwanda, Serbia, and Thailand).
Evaluation Criteria and Limitations. Evaluation criteria assessed the internal and external coherence of
UNICEF’s work in early stimulation and responsive care, the effectiveness of UNICEF’s efforts to
strengthen national systems for ECD, and the relevance and outcomes of UNICEF’s leadership and direct
support for parents and young children. Summative evaluation criteria were also identified to provide
qualitative ratings on the scope and strength of the evidence from nascent to advanced. In light of the global
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation team could not undertake primary data collection
activities through direct contact with stakeholders and beneficiaries, and observations of the implementation
of interventions; hence we modified the original evaluation design and methods accordingly. However,
additional questions about the impact of COVID-19 on UNICEF’s work in ECD and early stimulation and
responsive care programming were integrated into the methods to capture this information.
Key Evaluation Findings
The evaluation objectives and questions addressed three themes that were identified during the scoping of
the evaluation. The key findings for each theme indicate both positive advancements as well as structural
challenges in implementing a multisectoral approach to early childhood development programming.
●
Theme 1: UNICEF’s Global Leadership ………………………………………………………………..
Objective: To assess the internal coherence and effect of UNICEF’s global leadership in early
childhood development.
Evaluation Questions: To what extent is UNICEF positioned and prepared to lead and support
governments in scaling early stimulation and care systems? What impact has UNICEF’s leadership
had on the field of early childhood development, international development agencies, evidence in
early childhood development, and in communicating the importance of early stimulation and care
to governments and development agencies?
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
Institutional Readiness. UNICEF was successful in discharging its role as global leader in ECD when
ROs and COs had sufficient human and financial resources to make it an explicit development priority that
was integrated into its results frameworks.
Internal Coherence. While ECD is prioritised in UNICEF’s current Strategic Plan, there is a lack of internal
coherence on ECD as it relates to multisectoral programming and the engagement of parents.
Effectiveness of UNICEF Leadership. UNICEF’s leadership on ECD was transformative for the
international development community over the evaluation period in raising awareness about and gaining
buy-in for an integrated ECD agenda, especially given the lack of investment by the organization in sufficient
human and financial resources for effective multisectoral programming.
Global Positioning. A lack of evidence on the situation of young children and on the efficacy of UNICEF-
supported programmes places the organization at a disadvantage in maintaining its global leadership and
positioning for ECD.
11
●
Theme 2: System Strengthening ………………………………………………………………………
Objective: To analyse UNICEF’s contributions and effectiveness in strengthening national capacity
and systems to implement and scale early stimulation and responsive care programs and services.
Evaluation Question: To what extent has UNICEF supported governments to strengthen
multisectoral policies and systems for ECD, including national capacity to scale the delivery of early
stimulation and care programs and services?
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
Enabling Environment for ECD. UNICEF makes significant contributions to the development of policies
and national ECD plans, but few country offices focus their support on strengthening systems to scale up
early stimulation and responsive care programmes.
Coordination Mechanisms. Many UNICEF COs make valuable contributions to multisectoral coordination
through their participation and, in some countries, joint leadership of ECD coordination committees.
Public Financing. UNICEF COs lack the capacity and technical knowledge needed to support line
Ministries to mobilise and ensure the equitable allocation of public funds to ECD programmes, and to
evaluate the efficient and effective use of such funds.
National Training Systems. UNICEF COs’ monitoring and evaluation activities mostly focus on measuring
the reach of programmes (e.g., the numbers of children reached), rather than contributing to the
development of systems that can be used to monitor and manage the activities of frontline workers to
ensure programmes are implemented with fidelity.
●
Theme 3: Programme Quality and Impact ….…………………………………………………………
Objective: To assess the relevance and impact of UNICEF’s direct support for vulnerable children,
parents, and frontline workers participating in early stimulation and responsive care programs in
low-resource and emergency settings.
Evaluation Question: What evidence is there that UNICEF direct support for early stimulation
and care programs is making a difference on a significant scale for vulnerable children, parents
and caregivers?
…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
Programme Delivery. UNICEF has focused its efforts primarily on public ECD programmes, working with
governments to deliver parenting and early learning programmes. UNICEF is reaching some of the most
marginalized child populations, but it is difficult to assess the adequacy of programme coverage.
Programme Design. UNICEF supported early stimulation and care programmes have adopted evidence-
based practices, with the exception of encouraging children’s agency and promoting autonomy-supportive
parenting and teaching.
Programme Scaling. Very few of the programmes that UNICEF pilots are designed to be taken to scale
because the focus is on proving effectiveness rather than on developing an understanding of what it takes
to institutionalise the programme in government systems.
Programme Quality of Implementation. There was almost no evidence of efforts to ensure programme
fidelity. Fidelity is the extent to which frontline workers adhere to the protocol for programme delivery.
12
Measuring fidelity is a key feature of implementation research, and is essential for determining the impact
of the programmes on parents and children.
Programme Impact. With few exceptions, monitoring of children’s developmental status has not been
integrated into programming practices with support from frontline workers, programmes have not be
evaluated using controlled designs and relevant measures, and relevant data have not been integrated
into a secure data management system.
Evaluation Conclusions and Recommendations
The main conclusions are summarized in this section, alongside an explanation of the results and
implications for UNICEF programming. Recommendations are based upon the evidence and are derived
directly from the conclusions, which are mapped according to each thematic objective.
Theme 1: UNICEF Global Leadership
Main Conclusion. UNICEF has had a substantial global impact on raising awareness about the importance
of investing in early childhood; however, it is only somewhat prepared to lead governments in strengthening
systems to deliver and scale early stimulation and responsive care programmes.
Explanation of Results. UNICEF is in the early stages of translating an integrated ECD agenda into
practice. UNICEF’s work on early stimulation and responsive care has not been sufficiently defined,
codified, or integrated into the current Strategic Plan and results framework in a manner that supports
effective multisectoral programming, especially as it applies to the role of parents in accelerating results for
children. Institutional investments in human and financial resources and in the management and
coordination structures that are necessary for effective multisectoral programming have not kept pace with
the awareness and demand for ECD that has been generated.
Implications. These deficiencies place UNICEF at a disadvantage in maintaining the momentum that has
been built externally with governments and with community members to scale integrated early stimulation
and responsive care programming. If left unaddressed, UNICEF risks losing its comparative advantage as
a global leader for ECD and in achieving results for young children.
Recommendation 1. UNICEF should update its conceptualisation of multisectoral ECD programming to
include an explicit articulation of parents’ role in accelerating results for children in the early years by clearly
articulating shared results and accountabilities among sectors.
Recommendation 2. UNICEF should clarify its budget and allocation for ECD programming and further
mobilise additional resources for ECD programming (for 0 – 8 years olds, across all sector) at all levels of
the organisation and ensure that the budget for ECD programming is transparent and inclusive of all
organisational investments.
Theme 2: System Strengthening
Main Conclusion. UNICEF COs have made a significant contribution in supporting governments to
strengthen sectoral and multisector ECD policies, but have made a far smaller contribution to strengthening
national capacity to scale the delivery of early stimulation and responsive care programmes and services.
Supporting government to institutionalise programmes is essential to the scaling up of programmes, which
was not frequently observed,
13
Explanation of Results. UNICEF COs do not have the required capacity to work on the issues and systems
required to assist governments to put policy into practice. Approaches to the scaling of programmes vary,
from demonstrating a package of services and their effectiveness to working closely with government to
support scaling of programmes to institutionalising new practices and/or programmes.
Implications. These deficiencies place UNICEF at a disadvantage in supporting governments to scale
high-quality and sustainable early stimulation and responsive care programmes and services, and slow
progress on achieving results for young children.
Recommendation 3. UNICEF should develop in-house capacity of ECD staff/team in public finance for
children at all levels of the organisation.
Recommendation 4. UNICEF ECD vision, including programme design and implementation processes
should be aligned with the period covered by the strategic plan with focus on scaling-up and supporting the
government to institutionalise, fund, monitor, and assure the fidelity of implementation of ECD interventions
and practices.
Theme 3: Programme Quality and Impact
Main Conclusion. UNICEF has not supported adequately designed evaluations of programme efficacy
and impact, and as a result, there is no compelling evidence that UNICEF’s direct support for early
stimulation and responsive care programmes is making a difference for vulnerable children, parents, and
frontline workers.
Explanation Of Results. UNICEF does not have the necessary measures, tools, and capacities to
strengthen government monitoring and evaluation of parenting outcomes and child impacts. While MICS
provides population level data to monitor the SDG on children’s developmental status, it should not be used
to evaluate the impact of UNICEF programming in early stimulation and responsive care.
Implications. The lack of adequate measures and controlled programme evaluations is a major limitation
to the progressive improvement and scaling of these programmes, and it misses an opportunity to make a
more compelling argument for the funding and implementation of the programmes globally.
Recommendation 5. UNICEF should increase investment in the development, adaptation, and/or norming
and validation of tools for measurement of children’s physical, cognitive, or social-emotional development.
Recommendation 6. UNICEF should update evaluation strategies and methods to include innovative,
more rigorous, and contextually relevant evaluation designs that can provide robust evidence base and
reliable assessments of efficacy and impact of ECD programmes on parenting, early stimulation and
responsive care..

EVALUATION TERMS AND CONCEPTS
Adequate Nutrition (From the Nurturing Care Framework) - The mother’s nutrition during pregnancy affects her
health and well-being, as well as the developing child’s nutrition and growth. When pregnant
women do not have enough micronutrients, they need supplements, including iron. Young
children flourish on exclusive breastfeeding – from immediately after birth to the age of 6
months – together with skin-to-skin body contact. From the age of 6 months, young children
need complementary foods that are frequent and diverse enough, and which contain the
micronutrients they need for the rapid growth of their body and brain.
Advocacy and Evidence of UNICEF-supported efforts to win support for the cause of children from decision-
Communication makers and the wider public, through advocacy, public engagement and communication
(such as through the Early Moments Matter campaign and End Violence Against Children
Campaign). May also refer to UNICEF supported convenings and/or key events to advance
ECD and early stimulation and responsive care.
Behaviour Change UNICEF supported engagement with communities to promote behaviour change, increase
and Community demand for quality services and support social norms that contribute to the realization of child
Engagement rights, directly and through policy and systems strengthening, including adaptations for
humanitarian response.
Budget Allocations Amounts of money that are allocated to a specific budget programme or budget line, but not
necessarily spent.
Caregiver The secondary caretaker of a minor child when parent is unavailable (such as older siblings
and grandparents) (contrast with Frontline Workers). In some countries, this term includes
parents or is used as a general term to encompass parents, relatives and frontline workers.
Children's Changes (with age and experience) in children’s learning, thinking, and problem-solving skills.
Cognitive Children’s cognitive developmental status refers to the developmental level of these brain-
Development based skills in relation to evidence-based expectations regarding the age at which specific
skills and competencies are typically observed. These expectations vary across cultures and
environments.
Children’s Health Changes (with age and experience) in children’s bodies, motor function, and physical health.
and Physical Nutrition, exercise, and other aspects of children’s development (such as their social and
Development emotional development) contribute to their healthy physical development.
Children’s Social Changes (with age and experience) in how children understand themselves and other people,
and Emotional how children manage their emotional reactions, and how children interact with others.
Development Experience contributes to children’s brain growth and changes the way children process and
manage information about themselves and others, as well as their attitudes and beliefs about
themselves and others.
Cross-Sectoral and UNICEF efforts to foster cross-sectoral and multi-sectoral programming (or the integration of
Multi-Sectoral more than one component of the Nurturing Care Framework) that responds holistically to
Programming children’s needs and to the environments in which they grow up.
15
Early Childhood Period of development from ‘conception to birth’ and from ‘birth to 3 years’, with emphasis on
Development the first 1,000 days (from conception to 24 months), followed by the ‘preschool and pre-
primary years (3 years to 5 or 6 years, or the age of school entry) and ‘lower primary school
years’ (6 to 8 years of age). Development is an outcome resulting from the interaction between
the environment and the child. It is the continuous process of acquiring skills and abilities
during this age period – across the domains of cognition, language, motor, social and
emotional development – which helps us to think, solve problems, communicate, express our
emotions and form relationships.
Early Learning Interventions or services aimed at providing children with early stimulation to promote
Programmes children’s Cognitive and Social and Emotional Development and school readiness
Early Stimulation Parent or caregiver engagement of young children’s senses through talking, reading, singing
and playing to “stimulate” neurological connections and healthy brain development.
Evidence UNICEF supported data analysis, research, studies, and evaluations on ECD and early
Generation stimulation and responsive care.
Frontline Workers Any adult or youth who works directly with children in ECD programs, serving in the role of
facilitator, caregiver, or teacher.
Good Health (From the Nurturing Care Framework) - Young children’s good health is the result of
caregivers monitoring of children’s physical and emotional condition; giving affectionate and
appropriate responses to children’s daily needs; protecting young children from household
and environmental dangers; having hygiene practices which minimise infections; using
promotive and preventive health services; and seeking care and appropriate treatment for
children’s illnesses.
Implementing Refers to UNICEF’s Strategic Plan “change strategies”, or how UNICEF intends to change
Strategies (specific the situation for children, or UNICEF’s locus of control in the applicable theory of change
to UNICEF) scenarios.
Life Course An approach to programming that acknowledges the connections between stages of
development, from infancy into adulthood. UNICEF has adopted a life course perspective in
thinking about the continuum of early childhood development services that are required from
infancy through adolescence.
Norms and Quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the contents and standard of a programme which
Standards are usually issued in regulations related to a specific act of law.
Nurturing Care Refers to conditions created by public policies, programmes, and services that enable
communities and caregivers to ensure children’s good health and nutrition and protect them
from threats. Nurturing care also means giving young children opportunities for early learning,
through interactions that are responsive and emotionally supportive.
Opportunities for (From the Nurturing Care Framework) - Children do not start to learn only when they begin
Early Learning kindergarten or pre-primary classes at the age of 3 or 4, and are taught colours, shapes, and
letters. Rather, learning is a built-in mechanism for human beings, ensuring our successful
adaptation to changing circumstances. It begins at conception, initially as a biological
mechanism called epigenesis. In the earliest years, we acquire skills and capacities
interpersonally, in relationship with other people, through smiling and eye contact, talking and
16
singing, modelling, imitation, and simple games, like “wave bye-bye”. Playing with common
household items – like tin cups, empty containers, and cooking pots – can help a child learn
about objects’ feel and quality, and what can be done with them. Even a busy caregiver can
be given the motivation and confidence to talk with a child during feeding, bathing, and other
routine household tasks. These interactions help the child learn about other people and learn
about how to think in order to solve problems. Children need affectionate and secure
caregiving from adults in a family environment, with guidance in daily activities and
relationships with others. This gives young children their important early experiences of social
learning and provides them with a sense of security that allows them to explore their
environment and learn.
Parent The terms "parent" and "parenting" are not limited to biological parents but extend to any
guardian or caregiver providing consistent care to the child.
Parenting Interactions, behaviours, emotions, knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and practices associated
with the provision of nurturing care. There are five domains of parenting: 1) caregiving
(health, hygiene and nutrition related practices), 2) stimulation (interactions, learning
activities, modelling), 3) support and responsiveness (trust, attachment, sense of security), 4)
structure (routine, discipline, supervision, protection from harm) and 5) socialization
(conveying values, habits, and attitudes of society). Taken together, these parenting domains
promote nurturing care.
Parenting Interventions or services aimed at supporting parenting interactions, behaviours, knowledge,
Programme beliefs, attitudes, and practices.

Mobilization
Policy Engagement The process of engaging in policy analysis, design/labs, implementation, monitoring,
evaluation, and foresight to catalyse change.
Policy Estimating the resources required to implement a policy in accordance with agreed (explicit
Implementation or implied) norms and standards.
Costing
Responsive (From the Nurturing Care Framework) - Bidirectional interactions between a parent and child,
Care/Caregiving or caregiver and child that are nurturing and “responsive” to the child’s need for bonding,
attachment and sense of security (sometimes referred to as “serve and return” interactions).
Responsive caregiving includes observing and responding to children’s movements, sounds
and gestures and verbal requests. It is the basis for: protecting children against injury and the
negative effects of adversity; recognizing and responding to illness; enriched learning; and
building trust and social relationships.
Security and Safety (From the Nurturing Care Framework) - Young children cannot protect themselves and are
vulnerable to unanticipated danger, physical pain, and emotional stress. Extreme poverty and
low income pose serious risks that have to be mitigated by social assistance such as cash
transfers. Pregnant women and young children are also most vulnerable to environmental
risks, including air pollution and exposure to chemicals. Young children, once they are mobile,
can touch and swallow objects that can harm them, and an unclean or unsafe environment is
full of potential threats. Young children can experience extreme fear when people abandon
them – or threaten to abandon or punish them. Across the world, toddlers are the group most
17
often harshly punished, by being beaten painfully with sticks, belts, and other objects. These
experiences cause uncontrollable fear and stress that can perturb the young child’s response
systems in ways that can lead to emotional, mental, and social maladjustment. Children can
withdraw socially, learn to mistrust adults, or act out their fear in aggression towards other
children. Ensuring frontline workers’ and parents’ mental health, working with them to prevent
maltreatment, is needed. Nurturing care includes making sure that defenseless young
children feel safe and secure.
Systems Building the institutional systems, processes and procedures required to plan, finance,
Strengthening coordinate, implement, manage and monitor programmes. Systems strengthening includes
putting in place organisational structures, delegations and reporting lines, hiring, training and

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION AND
EVALUATION BACKGROUND
This evaluation aims to draw lessons from policy, advocacy, and
programming strategies and interventions to inform good practices and
appropriate course corrections in UNICEF’s work in ECD.
1.1 Evaluation purpose and scope
1. This global evaluation provides the first comprehensive assessment of UNICEF work in Early Childhood
Development (ECD), and early stimulation and responsive care, in particular, after advances in
neuroscience research underscored the importance of this period of childhood development and placed it
on the global development agenda. While UNICEF has worked to promote the rights of children since its
inception, it has done so through sector-specific strategies and interventions. By contrast, the neuroscience
research emphasised the importance of integrated and holistic strategies and interventions for this period
of development. As the global steward of children’s rights, UNICEF has assumed a leadership role in
translating the knowledge gained from the neuroscience research into practice.
2. UNICEF emphasised the new approach to ECD in its previous Strategic Plan (2014-2017), and in particular,
articulated the rationale for why ECD matters for children. During the current Strategic Plan (2018-2021),
the organization has focused on supporting governments to implement and scale up high-quality, holistic
early childhood development interventions. This shift in approach to ECD has contributed to changes in
UNICEF staff policies (such as evidenced by the adoption of extended paid maternity and paternity leave),
and externally with international development partners (such as the World Bank, which recognised
investment in ECD as significant for a nation’s economic and social development). Thus, a global formative
evaluation of UNICEF’s leadership and programming in early childhood development is timely and
warranted to assess the organization’s progress in advancing the holistic ECD agenda, and to evaluate its
contributions in realizing the rights of the most vulnerable children and families living in low-resource and
humanitarian contexts.
3. Evaluation Purpose. This is a formative evaluation whose main purpose is to draw lessons from policy,
advocacy, and programming strategies and interventions to inform good practices and appropriate course
corrections in UNICEF’s work in ECD. The secondary purpose of the evaluation is to provide evidence for
accountability and oversight within UNICEF and relevant cooperating partners, and to provide concrete
recommendations for strengthening UNICEF’s work in ECD.
4. Evaluation Objectives. The objectives of the evaluation were associated with three themes: 1) UNICEF’s
Global Leadership - to assess the internal coherence and impact of UNICEF’s global leadership in early
childhood development; 2) System Strengthening – to analyse UNICEF’s contributions and effectiveness
in strengthening national capacity and systems to implement and scale early stimulation and responsive
care programs and services; and 3) Program Quality and Impact – to assess the relevance and impact of
UNICEF’s direct support for vulnerable children, parents, and frontline workers participating in early
stimulation and responsive care programs in low-resource and emergency settings.
19
5. Scope of the Evaluation. This evaluation examines UNICEF’s global leadership in the broader field of
practice to promote ECD, as well as the organization’s support to national governments in ensuring parents
and adult caregivers provide appropriate early stimulation and responsive care to young children as a basis
for their healthy development, school readiness and on-time enrolment into pre-primary and primary school.
The evaluation focused on the early years of life - from birth to age of entry into primary school (usually 0-
5, noting that the age of school entry varies by country context). The evaluation assessed all goal areas,
but there was more evidence on UNICEF’s leadership, support and contributions to strengthening health
(Goal 1), education (Goal 2), and child protection (Goal 3) systems for early stimulation and responsive
care programmes and services on a global, regional, and country level. UNICEF’s contributions in preparing
frontline workers, and parent and child impacts were assessed on a country level through selected
programs representing both development and humanitarian contexts. The evaluation was both
retrospective and prospective (forward looking), examining the period from 2014 through 2021
(encompassing two Strategic Planning periods). It included countries in all contexts and situations where
UNICEF was or is implementing strategies to strengthen ECD systems and services, including
development, humanitarian, and peacebuilding programming in early stimulation and responsive care.
6. Audience. The internal users of the evaluation include UNICEF’s Senior Management at global, regional,
and country levels, as well as UNICEF Programme Managers and Specialists working on early childhood
development programming. External UNICEF partners (such as national governments, NGOs and
academia) will also benefit from the results of the evaluation to inform their policies and programmes for
young children and families. Additionally, UNICEF is uniquely positioned to make major contributions to the
scientific understanding of human development globally, which is important because most of what is known
is based on very limited samples that do not adequately reflect the global majority.1 2
7. Structure of the Report. This report consists of four parts: 1) an introduction to the evaluation and global
context; 2) the evaluation design and methods; 3) the evaluation findings; and 4) conclusions and
recommendations for strengthening UNICEF’s leadership and impact for young children and their
caregivers. We advise the readers of this report to consult the definitions of evaluation terms and concepts
to ensure comprehension of the evaluation in a global context where these terms may not be clearly defined.
1.2 Global context on the situation of young children
8. Globally, approximately 250 million young children (about 43% of the global child population under five) in
low-income and middle-income countries are failing to reach their full developmental potential.3 Children
suffer suboptimal development due to extreme poverty and stunting, physical maltreatment and low levels
of maternal schooling. These deficits limit children’s abilities to benefit from education, which has long-term
implications for their well-being and livelihood and for reaching the Sustainable Development Goals.
9. Available data from UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys on the situation of children age
36-59 months indicates that only 16 out of 48 countries had an Early Childhood Development Index of 80%
or more between 2014-2018 (see Figure 1). This target was set by the organization to describe the desired
percentage of children who are developmentally on track in literacy-numeracy, physical, learning, and
social-emotional skills. Countries with the highest percentage of children who were developmentally on

track are located in East Asia and the Pacific (EAP), Eastern and Central Asia (ECA), and Latin America
and the Caribbean (LAC). These regions include countries that are middle-income or high-income in status,
as well as those that have historically invested in early learning and violence prevention for young children.

10. Fragile states and countries experiencing humanitarian situations such as in Chad, Burundi and Timor-
Leste had fewer than 50% of children who were developmentally on track (see Figure 1). Eastern and
Southern Africa (ESA) and Western and Central Africa (WCA) lag behind other regions due to high
concentrations of multidimensional poverty, fragile economies and high levels of poverty, and a lack of
access to routine and essential services for young children and mothers. Data is not disaggregated by sex,
location or disability; thus, it is not currently possible to anlayse trends in children’s developmental status
from an equity perspective.
11. Available data from UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys on the situation of children age
36-59 months indicates that only 12 of the 31 countries had 74% or more of children receiving early
stimulation and responsive care from parents between 2014-2018 (see Figure 2). These countries are
located in East Asia and the Pacific (EAP), Eastern and Central Asia (ECA), Latin America and the
Caribbean (LAC), and in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Ten countries had fewer than 50 percent
of children receiving early stimulation and responsive caregiving and may not meet the target set for 2021.
These countries are concentrated in Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) and in Western and Central Africa
(WCA).
12. Mothers are disproportionately more likely to provide early stimulation and responsive care when compared
to fathers (see Figure 3). For example, in East Asia and the Pacific (EAP), the difference in the proportion
of mothers versus fathers providing support for learning is up to 30 percentage points in Vietnam. In Eastern
and Central Asia (ECA), this difference is as high as 66 percentage points in Turkmenistan. In Latin America
and the Caribbean (LAC), the difference in proportions are has high as 58 percentage points in Cuba. Thus,
there is a great need for gender responsive ECD programmes, services and interventions that aim to
improve the capacity of parents to provide the necessary care for their young children to survive and thrive,
especially fathers.

13. A correlation analyses of the available MICS data indicated that early stimulation and responsive care is
positively associated with children’s developmental status (ECDI) (see Figure 4). In particular the availability
of children’s books (r=0.88)6 and support for learning were strongly associated with children’s
developmental status, with mothers’ support for learning being the most strongly linked (0.84). Support for
learning encompasses telling stories, singing songs, taking outside, playing, naming/counting or drawing
things. Attendance in an early childhood education programme is also correlated with children’s
developmental status (r=0.61). Furthermore, inadequate care was negatively associated (r=-0.82) with the
developmental status of children in the literacy-numeracy, social-emotional, physical, and learning
domains. These findings underscore the importance of early stimulation and care activities and the
critical role of parents as accelerators for the development of young children.

14. Several global trends have contributed to the poor developmental status of young children around the world.
Climate change and natural disasters and the movement of children due to situations of conflict means that
more children will grow up in humanitarian situations. For example, approximately 28 million babies were
born into conflict in 2018,7 which has implications for their ability to survive and thrive, in promoting social
cohesion and peacebuilding, and in reducing intergenerational poverty. UNICEF estimates that 535 million
children live in countries affected by conflict or natural disasters associated with climate change, 73 percent
of whom are from sub-Saharan Africa.8 Growing up in countries affected by emergencies means children
often lack health care, education, proper nutrition and protection. Children from birth to age eight are the
most affected by global emergencies; children under five living in fragile contexts have the highest illness
and death rates of any age group, twenty times higher than standard levels.9
15. The global COVID-19 pandemic has made it challenging for all children to reach their full developmental
potential. For example, young children were not able to attend preschool during lockdowns, and parents
had to assume the responsibility for educating their young children during the pandemic. In other countries
there was an increased need for safe and affordable child care to ensure parents could continue to work.
For all these reasons, UNICEF has a critical role to play in ensuring the needs of young children and their

that it is a secondary analysis over means, and that the outcomes are intercorrelated.

parents are addressed, especially among the most vulnerable populations such as children with disabilities,
children living in humanitarian situations, and children from marginalized ethnic and cultural groups. In
particular, UNICEF has led international advocacy efforts to increase support for parents who are forced to
raise their infants in conflicted-affected areas.
1.3 Advances in early childhood development research and practice
16. There were two key advancements in research in recent years that changed the way UNICEF and other
international development agencies viewed ECD. One stream of research was associated with advances
in the neurosciences showing the importance of experience in healthy brain development, and the
importance of this development for realizing children’s full developmental potential across the life course.
The other stream of research was associated with a social return on investment analysis that
demonstrated substantial gains in economic growth and prosperity for every dollar invested in early
childhood programmes and services.
17. Recent research in the neurosciences has documented the importance and significance of early stimulation
and responsive care, or the role that parents and other adult caregivers play in promoting children’s healthy
brain development through nurturing care practices such as talking, singing, and playing. The period from
pregnancy to age 5 years is critical for a child’s cognitive, social, emotional, sensory, and motor
development. During these early childhood years, the highly elastic nature of the developing brain
contributes to its enormous potential, and its vulnerability. Neuronal connections are formed at a rate
unrepeated later in life, and when used, these connections are strengthened. At the same time, connections
that are utilised infrequently are selectively eliminated as a function of experience.10 Foundational
neurocognitive skills, such as language and executive function skills are acquired during early childhood,
and these skills are necessary for later success in school and for social adaptation.11 12 Without these
foundational skills, children are at considerable risk of not reaching their full developmental potential.
Recent estimates indicate that more than 43% of children in low- and middle-income countries are at risk
for poor development.13
18. For optimal development, the brain requires a wide variety of experiences and environmental input.14
Indeed, experience drives the development of cortical networks, which grow through use in the context of
support from caregivers. 15 16 When activated, relevant cortical networks adapt, becoming more efficient
and more likely to be used in the future. Thus, empowering parents and other adult caregivers with the skills
to practice early stimulation and responsive care are foundational practices that any ECD intervention
should focus upon to support children’s healthy brain growth and holistic (whole child) development. In early
childhood it is primarily the parent who regulates the child’s exposure to learning opportunities, calibrating

challenges to the child’s developmental level (so that the child can learn by doing), providing rich stimulation
by talking and singing to the child, playing with the child, and otherwise structuring the child’s environment.17
19. It is crucial to provide parents and other adult caregivers (e.g., teachers) with knowledge and skills on the
‘what’, the ‘when’, and the ‘how’ of providing early stimulation and responsive care. The ‘what’ comprises a
wide variety of environmental input that is needed to foster development in different domains. Rich sensory,
motoric, linguistic, cognitive, and social-emotional stimulation must be provided. This includes talking and
singing, which provides linguistic stimulation to foster language development, physical contact to foster
motor development, and playing that provides social-emotional experiences. Providing objects to
manipulate, along with linguistic stimulation and social play, fosters the development of key cognitive
functions, such as executive function and self-regulation skills (e.g., mental processes that enable us to
plan, focus attention, remember instructions, and juggle multiple tasks successfully), as well as knowledge
about the world (e.g., understanding the relation between cause and effect).
20. As to the ‘how’ to interact with the child – it is crucial for optimal development that the interactions between
the parent/caregiver and the child are bidirectional and contingent upon the child’s behaviour. It is for
example important that the caregiver not only feeds or sings to a child in certain intervals, but also that the
caregiver does this in response to the child’s behaviour (e.g., crying). Infants are born with a behavioural
repertoire designed to ensure caregiver protection and proximity.18 Children develop a secure attachment
when the caregiving is sensitive, responsive, and predictable.19 20 21 22 In the language domain it appears
that exposure to environmental input must occur in the context of social interaction to generate learning.23
24 Early in life most forms of learning occur in the context of responsive caregiving, which allows the child
to form a secure attachment to the caregiver and lasting representations of the environment, and which in
turn facilitate the development of reasoning and problem-solving.25 Of particular importance is autonomy-
supportive parenting and teaching, which is associated with healthy child development across a wide range
of cultural contexts, from more individualistic to more interdependent.26 27 28 Autonomy support refers to a
set of behaviours that help children develop a sense of agency, and consequently, a willingness to accept
challenges and solve problems: (1) providing children with the appropriate amount of help for their skill level

(i.e., scaffolding, providing “just enough” support); (2) encouraging and appropriately praising children; (3)
taking children's perspectives; and (4) providing children with choices and following their lead.29 30
21. The absence of a responsive parent, or the lack of parent capacity, can lead to inadequate learning and
neural stimulation in early childhood, and can prevent children from reaching their social, emotional, and
physical developmental potential.31 It is often difficult for families to provide responsive stimulating care for
their young children when they are in extreme poverty or struggling for survival – amid natural disaster,
displacement, war, or conflict. 32 This is compounded by factors including young parenthood, disability,
family violence, discrimination, substance abuse, poor physical health and mental health issues. Threats
to ECD tend to cluster together, often in conjunction with lack of access to information, services, and social
exclusion. This adversity amid lack of support can undermine families’ capacities to provide responsive
caregiving and stimulation for their young children.
22. While the characteristics of ECD described above appear to be universal, there are variations in what is
considered typical child development across cultures and environments. Expectations and parenting
strategies may differ not only across countries, but also across cultural, ethnic, or religious groups within
the same country. ECD awareness-raising and parenting programs need to aim at establishing caregiving
practices that are in accordance with a holistic understanding of development, set realistic expectations,
and fit in the cultural context of the child. Similarly, environmental inputs, including parents’ provision of
early stimulation and responsive care, depend upon a range of factors such as poverty, parental level of
education, and access to ECD programs and services, especially in low resource or humanitarian settings.
23. In terms of social return on investment studies, there is persuasive evidence that interventions early in
life can be effective in promoting ECD.33 Research indicates that investing in ECD is one of the most cost-
effective ways to increase skills, capabilities and productivity. For example, a 2016 study in the US of two
high-quality childcare programs showed that the rate of return on investment was 13.7% per annum.
Though the upfront costs for high quality childcare per child were high, the benefit/cost ratio was US$7.30
on the dollar.34 Others have reported higher returns. Significant results for children have also been shown
for programs in low- and middle-income countries. In a comparative longitudinal study in Jamaica in 1986-
1987, growth-stunted children ages 9-24 months were provided with cognitive, language, and psychosocial
stimulation through weekly one-hour play sessions at home. After 20 years it was found that the earnings
of the stimulation group were 25% higher than those of the control group and caught up to the earnings of
a non-stunted comparison group. These and other findings show that a psychosocial stimulation
intervention in early childhood for disadvantaged children can have a substantial effect on labour market
outcomes and can compensate for poverty-related developmental delays.35 In particular, the integration of

programs on early stimulation and responsive care.36
1.4 UNICEF’s approach to early stimulation and responsive care programming
24. In this section, we provide a brief history of the evolution of UNICEF’s approach to early childhood
development and the specific aspects of its programming that are related to early stimulation and
responsive care through a retroactive theory of change (see Figure 5). This theory of change reflects a
combination of our evaluation results, as well as aspirational planning that is currently underway at UNICEF
Headquarters (HQ) in New York to define an organization-wide parenting framework. The simplified logic
for UNICEF’s theory of change for ECD is provided in Box 1.
Box 1: Simplified Logic of UNICEF’s Approach to ECD
● If investments are made in high-quality multisectoral ECD service packages that address children’s
holistic development; and
● If these multisectoral ECD service packages are implemented effectively and with fidelity;
● Then parents and caregivers will practice early stimulation and responsive care; and as a result…
● Children will be more likely to be ready for school and will reach their full developmental potential.
● An enabling environment (such as ECD policies, public financing, cross-sectoral coordination, and
a skilled frontline ECD workforce) is required to implement high quality and integrated early
stimulation and responsive care programmes with fidelity, including strategic investments in the
scaling of parenting programmes that have demonstrated impact in accelerating results for young
children.
25. UNICEF first articulated early stimulation and responsive care as an essential component of ECD in the
former Strategic Plan (2014-2017) within a nutrition outcome for parents and children under age 3 years.
However, guidance on how to translate these concepts into UNICEF supported programming - across
multiple sectors and for children ages eight years and under - is a relatively new phenomenon for the
organization and was only first mentioned in 2017 in the publication: UNICEF’s Global Programme
Guidance on Early Childhood Development. In the new Strategic Plan (2018-2021), reference to early
stimulation and responsive care was embedded in health results (Goal 1, all children survive), along with a
range of change strategies to guide UNICEF’s work in this area. The Global Programme Guidance for ECD
also provided an ECD Framework for Action with national governments that outlined various
multigenerational and multisectoral programming strategies to improve early stimulation and responsive
care among frontline workers, parents, and other caregivers. This framework also recognised that ECD
was the synergistic impact of these efforts and endorsed the ambitious goal that all children ages 8 and
under would achieve their full developmental potential.

26. During the period covered by this evaluation, UNICEF’s approach to ECD became more grounded in the
neuroscience research, as summarised in The Lancet series on Advancing Early Childhood Development:
From Science to Scale (2017). This publication was co-authored by UNICEF and was a pivotal publication
that reflected a paradigm shift in how ECD is defined, valued, and implemented by policy makers and
practitioners on a global and local level. 37 38 39 In particular, the Nurturing Care Framework introduced
in this series postulated that ECD is a synergistic outcome of five interrelated components: 1) good health;
2) adequate nutrition; 3) opportunities for early learning; 4) security and safety; and 5) responsive
caregiving. UNICEF was a key partner with the World Health Organization (WHO) in developing the
Nurturing Care Framework, which was launched at the World Health Assembly in May 2018.
27. UNICEF has been engaged with programming in all areas of the Nurturing Care Framework since 2014
(see Figure 6). A majority of UNICEF COs reported programming efforts for good health (including universal
health care, maternal and newborn health and vaccinations; for adequate nutrition (including Scaling Up
Nutrition interventions, micronutrients and supplements, and the promotion of breastfeeding); for safety and
security (including WASH and community-led total sanitation, birth registration, violence prevention
programmes and social assistance such as cash transfers); for responsive caregiving (including parenting
programmes); and for opportunities for early learning (including early learning programmes and preschool).

28. Given its history in providing ECD programming during the former Strategic Plan 2014-2017 period,
UNICEF led international development efforts to reach a consensus that investing in ECD should be a
priority for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. For example, one of the key developments was
that explicit reference was made to ECD in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Number 4, Target 2, “[to]
ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality ECD care as well as pre-primary education so that
they are ready for primary education.” There are two performance benchmarks for SDG 4, Target 2.
Indicator 4.2.1 measures the “proportion of children under 5 years of age who are developmentally on track
in health, learning and psychosocial well-being, by sex.” Indicator 4.2.2 measures the “participation rate in
organised learning (one year before the official primary entry age).” UNICEF is the custodian agency for
indicator 4.2.1; whereas UNESCO is the custodian agency for 4.2.2.
29. UNICEF subsequently integrated this SDG target (among others) into 3 of its 5 current Strategic Plan 2018-
2021 goals. Goal Area 1 aims to ensure that “every child survives and thrives.” Planned results for 2021
include that 80 countries have adopted, at scale, ECD packages promoting early stimulation and responsive
care. Goal Area 2 aims to ensure that “every child learns.” Planned results for 2021 include that 60 million
out-of-school children are gaining access to early learning, primary, or secondary education (up from 10
million in 2017), and that 93 million girls and boys are provided with individual education or early learning
materials (up from 15.7 million in 2017). Goal Area 3 aims to ensure that “every child is protected from
violence and exploitation.” Planned results for 2021 include that 966,000 mothers, fathers, and caregivers
will be reached through parenting programs (up from 600,000 in 2017). No parenting goals were identified,
but the ECD Section at UNICEF HQ considers these important for the next Strategic Plan, to fully cement
early stimulation and responsive caregiving into all goal areas.
30. Recognizing that nature and nurture interact fundamentally to stimulate the cognitive, social, and emotional
development of young children,40 UNICEF programming strategies are in the process of shifting from siloed
approaches to multisectoral ECD packages, encompassing health, nutrition, HIV, WASH, education, child
protection, and social protection. Strongly linked to the provision of primary health care (PHC), this
approach embeds ECD interventions in a wider system that addresses common social determinants of
child development and well-being across these sectors. Program strategies are based upon theories of
child development and a life-course perspective, emphasizing that the skills acquired throughout childhood,
adolescence, and adulthood build on the capacities established prenatally and early in life.41
31. Other changes in UNICEF programming in the broader ECD landscape and in early stimulation and
responsive care programming that occurred between the former and current UNICEF Global Strategic
Plans are summarised in Figure 7. These include a shift from child-centred programming to
multigenerational programming (or a dual-generation approach), including focus on the needs and
capacities of parents alongside that of children. There has also been an explicit effort to focus less on
service delivery for young children, and more on the enabling environment (such as policies sector plans,
budgets and a qualified workforce) that are required to provide high quality and holistic early childhood
programmes and services. These trends are explored in greater detail throughout the evaluation report and
provide an important context for reviewing the evaluation results. .

1.5 UNICEF-supported early stimulation and responsive care interventions
32. For the purpose of this evaluation, we understand “support for early stimulation and responsive care
programming” to be comprised of strategies or actions taken by UNICEF to support governments in
31
ensuring parents and frontline workers have the necessary knowledge and skills to practice
nurturing care with children ages 5 and under (see Figure 8).42
33. Upstream, this definition translates into UNICEF’s efforts to build the awareness and capacity of
governments in understanding the importance of ECD, and providing governments with support for policy-
making to strengthen national systems for ECD programmes and services. This includes sectoral and
multisectoral efforts to build sustainable systems for scaling the of delivery of quality programming in high,
middle, and low-income countries, as well as in fragile and humanitarian contexts.

34. Downstream, this definition translates into UNICEF’s support for early childhood education and early
learning programmes that incorporate play-based teaching and learning; integrated early childhood
development parenting programmes; community-based communications for development interventions
with parents of infants and toddlers; the promotion of good hygiene practices in the early years (such as
through essential WASH services and their integration with nutrition programmes); the promotion of social
cohesion in fragile and peacebuilding contexts through ECD programming (such as the use of mother
tongue language in preschool); and ensuring social protection mechanisms for families (such as cash
transfers/child grants).
35. Figure 9 provides recent data on the interventions UNICEF was supporting for ECD programming for
children ages 0-5 in 2019 for Goal Area 1. Out of the 54 Country Offices with data, a majority were focusing
on upstream interventions, such as: ECD policy and system strengthening; ECD data, evidence and
knowledge generation and dissemination; capacity development of ECD frontline workers, and technical
assistance for ECD. Downstream interventions focused upon community-based child care, parenting
programmes to promote nurturing care; and social and behaviour change communication. Partnerships and

the focus of this evaluation was from birth up until the child’s entry into primary school, which generally means the 0-5

36. Figure 10 provides recent data on the ECD interventions UNICEF was supporting for early learning
programmes for children ages 0-5 in 2019 for Goal Area 2. Out of the 54 Country Offices with data, a
majority were focusing on upstream interventions, such as: system strengthening in early learning and pre-
primary education policy, leadership and budget; early learning and pre-primary standards and governance;
and early learning and pre-primary teaching and learning environment. Downstream interventions focused
upon the provision of early learning and pre-primary education and teacher training. The procurement of
early learning materials and the provision of parenting education were reported by fewer COs in 2019.
37. Recent data on the ECD interventions UNICEF was supporting for children ages 0-5 in 2019 for Goal Areas
3 and 5 was minimal. Out of the 54 Country Offices with data, only three COs reported working on
parent/caregiver education and programmes on violence, exploitation and abuse (goal 3). Only six out of
54 COs reported supporting social protection programmes focused on child care and ECD in 2019 (goal
5). Thus, a majority of UNICEF’s recent work on early stimulation and responsive care programming was
taking place in Goal Areas 1 and 2, or primarily in the health and education sector. However, we found
evidence of interventions across all UNICEF goal areas during the period covering this evaluation, including
for WASH (goal 4) when it was integrated into ECD programming focused on health and nutrition.

CHAPTER 2: EVALUATION DESIGN AND
METHODS
3.1 Evaluation Approach
38. This evaluation was formative in its design and examined three interrelated themes to assess UNICEF
global leadership and results for young children and their families since 2014 (see Annex A, Detailed
Evaluation Framework). These themes were based upon an initial review of UNICEF’s work in ECD and
included: (1) UNICEF’s Global Leadership - to assess the internal coherence and effect of UNICEF’s
global leadership in early childhood development; 2) System Strengthening – to analyse UNICEF’s
contributions and effectiveness in strengthening national capacity and systems to implement and scale
early stimulation and responsive care programs and services; and 3) Program Quality and Impact – to
assess the relevance and impact of UNICEF’s direct support for vulnerable children, parents, and frontline
workers participating in early stimulation and responsive care programs in low-resource and emergency
settings.
39. Each theme includes core evaluation questions and sub-questions that were guided by the results of
the portfolio review and through consultations with the UNICEF ECD Section in Programme Division and
the UNICEF Evaluation Office. Evaluation criteria assessed the internal and external coherence of
UNICEF’s work in early stimulation and responsive care, the effectiveness of UNICEF’s efforts to
strengthen national systems for ECD, and the relevance and impact of UNICEF’s leadership and direct
support for parents and young children. Summative evaluation criteria were also identified to provide
qualitative ratings on the scope and strength of the evidence.
40. The evaluation adopted an inductive and retroactive theory-based design primarily because the object
of the evaluation (early stimulation and responsive care) was not well defined or codified in the
organization’s theory of change and results matrices. Inductive and theory-based evaluations rely upon
research-based analytical frameworks to guide the selection of appropriate evaluation methods as
relevant for the evaluation questions. Each theme drew upon different analytical frameworks to answer the
evaluation questions. Theme 1 drew upon research and practice of collective impact initiatives and
UNICEF’s Strategic Plans (2014-2017 and 2018-2021). Theme 2 drew upon research and practice on
programme scaling and the requirements for strengthening national government systems to effectively
design and implement policies for multisectoral programmes. Theme 3 drew upon research and practice of
early childhood development and early childhood education, and in particular, UNICEF’s global standards
for early childhood education and parenting programmes.
3.2 Evaluation Questions and Analytical Frameworks
Theme 1: UNICEF Global Leadership
● Objective: To assess the internal coherence and effect of UNICEF’s global leadership in early
childhood development
35
41. Core Evaluation Questions. To what extent is UNICEF positioned and prepared to lead and support
governments and partners in scaling systems to deliver early stimulation and responsive care systems?
What effect has UNICEF’s leadership had on the field of early childhood development, international
development agencies, evidence in early childhood development, and in communicating the importance of
early stimulation and responsive care to governments, implementing partners and development agencies?
42. Evaluation Sub-Questions. Theme 1 included four sub-questions that the evaluation team used as a basis
for answering the core evaluation questions.
• 1.1 Institutional Readiness. To what extent has UNICEF been successful in discharging its role as a
global leader in ECD (and early stimulation and responsive care, in particular) with regional and
country offices in both emergency and development settings?
• 1.2 UNICEF Strategies. Which strategies has UNICEF implemented to advance early childhood
development, and early stimulation and responsive care? How relevant and effective are these
strategies in development, humanitarian and peacebuilding contexts?
• 1.3 Effect of UNICEF Leadership. Have there been significant advances in ECD and the delivery of
early stimulation and responsive care programs by governments globally during the evaluation period?
To what extent can these advances be attributed to the leadership and support provided by UNICEF?
• 1.4 Global Positioning. What positioning, policy, and institutional adjustments, if any, are necessary to
strengthen UNICEF capacities for global leadership in ECD?
43. Analytical Framework. Research on collective impact initiatives provides a useful analytical framework for
evaluating UNICEF’s institutional readiness for multisectoral programming in theme 1 (see Figure 11).
Collective impact initiatives (such as multisectoral programming) are an integrated approach to
programming with a range of actors who commit to a common agenda for solving complex social and
environmental issues. Research indicates there are five foundational conditions for collective impact
initiatives to be effective: (1) a common agenda; (2) mutually reinforcing activities; (3) a shared
measurement system; (4) a backbone function; and (5) continuous communication.43
44. First, there must be a common agenda or a shared vision for change, including a common understanding
of the problem and a joint approach to solving it through agreed upon actions. Second, there must be
mutually reinforcing activities, or differentiated programme activities that are coordinated and synergistic
through a mutually reinforcing plan of action. Third, there must be a shared measurement system, or an
agreement upon what to measure and how in order to ensure the efforts remain aligned, as well as for
continuous learning, improvement, and accountability.
45. Fourth, one partner or entity should provide a backbone function, or dedicated staff with the necessary
skills to coordinate partner organizations and agencies. Finally, there must be continuous communication
across the multiple actors to build trust, to transparently confirm that mutual objectives are being met, and
to maintain motivation. The evaluation criteria associated with institutional readiness is internal
coherence, or the synergies and interlinkages between the interventions carried out by UNICEF on global,
regional and country levels, as well as the consistency of these interventions with relevant international
norms and standards for children’s rights.

46. UNICEF Strategic Plans (2014-2017 and 2018-2021) and their associated theory of change and results
frameworks were the basis of the analytical framework for answering the remaining three questions for
theme 1 (see Figure 12). UNICEF leadership is expressed through the organization’s “change strategies”
which are based upon UNICEF’s comparative advantage and mandate to work with national governments
in realizing children’s rights, as outlined in the former and current Strategic Plan. The evaluation criteria
associated with UNICEF’s leadership is effectiveness, or the extent to which UNICEF’s leadership has
achieved, or is expected to achieve, its objectives and its results with governments and international
development agencies in the manner in which they conceptualize and implement ECD in practice.

47. We grouped these strategies into four areas of leadership: (1) partnerships and resource mobilization,
or the extent to which public and private partnerships were mobilized and/or contributed to UNICEF
supported early stimulation and responsive care programming; (2) evidence generation, or the extent to
which data was generated and used for decision making on the situation of young children and on the
efficacy of UNICEF supported early stimulation and responsive care programmes; (3) advocacy and
communication, or the extent to which there was evidence of increased awareness, demand and
investment in ECD and early stimulation and responsive care programmes; and (4) system strengthening,
or the extent to which UNICEF strengthened national capacity and systems to deliver and scale early
stimulation and responsive care programmes.
Theme 2: System Strengthening
● Objective: To analyse UNICEF’s contributions and effectiveness in strengthening national capacity
and systems to implement and scale early stimulation and responsive care programs and services
48. Core Evaluation Question. To what extent has UNICEF supported governments to strengthen sectoral
and multisectoral policies and systems for ECD, including national capacity to scale the delivery of early
stimulation and responsive care programmes and services?
49. Evaluation Sub-Questions. Theme 2 included five sub-questions that the evaluation team used as a basis
for answering the core evaluation question.
 2.1 Enabling Environment. How has UNICEF supported governments in the delivery and the scaling
up of early stimulation and responsive care services through relevant sectors? Do countries have the
required legal, financial, and institutional arrangements, as well as policies and sectoral plans, to
support the delivery and scaling up of early stimulation and responsive care? What was UNICEF’s
contribution in establishing these?
 2.2 Coordination Mechanisms and Systems. Do countries have the required coordination mechanisms
and systems in place with all relevant stakeholders and sectors to deliver an essential package of ECD
and early stimulation and responsive care programs? What was UNICEF’s contribution in moving the
country forward in these areas?
 2.3 Public Financing. Is there adequate, efficient, and equitable public financing for ECD, and for early
stimulation and responsive care programs in particular? What has been UNICEF’s contribution to
strengthening government capacity to prioritize ECD in the relevant budgets, and to allocate and spend
funds efficiently, equitably, and effectively? Efforts may include evidence-based advocacy to key
stakeholders, supporting line ministers to assist with budget planning and allocation, and promoting
coordination among relevant sectors. This may also require understanding what roles private and public
sector funding play in ECD in each country
 2.4 National Training Systems for Frontline Workers. Are service providers and front-line workers
across relevant sectors that engage with young children and families adequately trained and supported
to deliver early stimulation and responsive care interventions and quality services? Are early stimulation
and responsive care programs adequately staffed, equipped, managed, harmonized and monitored?
What was UNICEF’s contribution in these areas?
 2.5 Lessons Learned. What can UNICEF learn from countries that are effective in delivering an
essential package of ECD services to young children and their families? Taking these lessons into
account, what strategic and operational changes does UNICEF need to make to more effectively
support the scaling up of ECD and early stimulation and responsive care programs at country level?
38
50. Analytical Framework. Research and practice on programme scaling provides a useful analytical
framework for evaluating UNICEF’s support to strengthen national systems for ECD and early stimulation
and responsive care in theme 2 (see Figure 13). This framework is based upon the core dimensions and
phases involved in taking a policy from an idea, to a pilot and into a programme that is implemented and
sustained at scale by the government. The evaluation criteria associated with system strengthening is
effectiveness, or the extent to which UNICEF’s leadership has achieved, or is expected to achieve, its
objectives and its results with governments and international development agencies in the manner in which
they conceptualize and implement ECD in practice.

51. First, an enabling environment is required to gain real traction for scale-up, meaning an intervention needs
to be aligned with the government’s key policies such as its national development plan or ECD policy, if
one exists. If such policies do not exist, governments must have strong evidence to warrant the
development of a new policy, which often necessitates technical and financial support. Second, there must
be effective coordination mechanisms for multisectoral ECD programmes and services, such as
coordinating committees or cross-sectoral networks that ensure continuous communication for the
intervention at a decentralized level. The relevant line ministries need to take responsibility for certain
aspects of the intervention, integrating it fully into its policies, plans and budgets, but more importantly into
its management organogram.
52. Third, there must be public financing for ECD interventions poised for scaling, such as: evidence of the
cost of inaction; evidence of the developmental impacts, expressed in economic terms; evidence of possible
synergies that improve the effectiveness or reduce the costs of other interventions and phased budget
proposals that are linked to realistic implementation plans. Finally, national training systems for frontline
ECD workers is required to scaling effective interventions, including the development of materials and
curricula. This might also include adapting the materials for new context and cultural groups.
39
Theme 3: Programme Quality and Impact
● Objective: To assess the relevance and impact of UNICEF’s direct support for vulnerable children,
parents, and frontline workers participating in early stimulation and responsive care programs in low-
resource and emergency settings
53. Core Evaluation Question. What evidence is there that UNICEF direct support for early stimulation and
responsive care programs are making a difference on a significant scale for vulnerable children, parents
and caregivers?
54. Evaluation Sub-Questions. Theme 3 included six sub-questions that the evaluation team used as a basis
for answering the core evaluation question.
 3.1 Program Delivery. What is the range of interventions or programs being supported by UNICEF in
early stimulation and responsive care? Is their reach and coverage adequate and equitable? Adequate
refers to the reach of the program (e.g., the number of children and parents served in relation to
demand/need). Equitable refers to geographic distribution, context (e.g., development, humanitarian),
income, gender and age.
 3.2 Program Design. To what extent do UNICEF-supported interventions correspond to evidence-
based good practices? What was UNICEF’s role in creating and supporting these interventions?
 3.3 Program Scaling. Are UNICEF-supported programs taking the necessary steps to ensure
interventions can be scaled (e.g., developing a theory of change and M&E framework, designing
appropriate curricula and tools for training caregivers, imbedding interventions into existing sectoral
programs and platforms.)?
 3.4 Program Quality. Are UNICEF-supported early stimulation and responsive care programs being
implemented as intended (with fidelity) and according to parenting and early learning and development
standards? What are the challenges associated with implementation? How and to what extent have
they been addressed?
 3.5 Program Impact. Are selected early stimulation and responsive care programs having a
demonstrable effect on caregiving practices and children’s development, especially for the most
vulnerable children, including children with disabilities?
 3.6 Lessons Learned. What can UNICEF learn from countries that deliver successful early stimulation
and responsive care programs in a variety of contexts (e.g., emergency situations, fragile contexts, very
poor rural and urban communities, and with nomadic or ethnic minority populations)? Taking these
lessons into account, what strategic and operational changes does UNICEF need to make to improve
early stimulation and responsive care programs?
55. Analytical Framework. Research and practice on early childhood education and early childhood
development provides a useful analytical framework for evaluating the quality and impact of UNICEF-
supported early stimulation and responsive care programming (see Figure 14). In particular, the analytical
framework is derived from ECD studies and UNICEF supported evaluations on programme quality, as well
as UNICEF’s previous work in supporting national governments to develop Early Learning and
Development Standards, and UNICEF’s Global Standards for Parenting Programmes. The evaluation
criteria for this theme included relevance, or the extent to which UNICEF-supported parenting programme
objectives and design are sensitive to the economic, environment, social, political, and capacity conditions
in the country. The evaluation team also examined impact, or the extent to which the selected parenting
40
programmes have generated (or are expected to generate) significant or transformative effects on parenting
practices and children’s developmental status.

56. Programme design was examined with a view to the extent to which it aligned with evidence-based
practices for early stimulation and responsive care programmes. Programme delivery was examined by
determining which stakeholders were involved, and by assessing the typology and reach to the intended
beneficiaries. Programme scaling was examined to assess if there was appropriate codification of the
early stimulation and responsive care interventions, including a clear theory of change, monitoring and
evaluation frameworks, and an explicit scaling strategy. Programme quality of implementation was
examined by the extent to which interventions adhered to UNICEF quality standards and were executed
with fidelity (or as planned), and by assessing if there was any evidence on frontline worker skills and
capacities. Programme impact examined if there was evidence that UNICEF-supported early stimulation
and responsive care programmes contributed to improvements in parent capacity to provide nurturing care
and in children’s developmental status.
3.3 Evaluation Methods and Analysis
57. The evaluation methods included a mix of qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis
techniques on global, regional, country, and programme levels (see Figure 15). Data were collected in five
phases using the following methods: (1) secondary data from 157 countries; (2) document review of
more than 400 reports, plans, studies, and evaluations from 28 UNICEF Country Offices (COs), 7 Regional
Offices (ROs), and 5 Headquarter (HQ) Divisions; (3) institutional survey with 54 UNICEF COs; (4)
remote key informant interviews/focus groups with 21 UNICEF staff members and external experts;
and (6) six case studies of UNICEF-supported parenting programmes or initiatives (Jordan, Mali,
Paraguay, Rwanda, Serbia, and Thailand).

58. Secondary Data Collection. During the first phase of data collection, data was collected from UNICEF’s
corporate monitoring systems and tools (RAMs, SMQs) as well as MICS data for 157 countries and 7
regions was analysed to map: (1) UNICEF’s special interventions for relevant goals; (2) progress made on
UNICEF’s implementation strategies (or outputs); (3) progress on achieving outcomes for frontline workers
and parents; and (4) the home environment and public education context children in the countries where
UNICEF supports ECD programmes (see Figure 3). The evaluation team analysed all available data from
2014-2020, including global data on 10 implementation strategies and interventions: 13 indicators on
outputs and 9 indicators on outcomes and impacts. See Annex C for additional information on the specific
indicators and relevant data tables; see Annex A (Evaluation Team Documents) for a link to the full
summary report on the global mapping of the ECD portfolio.
59. Document Review. During the second phase of data collection the evaluation team identified 54 countries
from the global mapping of the ECD portfolio that had evidence of early stimulation and responsive care
programming across many UNICEF goal areas. This sample included 7 regions with 10 lower-income
countries; 20 lower-middle income countries; 20 upper-middle income countries; and 4 higher-income
countries; as well as 9 countries with active Level 2 (L2) emergency status. For this sample, the team
reviewed more than 200 documents from a sample of 28 countries and 7 regions, including UNICEF CO
and RO Annual Reports, Country Programme Documents (or plans), and RAM Reports for COs and ROs.
The document review also included more than 200 relevant global and regional programme documents,
work plans, and ECD evaluations and studies from relevant divisions and sections, as well as a scan of the
latest research on early stimulation and responsive care. See Annex B for a summary of this data collection
and Annex D for the analysis procedure.
43
60. Institutional Survey. During the third phase of data collection, 54 COs identified from the document review
completed an institutional survey to provide greater detail on their support to national governments for ECD
and early stimulation and responsive care programming (see Annex E). These data addressed substantial
gaps in programming monitoring data, especially on the content and evidence associated with parenting
programmes and frontline worker capacity development. In addition, the survey contained questions to
understand the impact of the COVID-19 emergency on UNICEF’s work in early stimulation and responsive
care programming, and upstream advocacy and systems strengthening.
61. Key Informant Interviews/Focus Groups. During the fourth phase of data collection, evaluators
interviewed a total of 16 UNICEF staff members, including 6 Regional ECD Advisors or Focal Points, and
10 Global ECD Advisors or Focal Points. In addition, 5 external international ECD experts were interviewed
to understand outsider perspectives about the organization’s role and leadership in the field on a global
level. The focus of these interviews was on the most significant changes made to early childhood policies,
systems and practices under UNICEF’s leadership, as well as an examination of UNICEF’s comparative
advantage in advancing a new vision for ECD and early stimulation and responsive care. See Annex G for
the interview protocols for both target groups.
62. Case Studies. During the fifth stage of data collection Six countries were selected for case studies based
upon UNICEF’s monitoring data for parenting programs, and through consultations with UNICEF’s ECD
Section. These countries met criteria for inclusion as case studies, including: (1) UNICEF had supported
national governments in implementing parenting programs that focus upon early stimulation and responsive
care; (2) they represented a range of parenting programmes that were poised for scaling; (3) they
represented a range of UNICEF regions and contexts; and (4) there was sufficient evidence for a more in-
depth case study. The final selection included: Jordan (MENA), Mali (WCA), Paraguay (LAC), Rwanda
(ESA), Serbia (ECA). and Thailand (EAP).
63. The focus of the case studies was on assessing the extent to which governments have prepared parenting
programmes for scaling, and to provide a more in-depth examination of quality and impact of parenting
programmes and initiatives. Case studies included a review of approximately 200 documents regarding
government policies, plans, secondary data, relevant national training curricula, and guides and tools from
the selected parenting programmes. Remote interviews were conducted with 15 UNICEF staff members to
better understand the steps the UNICEF COs took to ensure parenting programmes were of high quality,
were effective, and could be scaled effectively. An exploration of monitoring and evaluation tools,
evaluations, and data for these programmes was undertaken to assess the evidence of impact on caregiver
capacities, parenting outcomes, and child development. Annex G also contains a generic initial interview
script, which was tailored to each CO in light of document review and institutional survey results. See
Annexes H and I for a more detailed summary of the case studies.
64. Data Analysis. The majority of the data collected for this evaluation was qualitative in nature and analysed
using qualitative coding, trends analysis, and descriptive frequencies. A total of 184 codes were created to
align passages of text with the evaluation themes, questions and the core dimensions of the theory of
change. The evaluators utilised Dedoose, an online platform for managing, coding, and analysing the data
(see Annex D, Dedoose Coding Manual). In total, approximately 2,000 passages of text were coded from
the document review alone. Qualitative trends analysis included a case-based approach to identify different
combinations of factors that were critical to a given outcome in given contexts (in this case, early stimulation
and responsive care). Descriptive statistics used to describe quantitative information from 157 COs include
different types of data, such as rating scales on the maturity of programming, the number of children or
parents reached, and the percentage of countries engaged in various activities within a region. Descriptive
44
statistics were also applied for the institutional survey with 54 COs. All data were then examined for
triangulation (or commonalities) in the results from the various methods to draw conclusions.
65. Data Visualization. An interactive google map of the evaluation data was prepared to facilitate the rapid
assessment and dissemination of information on the impact of COVID-19 on parenting and early learning
programmes (see Figure 16). This map also includes data layers of the corporate monitoring data for Goals
1 and 2, as well as information on system strengthening and UNICEF strategies.
Figure 16: Impact of COVID-19 on ECD parenting and early learning programmes
66. Evaluation Limitations mitigation measures. In light of the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,
the evaluation team could not undertake primary data collection activities through direct contact with
stakeholders and beneficiaries, and observations of the implementation of interventions; hence we modified
the original evaluation design and methods accordingly. Namely, international travel and all fieldwork had
to be eliminated from the evaluation exercise. This limitation placed a substantial constraint on our ability
to evaluate program scaling and impact (Themes 2 and 3). For example, the evaluation team had planned
data collection with government representatives, implementing partners, and with beneficiaries (i.e.,
parents and children) from selected programmes to directly assess the impact of UNICEF support on child,
parent, and frontline worker outcomes. Instead, we amplified our review of documents on a global, regional,
and country level to ensure a robust qualitative database was in place to assess trends in UNICEF
strategies, outputs, and outcomes. In addition, we conducted six in-depth case studies that consisted of
reviewing program documents, manuals and available statistical data, and interviews with UNICEF staff
members to examine the evaluation themes in greater detail as they related to UNICEF supported parenting
programmes. Finally, we added questions to an institutional survey to assess the impact of COVID-19 on
early learning and parenting programmes and on government systems that deliver these programmes.
67. Ethical Engagement of Evaluation Participants. No beneficiaries were involved in this evaluation due to
the restrictions placed on the evaluation team resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Key informants were
informed of the purpose of the evaluation and their identity was protected through anonymous identifiers.
Quality control and assurance to UNICEF evaluation reporting standards were upheld by all evaluation
team members.

CHAPTER 3: EVALUATION FINDINGS
Theme 1: UNICEF Global Leadership
3.1 Institutional Readiness and Internal Coherence
EQ 1.1 - To what extent has UNICEF been successful in discharging its role as a global leader in ECD (and
early stimulation and responsive care, in particular) with regional and COs in both emergency and
development settings?
● Key Findings:
UNICEF was successful in discharging its role as global leader in ECD when ROs and COs had
sufficient human and financial resources to make it an explicit development priority that was integrated
into its results frameworks. While ECD is prioritised in UNICEF’s current Strategic Plan, there is a lack
of internal coherence on ECD as it relates to multisectoral programming and the engagement of
parents.

Common Agenda
68. For UNICEF, the common agenda was evaluated by examining evolutions in HQ, RO, and CO development
priorities for ECD, and the extent to which they address the most vulnerable child populations. ECD was
named an explicit development priority in 44 out of 54 (81%) of countries in our surveyed sample,
which was directly associated with UNICEF’s global leadership in declaring ECD an explicit priority
in the 2014-2017 Strategic Plan. In ECAR and ESAR, the priority was associated with government support
to implement the Nurturing Care Framework. In Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and South Africa, ECD priorities
included designing, modelling, and scaling an integrated package of essential ECD services. In LACR, the
priority was associated with government support to implement Care for Child Development. In Chile,
Colombia, and Paraguay, the development priority was focused upon inadequate care practices and the
prevention of violence through parenting programs. In Honduras, development priorities included the
implementation of the National Early Childhood Development Policy and improving access to
comprehensive ECD services for children ages 0 to 6 years. In MENA, UNICEF has advocated for multi-
and cross-sectoral programming to deliver holistic ECD programming. Positive parenting programs have
been implemented to prevent violent behaviour against children and to instead promote early stimulation
and responsive care practices. In EAPR the regional ‘Early Moments Matter’ headline provided vision for
the region and made it easy to communicate the regional priorities. In SAR, UNICEF has promoted greater
inter-ministerial collaboration through quality ECD multi-sectoral approaches. In Pakistan, with human
capital development declared a national priority by the Prime Minister, UNICEF accelerated support for
ECD based on the Nurturing Care Framework, including a mapping exercise which yielded
recommendations to develop a multisectoral ECD policy framework.
69. Recognizing ECD as an explicit development priority over time was transformative within some ROs
and COs. For example, in WCAR, there was no evidence of ECD as an explicit development priority for
any of the countries or for WCARO in 2014. In 2017, ECD was named as an explicit development priority
in WCAR, Senegal, and Mali. WCARO annual reports indicated that ECD was named an explicit
development priority in the region due to four primary factors: 1) raised awareness in the region as a result
of new evidence on the importance of the early years on brain development and its impact on school
readiness and future generations; 2) evidence from MICS that demonstrated a majority of children ages 0-
5 years in the region do not receive adequate social emotional and cognitive stimulation or responsive care
(such as in Senegal); 3) the recognition that ECD has become a top priority for many donors and partners;
and 4) the opportunity to support existing programs and initiatives by leveraging new investment for ECD.
This story of change was echoed by key informants in other regions (such as ECAR and LACR), further
demonstrating the importance of UNICEF’s global influence in identifying ECD an organizational priority.
When MICS (or other survey data) were not available, ensuring the buy in for the common agenda was
more challenging for COs, even if the agenda was aligned with national development goals.
70. Early learning was also considered a development priority in 52 out of 54 (96%) of countries within
our sample. In ECAR, the priority has been on children with disabilities (CwD), in particular early detection
and early intervention (EDEI). In ESAR, the goal has been to increase enrolment and retention of girls and
boys in pre-primary education in Kenya, to improve early learning outcomes in South Africa, to increase
access to early learning opportunities for children in Uganda, and to scale a play- and competency-based
pre-primary curriculum in Rwanda. In LACR, early learning tends to be integrated into the ECD interventions
such as Care for Child Development, and only Paraguay focused upon it as an explicit development priority.
In MENAR, the State of Palestine prioritised the improvement of learning environments in public
kindergartens, while Jordan recognised the importance of early childhood education (ECE) for human
development and also focuses on child protection. In WCAR, RO reports from 2014, 2017, and 2019 also
indicated early learning as a development priority, with a specific focus on out-of-school children given that
47
the gross enrolment ratio for pre-primary education averages 32% in the region. In EAPR all countries
investigated in the document review have early learning as a development priority. The countries increased
access to pre-primary education enrolment rates through conventional classroom-based programmes as
well as exploring the impact of community-based and alterative early learning programmes. In SAR, the
countries investigated here have early learning as a development priority and deliver early learning
programmes, like the Anganwadi Centres in India.
71. Regions and country offices that identified early learning and ECD as explicit result areas in their
CPDs were more likely to be engaged in early stimulation and responsive care programming when
compared to countries that did not have these result areas. A majority of countries in our survey
sample (72%, or 39 out of 54 countries) had identified ECD as an explicit output or outcome in their
results frameworks. Key informants stressed that they often positioned ECD within the sector that
provided the greatest strategic entry point for early stimulation and responsive care programming to be
scaled and was also based upon internal capacity and resources. A majority of the evidence from the
document review indicates ECD was positioned within education (54%) or as an explicit, stand-alone result
area (27%). The integration of ECD results within health had fewer passages of text coded in the document
review (11%), as did child protection (4%) and social protection (1%) (see Annex B, Figure 8). Thus, some
COs have made ECD an explicit result area in their country plans. However, the goal of integrating early
stimulation and responsive care into the health sector programme monitoring, as identified through
UNICEF’s Global ECD Framework and Strategic Plan, has only been marginally achieved on a global level.
72. UNICEF-supported programming was targeted towards the most vulnerable children through its
common agenda for ECD, resulting in the emergence of UNICEF as a global leader and advocate
for early stimulation and care programming in emergencies. CO annual reports and CPDs provided
evidence of equity in the provision of early stimulation and responsive care programming for specific groups
of children (see Annex B, Figure 7), with more emphasis on children with disabilities than on any other
group (27% of the 164 coded passages). There was also evidence of recent global efforts to ensure
consideration for children with disabilities in ECD programming across all sectors, especially within
parenting programmes in LACR, ECAR, MENAR, and ROSA. However, more work is required to
institutionalise this workstream, such as through more robust monitoring measures for young children with
disabilities and their parents within each goal area. Children living in poverty (17%), from marginalised
ethnic/cultural groups (12%), from remote and hard to reach areas (11%) and living in humanitarian
situations (10%) were also referenced. Migrant children (8%), out of school children (7%), working children
(1%), and gender-based programming (7%) were also important in some regions. For example, in EAPR
there has been a focus on children living in poverty, among them ethnic minorities, remote children, and
urban poor. UNICEF’s role as an emergency responder has also been crucial in reaching the most
vulnerable child populations (especially where no other partner exists), although recent global efforts have
focused more on advocacy and system strengthening for ECD in emergencies.
Mutually Reinforcing Activities
73. For UNICEF, mutually reinforcing activities are evaluated by examining the extent to which the organization
has adopted core ECD messages and the multisectoral programming approach. Global programme
narratives about healthy brain development, the Nurturing Care Framework, and other global goods
produced by UNICEF HQ to promote integrated ECD programming for the most marginalised child
populations have been largely adopted by ROs and COs in the common agendas. A majority of
surveyed COs (85%, or 46 out of 54) indicated they used the Nurturing Care Framework as an organizing
framework for communicating ECD. RO and CO reports and plans mentioned a range of core messages
provided in global ECD programme guidance documents, and a majority of surveyed countries had
48
integrated this messaging into its advocacy with governments. In total, we coded 205 passages of text in
the document review that represented core ECD messages (see Annex B, Figure 6) and 79% (43 out 54)
surveyed COs indicated they used the global ECD Programme Guidance to frame their work in ECD.
Consideration for equity in the provision of ECD services was mentioned the most in the document review
(33% of the 205 coded passages). There was also evidence on narratives associated with integrating
systems or providing multisectoral programming (22%), the importance of investing in ECD (15%), and the
importance of early stimulation and responsive care in the development of young children (13%).
74. UNICEF’s current Strategic Plan for 2018-2021 emphasises the importance of multisectoral ECD
packages, which consist of “at least two interventions that address stimulation for children aged 0-
59 months” (such as early learning and nutrition). UNICEF envisages the delivery of a range of
integrated services through strengthened health platforms and a multisectoral approach to health, bringing
frontline workers and families closer to the health systems they rely on, and improving system linkages at
the household, community, and facilities levels. As part of this approach, health platforms for the frontline
delivery of antenatal care, delivery, post-natal care, immunization and HIV prevention, and community
health workers, schools, and childcare centres, provide the opportunity for an integrated delivery of services
that are child-oriented and holistic and offer better value for money (UNICEF Strategic Plan, Theory of
Change Paper, 2018).
75. Globally 68% (107 out of 157) countries reported to have two or more ECD interventions delivered
as a package in 2018 (see Figure 17). According to the Strategic Plan 2018-2021 Results Framework,
the target for 2018 for this output was 16 countries, which was well exceeded with 107 countries.
Eastern and Central Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean had the highest percentage of countries
with ECD packages in their regions (86% in Eastern and Central Asia, and 81% in Latin America and the
Caribbean). Many of these packages integrated parenting programmes, or training of frontline ECD
workers, alongside direct services to children. Thus, multi-sectoral ECD packages are strongly associated
with early stimulation and care interventions.

76. However, these countries are in diverse stages of system strengthening on a 6-point maturity scale
from ‘weak’ to ‘champion’ (see Figure 18). The maturity status of most countries is ‘emerging’ with 47
countries, followed by ‘weak’ with 27 countries, ‘established’ with 16 countries, ‘proficient’ with 9 countries,
‘advanced’ with 5 countries, and finally ‘champion’ with 3 countries (see Box 3). This means that the largest
portion of countries have ‘emerging’ systems to roll out ECD packages, i.e., they have at least two
interventions that address stimulation for children aged 0-59 months adopted by the government, but they
49
are lacking a costed action plan to scale up under the government's ownership. The data shows that the
shift towards multisectoral ECD packages has clearly gained significant momentum, well in accordance
with the targets put forward in UNICEF’s current Strategic Plan. On the other hand, the fact that the majority
of countries are either in ‘emerging ’or ‘weak’ stages of the implementation of multisectoral ECD packages
means that there is continued need for further support in many countries.

have ‘established or above’ systems. The data reveal a regional difference in the coverage of the early
stimulation and care programmes in relation to the need for the programmes. In Eastern and Central Asia,
Eastern and Southern Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean and South Asia, 75% or more of the
countries had two or more ECD interventions delivered as a package in 2018 (Table 21). The Middle East,
and North Africa, and Western and Central Africa, 44%, 60%, and 33%, respectively, had no ECD packages
in 2018.
Shared Measurement Framework
78. For UNICEF, the shared measurement system is evaluated by examining the positioning of ECD within
corporate monitoring and evaluation systems, including the extent to which there are clear indications of
programme convergence in strategic plans and results frameworks. UNICEF current Strategic Plan,
theory of change and results framework do not reflect multisectoral programming, nor do these
documents identify opportunities for synergies in mutually reinforcing strategies, outputs, and
outcomes associated with early stimulation and responsive care programming in ECD. While ECD
is prioritised in UNICEF’s current Strategic Plan, UNICEF’s work on early stimulation and responsive care
has not been sufficiently defined, codified, or integrated into the current Strategic Plan and results
framework. Because UNICEF has struggled to implement multisectoral programming internally, the
organization has also been less successful in supporting governments in this type of collective impact
initiative.
79. Multisectoral programming in early stimulation and responsive care requires a clear vision for programme
convergence and a common measurement framework that identifies synergistic outputs and outcomes
for systems, frontline workers, and parents. Programme convergence can be expressed geographically
(such as in the delivery of multiple services within targeted communities) or thematically (such as through
an integrated ECD parenting package focused on nurturing care). Neither approach is clear in the current
Strategic Plan. UNICEF has a strong community presence – this fact was consistently referenced as one
of the comparative advantages of the organization for early stimulation and responsive care programming.
However, geographic convergence would require a more robust community engagement model for ECD
than currently exists, as well as disaggregated spatial data on programme implementation. Promising
examples from WCAR (such as through child-friendly communities) and in other countries that have
integrated health, emergency response, and communication for development programming with parenting
programmes offer ways of conceptualizing and operationalizing geographic convergence. There is strong
evidence that parent and community engagement are closely intertwined in early stimulation and
responsive care programming, and C4D provides an opportunity to strategically connect all of the work
being done with parents in this manner.
80. For thematic convergence, a common suggestion by informants is to think of ECD as the integrated
outcome for UNICEF’s work for this period of development, and to also make synergistic parenting
outcomes more explicit by acknowledging the role of parents in accelerating results for children in the next
Strategic Plan. Recent global efforts to create an organization-wide parenting strategy point to promising
practices for thematic convergence. The Nurturing Care Framework was also consistently referenced as
an effective tool for multisectoral ECD programme planning by ROs and COs. Its simplicity in design and
in conveying the key message of holistic child development has been transformative for international
development agencies, governments, and INGOs. In EAPR the focus on operationalization of the Nurturing
Care Framework, with partners and donors, provided an opportunity to better define the indicators and
objectives of integrated ECD and parenting programmes and to collaborate across sectors. However, there
is consistent evidence that more work needs to be done on identifying the continuum of integrated ECD
51
packages for children and parents beyond the first 1,000 days. Further, there is little to no evidence or
evaluations that have proven the added benefits of multisectoral programming for parents and children.
This finding was related to the infancy of UNICEF’s work in multisectoral programming (which is ‘weak’ or
‘emerging’ in status for the majority of countries) and a lack of a common measurement framework to
assess the added benefit of this approach for programme outputs, outcomes, and impacts (see Annex C,
Table 19).44
81. A noticeable gap in UNICEF’s work with parents and early stimulation and responsive care
programming is that it has not been sufficiently codified or integrated into the current Strategic
Plan, theory of change, and results framework. There are currently only two parenting outcomes in the
Strategic Plan theory of change in Goal 1 and 3 (Outcome Indicator 1.20 “percentage of children receiving
early stimulation and responsive care from their parents or caregivers”; and Outcome Indicator 3.2,
“attitudes towards corporal punishment,” which currently does not include disaggregated data for the 0-5
age group). In addition, the current monitoring systems and tools (the SMQs and RAMs) do not capture this
body of work, which touches all of the Strategic Plan goal areas. For example, we found limited evidence
on the types of parenting programming being supported by UNICEF, the age groups reached by these
programmes, the content of these programmes, and the outcomes and impacts of these programmes in
the document review and SMQs and RAMs. Thus, a majority of the work being supported by UNICEF on
parenting is currently “invisible” within the organization. This evaluation represents the first attempt to
answer these basic questions, which are summarised in the results for Theme 3 on programme delivery,
design, quality, and impact. Further, the terms “early stimulation and responsive care” are not sufficiently
defined within programme guidance, leading to different sector definitions and practices. Given the
significance of providing early stimulation and responsive care as a core intervention of any ECD
programme, these findings represent a significant leadership gap in UNICEF’s global role for ECD.
Backbone Function and Continuous Communication
82. For UNICEF, the backbone function is evaluated by examining internal capacity development in ECD
programme staff and the extent to which the organization has invested in the necessary human and
financial resources for achieving results. Continuous communication is evaluated by examining the extent
to which internal planning and management of ECD programming is sufficient for achieving results. The
common, integrated ECD agenda has advanced under enormous financial and human resource
constraints, which is an unsustainable strategy for a corporate priority. There is substantial evidence
that UNICEF ROs and COs have relied upon existing human resources to promote early stimulation and
responsive care programming, with relatively limited financial resources (see Annex B, Table 7). ECD
budget utilization varied widely by CO from 1% to 100% (see Annex C, Table 33). Five countries (Serbia,
Chile, Colombia, Honduras, and the State of Palestine) allocated 50% or more of their Goal 1 CO utilization
for ECD programming. Seven countries allocated 10% or less of their Goal 1 CO utilization for ECD
programming (primarily in WCAR). About one-half of the countries in our sample saw increases in this
percentage from 2018 to 2019 (primarily within ESAR), while the other half saw decreases in this
percentage (primarily in WCAR). Within regions such as ECAR, LACR, and EAPR, there were marked
differences in ECD budget utilization as a percentage of Goal Area 1 budget utilization; in ROSA the ECD
budget utilization as a percentage of Goal Area 1 budget utilization is low. However, UNICEF does not
44 The Strategic Monitoring Questions (SMQs) are the primary vehicle through which UNICEF collects data from COs to report on the
Strategic Plan. A majority of indicators from the SP results framework are calculated through the SMQ country data. At this point
UNICEF only monitors whether two or more ECD interventions were combined and delivered as a package through at least one
existing platform to address the holistic early childhood development of children 0-59 months through UNICEF supported programmes
during the year of reporting, and whether the package is adopted at scale.
52
report budget utilization specifically for early learning within Goal Area 2, so the budget data is incomplete.
For example, early stimulation and care related interventions and results in parts of EAPR and ROSA are
reported under education.
83. With all available sources combined over a 5-year period, the ECD operating budget was USD 31.1
million, which equates to less than 1% of UNICEF’s overall annual organizational budget (estimated
at USD 6.4 billion in 2019).45 From 2014-2019, an ECD operating budget was provided to HQ, RO, and
CO through a mix of funding sources, the largest proportion from the private sector. HQ received a total of
USD 18.3 million (USD 8.3 million from private sector; USD 6.02 million from 7% aside funds; USD 2.17
million from regular resources, thematic funds, and institutional budget; and USD 1.82 million from
governments). ROs received the least amount of funds, 262,000 USD from 7% aside funds; but there is
evidence that donor funding was sought by ECARO and LACRO. CO received USD 12.6 million from
UNICEF’s corporate grands through the 7% aside funds.
84. The fact that a majority of the ECD global operating budget came from private sources is
noteworthy, but there is a substantial gap in UNICEF’s internal investment in ECD, given that ECD
was elevated as a global corporate priority. The lack of investment in ROs is also striking, especially
given the extensive capacity development and institutional capacity building that has taken place when
Regional Advisors were in place to advance the ECD agenda internally. There is a strong correlation
between COs that have received these funds and evidence on early stimulation and responsive care
programming. This finding does not consider other investments by UNICEF for ECD related programming,
such as in education, to which the organization has committed to giving 10% of its operating budget. A
closer examination of each sectoral contribution to the 0-8 age group financing would provide a clearer
indication of UNICEF’s overall investment in ECD.
85. Internal governance structures have not kept pace with the integrated vision for ECD. While UNICEF
has practiced Matrix Management structures to facilitate collaboration on programming planning
for ECD, this governance structure has not been sufficiently resourced or formalised within
management practices, which are insufficient for coordination and collaboration to promote integrated
programming. According to key informants, more recent efforts to develop an organization-wide parenting
framework across all sectors and over the life course offer a promising example of effective multisectoral
programming that spans early childhood and adolescent development. There is also evidence that suggests
multisectoral programming is more effective internally within countries, where teams are smaller and often
integrated under one Programme Manager or the Deputy Representative.
86. UNICEF has tried to address these shortcomings through internal capacity development at the
global and regional levels for COs (see Annex B, Table 7). For example, ESARO reported capacity
development for each CO to implement and scale integrated ECD packages in the health, education,
nutrition, and child protection sectors through the steps contained in the ECD Framework for Action, which
is based upon the Nurturing Care Framework. LACRO reported capacity development for CO in
contextualizing and rolling out Care for Child Development within the region. This included the development
of training materials, toolkits, guides, and technical notes for addressing children with disabilities and
violence in the early years. LACRO also helped COs prepare emergency plans that incorporated the
provision of ECD kits and/or an explicit ECD response plan. WCARO has provided technical assistance
alongside HQ in finalizing the Care for Child Development training package, with a new module on caregiver

53
support. WCARO also mobilised internal partnerships between ECD, Education, and Nutrition to obtain
financial resources for nurturing care programming in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso.
87. However, there is also strong evidence from key informant interviews both internal and external to
the organization of shortcomings in staffing, including a need for ECD Specialists who are P4 or P5
grade or higher. The logic is that ECD requires dedicated and highly skilled technical staff members
who are able to coordinate work in early childhood both within and across the sectors. Staff
members require skills in participatory planning processes and negotiation, and to be empowered to
suggest common areas for programme convergence and advancement with staff members of all
professional grades, and across all sectors. This requires sufficient content knowledge that is
interdisciplinary in nature, as well as specialised knowledge in neuroscience research, best practices in
ECD programming, and direct assessment and the design of evaluations that are useful for estimating
programme efficacy and impact. In many cases, because ECD was only named a recent organization
priority, existing staff members, often at the P3 level and sitting in education or health sections, have been
asked to coordinate work for this age group across organizational sectors or divisions without having
sufficient skills, knowledge, and power to influence changes in practice.
3.2 UNICEF’s Global Leadership Strategies for ECD
EQ 1.2 – Which strategies has UNICEF implemented to advance early childhood development, and early
stimulation and responsive care? How relevant and effective are these strategies in development,
humanitarian and peacebuilding contexts?
● Key Findings:
• UNICEF implements four primary strategies to achieve its programmatic goals, including
partnerships and resource mobilization, evidence generation, advocacy and communications and
system strengthening. Advocacy and system strengthening were identified as most effective for
development context, while partnerships and resource mobilization and system strengthened were
most effective in humanitarian and peacebuilding context. Evidence generation is the least effective
strategy, largely due to the human and financial resources required to conduct research or
evaluations.

88. A significant amount of evidence was found on UNICEF’s leadership strategies to promote early stimulation
and responsive care programming, especially as it applied to partnership and resource mobilization and
advocacy and communications. Some evidence of UNICEF’s leadership in system strengthening was
identified, but gaps and challenges remain in creating the necessary enabling environment for the scaling
of early stimulation and responsive care programmes. There was limited to no evidence of UNICEF’s
leadership or contributions in evidence generation, which is the costlier strategy among the four we
examined.
89. Government capacity and the situation of children in different contexts influences operational
choices in the selected strategies. According to UNICEF’s ECD Programme Guidance, in each country,
the analysis of the situation of children, government capacities, partnerships, and the availability of
resources determines the scope and scale of programmes as well as UNICEF’s value added. By mapping
the context, UNICEF, in partnership with governments and other constituents, determines the appropriate
programming approaches to maximise results. The focus and scope of ECD programming are significantly
influenced by the government’s ability to implement ECD-friendly programmes and policies considering its
financial and human resources, as well as the effectiveness of its systems and the delivery platforms in
place. Additionally, given that UNICEF programming in a country is implemented with and through other
partners, the programmatic response is influenced by the presence as well as the capacity of these other
actors. The ECD programme will differ across countries because it needs to be adapted to leverage the
strengths of the context and respond to the needs.
90. UNICEF implements complementary strategies to achieve its programmatic goals, and to adjust to
contextual changes in the operating environment. The document review revealed more evidence on
system strengthening (40%) and evidence generation (26%) by UNICEF COs than on advocacy and
55
communications (14%), partnerships and resource mobilization (13%) (see Annex B, Figure 9). This trend
was confirmed by the institutional survey, but we also found that advocacy was the most common strategy
employed by UNICEF in combination with other strategies (see Figure 19). The UNICEF strategies that
were rated by the COs as effective at getting the government to prioritise and invest in early stimulation and
responsive care programming were system strengthening and advocacy and communication. In
humanitarian contexts, partnerships and resource mobilization and system strengthening were the most
commonly used strategies.

91. COVID-19 has elevated the importance multisectoral programming, behaviour change and
community engagement and advocacy and communications. For example, a majority of the 54
surveyed COs indicated that multisectoral programming, behaviour change, and community
engagement and advocacy are more important now in light of the pandemic (see Figure 20). This
trend reflects the need for virtual and remote programme delivery through community-based engagement
platforms and to communicate important messages for nurturing care. Donor interest in supporting early
stimulation and responsive care increased in 7 COs, decreased in 6 COs, was unchanged in 10 COs, and
was too early to assess in 21 COs.

92. Major challenges in implementing UNICEF global change strategies were associated with: financial
resources; government allocation of resources to implement the strategies; political buy-in; and
adaptation to the country context. The most frequently mentioned obstacles to UNICEF’s achievement
of results for children were a lack of scaling and/or sustainability of programmes, a delay in implementation
of programmes, issues with the quality of programmes, and a general lack of coordination (see Figure 21).
The most promising mitigation measures included: advocating for ECD; focusing on coordination efforts;
and piggybacking on existing programmes and community-based programmes.

3.3 Effectiveness of UNICEF’s Leadership on ECD
EQ 1.2 – Effectiveness of UNICEF Strategies. Have there been significant advances in ECD and delivery
of early stimulation and care programmes by governments globally during the evaluation period? To what
extent can these advances be attributed to the leadership and support provided by UNICEF?
● Key Finding:
• UNICEF’s leadership on ECD was transformative for the international development community over
the evaluation period in raising awareness about and gaining buy-in for an integrated ECD agenda,
especially given the lack of investment by the organization in sufficient human and financial
resources for effective multisectoral programming.
93. UNICEF has combined partnerships, advocacy, and public communications strategies to increase
awareness of ECD, which has led to new priorities and champions for ECD in some countries. In
Paraguay, the Early Moments Matter campaign reached more than 1.125 million people with messages on
57
the importance of investing in ECD, including 73 influencers, more than one million tweets, and more than
200,000 Facebook views. This campaign contributed to making early childhood a national priority and
influenced the design of the Social Protection System for this age group. In Serbia, UNICEF brokered
partnerships with key national media and corporate partners Nordeus and VodaVoda to support the launch
of the Early Moments Matter Campaign during the Parenting Month. This resulted in more than 4.8 million
views on television and over 37,000 pageviews on Serbia CO’s website, and a digital display campaign that
had over 11.6 million impressions and was amplified by some of the country’s most relevant influencers.
Rwanda CO reached more than one million people nationwide through a mass media campaign and more
than 334,000 parents to increase awareness on the importance of ECD services. In Jordan, nationwide
community-based events to end violence reached 40,000 persons, and its social media campaign on
Violence against Children, specifically the message that corporal punishment is an unacceptable way of
disciplining children, gained 2.2 million impressions resulting in support for the idea that corporal
punishment is an unacceptable way of disciplining the children. In Ghana, the country’s public
communications efforts through the Early Moments Matter Campaign conveyed consistent messaging on
the importance of fathers in young children’s development and on the right age of school enrolment that
reached 2.8 million people through social media platforms, one million through traditional media, and 70,000
new followers on social media. In Thailand UNICEF partnered with Central Group (retail) on the
#EatPlayLove campaign to increase awareness of the importance of the first months and years of a child’s
life and the impact of early experiences on brain development. In Palestine UNICEF utilised the Bank of
Palestine ATM machines to promote messaging on ECD targeting parents. This partnership allowed for
much broader dissemination of messaging than would have otherwise been possible.
94. UNICEF advocacy for a holistic approach to ECD (the Whole Child approach) and its efforts in stimulating
investment and demand for early stimulation and responsive caregiving have global benefits beyond
discreet organizational goals. UNICEF efforts have made a positive contribution in raising awareness
and demand for ECD among international development agencies, governments, non-governmental
organizations, as well as within the private sector. These include: (1) the publication of The Lancet
Series that summarised research in the neurosciences on the importance of healthy brain development and
the role of experience, including stimulation, in promoting that development; (2) the co-development with
WHO and the World Bank of the Nurturing Care Framework, which provides a simple and clear vision for
integrated ECD programming; (3) the establishment of UNICEF’s role as the global steward of the ECD
indicator in the Sustainable Development Goals, SDG target indicator 4.2.1, which aided in mobilizing a
global partnership with the World Bank and the private sector for ECD (such as the Lego Foundation, IKEA
Foundation, and the H&M Foundation); (4) the global reach of the Early Moments Matter Campaign and
Parenting Hub, which helped to raise awareness among decision makers, service providers, parents, and
the general public on the importance of the early years for lifelong thriving; (5) the production of academic
research and global programme guidance on ECD, parenting, and public financing for ECD; and (6) the
establishment of global, regional, and country level networks for ECD, such as ECDAN and the ECD Peace
Consortium, which have highlighted UNICEF’s power as a technical leader and convener of diverse
partnerships for the sharing of good practices and for advocating for investment in ECD.
95. UNICEF has successfully leveraged public-private partnerships to implement early stimulation and
responsive care programming. In total, we coded 99 passages of text associated with the
partnership and resource mobilization strategy (see Annex B, Figure 10). A majority of these narratives
indicate UNICEF’s efforts to establish and activate ECD Networks (47%), followed by public partnerships
(33%) and private partnerships (13% financial, 7% non-financial). A majority of evidence on UNICEF’s
partnerships represents public sector implementing partners (41% of 232 passages of text), followed by
INGOs, NGOs and Civil Society implementing partners (16%), the media (13%), academia (12%),
international development agencies (12%) and the private sector (6%) (see Annex B, Figure 11). For
58
example, in 2018, Thailand CO established new partnerships with the National Human Rights Commission
of Thailand for advocacy on the ECD Act, the Thai Health Promotion Foundation, and the Equitable
Education Fund to advocate for greater investment in children. EAPRO and ROSA work closely with the
Asia-Pacific Regional Network for Early Childhood (ARNEC).
96. UNICEF’s public partnerships have led to substantial increases in funding for ECD programming,
especially in WCAR where more than USD 166 million was raised. The WCARO raised USD 6 million
as a recipient for “Education Cannot Wait”, as well as USD 15 million for Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger for
early learning. In 2017 and 2019, Senegal reported a collaboration with the World Bank to strengthen ECD
services for early stimulation and care at the community level. This included USD 60 million in resource
mobilization from the World Bank and the Global Partnership for Education. In Niger, UNICEF’s public
partnerships and policy and systems strengthening with the government in the process of developing a new
Education and Professional Training Sector Plan 2020-2022, and a Financial Simulation Model in particular,
enabled the mobilization of USD 85 million for sector interventions in early learning from the Global
Partnership for Education. The ECARO was also successful in mobilizing USD 2 million from a bilateral
donor for ECD in six Western Balkans countries and Moldova. In LACR, UNICEF’s leadership in a national
education network in Honduras was credited with securing a donation of USD 10.2 million from the World
Bank.
97. UNICEF’s private partnerships have mobilised resources for demonstration models in WCAR,
ECAR and ESAR with the aim of scaling effective approaches through public systems. With support
from UNICEF HQ, resources were obtained for early stimulation and responsive care programming from
the H&M Consciousness Foundation and the Lego Foundation. The private sector (tea companies) in
Rwanda also increased ECD investment through the provision of integrated ECD services in 12 districts
with tea plantations. Engaging the private sector as new champions for ECD by sharing evidence on
nurturing care increased awareness of the sensitivity and developmental importance of the early years
among tea companies which motivated their investment in early stimulation and responsive care services.
98. When UNICEF was able to generate evidence on children’s developmental status or on public
financing for ECD and combined this with advocacy and communications, it has been able to
increase public investment in ECD in some countries. For example, in Senegal, UNICEF’s advocacy
efforts with the Ministry of the Economy, Finance, and Planning using data on children’s developmental
status led to an increase in budget allocation for early childhood from 0.5 percent to 0.9 percent. In Burkina
Faso, there was evidence of increased budget allocation to ECD in 2017, due to the evidence-based
advocacy efforts of the CO with the Ministry of Education during the development of the Education Sector
Plan 2017-2030. The budget allocation to ECD (against the overall education sector budget), rose from 0.4
percent in 2016 to 2.0 percent in 2017. The Mali CO reported that UNICEF’s public partnerships and support
for policy engagement and systems strengthening, namely revising the national early learning strategy,
resulted in increased budget allocations to the preschool subsector from 0.01 percent to 4.0 percent. In
South Africa, UNICEF’s supported the reprioritization of budgets including a 25% allocation increase in the
ECD subsidy for poor children. The Rwanda CO reported that the creation of the National ECD Programme
and Policy have been credited with increasing ECD budget allocation in which 21 districts.
99. UNICEF’s technical support has enabled the strengthening of national capacity and systems in
some countries. For example, the coordination of ECD services was strengthened in Kenya through
its financial and technical support which permitted joint field visits and planning that improved
accountability and deterred duplication of efforts. In Rwanda, technical support to the National ECD
Programme provided direction to ECD programming and coordination across the sectors through the ECD
Network. With over 20 established positions across all the thematic areas financed by central government,
59
ECD and family coordination mechanisms have been strengthened at the national and decentralised levels.
Burkina Faso CO’s technical support facilitated the creation of sub-national ECD coordination mechanisms
within a multi-sectoral nutrition coordinating unit in the Office of the Presidency. In 2019, Ghana CO
reported its technical support to the Ministry of Education (MoE) resulted in the development of a policy
framework and costed implementation plan for ECD. Thailand CO is providing technical support to develop
nutrition guidelines and practices for ECD services. In Lao UNICEF is providing technical support to the
Ministry of Education. Palestine CO continued playing a significant technical and coordination role in
facilitating the engagement of various government ministries, UNWRA, and the World Bank through regular
meetings of the national and sub-national ECD committees and technical working groups. Pakistan CO ’s
sustained technical assistance to the KP government included coordination; contracting, managing and
quality control of technical service providers; and technical inputs, all of which significantly advanced the
readiness of the province to scale up ECE. Results included a prototype for holistic child development and
early learning in a secure, stimulating, and creative environment; and approved early learning development
standards and teacher training manuals.
3.4 UNICEF’s Leadership and Positioning for ECD
EQ 1.4 – Global Positioning. What positioning, policy and institutional adjustments, if any, are necessary to
strengthen UNICEF capacities for global leadership in ECD?
● Key Findings:
• UNICEF has a strong comparative advantage for multisectoral programming on a global level.
However, a lack of evidence on the situation of young children and parents, and on the efficacy of
UNICEF-supported programmes places the organization at a disadvantage in maintaining its global
leadership and positioning for ECD.
100. UNICEF has positioned the organization as an ECD leader and expert, policy influencer, capacity
developer, and service provider. This trend is clearly seen in the number of text passages coded for
UNICEF’s strategies (N=540), the enabling environment for ECD (N=112), national training systems from
frontline ECD workers (N=182), and for program delivery (N=242) (see Figure 22). This trend reflects
several factors. First, since UNICEF did not explicitly address early stimulation and responsive care
programming until 2017, the institution is in the early stages of translating these concepts into practice.
Thus, there is more information about what UNICEF is trying to do and less information about the results
of these efforts at this time. This trend also reflects UNICEF’s strategic decision to shift from service
provision to system strengthening. Another reason this trend might exist is related to the need for UNICEF
to demonstrate results for children with governments. As a result, UNICEF has focused its efforts on
supporting governments to train frontline workers and in program delivery to gain buy-in for early stimulation
and responsive care programming before it can convince governments to improve the enabling environment
for ECD. Finally, other factors such as the availability of suitable measures for assessing parent outcomes
and child impacts, UNICEF CO human and financial resources, country context variables, and priorities are
likely contributing to this trend in the data from the document review.

101. UNICEF has a strong comparative advantage for multisectoral programming when compared to
other international development agencies that focus on young children because the organization
includes all sectors in its programming goals and workstreams. However, there is a lack of
programme coherence and understanding of UNICEF HQ’s desired approach to multisectoral
programming for ECD hampers progress. Multisectoral programming requires collaboration around
opportunities for mutually reinforcing strategies across the sectors, which UNICEF has accomplished to
some extent through integrated strategies and tools, such as the Early Moments Matter Campaign, the
Care for Child Development Package, and the Nurturing Care Framework. Multisectoral programming also
requires clear sectoral objectives for the early childhood period in order to inform programme convergence.
For example, global efforts in ECE point to promising practices on defining the learning needs of children
0-8 years through a clear conceptual framework and blueprint for systems strengthening aspects of the
pre-primary subsector using standardised diagnostic tools.
102. However, UNICEF’s investments in integrated ECD on a global level do not correlate with results
for frontline workers, parent, or child outcomes and impacts on a country level (see Annex C, Table
34). This finding is very significant, because without evidence on the situation of young children, UNICEF’s
system strengthening work is less effective. This finding is primarily related to 4 factors: (1) a lack of a
common measurement framework, systems, and tools to assess changes in frontline worker capacities,
parent outcomes, and child development that are associated with early stimulation and responsive care
programming; (2) weak national systems and resources to monitor and evaluate the impact of early
stimulation and responsive care programming; (3) the absence of well-designed randomised controlled

trials, and (4) the absence of direct behavioural measures of parent and child outcomes using standardised
assessments that are brief, reliable, validated, and culturally appropriate. Evidence from child protection
provides a good practice to consider for a specific sector, including the articulation of parenting programme
strategies that have demonstrated a reduction in harmful practices, as well as clear measures for assessing
the impact of these programmes, However, UNICEF does not have strong evidence on the impact of
integrated ECD packages on parental early stimulation and children’s development, and many questions
remain on what mix of interventions are operationally feasible and effective in development, humanitarian,
and fragile contexts.
Theme 2: System Strengthening
103. Overall, the evaluation found substantial evidence of UNICEF’s leadership and contributions in supporting
governments to establish coordination mechanisms required for multisectoral programming. Some
evidence was found on UNICEF’s leadership in promoting a strong enabling environment for ECD, but gaps
and challenges remain in developing and implementing integrated ECD policies. Some evidence of
UNICEF’s leadership to promote national training systems for frontline ECD workers was identified, but
gaps remain in the monitoring and supervision of these workers. There was limited evidence on UNICEF
contributions to public financing for ECD as a basis of system strengthen, but this is a new area for the
organization.

104. The analytical framework46 against which the subsequent evaluation questions were evaluated recognises
that strengthening sectoral and multisectoral policies and systems for ECD and the capacity to scale the
delivery of programmes and services can be achieved through:
● Strengthening government’s capacity to, or assisting government, to generate evidence on the
need for early stimulation and responsive care programmes.
● Contributing to the development and drafting of policies, legislation, and national plans.
Contributions can include leading and participating in forums, committees, providing technical
inputs to these documents (either directly or through consultants).
● Drafting new or revising existing curricula for ECD programmes and pre-service training of
frontline workers that engage with parents. Developing new or revising existing training
programmes used in pre-service training of frontline workers that engage with parents.
● Strengthening sectoral capacity to advocate for and mobilise funding for programmes by
developing their capacity to quantify resource requirements and propose appropriate funding
mechanisms for the phased implementation and/or expansion of programmes.
● Assisting government to revise and adapt existing regulations, procedures and processes to
institutionalise practices and procedures required to deliver ECD programmes and services.
This can include procedures and regulations related to planning, budgeting and human
resource management.
● Piloting programmes to demonstrate their effectiveness and test how service modalities can
be incorporated into government service delivery systems.
105. The contributions required will depend on the context, informed by the existence of policies in relevant
sectors, the sophistication of training systems, the degree to which human resource policies and practices
are formalised, the extent of decentralisation in the allocation of roles and responsibilities, and the presence
of revenue and expenditure assignments.
3.5 Enabling Environment
EQ 2.1 – How has UNICEF supported governments in the delivery and the scaling up of early stimulation
and responsive care services through relevant sectors? Do countries have the required legal, financial, and
institutional arrangements, as well as policies and sectoral plans, to support the delivery and scaling up of
early stimulation and responsive care? What was UNICEF’s contribution in establishing these?
● Key Finding:
• UNICEF makes significant contributions to the development of policies and national ECD plans,
but few COs focus their support on strengthening systems to scale up early stimulation and
responsive care programmes.
106. UNICEF is more involved in higher level policy work, than activities required to support government
in the delivery and scaling up of programmes. A majority of UNICEF COs support rather than lead policy

63
development activities associated with ECD (see Figure 23). The number of mentions of activities core to
strengthening the scaling up of programmes in the document review, namely “coordination mechanism and
systems” and “public finance” are much lower than references to other activities (see Annex B, Figure 5).
There are only 46 passages of text out of 2,000 referring to “coordination mechanisms and systems” and
40 referring to “public financing”. This in comparison to 112 passages to “enabling environment”. These
numbers suggest that country offices work on higher level activities related to the enabling environment,
but not the specific factors that contribute to the functioning of the bureaucratic systems involved in actual
delivery.

107. Except for LACR, the majority of countries had no national ECD policies and implementation plans,
but UNICEF is working towards this objective. In 2018, 60 (38%) of the countries reported having a
national ECD policy, which is lower than the target of 85 set by UNICEF (see Figure 24). In 2018, 45
countries (27%) reported having national multisectoral ECD action/ implementation plans, of which 42 were
developed with support from the UNICEF country office, underscoring the critical importance of UNICEF’s
work in this area (see Annex C, Table 23). WCAR is a notable outlier as 9 (38%) of the countries have a
national ECD policy, but only one has an ECD implementation plan.
108. Notable findings from the document review include the following. In EAPR, UNICEF China provided
technical inputs to key national guidelines, policies and laws, including the drafting of the Early Childhood
Care and Education Law. In Lao UNICEF supported the development of the draft early childhood education
policy and the pilot of a Mother and Early Childhood Grant. In ESAR, UNICEF contributed to the
development of national ECD policies in Uganda and Rwanda, and in Kenya, UNICEF provided technical
support to the education sector which led a process to develop a cross sectoral ECD policy. In LACR,
UNICEF Chile was working to leverage a National Plan of Action for Children and Adolescents to shape
policies for ECD services. In MENAR, UNICEF has supported national governments to plan and implement
frameworks and strategies that expand the coverage of education policies to include one year of mandatory,
universal pre-primary education or kindergarten. In ROSA, UNICEF Sri Lanka played a key role in
developing the National Preschool Education Policy, led by the National Education Commission. UNICEF
supported the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MOWCA) in developing a National Policy for Child Day-
Care Centres, complementing the National Guidelines for Child Day-Care Centres introduced in 2017. In
WCAR, UNICEF expressed a desire to leverage education sector and social protection policies, but no
results were reported due to challenges associated with weak governance systems.

3.6 Coordination Mechanisms and Systems
EQ 2.2 – Do countries have the required coordination mechanisms and systems in place with all relevant
stakeholders and sectors to deliver an essential package of ECD and early stimulation and responsive care
programs? What was UNICEF’s contribution in moving countries forward in these areas?
● Key Finding:
• Many UNICEF COs make valuable contributions to multisectoral coordination through their
participation and, in some countries, joint leadership of ECD coordination committees.
109. UNICEF’s technical support and convening power have facilitated the establishment of coordinating
bodies that promote cross-sectoral planning at the national and decentralised levels for early
stimulation and care services (see Annex B, Table 11). In ESAR, UNICEF Kenya worked with the Ministry
of Health to coordinate a technical working group and other stakeholders to develop a road map and
implementation plan for the Nurturing Care Framework and develop an Integrated ECD policy framework.
In Rwanda, UNICEF’ played a key role in developing the National ECD Programme (NECDP), which seeks
to coordinate actors and provide strategic direction to multisectoral ECD programming inclusive of health,
nutrition, WASH, social and child protection, and education. The NECDP established 20 positions across
the thematic areas which are financed by central government. In ECAR, UNICEF Georgia provided
65
technical and financial support to the government and municipalities for improving horizontal and vertical
coordination and capacity for the implementation of the Law on Early and Preschool Education and Care
(EPEC) and related national standards. In LACR, UNICEF Colombia prepared a Comprehensive Child Care
Analysis Guide for national coordinating bodies to strengthen the co-responsibility of mayors in the local
planning process. UNICEF Honduras has focused on establishing a body to oversee the creation of efficient
mechanisms for interinstitutional and cross-sectoral coordination for integrated ECD services. In MENA,
UNICEF Palestine has played a significant technical and coordination role in facilitating the engagement of
relevant sectoral ministries, UNWRA, and the World Bank. This has involved facilitating regular meetings
of the inter-ministerial national and sub-national committees to build a sustainable system for ECD related
services. In WCAR, evidence of UNICEF efforts to strengthen coordination capacity were found in 2014
and 2017 reports, but there was no evidence of results in 2019.47 In ROSA, UNICEF Nepal supported the
National Planning Commission (NPC) to develop draft national ECD strategy (2019-2030). This strategy
will help to improve collaborative efforts among the relevant ministries and stakeholders to ensure holistic
early childhood development.
110. UNICEF’s membership and role in coordinating intersectoral committees varied by country and
depended largely on the closeness of the relationship between UNICEF and the relevant ministry.
Where UNICEF has a close relationship with the ministry their role on the committee can include co-chairing
the committee, scheduling and coordinating meetings. These roles enable UNICEF to influence who is
invited and what items are put on the agenda for discussion. Where UNICEF merely participates in the
committee, they are able to use that presence to keep issues on the policy agenda and be aware of
opportunities to make technical inputs into policy and planning processes. Notable examples of close
relationships are UNICEF Rwanda which co-chairs the National ECD Committee with the National ECD
coordinator; UNICEF Jordan has a partnership agreement with the National Council for Family Affairs and
also supports the council financially. UNICEF Serbia established informal intersectoral groups and an ECD
Services Advisory group that includes officials delegated by key ministries. UNICEF Mali is on the ECD
Action Network with government, the World Bank, and Save the Children.
3.7 Public Financing
EQ 2.3 – Is there adequate, efficient, and equitable public financing for ECD, and for early stimulation and
responsive care programmes in particular? What has been UNICEF’s contribution to strengthening
government capacity to prioritise ECD in the relevant budgets, and to allocate and spend funds efficiently,
equitably, and effectively?
● Key Finding:
• UNICEF COs lack the capacity and technical knowledge needed to support line Ministries to
mobilise and ensure the equitable allocation of public funds to ECD programmes, and to evaluate
the efficient and effective use of such funds.
47 In WCAR in 2014, UNICEF Mali reported that its efforts to strengthen coordination capacity at national and regional levels resulted
in the revitalization of a national ECD coordination platform, as well as functioning regional ECD coordination mechanisms. In 2017,
Mali was selected by HQ, WCAR, and the World Bank to pilot the ECD Action Network, by the establishment of national inter-ministerial
coordination mechanisms. However, no activity was reported on these efforts in 2019 reports. In Senegal, a multisectoral group
(Education, Health, Nutrition, Protection, Decentralization, Economy and Finances) was established in 2017 on a national and regional
level to address the lack of synergies in the delivery of services in community preschools and to institutionalize the integrated approach
into 20 villages.
66
111. Only a few UNICEF country offices have the expertise and/or competencies in budgeting, public
finance management and costing needed to advocate and lobby for public funding. To lobby for
funding and make specific recommendations about how early stimulation and responsive care programmes
should be funded it is necessary to understand the funding mechanisms and budgeting processes related
to the services and be able to work closely with the Ministry of Finance. Less than 25% of the COs felt that
strong relationships with the Ministry of Finance are relevant to taking programmes to scale.
112. Other notable findings from the survey include the following (see Figure 25 and Annex H for more detailed
analysis). At most, 24% of the COs developed, or attempted to develop, an in-depth understanding of the
budgeting mechanisms in the country to enable them to advocate for funding effectively. Fewer than 30%
of COs helped government officials to prepare budget bids or memos about funding of early stimulation and
responsive care programmes. Fewer than 15% of COs have hosted workshops on funding issues; only
12% of COs have assessed or made recommendations on the modalities for including private funding of
early stimulation and responsive care programmes. 24% of COs have assessed funding channels for early
stimulation and responsive care programmes. 37% of 54 COs have costed their own pilots and only 12 of
these costed them in sufficient detail to be useful for informing resource allocation. 52% the COs indicated
they have costed government programmes, of which 15 indicated there was follow through with and/or use
by the line Ministry that could potentially impact on resource allocations for the relevant programmes. Only
5 out of these 28 COs indicated they had engaged with the Ministry of Finance on the costing.

113. Good practices regarding costing, public finance management and leveraging observed in the case
study countries show how varied the type of support that is required. UNICEF Jordan has a long and
close working relationship with government and has seconded an official to government to provide technical
support. The CO has a good understanding of public finance management arrangements, and so has
helped ministries prepare work plans and advised on resource requirements. The CO estimated the unit
costs for the parenting programme to help line Ministries prepare budgets for the programme. UNICEF
Rwanda supported the development of a national ECD policy and 5-year Strategic Plan that were costed
and endorsed in 2016. These documents outline cross-sectoral interventions in health, nutrition, WASH,
education, child protection and social protection. When the CO helped to establish a coordination structure
in the line Ministry, the government created a separate budget line for it, which lead to resources being
available for policy development activities. The CO has also started working with local governments to build
their capacity to plan and budget for ECD. UNICEF Thailand, as part of their demonstration ECD project,
built the capacity of selected local authorities to plan and budget for the programme so that these funding
arrangements could be replicated in other local authorities. Also, the Social Policy Unit is working with the
67
Ministry of Finance and the Parliament Budget Office to build capacity to improve public finance reporting
on children. UNICEF Serbia prepared a costing of a kindergarten programme that was used to prepare a
request for a loan from the World Bank, which is currently funding the roll out of a UNICEF supported
programme. UNICEF Paraguay developed a method for tracking expenditures on children, which was
adopted by the General Budget Office of the Ministry of Finance.
114. UNICEF COs provided technical support to governments to cost education sector plans, which
include early stimulation and responsive care (see Annex B, Table 12 and Figure 15).48 In ESAR,
UNICEF Kenya supported county-level governments with budgeting for integrated ECD plans that commit
local funding to improve these services. UNICEF Uganda worked with the UNHCR, the Office of the Prime
Minister and the Ministry of Education to develop a national Education Refugee Response plan that includes
ECD services in six refugee-hosting districts in the West Nile. In WCAR, information for 2019 indicates that
all five COs covered by the document review were supporting the development of Education Sector Plan
(ESP), and specifically ensuring the inclusion and costing of preschool education in these plans. The key
drivers for these changes were UNICEF’s leadership, technical support, and evidence-based advocacy on
the need for early learning and school readiness in their countries during the education sector planning
processes with government representatives. In EAPR, UNICEF Lao is working with partners to influence
education policy, and advocate for increased investments in equitable early childhood and primary
education and develop a national costed action plan for early childhood education.
115. Only a few UNICEF COs provide evidence that their work has contributed to leverage increased
government budgets for early childhood education programmes (see Annex B, Table 12). These
countries are Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, South Africa, and Rwanda. On the other hand, UNICEF has
successfully leveraged partnerships to mobilise substantial financial resources for early stimulation and
care services in certain countries through bilateral and multilateral donors. Most of the evidence on
UNICEF’s efforts to influence public financing for early stimulation and care services discusses what the
COs are currently doing as well as challenges in this area of work, rather than the results of these efforts.49
3.8 National Training Systems for Frontline Workers
EQ 2.4 – Are service providers and frontline workers across relevant sectors that engage with young
children and families adequately trained and supported to deliver early stimulation and responsive care
interventions and quality services? Are early stimulation and responsive care programmes adequately
staffed, equipped, managed, harmonised and monitored? What was UNICEF’s contribution in these areas?
● Key Finding:
48 Other notable efforts on costing sector plans included the following. In ECAR, Tajikistan reported UNICEF’s support
to the government on developing transparent financial mechanisms for early childhood education through a budget
brief and costed scenarios within the State Programme on Preschool Education 2020-2025. In MENA, the State of
Palestine reported UNICEF support for a costed communication for development (C4D) ECD Strategy developed jointly
with adolescents with disabilities and families with children with disabilities, endorsed by the Ministry of Social
Development (MOSD) to improve early stimulation and responsive care practices among parents.
49 For example, in LACR, Honduras reported contributing to strategic and integrated planning and budgeting so that
the Honduran State would be in a strong position to deliver 15 identified early stimulation and care services in a timely
manner. Chile reported its contribution in modifying the subsidy system for preschool education to promote universal
service care for early childhood. There was no evidence of public financing for early stimulation and responsive care
programming in MENA, most likely due to the protracted conflict in the region.

• UNICEF COs’ monitoring and evaluation activities mostly focus on measuring the reach of
programmes (e.g., the numbers of children reached), rather than contributing to the development
of systems that can be used to monitor and manage the activities of frontline workers to ensure
programmes are implemented with fidelity.
116. Most UNICEF COs contributed directly to building the capacity of frontline workers, through
regional training or trainer of trainer programmes. Various UNICEF CO have supported the design and
implementation of capacity development workshops for decision makers, service providers, and
practitioners who work with or support frontline workers (see Annex B, Figure 16). Other efforts included
providing governments with the technical assistance to design standards related to ECD centres, preschool
teachers, parenting programmes, and children’s early learning and development, as well as efforts to
improve or strengthen the national education curriculum.
117. The content of UNICEF-supported frontline workers trainings covered: core information on ECD practices
for health and education practitioners (such as in Serbia, Jordan, and Palestine); how to provide parenting
support in refugee camps (such as in Jordan); how to engage parents through home visits (such as efforts
led by the ESARO); positive parenting and discipline (such as in Paraguay and Palestine); how to address
the unique needs of children with disabilities, children living with HIV and tuberculosis, and children in
remote rural areas (such as in Tajikistan); the training of preschool teachers in national curriculum and
standards (such as in Georgia, Serbia, Uganda, and Mali); a comprehensive teachers instruction manual
(Sri Lanka); and supporting the development of training materials for frontline volunteers and caregivers
and the ‘Child-Friendly Kindergarten’ programme (in China);
118. As regards assisting with the actual provision of training, UNICEF Lao assisted with providing continuous
professional development support at provincial, district and school/community levels and the revision and
piloting of pre-primary teacher’s guidebooks. UNICEF Thailand provided training in holistic ECD and
developed a facilitators’ manual for ECD caregivers incorporating early learning and development
standards. UNICEF Timor-Leste provided training to preschool facilitators. UNICEF India provided training
to master trainers, supported professional teacher development on supportive supervision / monitoring and
enhanced assessments, and provided training on interpersonal communication skills.
119. UNICEF’s work on developing national curricula for early stimulation and responsive care
programming primarily targeted preschool and kindergarten education and included technical
support in the design of the curricula as well as the preparation of guidebooks and resources for
practitioners. These efforts helped to ensure that early stimulation and responsive care, specifically play-
based teaching and learning, parenting programmes, and the unique stimulation and care needs of bilingual
children and children with disabilities, were integrated into the different curricula.50
120. Only a few UNICEF COs contributed directly to the development of new curricula. From the
documentary evidence and the written responses in the survey it would seem that only ten COs in the
sample contributed to the development or revision of curricula related to early stimulation and responsive
care services. UNICEF Rwanda commissioned the drafting of a Parenting Curriculum (2019). UNICEF
50 Globally, around 30% of countries have a policy environment that supports mother tongue/ multilingual education in
some form, however there are significant differences between regions (see Annex C, Table 26). For example, while in
2018 in SAR 88% of countries report to have a policy environment that supports mother tongue/ multilingual education,
only 5% of countries in MENAR report so. Globally, in 2017 and 2018 around 30% of countries had human and material
resources that supported mother tongue/ multilingual education in some form, which represented a drop from 2016
(41%) (see Annex C, Table 27).
69
Serbia developed the Years of Ascent Curriculum for preschools, and modules for training home nurses
were added to the pre-service training curriculum. UNICEF Jordan made changes to the KG curriculum to
include parental engagement (not yet rolled out) and UNICEF Thailand developed training modules and
the curriculum for the training of ECD workers.
121. Very few UNICEF COs took steps to develop or strengthen the systems in government required to
professionalise and develop a national workforce for early stimulation and responsive care. Only 13
sampled UNICEF COs participated in the development of minimum competency standards and/or career
pathways for the early stimulation and responsive care workforce and 10 CO were involved in developing
key performance indicators for monitoring the work of frontline workers. The survey assessed the extent to
which COs supported ministries to appoint a professionalised workforce for early stimulation and responsive
care programmes. Activities included identifying management capacities required and presenting these in
an organogram, preparing job descriptions of management required, helping government to approve new
posts and helping government get posts funded. At best, only 30% of 54 COs engaged with these activities
at a level required to make an impact.
122. UNICEF COs’ monitoring and evaluation activities mostly focus on measuring the reach of
programmes (e.g., the numbers of children reached), rather than contributing to the development
of systems that can be used to monitor and manage the activities of frontline workers to ensure
programmes are implemented with fidelity. There was little evidence in the document review that
UNICEF has supported governments to monitor and certify frontline workers. The survey and case studies
suggest only 15 COs contributed to the development of systems with this capacity.
123. Some good examples are noted in the case study countries. UNICEF Thailand contributed to the
development of the system that was used by the NGOs responsible for implementing the programme. This
system was later adopted by some local authorities when they took over responsibility for the programme.
UNICEF Jordan developed a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system (Bayani) for the programmes
provided through their Makani centres. UNICEF Serbia helped the Ministry of Education and institutes to
improve the system for self and external evaluation of the preschools and supported the development and
piloting of monitoring instruments for home visiting services that nurses use. The office is currently
supporting the digitisation of the monitoring systems. UNICEF Rwanda developed a system for monitoring
ECD which can be rolled out as funding becomes available. UNICEF Paraguay has planned the
development of a monitoring system.
Theme 3: Programme Quality and Impact
124. Overall, the evaluation found substantial evidence that UNICEF-supported early stimulation and responsive
care programmes were well designed. There is some evidence on programme delivery and scaling, but
gaps and challenges remain in relation to the strength of multisectoral programing. There is limited to no
evidence on programme quality of implementation or on programme impact.

3.9 Program Delivery
EQ 3.1 – What are the range of interventions or programs being supported by UNICEF in early stimulation
and responsive care? Is their reach and coverage adequate and equitable?
● Key Findings:
• UNICEF has focused its efforts primarily on public ECD programmes, working with governments to
deliver parenting and early learning programmes. UNICEF is reaching some of the most
marginalized child populations, but it is difficult to assess the adequacy of programme coverage.
Many COs reported that there is a strong focus on children with disabilities, children living in
poverty, children in remote/hard to reach rural areas, children in poor urban areas, and children
from marginalised cultural or ethnic groups
125. Typology of Programmes. The evidence from the document review indicated that UNICEF has primarily
focused its efforts on public early learning programmes and parenting programmes. Community
programmes were also common, however, while humanitarian programmes were only applicable in some
71
of the countries. The institutional survey confirmed 69 UNICEF supported parenting programmes across
52 COs, and that UNICEF supported early learning programmes were present in 52 COs. About 40% of
the parenting programmes (28 out of 69) were associated with Care for Child Development, while a majority
(60%) were stand-alone programmes (not associated with an existing ECD or ECE package). Results from
the secondary data analysis, which were based on a larger sample, showed that 33 (21%) of 157 COs
reported supporting ECD programmes in humanitarian settings (see Annex C, Table 30), reaching 266,529
children in formal or non-formal early learning/pre-primary education through UNICEF-supported
programmes (Annex C, Table 30).
126. Current Status of Programmes. Globally, the number of children enrolled in UNICEF-supported early
learning programmes has grown exponentially by more than 60 percent, from 673,835 in 2016 to 1,096,060
in 2018 (see Annex C, Table 29), and the secondary data analysis revealed that it was common for UNICEF
to support governments in more than one type of early stimulation and responsive care programmes (see
Annex B, Figure 17 and Table 14). In addition, 68% (107 out of 157) of COs reported that in 2018, they had
integrated two or more different ECD interventions and delivered them as a package (Annex C, Table 21),
far exceeding the Strategic Plan (2018-2021) target of 16 COs. Globally, there was a drop in community
engagement associated with multilingual education, from 51% of COs reporting community engagement in
some form in 2016 to around 25% in 2017 and 2018 (see Annex C, Table 26).
127. Government Partners. Of the 69 UNICEF-supported parenting programmes reported in the institutional
survey, 61 (88%) received contributions from the Ministry of Health, 51 (74%) from the Ministry of Education,
29 (42%) from the Ministry of Social Protection, 24 (35%) from the Ministry of Child Protection, and 9 (13%)
from the Ministry of Finance. A majority of parenting programmes (61%) received contributions from two or
more ministries. Ghana, Honduras, the Republic of Moldova, Rwanda, and Serbia engaged five ministries
in their parenting programmes. These contributions were made through financing, training of frontline
workers, creation of curricula, provision of supplies/resources, monitoring/certification, etc. For the 52 early
learning programmes, 33 (63%) received contributions from the Ministry of Health, 52 (100%) from the
Ministry of Education, 21 (40%) from the Ministry of Social Protection, 13 (25%) from the Ministry of Child
Protection, and 21 (40%) from the Ministry of Finance. A majority of the reported early learning programmes
(79%) also received contributions from two or more ministries. China, Kenya, the Republic of Moldova,
Rwanda, and Cuba engaged five ministries in their early learning programmes.
128. Implementing Partners. The implementers of community-based programmes included parents
themselves (through peer and participatory learning), as well as community leaders, ECD practitioners, and
faith-based organizations (see Annex B, Figure 18). In WACR, a good example is Ghana, where parents
have been trained in play-based teaching, child protection, health promotion, and malaria prevention. In
Senegal and Mali, parents have been empowered to serve on ECD centre management committees,
alongside educators who teach parents about nutrition and psychosocial stimulation practices. In EAPR,
COs increased access to pre-primary education both through conventional classroom-based programmes
and through community-based and alterative early learning programmes. China piloted community-based
ECD centres and Lao rolled out a community-based school readiness (CBSR) programme in hard-to-reach
remote communities. It should be noted that UNICEF was also involved as a direct service provider,
especially in lower income countries and in the delivery of humanitarian programmes.
129. Targeted Beneficiaries. The institutional survey data indicate that a majority of UNICEF-supported
parenting programmes (59%) are open to parents of all children in the country (see Figure 26). However,
many COs reported a strong focus on children with disabilities (48%), children living in poverty (57%),
children in remote/hard to reach rural areas (61%), children in poor urban areas (48%), and children from
marginalised cultural or ethnic groups (41%). A similar pattern of results was seen for UNICEF-supported
72
early learning programmes (see Figure 27), with the exception of humanitarian settings where more children
were reached by early learning programmes than through parenting programmes (46% vs 29%). In this
sample of 54 COs, there was little regional variation in the child age targets of parenting programmes and
early learning programmes, although it is worth noting that for some regions the sample included few COs
and may not be representative of the whole region (range: 2 to 13).

130. Most parenting programmes target parents of children ages 6 years and younger, but focus
primarily on infants and toddlers. For example, the institutional survey indicated that nearly all parenting
programmes (87%) address parents with infants and toddlers (see Figure 28). By contrast, early learning
programmes supporting children’s school readiness are generally focused on preschool age and
kindergarten age children. Similarly, for public education, community-based, and humanitarian settings,
the focus of the early learning programmes is on preschool and kindergarten age children (see Figure 29).
Across the 54 COs, there was little regional variation in the age and child groups that are the focus of
parenting programmes and early learning programmes.

131. In EAPR, early learning programmes have focused upon access to pre-primary education,
implementing integrated ECD packages, and supporting community-based programmes. In terms of
access to early learning programmes, 12 out of 14 COs reported net enrolments in pre-primary education
over 50%, and 6 COs report 80% or higher. At least 11 COs are implementing integrated ECD packages
combining health, parenting, stimulation WASH, and/or nutrition. A growing number of countries now focus
on the youngest children, “First 1000 Days”, with 11 of these COs piloting or designing integrated
ECD/parenting packages. The reviewed documents show that UNICEF delivers community programmes,
early learning programmes, and parenting programmes. In Lao, for example, the community-based school
readiness (CBSR) programme promoted greater demand creation, where Village Education Development
Committees, trained with UNICEF’s support, played a critical role in community and parent mobilization,
which realised enhanced community ownership and mutual accountability. There is limited evidence,
however, that UNICEF-supported programmes have a beneficial impact on frontline workers, parents, or
children.
132. In ECAR, improving access to preschool education and home visiting were the key strategies for
supporting families to provide nurturing care to young children. Serbia leveraged resources to scale-
up implementation of inclusive, quality preschool services in partnership with the Ministry of Education and
the World Bank. These achievements created a platform for wider reform of preschool education led by the
74
Ministry aimed at the expansion of 17,000 preschool spaces, benefiting a total of 48,000 children. In
Kyrgyzstan, UNICEF provided technical support to the Government of Kyrgyzstan for the introduction of
Child Development Centres to reach the Government target of 80% coverage and reach, as an alternative
early learning opportunity for young children and to promote nurturing, positive parenting across the
country.
133. In ESAR, there was evidence of early learning programmes, parenting programmes, and
humanitarian programmes. Kenya reported that pre-primary enrolment increased due to its efforts in
supporting the government to make gains in reaching remote areas and disadvantaged communities. In
Uganda, UNICEF support for 7,450 ECD centres reached more than 211,000 parents and 350,000 children
with school readiness parenting programmes, including more than 6,000 children with disabilities and
113,000 refugee children. In Rwanda, a form of Care for Child Development reached about 10,000 families
through home visitation to improve the home environment for optimal child development. Humanitarian
programs were found in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. In Rwanda, UNICEF continued to provide ECD
response to children at the Mahama Refugee camp which is hosting people from Burundi. A total of 5,481
children aged 3-6 years received integrated ECD services at the camp (2,813 boys and 2,668 girls). In
addition, 893 children under 3 years of age received early stimulation, nurturing care, and learning in 72
home-based groups (495 boys; 398 girls). A total of 723 frontline workers were trained to provide integrated
and quality ECD services (359M, 364F). The annual target of 300 was exceeded due to the change in
approach from the use of paid to volunteer frontline workers, which called for an increased number of
frontline workers who work on a rotational basis. In Uganda, in refugee-hosting districts, 110,775 refugee
children (50% girls) were enrolled in pre-primary education, constituting 61% of eligible refugee children in
these districts. Sixty-two per cent (target 25%) of ECD frontline workers in 27 focus districts were trained
according to national standards.
134. In LACR, the focus has been on parenting programmes, early learning programmes, and community
programmes. The LACRO has provided substantial internal and external support for the roll-out of Care
for Child Development in the region and as a result, all of the countries in our document review sample
were implementing parenting programs. The LACRO has emphasised the need to address children with
disabilities in the provision of early stimulation and care services. Paraguay reported extensive work on
supporting children with disabilities to access early childhood programs and services, and in ensuring the
government implements preschool programs, especially in areas of exclusion. Honduras reported working
on increasing coverage of early learning with the Education Secretariat through three delivery models:
home education, education in community centres and education schools. Chile reported working on
integrating information on young children’s development into existing education programs to improve their
quality.
135. In MENAR, there was more evidence in the document review on early learning and parenting
programmes, and limited evidence on humanitarian programmes. In Jordan, the Makani (My Space)
programme provided an integrated package of services reaching 20,000 children and over 42,000
caregivers through the Better Parenting Programmes. UNICEF Jordan also introduced the Zero-to-Three
Programme (for parents and children from birth to 3 years old; the Parent and Child Programme (including
an Early Learning Readiness component for parents and children 4-5 years old) to stimulate the
development of young children and ensure that children’s social and cognitive readiness for school is
enhanced. In 2018, 57,078 parents benefited from the parenting sessions. Jordan also made considerable
progress towards realizing the rights of the country’s 4 million children. During the 2018/2019 school year,
84% of children aged 4-5-year enrolled in kindergarten, and in 2019 the CO supported 3,798 children (50%
female) with pre-primary education. In the State of Palestine, UNICEF has supported the MoE to implement
a strategy that extends service availability and improves programme quality to raise awareness on the early
75
detection of children with developmental delays and improving the learning environment in public
kindergartens.
136. In SAR in 2019, ROSA prioritized primary health care (PHC), and adopted a multi-sectorial approach
bringing together health, nutrition, ECD, and communication for development (C4D), and supported
COs help provide PHC at the community level. Although there is little evidence in the reviewed document
that UNICEF is working on strengthening public financing for early stimulation and care services within the
region, UNICEF has supported curriculum development and the training of frontline workers at 2,501 ECE
centres enrolling 77,201 pre-primary aged children (61% girls) in 2019. In Nepal, UNICEF is promoting use
of early learning and development standards (ELDS) through summative and formative assessments and
is supporting the Education Review Office (ERO) on national assessments based on ELDS. The Education
Review Office is sampling 10-15 districts per year and has assessed 40 districts to date. ROSA also
supported the development of policy and systems for ECE, non-formal education (NFE) such as alternative
learning pathways, and education management information systems. As a result, a total of 302,192 out-of-
school children (55% girls) gained access to pre-primary, formal and non-formal education through direct
UNICEF support. Disparities exist in access to preschool, however, with children in rural regions seeing
less attendance
137. In WCAR, the focus has been on early learning and multisectoral packages that address children’s
holistic development, as well as community-based and humanitarian programmes. Mali reported its
multisectoral programming strategies reached 50,000 children living in regions affected by conflict who
benefited from access to education, including cognitive and psychosocial activities, parenting education
and the construction of ECD centres. UNICEF Mali’s C4D strategies led to an increased demand for
services through the “Mama Yaleen” model (parents training other parents), which grew from 1,600 to 4,000
parent trainers who reached more than 300,000 parents with ECD messages. In Senegal, the 2012-2018
CPD indicated that enrolment rates for primary education increased as a result of the introduction of
preschool classes in two of the poorest regions in the country. In Niger, the 2019-2021 CPD told a similar
story, that UNICEF advocacy efforts to promote preschool enrolment contributed to increased enrolment in
primary school by 3%. In Ghana, Niger, and Senegal, parenting education programs have been a
component of community-based preschools and ECD centres. There is evidence that Senegal, Mali, and
Niger have implemented Care for Child Development. School readiness has been the focus of parenting
education in Niger, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Mali. In Ghana, parenting education programs focused on
violence prevention in 2014.
3.10 Programme Design
EQ 3.2 – To what extent do UNICEF-supported interventions correspond to evidence-based good
practices? What was UNICEF’s role in creating and supporting these interventions?
● Key Findings:
• UNICEF supported early stimulation and care programmes have adopted evidence-based
practices, with the exception of encouraging children’s agency and promoting autonomy-supportive
parenting and teaching.
76
138. The document review revealed that programs were designed to promote early stimulation and
responsive care (41% of 101 passages of text), to promote the holistic delivery of ECD services
through multisectoral packages (37%), and to convey important information about ECD practices
(22%) (see Annex B, Figure 19 and Table 15). For the institutional survey, UNICEF staff respondents were
provided with a list of 18 “best practices” in parenting (based on the scientific literature on parenting and
ECD, and consistent with the Nurturing Care Framework),51 and asked whether the practice is included in
the ECD programmes they support. All of these practices are examples of components of nurturing care
such as responsive caregiving and opportunities for early learning, although some of them (e.g., supporting
children’s developing sense of autonomy and agency by giving children choices, and respecting their
opinions, while still remaining “in charge”) are not explicitly mentioned in UNICEF’s messaging on the topic.
139. The number and percentage of parenting programmes (out of 69) for which COs endorsed each best
practice (i.e., reported that the practice was included in the programme) is shown in Figure 30. The most
highly endorsed practices (90% endorsement or more) are shown in bold, and the least endorsed (75% or
less) are shown in red. All 18 of these best practices were endorsed by a majority of surveyed COs
(59% of the country offices or more). Five of the practices were endorsed by a large majority (90% of
more) of COs. These highly endorsed practices correspond to UNICEF’s efforts to raise awareness
regarding (1) brain development (2) play-based interactions, (3) discouraging use of corporal punishment,
(4) age-appropriate play and learning materials, and (5) parental warmth. Apparently, UNICEF messaging
regarding these five practices has been well received and is reported by COs to be part of the large majority
of ECD programmes.

Data Source: Institutional Survey, N=54
140. In contrast, 6 practices were endorsed by only 75% or fewer COs (see Figure 30). These include: (1)
providing children with developmentally appropriate challenges, (2) providing children with just enough
help, (3) encouraging parenting consistency, (4) providing children with age-appropriate problems to solve,
(5) support for autonomy and agency, and (6) promoting socialization. These least endorsed items all reflect
the importance of autonomy-supportive parenting, which has been shown to promote children’s healthy
development, in both more individualistic and in more interdependent cultures,52 53 54 as well as across
levels of socioeconomic status within a culture.55
141. Autonomy support refers to a set of behaviours that help children develop a sense of agency, and
consequently, a willingness to accept challenges and solve problems: (1) providing children with the
appropriate amount of help for their skill level (i.e., scaffolding, providing “just enough” support); (2)
encouraging and appropriately praising children; (3) taking children's perspectives; and (4) providing
children with choices and following their lead. The most versus the least endorsed practices might also
differ from one another in a variety of other ways (e.g., it may be more difficult to introduce unfamiliar
practices to parents, or the practices themselves might vary in difficulty), but a review of UNICEF’s
messaging about responsive parenting, such as the Nurturing Care Framework and The Lancet series on
Advancing Early Childhood Development: From Science to Scale (2017), reveals that although this
messaging emphasises the importance of both responsive caregiving and opportunities for learning
(stimulation, including play), it does not specifically address autonomy supportive practices. Consequently,
it seems likely (although not certain) that the importance of autonomy-supportive practices is not well as

well understood among COs and frontline workers, and therefore not as likely to be emphasised in
programme design.
142. COs were also asked about best practices included in any early learning programmes they support. As with
the parenting programmes, Figure 31 indicates practices endorsed by 90% or more of the COs (shown in
bold) were considered the most highly endorsed. The most highly endorsed practices concerned (1) brain
development, (2) play-based interactions, (3) age-appropriate play and learning materials, (4) age-
appropriate play and learning materials, and (5) praise, attention, and encouragement. These are all key
features of the Nurturing Care Framework. Given the overall high levels of endorsement, practices
endorsed by 80% or fewer (shown in red) were considered the least endorsed. These practices included
four different forms of autonomy support: (1) providing children with just enough help, (2) serve and return
interactions, (3) discouraging teaching that is psychologically coercive, and (4) support for autonomy and
agency. Decades of research on autonomy-supportive teaching has established clearly that it supports
academic engagement and achievement, as well as other important developmental outcomes.56 As with
autonomy-supportive parenting, this research shows that autonomy-supportive teaching has similar effects
across both more individualistic cultures and more interdependent cultures.57 The document review
indicates although UNICEF has promoted responsive caregiving, it has not specifically emphasized the
multicultural importance of autonomy support. UNICEF could usefully place a greater emphasis on
practices related to autonomy support not only in parenting programmes, but also in early learning
programmes.

3.11 Programme Scaling
EQ 3.3 – Are UNICEF-supported programmes taking the necessary steps to ensure interventions can be
scaled (e.g., developing a theory of change and M&E framework, designing appropriate curricula and tools
for training frontline workers, embedding interventions into existing sectoral programmes and platforms.)?
● Key Findings:
• Very few of the programmes that UNICEF pilots are designed to be taken to scale because the
focus is on proving effectiveness rather than on developing an understanding of what it takes to
institutionalise the programme in government systems.
143. There was limited evidence in the document review on UNICEF’s efforts to support programme
scaling, despite making this a goal in certain regions and countries (see Annex B, Figure 21 and Table
16). Most of the information indicated that UNICEF has considered scaling preparedness and costing more
than the country context, or programme norms and standards. In ESAR, UNICEF has supported
governments to prepare for scaling the “Let’s Play” by providing them with the tools to plan, implement, cost
and evaluate the project with support from IKEA. UNICEF Kenya supported the costing of “Let’s Play” with
a to supporting scaling it in the future. UNICEF Rwanda has relied on the strong enabling environment that
has been formed through the National ECD Policy which aims to increase access to ECD services by 45%
in 2024. They have worked through communities to mobilise awareness and demand for services, since
ECD services only reach 1% of children ages 0-3 years. LACRO reported the continued scaling of Care for
Child Development through existing government sectors. UNICEF Paraguay mentioned the need to be
actively engaged with municipal-level actors as a mechanism for scaling proven programs. The CO also
reported that scaling was a challenge in terms of being able to reach the most marginalised groups,
including indigenous children, children living in rural areas and children with disabilities. UNICEF Senegal’s
CPD for 2019-2023 indicates that if multisectoral or integrated approaches such as ECD are to be scaled
up, sectoral roles have to be clarified and guidance included in national policies and Strategic Plans.
144. Programme materials provided have been codified in some detail and it appears the information
and knowledge required to replicate the programmes elsewhere are embedded in the materials. The
COs that responded to the survey questions about the extent to which features of the programmes they
supported had been codified during the design phase of the project indicated that 75% or more of the
workforce and programme management dimensions and 71% or more of the programme features had been
codified. The features that were codified the least were physical spaces and facility standards, which most
80
likely reflects that many of the UNICEF supported programmes built capacity in existing delivery systems
as opposed to piloting a standalone intervention.
145. Few UNICEF COs: (a) provide support over a long enough time period and (b) work on the kinds of
systems issues required to embed programmes in the processes of government bureaucracies that
are responsible for scaling the programmes. Over 80% of 54 COs feel that factors that sit in their policy
development comfort zone such as strong technical expertise in early stimulation and responsive care;
strong relationships and regular communication with the line ministries and strong relationships with the
community stakeholders are important for scaling. However, less than half of 54 COs feel that technical
expertise on public administration, decentralisation and public finance were important to scaling, even
though all of these contribute to strengthening systems required to take programmes to scale. This finding
reflects a lack of knowledge on the part of UNICEF staff on what taking a programme to scale involves.
Similarly, only 41% of 54 COs indicated that intergovernmental arrangements had influenced the design of
their programmes. UNICEF Jordan has worked with government to embed its Better Parenting Programme
into government programmes, which has enabled wide-scale training. UNICEF Serbia developed a
comprehensive plan to roll out training on the new preschool curriculum and leveraged funding to implement
the 4-year plan. In contrast, COs in Rwanda and Thailand developed comprehensive training packages,
but provided them only in selected geographic areas; however, UNICEF has demonstrated that these can
be replicated elsewhere.
146. Communication for Development (C4D) campaigns are an important scaling mechanism, but COs
need to take further steps to achieve nationwide reach. UNICEF Thailand and Paraguay developed
websites where the public can access material. Whether this material is accessed at scale depends on the
effectiveness of communication campaigns, access to and use of social media and whether frontline
workers or public officials referred parents to the websites and materials. UNICEF Thailand has agreed
with the Ministry of Health to include references and links (e.g., QR codes) to UNICEF’s website in materials
that government distributes through clinics, including the health card that is given to every parent. It is not
clear that these COs have a plan in place to workshop the materials with all parent facing officials. Within
the C4D programme, UNICEF Rwanda has helped the National Children’s Commission (NCC) to design,
develop, and implement ‘Let us Raise Children in Families’. There are about 30,000 Izus (community
member elected as a “friend of the family”) in the country, and UNICEF intends to use the Izu network to
promote child protection issues, early stimulation, and ECD programmes.
147. Despite the limited examples of UNICEF supported programmes being taken to scale, some good
practices were observed. Successful scaling requires an implementation plan that is comprehensive and
scheduled over multiple years. The roll out of the Years of Ascent curriculum in Serbia includes a detailed
and comprehensive four-year plan, which is fully funded. To scale programmes across the country it is
essential to understand policy implementation at the decentralised level. UNICEF Thailand, through their
ECD demonstration centres, demonstrated how to implement a programme within existing structures and
budgets at a decentralised level. The experience in UNICEF Jordan shows that through long-term and close
working relationship with government, including seconding an official to government, it is possible to fully
embed UNICEF programmes into government programmes and budges. UNICEF Serbia worked with two
ministries to formalise the competencies and expectations of the workforce by changing the “Rule Books”
for nurses and preschool teachers, which regulate the roles and responsibilities of frontline workers.
Perhaps most important is the recognition that achieving impact and roll out at scale requires focused long-
term support which UNICEF Serbia and Jordan have provided.
148. Partnering with the private sector is a cost-effective opportunity for achieving impact, but few
UNICEF COs have strategies to engage with the private sector. UNICEF Rwanda developed a “Private
81
Sector Engagement Strategy” aimed at establishing linkages between local businesses, nutrition projects
and ECD centres. Business, especially in the tea sector, were sensitised on the Children’s Rights and
Business Principles and the importance of ECD and establishing child-friendly workspaces. This is a low-
cost way to expand access to programmes, especially in countries with industries that employ large low
and semi-skilled workforces. Surprisingly, this was not a strategy identified elsewhere. The private sector
must be viewed as one of the implementing partners of parenting programmes.
3.12 Programme Quality of Implementation
EQ 3.4 – Are UNICEF-supported early stimulation and responsive care programmes being implemented
as intended (with fidelity) and according to parenting and early learning and development standards? What
are the challenges associated with implementation? How and to what extent have they been addressed?
● Key Findings:
• There was almost no evidence of efforts to ensure programme fidelity. Fidelity is the extent to which
frontline workers adhere to the protocol for programme delivery. Measuring fidelity is a key feature
of implementation research, and is essential for determining the impact of the programmes on
parents and children.
149. There is limited evidence of UNICEF’s efforts to improve the quality of early stimulation and
responsive care programming, which focused primarily upon improving frontline worker capacity
and setting affordances, such as the construction of ECD centres and the provision of play and learning
materials (see Annex B, Figure 20 and Table 17). Most evidence on frontline worker capacity suggested
efforts to increase awareness of ECD, play-based facilitation skills, responsive care skills, and classroom
management skills. In 2016 globally 83% of 157 COs reported to be working on the quality of the teaching
and learning environment for early learning (see Annex C, Table 32). For 2017 and 2018 this number was
a bit lower, 73% and 77% respectively. However, most regions rated the quality of the teaching and learning
environment between ‘weak’ and ‘initiating’. ‘Weak’ means that: (a) the teachers are not trained on child-
centred pedagogy; (b) a curriculum has not been formally approved and whatever exists is not based on
child standards; (c) classroom material lists do not exist and thus age-appropriate books, toys/play things,
and learning materials are not available for preschool classrooms; (d) there are no standards for the design
of classrooms/centres that ensure adequate learning space; and (e) parent participation is not encouraged
and is at best extremely limited.
150. There was almost no evidence of efforts to ensure programme fidelity, or the extent to which
frontline workers adhere to the protocol for programme delivery. Measuring fidelity is a key feature of
implementation research,58 and is essential for determining the impact of the programmes on parents and
children. High quality tools for the assessment of fidelity are freely available, and can be adapted easily to
the implementation of specific programmes. On the institutional survey, none of the 52 COs with
parenting or early learning programmes indicated that UNICEF supported the assessment of
frontline workers; 23 COs reported that UNICEF has not assessed frontline workers, and 29 COs

82
did not reply. The document review only yielded one mention of programme fidelity. High quality fidelity
data are essential for supporting frontline workers to deliver programmes as planned, and for using
evidence to refine and improve programmes.59
151. A recent global evaluation of UNICEF’s Early Childhood Development Kits for Emergencies underscores
the importance of monitoring programme fidelity.60 An estimated 142,235 ECD kits were procured by 104
Country Offices from 2009-2018, benefitting approximately 7,111,750 children. The global evaluation had
three primary findings: 1) using the kits in non-Western cultures and in low-resource settings requires
context-specific local adaptations to ensure the relevance of the play opportunities for children, their
parents, and caregivers; 2) the presence of an ECD enabling environment, the safe integration of play
opportunities into ECD programming, play affordances, and caregiver training were all important factors
shaping the effectiveness of the ECD kit interventions; and 3) without appropriate frontline worker and
parent training and high fidelity of implementation, children will not fully benefit from these play opportunities
due to the challenges caregivers face when introducing toys into emergency or low-resource settings. An
overarching finding was that parents were not fully considered in the design and use of the ECD kits in
practice. When parents were involved in making locally relevant toys, case studies found that COs reported
that children improved their cognitive, social, and emotional development as a result of play activities, and
caregivers reported reduced stress levels in both children and themselves.
3.13 Programme Impact
EQ 3.5 – Are selected early stimulation and responsive care programmes having a demonstrable effect on
caregiving practices and children’s development, especially for the most vulnerable children, including
children with disabilities?
● Key Findings:
• With few exceptions, monitoring of children’s developmental status has not been integrated into
programming practices with support from frontline workers, programmes have not been evaluated
using controlled designs and relevant measures, and relevant data have not been integrated into
a secure data management system.
152. There are virtually no outcome data concerning (1) frontline workers’ knowledge about ECD and (2)
frontline workers’ practices. The limited data that do exist (e.g., from Thailand) suggest that frontline
workers who participate in ECD programmes show increased knowledge about ECD. Data concerning
outcomes for parents and children are also limited. Moreover, all available parent and child outcomes data
are based on parents’ reports of their own practices or children’s behaviour, and generally do not include
comparisons with parents and children who do not participate in the programmes. For example, in Jordan,
War Child Holland collected data from parents receiving interventions in refugee camps, and found that
after the interventions, parents reported increased knowledge about ECD and an acceleration of their
children’s development. This evidence is promising, and it is consistent with the possibility that the

interventions are effective, but in the absence of an appropriate comparison group, these findings could be
attributed to the passage of time, placebo effects, and/or demand characteristics. A good example of a well-
designed study is the World Bank-supported Quality for Preschool Impact Evaluation 2017.61 This could be
used as a model for future evaluations.
153. The document review revealed that many COs reported challenges associated with programme
coverage and a lack of data for monitoring and evaluation. UNICEF Kenya reported a lack of
appropriate data to assess progress with implementing the Competency-Based Curriculum and National
Pre-Primary Policy and indicated that departments responsible for providing children’s services still operate
in silos. In Uganda, data on ECD services for children 0-3 are not available, and coverage is skewed
towards urban areas, there are few trained teachers, and there is a lack of clarity on appropriate curricula.
UNICEF Uganda also indicated a lack of sectoral planning, monitoring, and data systems to effectively
coordinate and track progress in the integration of relevant interventions within and across sectors. UNICEF
Rwanda also mentioned that data collection on the management of ECD centres is limited to periodic
studies or surveys through the Demographic Health Surveys, which are too infrequent to assess progress,
and focus on children’s physical health. UNICEF Rwanda reported that most parents still lack skills and
knowledge to provide nurturing care related to a lack of education and cultural norms and practices.
154. Overall, there is very limited evidence that any UNICEF-supported ECD parenting programmes have
a measurable beneficial impact on either parents (see Annex B, Figure 22 and Table 18) or children
(see Annex B, Figure 23 and Table 18). The document review found that only 9 COs had MICS data
associated with early stimulation and responsive care; only 3 are planning a new round of MICS data
associated with the ECD module. These MICS data are better suited as baseline measures at the
population level because they were collected during the previous UNICEF Strategic Plan (2014-2017)
before the organization made early stimulation and responsive care an explicit goal. Some parent outcomes
were reported in six countries (Serbia, Rwanda, Chile, Colombia, Jordan, and the State of Palestine), and
primarily focused on support for learning (63% of 32 passages of text), and less on the home environment
(25%) or parent engagement in ECD centres (12%). Child outcomes were reported in five countries
(Kyrgyzstan, Serbia, Tajikistan, Colombia, and Senegal), and primarily focused upon school readiness
(attending one-year of preschool) (52% of 31 passages of text), and less on children’s cognitive
development (26%) or children’s social emotional development (22%). As discussed in below (paragraph
121), most measures used to assess child outcomes are inadequate in their scope and
developmental sensitivity (also see Annex C, Figure 26, 27, 28, and 29).
155. The milestone for this Strategic Plan period is that by 2021, 74% of children will be receiving early
stimulation and care. Twelve of the 31 (39%) countries with data have already met or are close to
meeting the Strategic Plan 2018-2021 target, reporting that 70% or more of parents provided early
stimulation and responsive caregiving. A total of 10 countries (32%) had fewer than 50 percent of
children receiving early stimulation and responsive caregiving and will likely not meet the target for the
Strategic Plan 2018-2021. These countries are located in ESAR and in WCAR. In the case study, the
Thailand CO supported an evaluation of 751 parents/guardians at 27 ECD centres to assess whether they
believed the programme was helpful, and to assess parent’s reports of what has changed. The vast majority
of parents reported that the training was “useful” or “very useful,” that they had learned about ECD, and

Effectiveness, 12(1), 10-37.
84
that they had changed their parenting practices.62 This information is useful and shows that the programme
has promise, but in the absence of baseline measures and a comparison group, it remains difficult to know
whether parents actually changed their practices or merely believed they had, and to what extent their
responses reflect experimenter demand (e.g., a desire to meet the experimenters’ expectations).
156. The evaluation found no reported use of reliable, validated, standardised, direct behavioural
assessments to measure children’s developmental status. Globally, only 16 out of 48 countries with
data on children’s developmental status had a MICS ECDI of 80% or more (which is the target set for this
indicator) (see Annex C, Figure 32). Countries with the highest percentage of children who are
developmentally on track are located in EAPR, ECAR, LACRO, and MENAR. MICS is useful at the
population level, and for some children (between 36-59 months only) it provides information on
children’s home and ECD environments (e.g., attendance in ECE programmes; being left alone for more
than an hour; availability of books and toys in the home; having an adult engage activities to promote
learning and school readiness in the last three days).
157. However, MICS indicators of children’s development are inadequate as potential measures of
programme efficacy and impact. The MICS measure of children’s school readiness is based on a single
question about whether children in the first grade of primary school attended preschool during the previous
school year. At the population level, it is indeed important to know about enrolment in preschool, but at the
level of individual children, preschool attendance does not in fact provide a measure of school readiness—
whether children have sufficient early literacy, numeracy, and executive function skills to function effectively
in kindergarten. Rather, the MICS measure simply assumes that preschool was effective in ensuring
children were ready for school, which is a dubious assumption. In addition, the criterion of “Developmentally
on track in 3 out of 4 domains” is a weak standard; it means children may be delayed in 1 out of 4 key
domains, which is problematic from a holistic (whole child) view where all domains are essential and interact
over time. The criteria for being on track in a domain are also inadequate. For example, children are judged
as being on track for learning if they are reported by parents to do at least one of only two things: (EC11)
Does (name) follow simple directions on how to do something correctly? and (EC12) When given something
to do, is (name) able to do it independently? Parent responses to these questions cannot be used to
determine whether children’s learning skills are “on track,” let alone to measure programme impact.
158. Only two countries were identified as employing integrated data management systems, and both
are middle-income countries. These include Jordan, which uses a comprehensive monitoring and
reporting system (Bayani) for its ECD programmes, and Thailand, which uses a nation-wide system (the
Developmental Surveillance System, or DSS) for developmental screening and monitoring. The DSS that
includes 116 items covering five developmental domains, including executive function skills, administered at 5
ages between 9 and 54 months. These secure data management systems are important for iteratively and
rapidly improving programmes through developmental evaluations, and have the potential to make a major
contribution to scientific understanding of human development globally. Most scientific knowledge about
children’s development is based on very limited samples of children that do not adequately reflect the global
majority.63 UNICEF has a unique opportunity to coordinate the collection of data globally and thereby
greatly expand scientific understanding of the range of variation in children’s development as a function of
context.

159. In summary, data regarding frontline worker, parent, and child outcomes are not being collected in
a way that allows for the assessment of fidelity of implementation and programme efficacy. Most
studies, with few exceptions, do not use the best available behavioural assessments of children’s
development. What is needed are direct behavioural assessments that are brief, reliable, validated,
standardised, and normed. An example is the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery, which is administered on a
computer tablet, and is currently available in a wide range of languages, such as French, Spanish, Arabic,
and a variety of African languages, including Swahili and Dholuo.64 Moreover, and equally important,
programme evaluations are not designed as randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which is absolutely
necessary in order to measure program efficacy and to determine whether UNICEF-supported ECD
programmes have any measurable beneficial effect on children’s health and development. Finally, data that
are collected are not integrated into secure data management systems, which is an enormous missed
opportunity.

CHAPTER 4: CONCLUSIONS, LESSONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
4.1 UNICEF’s Global Leadership
Objective 1: To assess the internal coherence and effect of UNICEF’s global leadership in early childhood
development.
● EQ1: To what extent is UNICEF positioned and prepared to lead and support governments and partners
in strengthening systems to deliver and scale early stimulation and responsive care programmes? What
impact has UNICEF’s leadership had on the field of ECD, international development agencies,
evidence regarding ECD, and in communicating the importance of early stimulation and responsive
care to governments, implementing partners, and development agencies?
● Summary Finding: UNICEF has had a substantial global impact on raising awareness about the
importance of investing in early childhood; however, it is only somewhat prepared to lead governments
in strengthening systems to deliver and scale early stimulation and responsive care programmes.
● Explanation of Results: UNICEF is in the early stages of translating an integrated ECD agenda into
practice. UNICEF’s work on early stimulation and responsive care has not been sufficiently defined,
codified, or integrated into the current Strategic Plan and results framework in a manner that supports
effective multisectoral programming, especially as it applies to the role of parents in accelerating results
for children. Institutional investments in human and financial resources and in the management and
coordination structures that are necessary for effective multisectoral programming have not kept pace
with the awareness and demand for ECD that has been generated by UNICEF.
● Implications: These deficiencies place UNICEF at a disadvantage in maintaining the momentum that
has been built externally with governments and with community members to scale integrated early
stimulation and responsive care programming. If left unaddressed, UNICEF risks losing its comparative
advantage as a global leader for ECD and in achieving results for young children.
160. Promising Results. UNICEF has generated substantial awareness and demand for ECD on a global,
regional and country level across a wide range of international and national development stakeholders.
This demand was strongly associated with prioritization of ECD within the UNICEF Strategic Plan, and with
a combination of advocacy, systems strengthening, and partnership and resource mobilization strategies.
The organization has positioned itself as a global leader for ECD – as an agenda setter, technical expert,
convener, and humanitarian responder. UNICEF is the only UN multilateral agency that encompasses all
sectors required for integrated early stimulation and responsive programming, placing it in a unique position
to advocate for a multisectoral approach to promoting developmental outcomes in early childhood.
161. Challenges to Progress. Institutional investments in human and financial resources and in the
management and coordination structures that are necessary for effective multisectoral programming have
not kept pace with the awareness and demand for ECD that has been generated by UNICEF. The
organization has not sufficiently codified and defined its work in ECD in a manner that supports effective
87
multisectoral programming, especially as it applies to the role of parents in accelerating results for children.
These deficiencies place UNICEF at a disadvantage in maintaining the momentum that has been built
externally with governments and with community members to scale integrated early stimulation and
responsive care programming. If left unaddressed, UNICEF risks losing its comparative advantage as a
global leader for ECD.
Lesson #1: Advocacy is foundational to government buy-in and is crucial for the scaling
and the sustainability of ECD programmes.
162. Government buy-in is a prerequisite for government funding and government-led coordination of ECD
programmes (‘government in the driving seat’). In order to secure buy-in, it is crucial to advocate with
the government from the beginning and to work to position ECD high in their agendas and to tailor
advocacy strategies with key stakeholders. However, global tracking of the Early Moments Matter
campaign did not continue beyond 2017, when an evaluability assessment found that more than 2 billion
people were reached globally through this campaign, raising an estimated USD 12.8 million for UNICEF
supported ECD programmes. Thus, it is not possible with existing data to articulate the total reach of
UNICEF’s advocacy efforts for ECD, and what impact occurred beyond prioritizing and raising awareness
about ECD. As the main strategy that runs in parallel with other UNICEF change strategies, greater
investment in monitoring and evaluating advocacy is required. This is especially important to ensure
UNICEF’s effective engagement with the private sector and related business for results initiatives, such as
in Rwanda. UNICEF needs to be able to tell the story of change achieved through this foundational strategy.
Lesson #2: Public-private partnerships are seen as a conduit to facilitate national
dialogue on early stimulation and responsive care programming and for accelerating
results for children.
163. Partnerships with line ministries/ key ECD players were an important factor for securing
government buy-in, and for influencing government policy and commitment to early stimulation and
responsive care programmes and services. Partnerships with the World Bank and with the private
sector played an important role in resource mobilization, and in achieving results for children.
Successful fundraising by COs helped improve programme delivery and quality. However, on a global level,
there is some evidence that UNICEF has had challenges in managing its partnerships with UNESCO and
the WHO when it comes to accountabilities for ECD. Namely, there have been challenges associated with
roles and accountabilities for SDG monitoring, which UNICEF has thus been able to maintain. However, a
recent shift in global corporate priorities to focus equally on adolescent development has led some global
public and private partners to wonder if UNICEF is still serious about ECD. This perception has slowed the
ability of ECD managers to advance the agenda.
Lesson #3: A multisectoral approach is key for at scale programming for children.
164. For the multisectoral approach to work, effective coordination is essential. Effective multisectoral
programming is seen to be the most challenging strategy to implement. For successful
implementation, COs stressed the need to set realistic timelines and goals: ‘realistic integration’ (identify
and accept limits of integrated effort based on mandates and “capacity comfort zones” of actors; to have
clarity on the roles of actors (UNICEF internal and external); and to secure the buy-in of the role-bearers
through advocacy. An important part of effective coordination is the use unified assessment tools and
88
evidence from the different sectors. Other aspects for improving multisectoral programming have been
noted above.
Recommendation #1: UNICEF should update its conceptualisation of multisectoral ECD
programming to include an explicit articulation of parents’ role in accelerating results for
children in the early years by clearly articulating shared results and accountabilities
among sectors.
165. Key components in the re-conceptualization of the multi-sectoral approach would be to clearly define the
common agenda and mutually reinforcing activities for ECD, design a shared measurement system for
ECD, and increase investments in the backbone function and continuous communication platforms required
for coordination and management across the sectors.
166. The integrated ECD agenda is represented by the synergistic indicator SDG 4.2.1 – that all children ages
8 and under are developmentally on track and reaching their full potential. This common agenda, something
to strive for, has been firmly placed on the international development agenda because of UNICEF’s global
leadership. There is currently no shared measurement system for early stimulation and responsive care
programming, or for ECD more broadly, although this evaluation has provided a retroactive theory of
change to represent what this system looks like right now and where it might go in the future. Multisectoral
programming requires clear sectoral objectives and a common measurement framework that identifies
synergistic outputs and outcomes for systems, frontline workers, parents, and children. For thematic
programme convergence, it is strongly recommended that UNICEF advocate for the use of the ECDI as the
integrated impact indicator for all of UNICEF’s work for this period of development. Similarly, it is highly
recommended that UNICEF make synergistic parenting outcomes more explicit by acknowledging the role
of parents in accelerating results for children in the next Strategic Plan.
167. Overall, UNICEF’s work in multisectoral programming is ‘weak’ or ‘emerging’ in status for the majority of
COs, and there is a lack of a common measurement framework to assess the added benefit of this approach
for programme outputs, outcomes, and impacts. These activities are represented by UNICEF’s sectoral
work for ECD. Each workstream is important for its unique contributions to children’s physical, cognitive,
and social-emotional development, but the power is in the synergistic potential of these mutually reinforcing
programme activities. Each goal area should explicitly identify the intended outcomes for parents and
children under 8 that are associated with their relevant sector activities. Opportunities for programme
convergence should be identified and backed by evidence or research that suggests robust synergistic
outcomes are likely to be observed.
Recommendation #2: UNICEF should clarify its budget and allocation for ECD
programming and further mobilise additional resources for ECD programming (for 0 – 8
years olds, across all sector) at all levels of the organisation and ensure that the budget
for ECD programming is transparent and inclusive of all organisational investments.
168. Internally, the UNICEF ECD Section is providing the backbone function for cross-sectoral programming on
a global level through various approaches, including Matrix Management. However, this management
approach requires strengthening and formalization within RO and CO staff roles, accountabilities, and work
streams. On a regional and country level, the backbone function sits in different sectors, primarily education
or health. These staff members should be of sufficient professional grade to ensure the necessary technical
skills are in place to effectively manage collaborative planning processes. Internally, the Matrix
89
Management approach for ECD has provided this platform for continuous communication. Externally,
UNICEF’s efforts to promote global, regional, and country level networks for ECD have served in this
function to some extent to promote continuous communication across the sectors and diverse actors
working in this space. It is worth noting also that the UNICEF ECD section is a small team managing big
demands, and needs resourced, sustainable human resources, with predictable flexible funding in order to
continue this backbone function.
4.2 System Strengthening
Objective 2: To analyse UNICEF’s contributions and effectiveness in strengthening national capacity and
systems to implement and scale early stimulation and responsive care programs and services.
● EQ2: To what extent has UNICEF supported governments to strengthen sectoral and multisectoral
policies and systems for ECD, including national capacity to scale the delivery of early stimulation and
responsive care programmes and services?
● Summary Finding: UNICEF Country Offices have made a significant contribution in supporting
governments to strengthen sectoral and multisector ECD policies, but have made a far smaller
contribution to strengthening national capacity to scale the delivery of early stimulation and responsive
care programmes and services.
● Explanation of Results: UNICEF COs do not have the required capacity to work on the issues and
systems required to assist governments to put policy into practice. Approaches to the scaling of
programmes vary, from demonstrating a package of services and their effectiveness to working closely
with government to support scaling of programmes to institutionalising new practices and/or
programmes.
● Implications: These deficiencies place UNICEF at a disadvantage in supporting governments to scale
high-quality and sustainable early stimulation and responsive care programmes and services, and slow
progress on achieving results for young children.
169. Promising Results. UNICEF’s contributions to policy development have been providing technical advice
and guidance on evidence generation. Most UNICEF COs are active members of ECD committees and
other ECD related technical workgroups, with some playing leadership, convening and coordination roles.
UNICEF’s membership on these committees provides opportunities to strongly influence the issues that
are kept on the ECD agenda in some countries, and in others participation ensures that UNICEF country
offices are aware of policy issues and opportunities to make contributions. There are a few examples of
good practices by UNICEF in piloting early stimulation and responsive care programmes and then building
on the pilot to support governments to take the programme to scale. These COs have demonstrated the
effectiveness of their interventions, as well as provide long term support and adaptability needed to put
policy into practice.
170. Challenges to Progress. UNICEF COs, with a few exceptions that are worth observing, do not position
themselves to provide long-term support and guidance to government or develop the knowledge of
government systems required to put policy into practice.
90
Lesson #4: Once national level strategies and policies are in place, the focus of
UNICEF’s work needs to shift to system strengthening and the scaling of programmes.
171. To paraphrase, one of the respondents “UNICEF does not only work for the capital, we work for the children,
especially the most vulnerable in hard-to-reach areas”. This requires an active effort to ensure programmes
are scaled-up and implemented with fidelity across all regions of the country. UNICEF needs to develop
the internal arrangements to support implementation of programmes at scale. There are a few phases
involved in taking a policy from an idea, to a pilot and into a programme that is implemented and sustained
at scale by government. Five phases, with indicative timelines, are proposed in Figure 20.

172. In order to achieve implementation at scale, some phases involve intensive activity for a limited period,
shown by the darker shading, whereas others involve a lot of activity at the start followed by ongoing
technical support and guidance for many years. The picture is presented over a notional 15-year time
horizon, which itself is a recommendation. COs should develop long-term visions of how they will support
scaled implementation. Expanding new programmes in government takes time. It usually takes longer than
10 years for a new programme to be implemented countrywide. COs should identify the capacity in UNICEF
that is needed to support the scaling of programmes over a 10 to 15-year time horizon.
173. UNICEF has strengths in the first three phases, which are creating evidence, developing policies, and using
pilots to demonstrate the effectiveness of policy interventions. However, most COs do not follow up as
91
suggested above and few engage with the next two phases of systems strengthening and implementing
monitoring systems. Once political buy in has been achieved and the policies exist, UNICEF needs to adapt
to engaging with the mechanics and financial arrangements involved in scaling implementation to stay
relevant.
Lesson #5: Donors are more likely to support programmes that are holistic rather than
narrowly focused.
174. ECD requires a multi-donor, multi-sector approach that focuses on 0-8 years. Donors want to know how a
programme will impact across multiple indicators and sectors and they want to know whether there is buy-
in from all the relevant sectors in government. Greater emphasis needs to be placed on the importance of
monitoring processes during implementation that ensures activities are being carried out with fidelity.
Monitoring and evaluation currently tends to emphasise measuring outputs and impacts. This is important,
but not sufficient for managing implementation at scale. To manage implementation at scale, M&E needs
to focus on measuring and monitoring the allocation of resources (financial, human, capital and other
inputs); process variables related to the implementation of the programme to ensure it is being implemented
with fidelity; training inputs and programme output. Measuring the impact of programmes on an ongoing
basis is not practical.
Recommendation #3: UNICEF should develop in-house capacity of ECD staff/team in
public finance for children at all levels of the organisation.
175. UNICEF COs must employ and develop staff with the right technical and analytical skills to manage
system strengthening and scale-up processes. It is one thing to develop a policy, but it is different thing
to build the government systems required to deliver programmes at scale and with fidelity. UNICEF COs
need staff that can move beyond policy, to supporting the development and strengthening of government
service delivery systems. To be effective, these staff need to work in countries for longer periods than is
currently the norm.
176. In larger country offices, there should be staff in the ECD section with the requisite capacities whereas in
the smaller country offices, it will be sufficient for the ECD section to rely on staff in the Social Policy Unit.
The technical capacity referred to includes knowledge to be able to drive public finance management
reforms and public finance analyses; engage with political committees on policy, planning, implementation
and finance issues; develop the systems and institutions need to deliver services, and support processes
to align government human resource strategies and regulations with the needs of scaled-up programmes.
As a minimum, all country offices should have at least one official that is familiar with the 2019 UNICEF
Global Guide for Public Financing for ECD.
177. The skills required to provide value in the first three phases (refer to Figure 20) are very different to those
required for the last two phases. The first three phases require ‘policy minds’ and can be achieved by
applying toolkits, the last two phases require a different set of skills and the same people to be in place for
a long time. It requires understanding how policy objectives fit into government systems, processes, service
delivery arrangements, funding, and reporting arrangements. It also requires understanding when and how
much change government bureaucracies can usefully absorb each year. UNICEF needs to develop these
skills and/or recruit people with these skills and the mind-set that driving through policy changes is a long-
term process.
92
178. UNICEF COs need to develop a better understanding of the public finance management arrangements in
their countries and develop the internal capacity to engage with these issues. It is not enough to say this is
not their niche and that development banks have more technical capacity in this area. UNICEF should rely
on development bank expertise for certain analyses, but UNICEF must have the internal capacity to assess
whether UNICEF’s policy positions are being funded adequately and appropriately. The existing UNICEF
Public Finance for Children (PF4C) guidelines offer substantive guidance in this regard. All UNICEF COs
should have a public finance specialist (only a few COs will need more than one individual) who are able
to provide cross sectoral support to help navigate the budget processes, structure funding modalities that
align with existing government funding arrangements, support carrying through costing exercises, help
ministries prepare budget bids and so on.
Recommendation #4: UNICEF ECD vision, including programme design and
implementation processes should be aligned with the period covered by the strategic plan
with focus on scaling-up and supporting the government to institutionalise, fund, monitor,
and assure the fidelity of implementation of ECD interventions and practices.
179. The institutionalization of systems that outlive people are needed in both UNICEF and many
countries that UNICEF operates in. UNICEF COs must learn how to build long-lasting systems in UNICEF
and learn how to help governments implement systems that outlast political cycles and governments. The
context will determine what is required, but a scaling-up strategy should identify at least the following: how
UNICEF will support the government to institutionalise programmes over the next 10-15 years, indicating
the internal capacity in UNICEF that will provide this support; a plan for how the sector will develop the
human resources required to support scaled implementation indicating what steps will be taken to ensure
the workforce is formally recognised, which training institutions will train the new cadre of workers; UNICEFs
strategy to advocate for and mobilise the required public funding. Existing M&E capabilities need to be
expanded to measure and monitor the allocation of resources (financial, human, capital and other inputs);
process variables related to the implementation of the programme to ensure it is being implemented with
fidelity and training inputs and programme outputs. Staff performance management systems must be re-
oriented away from an annual focus to incentivising staff to support multi-year planning and implementation
support to government.
4.3 Programme Quality and Impact
Objective 3: To assess the relevance and impact of UNICEF’s direct support for vulnerable children,
parents, and frontline workers participating in early stimulation and responsive care programs in low-
resource and emergency settings.
● EQ3: What evidence is there that UNICEF direct support for early stimulation and responsive care
programs are making a difference on a significant scale for vulnerable children, parents and caregivers?
● Summary Finding: UNICEF has not supported adequately designed evaluations of programme
efficacy and impact, and as a result, there is no compelling evidence that UNICEF’s direct support for
early stimulation and responsive care programmes is making a difference for vulnerable children,
parents, and frontline workers.
93
● Explanation of Results: UNICEF does not have the necessary measures, tools, and capacities to
strengthen government monitoring and evaluation of parenting outcomes and child impacts. While
MICS provides population level data to monitor the SDG on children’s developmental status, it should
not be used to evaluate the impact of UNICEF programming in early stimulation and responsive care.
● Implications: The lack of adequate measures and controlled programme evaluations is a major
limitation to the progressive improvement and scaling of these programmes, and it misses an
opportunity to make a more compelling argument for the funding and implementation of the
programmes globally.
180. Promising Results. There was evidence that the design of programmes adopted evidence-based
practices, especially concerning (1) brain development (2) play-based interactions, (3) discouraging use of
corporal punishment, (4) age-appropriate play and learning materials, (5) parental warmth, and (6) parental
support and responsiveness. UNICEF messaging regarding these practices has been well reflected in the
large majority of ECD programmes.
181. Challenges to Progress. UNICEF does not have the necessary measures, tools, and capacities to
strengthen government monitoring and evaluation of parenting outcomes and child impacts. While MICS
provides population level data on children’s developmental status, it cannot be used to evaluate the impact
of UNICEF programming in early stimulation and responsive care. Moreover, with few exceptions,
monitoring of children’s developmental status has not been integrated into programming practices with
support from frontline workers..
Lesson #6: A major limitation to the progressive improvement of ECD programmes is the
lack of adequate evaluations of the benefits of these programmes for frontline workers,
parents, and children.
182. Children’s cognitive, social, and emotional development are not measured directly using standardised
measures of children’s development and parent-child interactions. Evaluations are rarely, if ever, designed
as experimental or quasi-experimental studies, which are essential for establishing efficacy, and outcome
data are generally not integrated into a secure data management system. There is enormous, missed
potential for iteratively and rapidly improving programmes, and for making a major contribution to scientific
understanding of human development globally.
Lesson #7: The engagement of parents is particularly critical for children with disabilities.
183. UNICEF Palestine reported that children with disabilities and their parents often struggle with stigma and
discrimination from those around them, and they also struggle with the challenges of living in a country in
which many aspects of life are impacted by the prevailing conflict. Parents who were included in a UNICEF-
supported study in Palestine reported that they often struggle with the most basic task, such as transporting
their children to receive services, as a result of lack of funding for assistive devices such as wheelchairs,
poorly built or damaged roads, and an inability to pay for transportation services. Nonetheless, parents,
extended family of children with developmental delays and disabilities, and many community members,
leaders, and others all express strong support for the rights of these children to receive an education and
participate in social and cultural life of their communities. A similar situation is found in many low-income
countries.
94
Lesson #8: The outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 had a substantial impact on the
delivery and evaluation of program impact.
184. Asked to what extent COVID-19 has interfered with the delivery of parenting programmes, (96%) of
programmes reported, “A great deal”, “A lot”, and “A moderate amount”. For the 53 early learning
programmes, (96%) of COs reported, “A great deal”, “A lot”, and “A moderate amount”. Programme delivery
shifted to online platforms where possible, and the large majority of COs (87%) indicated that some
adaptations to the programmes as a result of the pandemic, including remote delivery, will be retained
moving forward. For example, Jordan CO is currently developing a parenting portal to provide caregivers
with resources during COVID-19 and beyond. Additionally, online versions of the UNICEF-supported
parenting programmes are being created so that the programmes can be offered both face-to-face and
virtually. An ongoing project for capacity building of preschool teachers as part of the Covid-19 response
includes development of video trainings targeting parenting and focusing on supporting families for
supporting learning through play. Planned evaluations have been delayed or moved online. For example,
in Jordan, War Child Holland reached students online through the KOBO Toolbox,65 a suite of free and
open-source tools for the collection of field data in challenging environments.
Recommendation #5: UNICEF should increase investment in the development,
adaptation, and/or norming and validation of tools for measurement of children’s physical,
cognitive, or social-emotional development.
185. A review of relevant UNICEF documents (e.g., the Nurturing Care Framework) revealed that UNICEF
clearly encourages responsive parenting but does not mention or explain the importance of autonomy
support in particular. Autonomy-supportive practices include (1) providing children with the appropriate
amount of help for their skill level (i.e., scaffolding that provides “just enough” support); (2) encouraging
children to undertake challenges and praising children appropriately; (3) taking children's perspectives; and
(4) providing children with choices and following their lead. It should be noted that autonomy-supportive
practices are not designed to encourage individualism versus interdependence; instead, they are designed
to respect children’s rights to freedom of expression and to education by helping them to develop a sense
of agency and self-efficacy, which increases curiosity and the motivation to learn, among many other
beneficial things. Evidence indicates clearly that autonomy-supportive practices promote healthy
development, including educational achievement, in a wide range of domains and cultural contexts—across
more individualistic and more interdependent cultures, and across levels of socioeconomic status within a
culture.
Recommendation 6: UNICEF should update evaluation strategies and methods to
include innovative, more rigorous, and contextually relevant evaluation designs that can
provide robust evidence base and reliable assessments of efficacy and impact of ECD
programmes on parenting, early stimulation and responsive care.
186. With relatively minimal training, frontline workers who deliver the interventions can assess children's
behaviour directly, using standardised measures. Measures of children’s development should include
direct, behavioural measures of parents’ knowledge of parenting skills, parenting practices, and children’s
65 https://www.kobotoolbox.org/
95
cognitive and social-emotional development. Measures of children’s development should include measures
of important foundational neurocognitive processes and skills, such as executive function, problem solving,
episodic memory, and social understanding. The healthy development of these skills is essential for
learning and adaptation. Without relevant data based on high-quality parent-report tools (e.g., ASQ-3) and
standardised behavioural assessments of children’s development (e.g., the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery),
it is not possible to evaluate the efficacy and impact of these programmes, or even their promise. Such
evaluation is necessary for ongoing programme refinement and improvement, and as a basis and
justification for scaling. High-quality assessment tools are freely available.
187. Target outcomes of most interest (e.g., parents’ actual parenting practices) should be measured using
measures that are standardized, reliable, valid, and developmentally sensitive. With relatively minimal
training, frontline workers who deliver the interventions can assess children's behaviour directly, using
standardised measures. Measures of children’s development should include direct, behavioural measures
of parents’ knowledge of parenting skills, parenting practices, and children’s cognitive and social-emotional
development. Measures of children’s development should include measures of important foundational
neurocognitive processes and skills, such as executive function, problem solving, episodic memory, and
social understanding. The healthy development of these skills is essential for learning and adaptation.
Without relevant data based on high-quality parent-report tools (e.g., ASQ-3) and standardised behavioural
assessments of children’s development (e.g., the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery), it is not possible to
evaluate the efficacy and impact of these programmes, or even their promise. Such evaluation is necessary
for ongoing programme refinement and improvement, and as a basis and justification for scaling. High-
quality assessment tools are freely available.
188. Ideally, these designs would include the random assignment of families or ECD centres to participate either
in target ECD programmes or in another form of intervention (e.g., a nutrition intervention that does not
focus on stimulation and responsive parenting). Without the use of experimental or quasi-experimental
designs, it is simply not possible to evaluate the causal efficacy and potential beneficial impact of these
programmes. Such evaluation is important for ongoing programme refinement and improvement and can
serve as a basis and justification for scaling. Other designs could be considered for countries where it would
be difficult to conduct a well-controlled evaluation (e.g., including an active control condition) due to limited
resources or other challenges (such as humanitarian crises). For example, it might be possible to stagger
the introduction of an ECD programme to two (or more) locations that are similar in other respects (e.g.,
similar in language, culture, and socioeconomic status), such that the programme is introduced first at one
location (Time 1) followed by a period of time (Lag 1), and then introduced at a second location (Time 2).
Parents and children (and caregivers if possible) could be assessed by frontline workers using appropriate
measures just before Time 1 and just before Time 2. All participants could usefully be reassessed after
another period to time equal in duration to Lag 1. Developmental evaluations can also be useful for
programme innovation and scaling, although these designs are not appropriate for summative evaluations
of the efficacy and impact of programmes. Similar in some ways to the research and development (R&D)
process common in the private sector, developmental evaluations often include an iterative series of “micro-
trials with small numbers of children, parents, and practitioners in different settings to facilitate rapid
modification and fast-cycle sharing based on who appears to be benefitting from specific interventions and
who does not.”66
66 Schindler HS et al. (2017). From innovation to impact at scale: lessons learned from a cluster of
research-community partnerships. Child Dev, 88(5): 1435-1446. doi:10.1111/cdev.12904
96
189. This is important for the ongoing evidence-based improvement and adaptation (e.g., to changing
circumstances) of particular programmes, and it facilitates the identification of any problems associated
with these programmes and their participants. Data management systems also facilitate summative
evaluations of programmes, as well as scientific research on parenting, teaching, and children’s
development more generally. Only two countries were identified as employing an integrated data
management system, and both are middle-income countries. These include Jordan, which uses a
comprehensive monitoring and reporting system (Bayani) for its ECD programmes, and Thailand, which
uses a nation-wide system (the Developmental Surveillance System, or DSS) for developmental screening
and monitoring. The DSS that includes 116 items covering five developmental domains, including executive
function skills, administered at 5 ages between 9 and 54 months. Both of these systems represent important
advances in data management that should be replicated, in a coordinated way, across COs. There is
enormous potential for iteratively and rapidly improving programmes, and for making a major contribution
to scientific understanding of human development globally, which is important because most of what is
known is based on very limited samples that do not adequately reflect the global majority.67

Annex B: Document Review Data and Trends
Figure 5 summarises the number of passages of text we coded for each evaluation theme and sub-question
from the document review (labelled EQ1.1 through EQ3.6 in the figure). This figure succinctly summarises
the information contained in the documents and monitoring data (COAR, ROAR, CPDs, and RAM Reports).
Namely, as self-reports, these documents emphasise UNICEF’s global leadership, such as its strategies to
promote early stimulation and responsive care programming. UNICEF has positioned itself as an ECD
expert, policy influencer, capacity developer, and service provider. This trend is clearly seen in the
number of text passages coded for the evaluation questions associated with UNICEF strategies (N=540),
the enabling environment for ECD (N=112), national training systems from frontline ECD workers (N=182),
and for program delivery (N=242).
This trend likely reflects several factors. First, since UNICEF did not explicitly address early stimulation and
responsive care programming until 2017, the institution is in the early stages of translating these concepts
into practice. Thus, there is more information about what UNICEF is trying to do and less information about
the results of these efforts at this time. Another reason this trend might exist is related to the need for
UNICEF to demonstrate results for children with governments. As a result, UNICEF has focused its efforts
on supporting governments to train frontline workers and in program delivery to gain buy-in for early
stimulation and responsive care programming before it can convince governments to improve the enabling
environment for ECD. Finally, other factors such as the availability of suitable measures for assessing
parent outcomes and child impacts, UNICEF CO human and financial resources, country context variables,
and priorities are likely contributing to this trend in the data from the document review.

Annex C: SMQ and RAM Data
See the Global Portfolio Review in Annex A for additional details.
Secondary Data - UNICEF RAM and SMQ Data were analysed using available data from 2014-2018,
including global data on 10 interventions, 13 indicators on outputs, and 9 indicators on outcomes and
impacts (UNICEF MICS data, 2014-2018).
UNICEF Goal Area 1 Special Interventions:
We examined these for 54 CO that were active in early stimulation and responsive care programming and
found the data unreliable; thus, this information is not included in our analysis. Instead, we used our survey
data to better understand these strategies and interventions. A link to a table of these data can be found in
Annex D, Dedoose Coding Manual for reference. The main issue was that CO can select which type of
intervention they are reporting, and this selection did not often match the description, or the connection was
not clear. During results reporting through the RAM tool COs can select which of the listed Goal Area 1
special interventions are implemented by UNICEF; 35 of the reviewed 54 COs indicated to implement
special interventions, though the selection was not always corroborated in the associated reports (see
Figure 24).

Implementation of Goal Area 1 Special Interventions
YES NO
In the current Strategic Plan for 2018, the organization set a goal of reaching 70% of targeted children
through organised programmes that included the ECD kits (Table 20). The number of children under five
targeted to participate in organised programmes with ECD kits (either UNICEF ECD kit or locally procured
set of materials) was met in 2018. Eastern and Southern Africa exceeded its target, reaching 199,209
children versus its target of 183,477 children. The percentages of children who were successfully targeted
is highest in South Asia (reaching 90%), Eastern Asia and the Pacific (reaching 88%), and in Latin America
and the Caribbean (reaching 77%).

Multi-Sectoral ECD Packages
UNICEF’s current Strategic Plan for 2018-2021 emphasises the importance of multi-sectoral ECD
packages, which consist of “at least two interventions that address stimulation for children aged 0-59
months” (such as early learning and nutrition). UNICEF envisages the delivery of a range of integrated
services through strengthened health platforms and a multisectoral approach to health, bringing frontline
workers and families closer to the health systems they rely on, and improving system linkages at the
household, community, and facilities levels. As part of this approach, health platforms for the frontline
delivery of antenatal care, delivery, post-natal care, immunization and HIV prevention, and community
health workers, schools, and childcare centres, provide the opportunity for an integrated delivery of services
that are child-oriented and holistic and offer better value for money (UNICEF Strategic Plan, Theory of
Change Paper, 2018).
Globally 68% (107 out of 157) countries reported to have two or more ECD interventions delivered as a
package in 2018 (Table 21). According to the Strategic Plan 2018-2021 Results Framework, the target for
2018 for this output was 16 countries, which was well exceeded with 107 countries. Eastern and Central
Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean had the highest parentage of countries with ECD packages in
their regions (86% in Eastern and Central Asia, and 81% in Latin America and the Caribbean). Many of
these packages integrated parenting programmes, or training of frontline ECD workers, alongside direct
services to children. Thus, multi-sectoral ECD packages are strongly associated with early stimulation and
care interventions.

However, these countries are in diverse stages of system strengthening on a 6-point maturity scale from
‘weak’ to ‘champion’ (Box 1). The maturity status of most countries is ‘emerging’ with 47 countries, followed
by ‘weak’ with 27 countries, ‘established’ with 16 countries, ‘proficient’ with 9 countries, ‘advanced’ with 5
countries, and finally ‘champion’ with 3 countries (Figure 25 and Box 1). This means that the largest portion
of countries have ‘emerging’ systems to roll out ECD packages, i.e., they have at least two interventions
that address stimulation for children aged 0-59 months adopted by the government, but they are lacking a
costed action plan to scale up under the government's ownership. The data shows that the shift towards
multisectoral ECD packages has clearly gained significant momentum, well in accordance with the targets
put forward in UNICEF’s current Strategic Plan. On the other hand, the fact that the majority of countries
are either in ‘emerging ’or ‘weak’ stages of the implementation of multisectoral ECD packages means that
there is continued need for further support in many countries.
The regionally disaggregated data reveal a maturity range from LACR at the most mature end to WCAR at
the least mature end of the implementation spectrum (Figure 25 and Box 1). In LACR, 14 out of 29 countries
reporting to have ECD packages have ‘established or above’ systems (with four countries reporting to have
‘no data’ on ECD packages). In WCAR however, only 3 out of 16 countries reporting to have ECD packages
have ‘established or above’ systems. The data reveal a regional difference in the coverage of the early
stimulation and care programmes in relation to the need for the programmes. In Eastern and Central Asia,
Eastern and Southern Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean and South Asia, 75% or more of the
countries had two or more ECD interventions delivered as a package in 2018 (Table 21). The Middle East,
and North Africa, and Western and Central Africa, 44%, 60%, and 33%, respectively, had no ECD packages
in 2018.

National ECD Policy Development
Establishing national ECD policies and implementation plans is another critical component of successful
programming, because it creates the appropriate enabling environment for early stimulation and care
services to flourish. UNICEF continues to foster multisectoral and cross-sectoral programming and support
policy, capacity development and systems strengthening to improve the delivery of essential ECD services.
UNICEF’s target for 2018 was that 85 countries have a national ECD policy or implementation plans for
scale-up, up from its target of 67 in 2017. Of the 157 countries surveyed for 2018, 60 report to have a
national multisectoral ECD policy (Table 22). Thus, the target for 2018 was not met. Information about the
contents of these policies are not provided in UNICEF’s monitoring data at sufficient level of detail to make
any claims about how and to what extent national ECD policies take into consideration early stimulation
and care.

Globally 45 countries (27%) reported having national multisectoral ECD action/ implementation plans, and
among these, 42 were supported by UNICEF, underscoring the critical importance of UNICEF’s work in this
area (Table 23). There are, however, 97 and 112 countries without a national multisectoral ECD policy or
action/ implementation plans, respectively. This leaves significant room for improvement during the current
Strategic Plan period. The number or countries without national policies and implementation plans is
particularly high in Western and Central Africa, East Asia and the Pacific, Eastern and Central Asia, the
Middle East and North Africa and South Asia). The 42 countries that have a national ECD
action/implementation plan that was supported by UNICEF will provide useful information on how to
successfully support countries in this domain. However, information about the contents of these plans are
not provided in UNICEF’s monitoring data at sufficient level of detail to make any claims about how and to
what extent they take into consideration early stimulation and care.

Early Childhood Education Policies and Programmes
UNICEF’s previous and current Strategic Plans recognised that education “increases knowledge, sparks
innovation, builds skills that drive nations’ growth and prosperity, and fosters inclusive societies” (UNICEF
Strategic Plan 2018-2021, Theory of Change). But for education to play this role, it must begin with strong
early learning and development foundations. Investment in quality early childhood care and education
produces a double benefit: it is both fair and efficient in achieving learning goals for children; this is
incorporated in the specific SDG target of one year of universal pre-primary education. However, globally
more than half of preschool-aged children lack access to learning and skills development opportunities. In
the current Strategic Plan 2018-2021, there is an increased prioritization of learning, starting with early
literacy and numeracy skills. UNICEF work towards archiving this goal among other initiatives through direct
service delivery, such as the provision of essential learning materials, as well as upstream advocacy for
national early learning policy development and multi-lingual education.
Early learning policies and programmes - In 2017, 171 countries reported they had ‘effective’ early
learning policies and early learning programmes, exceeding the target of 119 set in the Strategic Plan 2018-
2021 (Table 24). However, regional differences in coverage exist; 100% of the countries in Central and
Eastern Asia (21 out of 21) reported having effective early learning policies and programmes in place;
followed by Latin America and the Caribbean, which reported 94% coverage (34 out of 36 countries).

However, the maturity of early learning policies and programmes varies by region from ‘weak’ to
‘championing’ (Table 25). This rating is based upon whether or not a country has early learning curriculum
and standards, appropriate ECCE facilities, and community participation. The data indicate that most
countries have ‘initiating’ and ‘establishing’ early learning policies and programmes. There is no information
on how and to what extent early stimulation and care are integrated into these early policies and
programmes with the data provided through UNICEF’s monitoring system.

Mother Tongue/Multilingual Education Policy Environment – Using a language that the child can
understand is a prerequisite for early stimulation and learning opportunities to be successful. Mother
tongue/multilingual education is hence one intervention to achieve positive learning outcomes (see
UNICEF’s Nurturing Care Framework). No targets were set for this output in the former Strategic Plan 2014-
2017, perhaps because it may not be applicable for each country. The global annual results framework for
Strategic Plan 2018-21 sets targets for the results area ‘learning outcomes’, under which mother tongue/
multilingual education is tracked. However, these targets are not disaggregated by dimensions, thus there
are no specific targets for mother tongue/ multilingual education.
In 2016, 2017, and 2018 COs rated the extent to which the policy environment supports mother
tongue/multilingual education. Globally, around 30% of countries have a policy environment that supports
mother tongue/ multilingual education in some form, however there are significant differences between
regions (Table 26). For example, while in 2018 in SAR 88% of countries report to have a policy environment
that supports mother tongue/ multilingual education, only 5% of countries in MENAR report so.
The maturity of multilingual education also varied by region from weak to championing (Table 9). Eastern
and Southern Africa, Western and Central Africa, and East Asia and the Pacific have the most advanced
maturity among all regions, while the Middle East and North Africa has the least advanced maturity rating.
This rating is based upon the policy environment and its alignment with multilingual education, as well as
resource allocation for multilingual education. No regions reported significant changes in the maturity of the
policy environment for mother tongue/ multilingual education across the monitored three years period.
For most regions the policy environment for mother tongue/ multilingual education is between the ‘initiating’
and the ‘established’ stage. This means that the education sector plan/policy explicitly promotes the use of
135
a few of the children’s mother tongues or of languages children understand in the early grades of primary
education, however, this only allows less than half of concerned children to learn in a language they
understand (‘initiating’). ‘Established’ means that the education sector plan/policy explicitly promotes the
use of all of the most common children’s mother tongues or languages children understand in the early
grades of primary education. This allows the large majority of concerned children to learn in a language
they understand. This is partially reflected in the curriculum and/or implementation plans.

Mother Tongue/Multilingual Education Human and Material Resources - COs further rated the extent
to which human and material resources support mother tongue/multilingual education (Table 27). Globally,
in 2017 and 2018 around 30% of countries had human and material resources that supported mother
tongue/ multilingual education in some form, which represented a drop from 2016 (41%). However, there
were significant differences between regions. For example, while in 2018 in SAR 88% of countries report
to have human and material resources that support mother tongue/ multilingual education, only 5% of
countries in MENAR report so. No region reported significant changes in the maturity of human and material
resources for mother tongue/ multilingual education across the monitored three years period.
For most regions the extent of support of human and material resources from 2016 to 2018 falls between
the ‘weak’ and the ‘initiating’ stage (ECAR, LACR, SAR, WCAR). ‘Weak’ means that instruction in children’s
mother tongue or in a language the children can understand is not reflected in teacher training, recruitment,
deployment, or pupil assessment systems. There is no official support for learning materials to allow for
instruction in children’s mother tongue or in a language they understand. ‘Initiating’ means that instruction
in children’s mother tongue or in a language that children can understand is partially integrated/considered
in at least one of the following: teacher training, recruitment and deployment, and/or pupil assessment
systems. There are prototypes of dedicated learning materials.
Resources are however only sufficient to provide children in model or pilot schools with instruction in their
mother tongue or in a language they understand. In EAPR and ESAR the extent of support of human and
material resources is between ‘initiating’ and ‘established’. ‘Established’ means that instruction in children’s
136
mother tongue or in a language the children can understand is integrated/considered in at least two of the
following: teacher training, recruitment and deployment, and/or pupil assessment systems. There are
dedicated learning materials. Resources are sufficient to ensure that a significant minority of children
receive instruction in their mother tongue or in a language they understand.

Mother Tongue/Multilingual Education Community Engagement - COs also rated the extent to which
there was community engagement for mother tongue/multilingual education (Table 28). Globally, the extent
to which there was community engagement falls between the ‘initiating’ and the ‘established’ stage for the
period 2016-2018. ‘Initiating’ means that local communities and teachers are not engaged, either through
SMCs, PTAs or any similar structure, in setting the curriculum or developing learning materials in support
of instruction in children’s mother tongue or in a language the children understand. ‘Established’ means
that local communities and teachers are sometimes engaged, through SMCs, PTAs or similar structures,
in setting the curriculum or developing learning materials in support of instruction in children’s mother
tongue or in a language the children understand.
In 2018 EAPR rated the extent of community engagement between the ‘established’ and ‘champion’ stage,
up from ‘established’. ‘Champion’ means that local communities and teachers are fully engaged, through
SMCs, PTAs or similar structures, in setting the curriculum and developing learning materials in support of
instruction in children’s mother tongue or in a language the children understand. Globally, there was a drop-
in community engagement from 51% of countries reporting community engagement in some form in 2016
to around 25% in 2017 and 2018.

Enrolment in Early Learning Programmes – Globally, the number of children enrolled in early learning
programmes has grown exponentially by more than 60 percent, from 673,835 in 2016 to 1,096,060 in 2018
(Table 29). These data represent the number of children, in both humanitarian and non-humanitarian
situations, who were enrolled in formal or non-formal early learning/pre-primary education through UNICEF-
supported programmes. The targets for early learning are not articulated in UNICEF’s results framework,
so we cannot assess progress on this indicator, nor do we know how to identify champion countries or
regions given the fluctuation in counts.

humanitarian situations were enrolled in formal or non-formal early learning/pre-primary education through
UNICEF-supported programmes (Table 30). The targets for early learning are not articulated in UNICEF’s

Early Learning Materials - Globally 11,298,748 children were provided with individual education/early
learning materials through UNICEF supported programmes in 2018 (Table 31). The 2018 target was 46.5
million, which has not been met. This finding suggests that children are not being sufficiently supported in
their early learning opportunities, because they lack appropriate materials to support their stimulation. We
also do not know if these learning materials address the age group of this portfolio review (birth to age 5).
If these learning materials are “school-in-a-box” from the Supply Division, this indicator should not be
considered associated with early stimulation and care, as this strategy targets children ages 7 to 19.

Teaching and Learning Environment for Early Learning - The quality of the environment in which early
teaching and learning takes place is a key determinant of successful learning. This includes the training of
teachers in child-centred pedagogy and a holistic curriculum (i.e., it includes components of socio-emotional
learning in addition to pre-academic skills and is based on age appropriate child standard), a curriculum
which is linked meaningfully to the primary curriculum as well as to any curriculum for the youngest learners,
including children 0-3 years of age. It also includes lists of age-appropriate books, toys/playthings and
learning materials, which are available in the majority of classrooms nationwide. Classrooms are designed
as per pre-established standards that ensure adequate learning space. Another important aspect is that
139
there are mechanisms or programmes for engaging parents in pre-primary education, and parents actively
participate in these programs.
The global annual results framework for SP 2018-21 sets targets for the results area ‘learning outcomes’,
under which the teaching and learning environment for early learning is tracked. However, these targets
are not disaggregated by dimensions, thus there are no specific targets for the teaching and learning
environment for early learning. In 2016, 2017, and 2018 COs rated the quality of the teaching and learning
environment for early learning (Table 32). In 2016 globally 83% of countries reported to be working on the
teaching and learning environment for early learning. For 2017 and 2018 this number was a bit lower, 73%
and 77% respectively. There were significant differences between the regions; in South Asia, 100% of
countries are working on the topic, coverage is also high in ECAR, ESAR, LACR and WCAR. EAPR and
MENAR only have a coverage around 50%, leaving room for improvement.

In 2016 most regions rated the quality of the teaching and learning environment between ‘weak’ and
‘initiating’. ‘Weak’ means that the teachers are not trained on child-centred pedagogy. A curriculum has not
been formally approved and whatever exists is not based on child standards. Classroom material lists do
not exist and thus age-appropriate books, toys/play things, and learning materials are not available for
preschool classrooms. There are no standards for the design of classrooms/centres that ensure adequate
learning space. Parent participation is not encouraged and is at best extremely limited.
‘Initiating’ means teachers are trained on some components of child-centred pedagogy. The curriculum is
not holistic, and links between preschool and primary curricula are weak. Classroom material lists are not
comprehensive and include limited age-appropriate play and learning materials. Materials are available for
less than half of preschools nationwide. Standards for classroom design that ensure adequate learning
space exist but are not used widely. There are limited mechanisms or programmes for engaging parents in
pre-primary education and parent participation is very limited. In 2017 and 2018 the quality is mostly rated
between ‘initiating’ and ‘established’.
140
‘Established’ means that teachers receive training on some (but not all) components of child-centred
pedagogy. The curriculum is holistic, but links to the primary curriculum and/or to any day-care/early years’
curriculum can be improved. Classroom material lists include age-appropriate books, toys /playthings, and
learning materials. They are available in two thirds of preschools nationwide. Most classrooms are designed
as per pre-established standards that ensure adequate learning space. There are mechanisms or
programmes for engaging parents in pre-primary education, but only some parents actively engage in these
programs.
ECD-Related Intervention Results (Outcomes)
Early Stimulation and Responsive Caregiving - In the retrospective theory of change (Annex A), the
intended outcomes of UNICEF’s work in early stimulation and care relate to responsive caregiving
(including materials available in the home environment for early stimulation) and early learning. The
baseline for Strategic Plan 2018-2021 is that 64% of children receive early stimulation and care from their
parents or caregivers. The milestone this Strategic Plan period is that by 2021, 74% of children are receiving
early stimulation and care.
Progress on parent and caregiver outcomes are mixed and vary by country and region (Figure 26). Twelve
of the 31 (39%) countries with data have 70% or more of children receiving early stimulation and responsive
caregiving. These countries are located in Eastern and Central Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, Latin
America and the Caribbean, and in the Middle East and North Africa. Countries in these regions have
already met or are close to meeting the Strategic Plan 2018-2021 target. Among the 31 countries with data
on this outcome, 10 countries (32%) had fewer than 50 percent of children receiving early stimulation and
responsive caregiving. Thus, they fall below the baseline on this outcome, and will likely not meet the target
for the Strategic Plan 2018-2021. These countries are located in Eastern and Southern Africa and in
Western and Central Africa.

or more activities (telling stories, singing songs, taking outside, playing, naming/counting or drawing things)
to promote learning and school readiness in the last three days.
Moreover, the same countries in these regions have more than 10% of children receiving inadequate care
(being left alone at home with a child 10 years or younger for more than an hour at least one time per week)
(Figure 27). Oman is a peculiar case; more than 40% of children received what UNICEF terms as
inadequate care (Figure 27), but 80% received early stimulation and responsive care from 2014-2018
(Figure 26). This could suggest that child-to-child caregiving may be an important cultural practice in the
country.

Home Environment – In some countries in Eastern and Central Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean,
more than 40% of children had available children’s books at home during the study time period (Figure 28).
Serbia reported the highest percentage of children with books at home (more than 70%), while countries in
Eastern and Southern Africa and Western and Central Africa had the lowest percentages of children with
books at home (less than 5%). The availability of toys at home was more evenly distributed across the
regions (Figure 29). In 22 out of 31 (71%) countries with data, more than 50% of children had access to
toys at home. Countries with less than 50% of children with toys at home are located in Western and Central
Africa and in Eastern and Southern Africa.

Early Learning and School Readiness – In nine out of 31 countries with data, 50% or more of children
had attended an early childhood education programme from 2014-2018 (Thailand and Vietnam in EAP;
Mongolia and Nepal in SA; Kazakhstan and Serbia in ECA; and Belize, Guyana and Mexico in LAC) (Figure
30). There is no target for this indicator, but a majority of countries who reported data had fewer than 50%
of children who attended an early childhood education programme. However, when examining school
readiness, 21 out of 31 (68%) countries with data had 50% or more children who attended one year of pre-
school, which is the target set in the current Strategic Plan 2018-2021 (Figure 31). All of the countries in
Western and Central Africa had fewer than 50% of children who attended one year of pre-school, as did
Malawi, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan.

Children’s’ Developmental Status - It is clear from both the research and evidence from this portfolio
review that early stimulation and care affect a wide range of developmental outcomes for children, including
their cognitive development, physical development, and social-emotional development. The impact-level
indicator for early stimulation and care is the Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI), which measures
the percentage of children who are developmentally on track in literacy-numeracy, physical, learning, and
social-emotional skills. Currently this indicator measures only children age 36-59 months. The results
indicate that 45 out of 48 countries with data had an ECDI of 50% or more, and 16 out of 48 countries had
an ECDI of 80% or more (which is the target set for this indicator) (Figure 32). Countries with the highest
percentage of children who are developmentally on track are located in East Asia and the Pacific, Eastern
and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East and North Africa. Chad, Burundi,
and Timor-Leste – all countries that have experience conflict during the time period had fewer than 50% of
children who were developmentally on track.

A summary of UNICEF’s progress on intervention outputs, outcomes and impact that have data is provided
in Table 33. Some targets have not been met during the study time period, while other targets have been
exceeded. Many indicators do not have targets or sufficient data, so progress cannot be determined at this

Efficacy of Interventions
Because early stimulation and care was not operationalised in UNICEF’s monitoring and evaluation
framework until the current Strategic Plan, and because data are not readily available for all interventions,
it was not possible to connect implementation strategies with outputs, outcomes, and impacts at this time.
The most significant issue UNICEF faces in demonstrating the efficacy of its interventions is the reliance
on MICS data to demonstrate results. A majority of countries have used the ECD Module (MICS 5), but in
any case, it is designed to assess trends at the population level (e.g., number of children attending
preschool), not to be used as measure of children’s physical, cognitive, or social-emotional development.
There may be ways that UNICEF has integrated survey items from the MICS into parent outcome surveys
(the Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice surveys mentioned previously), in order to correlate interventions with
results. However, it is not clear how many countries are collecting this type of data, and to what extent
these KAP surveys have been standardised for use across the organization to demonstrate results. Also,
is does not appear that any evaluations have employed a randomised controlled experimental or quasi-
experimental design, which is necessary for assessing programme efficacy and impact.
While we were not able to connect specific interventions with outputs, outcomes and impact, we did explore
to what extent different measures within MICS were correlated with one another—at the population level.
This correlation analyses examined the different outcome indicators on early stimulation and care and
revealed that all indicators are closely associated with the ECDI (children’s developmental status). In
particular, within a country, the availability of children’s books (r=0.88)71 and support for learning were
strongly associated with children’s developmental status, with mothers’ support for learning being the most
strongly linked (r=0.84). Support for leaning in this indicator encompasses telling stories, singing songs,
taking outside, playing, naming/counting or drawing things (Table 34). Attendance at an ECD programme
is also strongly correlated with the ECDI (r=0.61). Furthermore, inadequate care is strongly negatively
associated with the developmental status of children in the literacy-numeracy, social-emotional, physical,
71 The informative value of this analysis is limited by the relatively small number of countries with available data, the
fact that it is a secondary analysis over means, and that the outcomes are intercorrelated.
146
and learning domains (r=-0.82). These findings underscore the importance of such early stimulation and
care activities for the development of children and appear to be internally coherent. However, we cannot
trace backwards with the given data to know if these outcomes and impacts are connected in any way to
UNICEF-supported programmes.

Notes: The “ECD package” is formed by at least two combined
interventions benefiting young children, 0-59 months. To be considered a
package the interventions need to have the following characteristics a)
address children from birth until 5 years of age; and b) one of the 2 (or
more) interventions needs to include early stimulation or responsive
caregiving. A country is considered having “adopted” a package if there
is ownership by the government. The ownership should include at least one,
but preferably all, of the following components: policy, coordination
mechanism, allocated budget and/or monitoring system.

Annex H: Case Study Analysis – System Strengthening
1. Background
This Annex reports the findings of the evaluation of Theme 2 of the Global Evaluation of ECD, which focused
on Systems Strengthening to analyse UNICEF’s contributions and effectiveness in strengthening national
capacity and systems to implement and scale early stimulation and responsive care programmes and
services. The evaluation question for theme 2 is: to what extent has UNICEF supported governments to
strengthen sectoral and multisectoral policies and systems for ECD, including national capacity to scale the
delivery of early stimulation and responsive care programmes and services?
1.1 Area of analysis
A survey with over 100 questions was circulated to UNICEF country offices. 21 of these questions were
related to Theme 2. 54 countries responded to most of these questions. 6 countries were identified as case
study offices as they have experience with piloting early stimulation and responsive care programmes:
Rwanda, Thailand, Jordan, Paraguay, Serbia, and Mali. These COs were asked to share specific
documents related to the programmes they have supported, including government policy documents,
including ECD action plans, evaluations of projects, programme monitoring reports, funding requests,
programme materials and curricula. These documents and CO annual reports from 2016 to 2019 were
reviewed.
Discussions were held with staff from each of the case study COs. Questions for discussion (except Mali)
were circulated to officials in advance and follow up questions were sent to most of them after the
discussions.
In all countries, the focus was on early stimulation and responsive care programmes that the COs had or
were currently implementing. These include standalone parenting programme, early childhood
development programmes and programmes that aimed at improving parental engagement of existing
workforces.
1.2 What we looked for
Five sub-questions in addition the main question were identified, however, the issues explored can be
captured in the following three core questions:
 How has UNICEF contributed to creating a policy environment that supports scaling up of early
stimulation and responsive care programmes? How have they contributed to creating political buy-
in for early stimulation and responsive care and how have they contributed to policy development
related to early stimulation and responsive care?
 How has UNICEF contributed to getting government to allocate resources for these programmes?
Has UNICEF identified and quantified the resources (institutional, human and material) required
and advised on how funds for these resources should be allocated in budgets?
 How has UNICEF approached supporting the scaling up of programmes and pilots it supports? Has
UNICEF codified the package so that it can be replicated with fidelity? How has UNICEF supported
222
government to develop the systems needed to support implementation? What steps has UNICEF
taken to embed pilots and good ECD practices into government processes and programmes?
1.3 What we found
The nature of UNICEF’s contributions differs by the type of programme they are supporting. The case
studies showed that UNICEF designed early stimulation and responsive care programmes that fit into one
or more of the following descriptions:
 standalone parenting programmes;
 early learning (ECD) programmes that include parental engagement;
 embedding parental engagement into existing programmes that are provided to children 0-8 years
(most of these are in the health sector).
Generally, the parenting programmes and the ECD programmes are standalone programmes with
distinctive and dedicate activities, workforce, curricula, physical spaces, materials, monitoring systems and
so on. UNICEF support for these standalone programmes range from designing and piloting the entire
programme (ECD pilots in Rwanda, BPP in Jordan) to making changes to embed or include parental
engagement in the delivery of an existing programme (Serbia and Thailand). UNICEF also supports
changing or adding to protocols in health (Serbia home visiting nurses, Mali nutrition treatment) to introduce
practices that front-line workers should implement when engaging with parents as part of their routine
processes.
Therefore, UNICEF support may involve designing and implementing an entire standalone package or
embedding new practices into existing programmes.
The key findings of the evaluation are:
 UNICEF engages on and provides advice, leadership and direction on policy issues. In many
countries it provides technical and financial support for the revision and production of
policy documents.
 UNICEF COs are less likely to engage in the nitty gritty of bureaucratic issues that need to
be addressed to make it possible to implement the policies, which includes systems
strengthening and engaging with public finance issues.
 Two of the case study COs (Jordan and Serbia) have taken a long-term approach to ensuring
UNICEF supported programmes are implemented at scale. These COs have demonstrated
what is required to implement a programme at scale and stakeholders can use that
knowledge to support the scaling up of other programmes.
1.4 How the findings are presented
The findings related to Theme 2 are presented as follows:
 Section 2 discusses how UNICEF participates in and contributes to developing polices for early
stimulation and responsive care, including evidence creation.
223
 Section 3 discusses the contributions made by UNICEF to strengthening the workforce for early
stimulation and responsive care. Contributions include training the workforce and developing the
human resources frameworks for professionalising the workforce.
 Section 4 discusses how UNICEF COs contributed to mobilising resources for early stimulation and
responsive care programmes, including how UNICEF offices engage with public finance issues.
 Section 5 discusses the extent to which UNICEF designs pilots with scale up in mind. This section
refers to steps by COs discussed elsewhere in the report that potentially contribute to scaled
implementation of early stimulation and responsive care programmes.
 Section 6 discusses lessons learned and recommends changes that need to be made to support
implementing programmes at scale, which are discussed in relation to the proposed phases
involved in taking programmes to scale and design features of programmes that will favour their
chances of being scaled up.
2. UNICEF’s contributions to creating an enabling policy environment
UNICEF COs like to engage with and lead on policy issues but tend not to engage with the nuts and
bolts of system strengthening.
Most of the countries covered by the survey, 39 (72%) have had policies and policy frameworks for early
stimulation and responsive care for three or more years. A third of CO have introduced new frameworks in
the last year. So overall, 78% of the countries have some sort of policy framework in place. These statistics
suggest widespread existence of policies, which are being expanded in many countries. Of the countries
with policy frameworks, 61% (48% of all respondents) have formalised at least some of these roles in
legislation.
Question 79 of the survey asked, “from 2014 to present, which of the following policy development activities
have been carried out by UNICEF to strengthen government systems for early stimulation and responsive
care programmes and services in the country? What was UNICEF’s role in the process?” Respondents
were given three options shown below (see Table 39).

It is notable that a much higher proportion of UNICEF COs play a leading role in proposing policy options
and developing regulations (41% and 49%) than play a leading role in the other activities. The other
activities are critical to implementing and scaling up ECD policies. They involve investigating how
government systems operate as opposed to dealing with theoretical issues related to child development.
About half the countries indicated they play a supporting, rather than a leading role, and more COs
collaborate with three or fewer other organisations than with a larger number.
The nature of the policy and legislative environment in a country determines where efforts to create enabling
policy environment for early stimulation and responsive care programmes should be aimed.
In countries with comprehensive legal systems, one expects rights to be enshrined in a high-level law such
as a constitution. The constitution may create a framework for protecting the rights of children through
combinations of sectoral legislation, policies, and regulations which will mandate different sectors and levels
of government to deliver services. In these contexts, introducing new programmes or changing existing
programmes usually requires some combination of new laws, changing existing laws, introducing new
regulations or changing existing regulations to create the mandate for the new activities to be carried out.
In these contexts, the mandate for parenting programmes would first need to be recognised in a National
ECD Act, or Children’s Act and once that is promulgated it is likely that regulations clarifying how the
services will be carried out will need to be developed.
There are many countries where the high-level mandate for early stimulation and responsive care
programmes is made through a national development plan, such as the Economic Development and
Poverty Reduction Strategy in Rwanda, the Strategic Framework for Economic Recovery and Sustainable
Development in Mali, or a national human resources development plan in Jordan. The detailed child related
objectives are usually expressed in a national ECD strategy or plan. In these contexts, it is necessary to
get early stimulation and responsive care recognised as a priority in the national development plan before
the more specific ECD plan can be developed.
The higher-level plans are usually revised every few years to align with electoral cycles. Therefore,
advocating for changes to ECD mandates and priorities should be planned around the revision of these
plans. In contrast, where mandates are exercised through legislation, the legislation can be changed at any
time there is political support for the change, although this can be very time consuming.
In the case study countries, the most common avenue for UNICEF to contribute to getting ECD on the
agenda and/or influencing the focus of the interventions was to participate in ECD committees or technical
working groups. In some countries, there are multi-sectoral ECD working groups and in others there are
technical working groups in each of the key sectors. UNICEF uses these committees as a platform to
provide technical input and advice, advocating for early stimulation and responsive care issues to be
formally recognised by government as a priority issue. Their participation ensures they are involved in
debates and discussions regarding revisions to legislation and regulations and are invited to participate in
revisions of country Strategic Plans and work plans at the relevant time during the planning cycle. All case
study COs indicated that they made these sorts of contributions, to varying degrees.
The membership and role of UNICEF in these committees varied by country and depended largely on the
closeness of the relationship between UNICEF and the relevant Ministry. Where UNICEF has a close
relationship with the Ministry their role on the committee can include as much as co-chairing the ECD cluster
or ECD committee, scheduling and coordinating meetings. These roles enable UNICEF to influence who is
invited and what items are put on the agenda for discussion. Where the relationship is not as close, UNICEF
participates in the committees and raises issues to keep them on the agenda.
225
Evidence of the problem is essential to demonstrate that a policy response is required. Most of the case
study COs have managed to get MICS institutionalised and some of them also provide technical assistance
to the Bureau of Statistics (or equivalent) to collect data that can be used in evidence-based decision
making. UNICEF’s contribution in this regard ranges from advising the office on what indicators should be
measured (terms used in surveys) to training officials on how to prepare surveys and analyse data. Besides,
the data being an important source of evidence of the need for policy interventions, there are no notable
examples of the data being used in planning and managing the implementation of policy.
Two of the case study COs (Serbia and Thailand) convened conferences or forums on child rights issues,
which lead to calls to action on children and the signing of MoUs between the relevant Ministries. Those
agreements create the mandate for multi-sectoral policy work to happen.
Specific experiences noted in the case study countries include:
 UNICEF Jordan has a partnership agreement with the National Council for Family Affairs and
supports the council both financially and technically to implement the interventions outlined in the
agreement. UNICEF participates in the planning processes of government and helps Ministries to
embed the Better Parent Programme in existing programmes.
 UNICEF Rwanda co-chairs the National ECD Committee with the National ECD coordinator.
UNICEF’s partnership agreement is signed with the National ECD Programme, which has recently
merged with another organisation to become the National Child Development Agency.
 UNICEF Serbia established an informal intersectoral group and an ECD Services Advisory group,
with delegates from key ministries. It does not have a recognised coordinating role.
 UNICEF Mali is on the ECD Action Network with government, the World Bank, and Save the
Children.
All the case study countries “helped develop” the national ECD plan or policy by providing technical advice
through these committees. Some also supported the writing of these plans and policies financially.
3. UNICEF’s contributions to strengthening the workforce
Most COs have contributed directly to building the capacity of frontline workers involved in the
delivery of early stimulation and responsive care programmes, through regional training or trainer
of trainer programmes. However, fewer COs introduced new curricula or took steps to develop or
strengthen systems in government required for scaling up the workforce.
Effective scaling up of programmes rests on a skilled and equipped workforce. Front line workers that
implement early stimulation and responsive care programmes are the most critical component of the
programme. These include child carers and teachers at ECD centres, facilitators of parenting programmes,
nurses, community development workers and others.
Preparing the workforce to scale programmes involves transferring skills to front-line workers and ensuring
that government’s human resource systems support the appointment, payment, and management of these
officials. In countries with formal human resource regulations the latter issues include defining job
descriptions, minimum competency requirements (e.g., required qualifications) and salary ranks or levels.
It is also usually necessary to ensure the organograms of departments are amended to include these
positions, and the associated management hierarchies.
226
There are two factors that affect the type of contributions required. First is the level of formality. Nurses are
usually formal positions, with recognised job descriptions. The level of formality of the rest of the workforce
involved in early stimulation and responsive care programmes vary. In some countries preschool teachers
and child carers are formally recognised positions, but this is not the norm. In most countries the rest of the
staff mentioned above are in informal/temporary/stipend positions or are community volunteers. Therefore,
programmes using these human resources could be taken to scale without for significant changes to HR
systems. Second, is the nature of the early stimulation and responsive care intervention. For parenting
programmes, UNICEF’s contribution to building a workforce includes preparing a complete package of
materials for a programme, which includes a training of trainer curriculum, a curriculum framework for the
programme, guidelines, manuals and materials used in the programme. Where UNICEF’s focus is on
ensuring parenting engagement is added to an existing programme, UNICEF’s contribution typically
focuses on embedding or adding parenting engagement materials into an existing curriculum and/or into
pre-service training.
Questions in the survey aimed to establish:
 the extent to which UNICEF COs have developed materials that were adapted for local conditions
and codified so they could be replicated at scale; and
 what COs had done to create an enabling human resources regulatory environment.
3.1 Developing curricula
A curriculum codifies the practices and protocols that frontline workers need to follow when implementing
a programme. Therefore, providing a curriculum is a way of codifying the teaching of these practices and
getting them embedded into the training of the national workforce.
(Q85) Just over half the COs indicated they prepared curriculum for frontline workers. This finding contrasts
with the written descriptions of how COs have “supported the development and implementation of training
for frontline workers”. Besides the four case study countries discussed below, only six other COs
(Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Honduras, Kazakhstan, State of Palestine, Timor-Leste) made explicit reference to
working on curricula. The contributions to curricula in the case study countries are as follows:
 UNICEF Rwanda commissioned the drafting of a Parenting Curriculum (2019).
 UNICEF Serbia developed the Years of Ascent Curriculum for pre-schools in Serbia, created
modules for training home nurses that were added to the pre-service training curriculum, and
amended the “rule books” for pre-schools and home visiting nurses so these programmes could be
implemented.
 UNICEF Jordan made changes to the kindergarten curriculum to include parental engagement (not
yet rolled out) and adapted and revised existing parenting materials for the Better Parenting
Programme, which is recognised as the official parenting programme, although it is not a
curriculum.
 UNICEF Thailand developed training modules and curriculum for the training of ECD workers.
UNICEF Paraguay developed training materials for the Upa! Programmes and their CCD trainings. Five
COs (Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Jamaica, Turkmenistan) developed programmes in partnership with a
227
government institute or university which have or are likely to lead to the institutionalisation of the
programmes.
So, in total only 10 COs developed or amended curriculum and a further six made contributions that are or
will likely be embedded in the capacity building of frontline workers.
3.2 Providing training
The responses to the survey suggest there is widespread involvement in the delivery of training.
 (Q85) In total 70% (37/54) of the COs indicated they have carried out train the trainer programmes.
About a third of the COs have carried out training of trainers nationally, of which 5 (35%) did not
carry out any training regionally. Just under 60% have carried out training of trainer programmes
at a regional level.
 About two thirds of COs that have engaged in training have translated the material into local
languages. It is possible that the material in the remaining third of countries was developed in the
local language or translated at a regional level (this was not established by the survey).
The above numbers are supported by COs written descriptions of their contributions. The approach to
preparing training materials and developing the workforce varies across the case study countries.
UNICEF Serbia is currently implementing a plan to roll out training of preschool teachers across the country.
The CO worked with the relevant ministries to change the “rule books” in health and education, which
ensures the new activities of the preschool teachers required by the curriculum are institutionalised in
practice. The roll out of the preschool curriculum in Serbia is a step in a long-term plan to improve the
quality of preschool teaching. They have leveraged relationships with the World Bank to raise the funding
to roll out the programme nationwide.
In Jordan, the Better Parenting Programme has been in place for more than 20 years during which time a
wide range of manuals and training material has been developed. UNICEF works closely with the relevant
Ministries to embed this into government programmes and budgets.
In the other countries, the training has been limited in geographic scope.
UNICEF Rwanda prepared and demonstrated the effectiveness of a comprehensive package at 15 sites.
UNICEF Thailand demonstrated how a training programme can be implemented in 25 demonstration
centres. UNICEF Paraguay developed materials and manuals aimed at frontline workers of 0-5-year olds,
which was combined with the childcare for development (CCD) approach. Training on this has been
provided in selected areas and to some frontline workers. These training interventions appear to be of high
quality and appear to have achieved impact in the limited geographic areas they were provided.
Training materials from all the case study countries were checked over and translated using Google
translate where necessary. In all countries there is a large amount of material that has been developed
including parenting guidelines, manuals for trainers, materials that can be used when engaging with parents
and so on. The early stimulation and responsive care packages shared are codified and comprehensive.
They can be replicated by other role players wishing to implement and/or scale the programme elsewhere
and if there is interest UNICEF will provide support if necessary.
3.3 Competency standards and monitoring systems
228
Institutionalising the capacity requirements of the frontline workers and how to measure their performance
in government frameworks is essential to scaling these programmes, yet it is a step that a small proportion
of COs have been engaged in.
Only 13 of the 37 (24% of all respondents) that provided training also developed minimum competency
standards and career pathways. Only 10 of these 37 (18% of all respondents) developed key performance
indicators for monitoring the work of frontline workers.
There may be reasons for the low numbers e.g., no formal contracts and therefore no perceived need for
competency standards. However, that these steps were not taken by so many suggests that few COs are
thinking long term about how to codify competency standards and performance measures so that they can
be institutionalised by government.
3.4 Preparing ministries to appoint a workforce
COs were asked (Q90) to indicate what support they had provided to prepare ministries to appoint a
workforce for early stimulation and responsive care programmes. Activities included identifying
management capacities required and presenting these in an organogram, preparing job descriptions of
management required, helping government to approve new posts and helping government getting posts
funded. 12 COs indicated that these activities were not required as the posts exist and are funded, which
is probable given that many UNICEF supported early stimulation and responsive care programmes are
targeted at members of an existing workforce (e.g., training nurses or preschool teachers). Accounting for
these COs, out of the remaining COs at most 30% engage with any of the above systems issues related to
appointing a workforce.
This is another example of where COs do not get involved in the deep work of systems strengthening that
enable programmes to be implemented.
3.5 Monitoring of frontline workers
The lack of ongoing supervision of frontline workers is listed as one the top four challenges to starting and
maintaining early stimulation and responsive care programmes (Q44, Q63). Ensuring that services are
provided as intended requires a system for the monitoring and supervision of the activities of frontline
workers and should be a priority of all COs when they develop a programme, but it is not widely done.
The survey asked COs to describe the systems they developed in this regard. Of the case study countries,
three have developed and implemented monitoring systems that can be scaled through existing
government systems, one has enhanced existing monitoring systems and the development of new systems
are planned in the other countries:
– UNICEF Thailand: NGOs that implemented the programme carried out monitoring and follow-up visits.
The monitoring system has been developed and government can adopt the system, which some local
authorities have done, but there is weak oversight at the national level.
– UNICEF Jordan – monitoring of the Better Parenting Programme was assigned to community liaison
officers who visited programmes while they were implemented. The programme is now provided
229
through Makani centres and UNICEF uses a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system (Bayani)
for the programme.
– UNICEF Rwanda - works with and through government systems within the decentralised framework
and through partnership agreements held with CSO partners. A monitoring system has been
developed and is being rolled out as more funding becomes available.
– UNICEF Serbia - in preschool education, UNICEF has helped the relevant Ministry and institutes to
improve the system for self and external evaluation of the preschool institution. For the home visiting
nurses, UNICEF supported the development and piloting of monitoring instruments for home visiting
services that nurses use. The office is currently supporting the digitisation of the monitoring systems.
– UNICEF Paraguay – the development of a monitoring system has been planned, even though the
programme has already been implemented.
11 of the other COs describe systems that are like those described above. Other COs described working
group meetings, training, supervision through payment, surveys and rapid assessments, self-evaluations,
and training all of which have value, but are not examples of systems put in place to monitor the
performance of the frontline workers. So only 15 COs (excluding COs that said they are/will develop one)
have a system to monitor if the frontline workers are scaling the programme with fidelity. This aligns with
the survey responses in which only 30% said they had developed M&E frameworks for monitoring the
activities of frontline workers (Q86).
Note that in a different question over 75% indicated they had developed M&E frameworks (Q100, see
below). There is an important distinction here. It appears that the M&E framework for the programme is
developed for the purposes of evaluating the programme and whether it delivered the planned outputs and
achieved intended objectives. These are needed for managing contracts. They generally do not include
information that is useful for monitoring the activities of the frontline workers.
4. UNICEF’s contribution to resource mobilisation
To be taken to scale, all programmes require funding. Advocating effectively for government funding
requires an understanding of how a programme fits within the public finance system and familiarity with
some technical public finance and budget process issues.
UNICEF COs are reluctant to engage in detail with public finance issues. Contributing factors could
be high levels of informality in delivery of early stimulation and responsive care programmes (i.e., the
workforce is not formally recognised and/or largely volunteer and therefore not on the government payroll)
and that many of the programmes are community or privately funded. Therefore, in some contexts,
programmes can function without any financial support from government and there may be no obvious
incentive for UNICEF programme managers to spend time trying to build relationships with the Ministry of
Finance that could be better spent providing technical programme inputs.
The following section discusses findings from the survey and discussions with the case study countries.
4.1 Dealing with public finance issues
COs (Q44 and Q63) listed too little funding as the top reason for not being able to start or sustain
programmes. One would therefore expect countries to engage with these issues closely. Questions related
230
to public finance issues, budgeting and costing aimed to establish the extent to which UNICEF COs engage
with and contribute to discussions around these issues.
The types of issues that need to be engaged with vary depending on the nature of the intervention, the
structure of public finances and intergovernmental arrangements (which levels of government have what
roles and responsibilities).
Parenting programmes, such as the Better Parenting Programme in Jordan, are stand-alone programmes
for which the funding can be identified. The funding allocated to the programme for salaries of trainers, the
printing of materials can be clearly identified in budget lines that are dedicated to the programme. It is
possible to ‘see’ the budget lines for the programme and advocacy efforts focus on getting money allocated
to these budget lines.
When an early stimulation and responsive care intervention involves embedding parental engagement into
an existing programme, such as introducing parental engagement into the curriculum of pre-schools or the
curriculum of home visiting nurses, advocating for funding for early stimulation and responsive care is
different. The costs of the early stimulation and responsive care activities are embedded into existing
programmes. When a nurse visits a home, she is carrying out a health service in a parenting friendly
manner. It is likely that one can see what resources are allocated to these activities, especially salary costs,
but trying to estimate the proportion of the salary used for parental engagement is an abstract idea. What
part of her salary is spent engaging with the parent? That ‘portion’ of her salary is part of the salary costs
of the programme. There is no way to tell from the budget for salaries whether the nurses will engage with
parents or not. One assumes, because parenting engagement is included in the pre-service curriculum,
that nurses will engage with parents. Advocating for funding focuses on ensuring that the larger programme
(e.g., home visiting nurses) and that the training of nurses are adequately funded.
Question 80 of the survey asks which of the following have been commissioned by UNICEF regarding
programmes that promote early stimulation and responsive care (see Table 40)?
Figure 98: Public financing activities reported by COs

Stakeholder mapping and analyses 31% 22% 28%
Frontline workforce assessments 11% 19% 50%
Cost of Inaction / Cost benefits 6% 11% 56%
Source: Survey Responses
Public expenditure reviews and budget briefs are usually sector wide, or on services for children and
therefore broader in scope than early stimulation and responsive care interventions. So, the low level of
responses under ‘explicit focus’ is understandable, yet at most 39% of the countries have analysed
expenditures related to early stimulation and responsive care programmes.
231
To be able to effectively lobby for funding and make specific recommendations about how early stimulation
and responsive care programmes should be funded it is necessary to understand the funding mechanisms
and budgeting processes related to the services so that one can recommend how the funding should flow,
what budgets it needs to go to and when it must be allocated. At most, 24% of the COs have developed, or
attempted to develop, the sort of in-depth understanding of the budgeting mechanisms in the country
required to lobby effectively for funding.
Few countries have conducted cost of inaction and/or cost benefit analyses. These analyses estimate the
economic value of these programmes and can be used to make an investment case for programmes. These
studies are technical and can be difficult to interpret, especially with programmes like early stimulation and
responsive care that have multiple benefits and are not exclusively responsible for the developmental
outcomes they contribute to. Responses to other questions suggest there is generally a low level of
engagement on technical financial management issues:
– Less than 30% of COs helped government officials to prepare budget bids or memos about funding of
early stimulation and responsive care programmes (Q83)
– Less than 15% of COs have hosted workshops on funding issues (Q83)
– Less than 12% of COs have assessed or made recommendations on the modalities for including
private funding of early stimulation and responsive care programmes (Q84)
– 24% of COs have assessed funding channels (Q91) for early stimulation and responsive care
programmes.
– Less than 25% of COs feel that strong relationships with the Ministry of Finance are relevant to taking
programmes to scale (Q87).
– Less than 20% of COs have helped the line ministry get funding for posts72
– 3 COs assessed procurement regulations to ensure UNICEF-supported programmes are aligned with
these requirements (Q91).
4.2 Costing of early stimulation and responsive care programmes
COs were asked separate questions about costing of their own programmes and the costing of government
programmes. One would expect a CO to cost the programmes they pilot so that they understand the
resources needed to implement the programme and demonstrate the fiscal feasibility of the programme.
The costing of government programmes can show whether a programme is adequately funded and
whether it is affordable.
The results from the survey show that early stimulation and responsive care programmes have not been
costed widely and that few of COs have developed costings that have informed budgeting or planning.
Only 37% (20, Q92) of the COs have costed their own pilot programmes. The more detailed the costing the
more useful it will be for estimating resources required for scaling. To be of value for planning and
72 8 countries have done this, but 12 indicated it’s not relevant because the post already exists.
232
budgeting, it is recommended that costings should include estimates of 4 or more of the 8 dimensions of
the programme identified in the survey.73 12 of the 20 countries that costed their own programmes met this
standard. This is 60%, but it means that only 12 of the 54 COs that responded to the survey have costed
early stimulation and responsive care programmes in sufficient detail to inform the scaling up of the
programme.
52% (28) indicated they have costed government programmes of which 15 indicated there was follow
through with and/or use by the line Ministry that could potentially impact on resource allocations for these
programmes. Note than only 5 out of these 28 COs indicated they had engaged with the Ministry of Finance
on the costing, which is concerning since officials from the Ministry of Finance play a crucial role in budget
decisions. They should be the subject of deliberate advocacy efforts to sensitise them regarding the benefits
of early stimulation and responsive care programmes, and the resource requirements to scale these
programmes.
In total 30 (56%) of the COs have carried out at least one type of costing. There are two valid reasons for
not costing government programmes in the written responses: the UNICEF programme involves training
an existing workforce, for which there is already a budget and therefore a costing was not seen as
necessary, and secondly other agencies, such as development banks have carried out costings.
The following experience in the case study countries are worth noting:
 Serbia carried out a costing of the kindergarten programme on an unrelated programme, which
was used by the CO to estimate resources for a World Bank loan. That loan was awarded and is
funding the scaled implementation of their programme of training teachers and preschool
institutions.
 Jordan estimated the unit costs for the parenting programme to help line Ministries prepare budgets
for the programme.
 Rwanda prepared a detailed costing of the ECD policy, which includes an implementation plan, but
it was done before the existing UNICEF started working there and they did not indicate whether it
has been used.
4.3 Public finance experiences from case study countries
Additional insights from the case study countries are as follows:
 UNICEF Jordan has a long standing and close working relationship with government. They have
seconded an official to government to provide technical support. This has led to the office
understanding the budget process and funding mechanisms and also means they have a presence
during budget discussions. UNICEF helps ministries prepare work plans and advises on resource
requirements. They have prepared costings of some programmes which are used to inform budget
allocations.
 UNICEF Rwanda advised and supported the government to establish a coordination structure in
the key line Ministry. This advice included establishing a separate budget for the structure, which
73 These 8 dimensions are as follows: Does the costing estimate costs per (1) Beneficiary (2) Site (3) Administrative
unit? Does the costing show (4) Salary costs, (5) set up costs, (6) overhead and fixed costs? Can it be used to show
change in (7) costs as a result of increased output and does it include a (8) phased implementation plan.
233
has contributed significantly to resources being available in the Ministry for policy development
activities. They have also started working with local governments to build their capacity to plan and
budget for ECD.
 UNICEF Thailand, through their demonstration project, built the capacity of pilot local authorities to
plan and budget for the programme so that this could be replicated in other local authorities that
implemented the programme.
 The Social Policy Unit in UNICEF Thailand has forged relationships with the Ministry of Finance
and the Parliament Budget Office to build capacity to improve reporting on public finance for
children. These activities should lead to improved understanding of what is spent on children, which
will hopefully lead to increased allocations for children, including early stimulation and responsive
care programmes.
 UNICEF Serbia prepared a costing of a kindergarten programme which was later used to prepare
a request for a loan from the World Bank. The rolling out of the training of the new preschool
curricula, which includes a parental engagement element, is being funded through the loan.
 UNICEF Paraguay developed a method for tracking expenditures on children that can be used in
the country, which is being used by the General Budget Office of the Ministry of Finance.
5. UNICEF’s approach to and intent of taking programmes to scale
Through the survey and the case studies we aimed to evaluate the contributions COs have made to policies
and systems that enable the scaling of programmes and the extent to which UNICEF has designed their
programmes with scaling in mind.
We have shown that most UNICEF COs make valuable contributions to policy development and writing
ECD actions plans, but fewer are involved in strengthening the systems required to support implementation.
In this section we look at factors influencing the purpose and design of pilots and UNICEF COs’
perspectives of what is needed to scale programmes.
It is closed off with a summary of ‘good scaling practices’ and recommendations regarding changes required
in UNICEF to more effectively support system strengthening.
5.1 The case made by piloting programmes
In response to questions about why COs piloted early stimulation and responsive care programmes, 44 out
of the 54 countries (Q88) indicated they wanted to make the case to introduce new policies related to early
stimulation and responsive care and/or to make the case to introduce an early stimulation and responsive
care programme. Even though more COs (34) indicated the purpose of the pilot was to motivate for a new
programme, than for policy change (29), a large proportion of the countries indicated that pilots are used to
shift policy thinking.
Only 3 countries that piloted programmes to make the case to introduce new policies indicated their country
did not have policies that supported early stimulation and responsive care. Pilots or demonstration
programmes are more likely to be taken to scale if they are aligned with existing government policy, however
234
there is merit to piloting programmes that aim to shift policy thinking even if there is a reduced likelihood of
the programme being taken to scale.
5.2 Designing programmes to be replicated with fidelity
The survey explored the extent to which country codified their pilots during design and piloting phases. It is
expected that the level of intent to scale programmes would be reflected by the extent to which elements
of the programme are codified during the early stages of the project. Respondents were asked (Q100) to
indicate aspects of the programme that were codified before or after the programme started, or not at all.
The questions can be split into two dimensions:
 Workforce and programme management: competencies, management arrangements, monitoring
and evaluation systems, staffing arrangements.
 Programme specifics: target beneficiaries, materials used, standard operating procedures,
physical standards of facilities.
44 countries responded to the question.
 With regards to the workforce and management aspects of the programme: 28 COs (71%) codified
5 or more of the 7 components. Out of the countries that codified less than 4 or fewer components,
the competencies of the workforce, trainer to mentor ratios and a monitoring and evaluation system
were the components codified the least.
 With regards to programme specifics, 27 COs, codified 6 or more of the 8 components. Of the
countries that codified 4 or fewer components, the lowest level of codification was of physical
space, facility standards and equipment.
The components of the programme that were codified by 35 (82%) or more countries were: the head office
staff required, the responsibilities of major role players, a monitoring and evaluation framework, the target
beneficiaries, lists of inputs, and lists of materials.
The components that are least codified are the physical spaces and facility standards, which most likely
reflects the fact that many of the UNICEF interventions focused on building capacity in existing delivery
systems as opposed to piloting a new system.
These results largely mirror the assessment of programme materials provided by the case study offices,
namely: the packages have been codified in some detail and most, if not all, the knowledge required to
duplicate the programme elsewhere is embedded in the materials.
5.3 Enablers of scaling identified by COs
In response to what they felt was important for scaling (Q87) most COs (>80%) indicated the following:
 strong technical expertise in early stimulation and responsive care;
 strong relationships with the line Ministry and regular communication with them; and
 strong relationships with the community stakeholders.
These factors all sit within a policy comfort zone, close to early stimulation and responsive care policy
development. Over 70% indicated that systems strengthening is important, but CO contributions in this
regard are limited. This response is also at odds with the fact that less than half the COs indicated that
235
technical expertise on public administration, decentralisation and public finance were important; even
though all of them are important for supporting system strengthening in government.
5.4 Intergovernmental arrangements
To scale any government programme, it must be aligned with how responsibilities in government are
decentralised. Also known as intergovernmental arrangements. Therefore, if there is intention to scale the
programme, these arrangements should be factored into the design of the programme. However, a minority
of COs demonstrated they had done this.
Just under 90% of COs developed knowledge of the intergovernmental arrangements through reviews (13)
or an extended presence in the country (35) before designing the programme. 19% (10) indicated that
intergovernmental arrangements would be defined after it was shown that the pilot was successful and 9%
(5) said that the arrangements were not considered relevant because the programme was implemented on
a pilot scale.
Only 41% indicated that intergovernmental arrangements had influenced the design of the programme. So,
despite widespread knowledge of intergovernmental arrangements, less than half the COs indicated this
affected the design of programmes.
5.5 Communication for Development as enabler of scaling
COs with Communication for Development (C4D) campaigns see them as an important scaling mechanism.
These campaigns have the potential to reach the entire population and therefore, hypothetically, change
parenting practices across the country.
UNICEF Thailand and Paraguay developed websites where the public can access material. Whether this
material is accessed at scale depends on the effectiveness of communication campaigns, access to and
use of social media and whether parent facing public officials refer parents to the websites and materials.
The Thailand CO has agreed with the Ministry of Health to include references and links (e.g., QR codes) to
UNICEF’s website in materials that government distributes through clinics, including the health card that is
given to every parent. It is not clear that these COs have a plan in place to workshop the materials with all
parent facing officials.
Within the C4D programme, Rwanda CO has helped the National Children’s Commission to design,
develop and implement ‘Let us Raise Children in Families’. There are about 30 000 Izus in the country
(community member elected as a “friend of the family”) and UNICEF intends to use the Izu network to
promote child protection issues, early stimulation and ECD programmes.
5.6 Engaging with the private sector
UNICEF Rwanda developed a “Private Sector Engagement Strategy” aimed at establishing linkages
between local businesses, nutrition projects and ECD centres. Business, especially in the tea sector were
sensitised on the Children’s Rights and Business Principles and the importance of ECD and establishing
child-friendly workspaces. This is a low-cost way to expand access to programmes, especially in countries
with industries that employ large low and semi-skilled workforces. Surprisingly, this was not a strategy
236
identified elsewhere. Countries with large low and semi-skilled workforces should develop these
engagement strategies as it is a cost-effective way to reach large numbers of parents.
The private sector must be viewed as one of the implementing partners of parenting programmes.
5.7 Examples of ‘good scaling practices’
Despite limited examples of UNICEF-supported programmes having been taken to scale, some good
practices were observed.
Scaling requires:
 An implementation plan that is comprehensive and scheduled over a number of few years – the roll
out of the Years of Ascent curriculum in Serbia is good example of this.
 Understanding policy implementation at the decentralised level – UNICEF Thailand have
demonstrated how to implement a programme within existing local government structures at a
decentralised level.
 Understanding how to embed the programme into existing government programmes and budgets
– the experience in Jordan shows that this requires working very closely with government for a long
time.
 Advising and structuring funding arrangements. UNICEF Thailand did this very effectively at a
decentralised level within a limit geographic scope. UNICEF Jordan has worked in partnership with
Ministries to achieve this.
 Codifying materials (most COs did this) and codifying how the implementation of the programme
should be monitored - most COs did the former, but it is less clear whether the latter happened
widely.
 Formalising the competencies and expectations of a workforce – UNICEF Serbia achieved this
through changes to curricula and the “Rule Books”.
 Achieving impact and roll out at scale requires support over the long term. UNICEF Serbia and
Jordan have maintained a programme over a long-time horizon, UNICEF Rwanda is implementing
systems that will outlive individual officials.
6. Lessons and Recommendations
6.1 Lessons shared
Notable lessons shared are:
 In the words of one respondent, “Children live in communities, not sections of UNICEF
frameworks”. UNICEF offices need to develop structures that support the balance between stand-
alone ECD focused programming and integrated multi-sectoral ECD programming. Both are
necessary. It is critical that there are ECD focal persons in each of the ‘other’ sectors (e.g.,
237
education, WASH, health, nutrition etc.) and that cross-sectoral committees exist, or cross sectoral
meetings focused on ECD are held
 Once national level strategies and policies are in place, the focus of UNICEF’s work needs to shift
to system strengthening and scaling of programmes. To paraphrase one of the respondents,
“UNICEF does not only work for the capital, but we also work for the children, especially the most
vulnerable in hard-to-reach areas”. This requires an active effort to ensure programmes are scaled-
up and implemented with fidelity across all regions.
 ECD requires a multi-donor, multi-sector approach that focuses on 0-8 years. Donors are more
likely to support programmes that are holistic than narrowly focused. They want to know how the
programme will impact across multiple indicators and sectors and that there is buy-in from all the
relevant sectors in government.
 UNICEF COs must employ and developed the right technical and analytical skills to ensure they
are able to make the desired impacts. It is one thing to have evidence or data, but it is different
thing to build the government systems required to deliver programmes at scale and with fidelity.
UNICEF COs need staff that can move beyond policy, to supporting the development and
strengthening of government service delivery systems.
 Funding and approval processes in UNICEF are slow and cumbersome and do not enable flexibility
or rapidly responding to opportunities that arise.
 The institutionalisation of systems that outlive people are needed both in UNICEF and many
countries that UNICEF operates in. UNICEF COs must learn how to build long lasting systems in
UNICEF and learn how to help governments implement systems that outlast political cycles and
governments.
 Collaboration with business groups is an opportunity to leverage the private sector to increase the
reach of programmes for young children, especially parenting programmes.
6.2 Recommendations
The lessons learnt above include some important recommendations: build government systems that deliver
the desired services; build capacity to deliver both stand-alone ECD programmes and also support multi-
sectoral engagements; recruit and retain staff with technical knowledge and experience on system
strengthening and scaling-up programmes; create arrangements that enable greater flexibility and
responsiveness for some activities.
6.2.1 UNICEF needs to develop the internal arrangements to support implementation of
programmes at scale
There are a few phases involved in taking a policy from an idea, to a pilot and into a programme that is
implemented and sustained at scale by government. Five phases, with indicative timelines, are proposed
below:
238

Phase 5: M&E and improve
Monitor and evaluate programmes
Strengthen MIS systems
Strengthen case for funding
Identify areas needing strengthening
In order to achieve implementation at scale, some phases involve intensive activity for a limited period,
shown by the darker shading, whereas others involve a lot of activity at the start followed by ongoing
technical support and guidance for many years. The picture is presented over a notional 15-year time
horizon, which itself is a recommendation:
COs should develop long-term visions of how they will support scaled implementation. Expanding new
programmes in government takes time. It usually takes longer than 10 years for a new programme to be
implemented countrywide. COs should identify the capacity in UNICEF that is needed to support the scaling
of programmes over a 10 to 15-year time horizon.
UNICEF has strengths in the first three steps, which are creating evidence, developing policies, and using
pilots to demonstrate the effectiveness of policy interventions. However, most COs do not follow up as
suggested above and few engage with the next two phases of systems strengthening and implementing
monitoring systems. Once political buy in has been achieved and the policies exist, UNICEF needs to adapt
to engaging with the mechanics and financial arrangements involved in scaling implementation to stay
relevant.
The skills required to provide value in the first three phases are very different to those required for the last
two phases. The first three phases require ‘policy minds’ and can be achieved by applying toolkits, the last
two phases require a different set of skills and the same people to be in place for a long time. It requires
understanding how policy objectives fit into government systems, processes, service delivery
239
arrangements, funding, and reporting arrangements. It also requires understanding when and how much
change government bureaucracies can usefully absorb each year. UNICEF needs to develop these skills
and/or recruit people with these skills and the mind-set that driving through policy changes is a long-term
process.
UNICEF COs need to develop a better understanding of the public finance management arrangements in
their countries and develop the internal capacity to engage with these issues. It is not enough to say this is
not their niche and that development banks have more technical capacity in this area. UNICEF should rely
on development bank expertise for certain analyses, but UNICEF must have the internal capacity to assess
whether UNICEF’s policy positions are being funded adequately and appropriately. The existing UNICEF
Public Finance for Children (PF4C) guidelines offer substantive guidance in this regard. All UNICEF COs
should have a public finance specialist (only a few COs will need more than one individual) who are able
to provide cross sectoral support to help navigate the budget processes, structure funding modalities that
align with existing government funding arrangements, support carrying through costing exercises, help
ministries prepare budget bids and so on.
Greater emphasis needs to be placed on the importance of monitoring processes during implementation
that ensures activities are being carried out with fidelity. Monitoring and evaluation currently tends to
emphasise measuring outputs and impacts. This is important, but not sufficient for managing
implementation at scale. To manage implementation at scale, M&E needs to focus on measuring and
monitoring the allocation of resources (financial, human, capital and other inputs); process variables related
to the implementation of the programme to ensure it is being implemented with fidelity; training inputs and
programme output. Measuring the impact of programmes on an ongoing basis is not practical.
6.2.2 Design pilots with scaled implementation in mind
Two of the case study COs suggested that the purpose of the pilots was to show how the existing system
can support and fund the intervention and that investing in the intervention creates results. These pilots
created evidence of interventions that can work, but there is a risk that they will not be scaled up or
sustained. If UNICEF wants to develop and pilot programmes with the intention of taking them to scale,
then the pilots need to be designed with scaled implementation in mind. The table below describes
characteristics of projects, or pilots, that are on the opposite end of the ‘likely to be taken to scale’ spectrum.

UNICEF COs should design pilots so that they match the descriptions of the “integrated and embedded
pilots”, on the right, as the chances of scaled and sustained implementation are much higher than pilots
that fit the “isolated and disconnected” descriptions. In countries that are not receptive to UNICEF pilots,
COs will be forced into implementing pilots that are “isolated and disconnected”. Their challenge is to
change the structure of the pilot to shift it from the left to the right-hand column. The order in which the
changes should be made depend on the context.
To increase the likelihood that UNICEF offices design pilots for scaled implementation, the following should,
in addition to existing requirements, become standard components of pilot programmes supported by
UNICEF COs in the ECD sector.
A long-term vision of how UNICEF will support scaled implementation. As discussed, this should cover
15 years.
A skilled workforce is a critical input in all government programmes. The following should be included
as part of a human resource development plan that has an implementation schedule of at least 5 years:
 Descriptions of how a workforce will be developed (if it is a new one) or how the existing workforce
will be trained on new protocols.
 The training institutions in the country UNICEF will partner with to develop or revise curricula and
roll out training.
 How UNICEF will support government to formalise the new responsibilities and/or new categories
of frontline workers.
 The sources of funding available for training the workforce that are on budget; alternative sources
of funding that can be accessed, including a description of how UNICEF will help mobilise those
funds.
Programmes cannot be taken to scale without funding. The plan must indicate:
 how UNICEF will estimate the resources required to scale up the implementation of the programme
(this may require commissioning a costing or using existing cost estimates); and
 how government does, or will, allocate budgets for the human resources, materials used in
programmes, facilities used for services and training of the frontline workforce required to
implement the programme at scale.
If funding arrangements do not exist at the start of the pilot, the proposal should include a description of
how UNICEF will advocate for new funding and the intergovernmental fiscal arrangements to ensure the
flow of funding can be managed in support of expanding the programme.

Annex I: Case Study Analysis – Programme Quality and Impact
1. Background
The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 4 on Quality Education is that all children have access
to 1 year of pre-primary education (Indicator 4.2.1).74 The number of parents and children enrolled in
UNICEF-supported early learning programmes has grown in recent years,75 but questions remain regarding
whether UNICEF-supported ECD programmes are well designed, delivered with fidelity, and lead to
increases in caregiver and parent knowledge about ECD and increases in young children’s developmental
status.76
This Annex reports in more detail the findings of the evaluation of Theme 3 of the Global Evaluation of ECD,
which asked, What evidence is there that UNICEF direct support for early stimulation and responsive care
programmes are making a difference on a significant scale for vulnerable children, parents, and frontline
workers?
Six sub-questions addressed (1) Programme Delivery, (2) Design, (3) Scaling (see Annex H), (4) Quality of
Implementation, (5) Impact, and (6) Lessons Learned (see the evaluation matrix, Annex A, Table 5). Impact
refers to the extent to which the selected UNICEF-supported programmes have generated (or are expected
to generate) significant or transformative effects on caregiver capacities, parenting practices, and children’s
developmental status. Our emphasis on impact highlights the importance, moving forward, of collecting
high quality fidelity and outcome data, which is essential for demonstrating the efficacy of the programmes
UNICEF supports, as well as for the evidence-based refinement of the programmes.
2. Evaluation Approach
Following an extensive document review, we administered an institutional survey to 54 UNICEF COs that
included questions about existing parenting and early learning programmes. Six COs were identified as
case study COs (Thailand [EAP), Jordan [MENA], Paraguay [LAC], Serbia [ECA], Rwanda [ESA], and Mali
[WCA]), and these COs were asked to share specific documents related to the ECD (early stimulation and
responsive care programmes) programmes they have supported, which allowed for review of programme
materials, materials for training frontline workers, and the results of pilot studies or other evaluations of
programme implementation and outcomes. One-hour Key Informant Interview (KII) were then conducted
with 5 of the case study COs (Rwanda was unavailable). Interview questions were circulated to CO officials
in advance (except for Mali), and follow-up discussion continued by email.
3. Summary of Theme 3 Findings
Generally, the parenting programmes and the early learning programmes are standalone programmes with
distinctive and dedicated activities, workforce, curricula, physical spaces, materials, monitoring systems,
and so on. UNICEF support for these standalone programmes ranges from designing and piloting the entire
programme (e.g., ECD pilots in Rwanda, the Better Parenting Programme in Jordan) to making changes to
include parental engagement in the delivery of an existing programme (e.g., Serbia and Thailand). UNICEF

also supports changing or adding to protocols in health for front-line workers to support parents as part of
their routine processes. For example, Serbia CO has sought to improve paediatric services by teaching
paediatricians to provide ECD support to parents, including developmental screening and monitoring, and
referral to early interventions.
The key findings of the evaluation are:
(1) Delivery: Overall, across all regions, UNICEF has clearly supported governments in delivering ECD
programmes, including parenting and early learning programmes that focus on responsive parenting and
early stimulation. In ECAR, key strategies were improving access to preschool education and home visiting.
In ESAR, there was evidence of early learning programmes, parenting programmes and humanitarian
programmes. In LACR, the focus has been on parenting programmes, early learning programmes and
community programmes. In MENAR, there was more evidence on early learning and parenting
programmes, and limited evidence on humanitarian programmes, with the exception of Jordan, which
supports refugee children through the Makani (My Space) programme. In WCAR, the focus has been on
early learning and multisectoral packages that address children’s holistic development, as well as
community-based and humanitarian programmes.
The majority of UNICEF-supported parenting programmes (59% are designed to support parents of all
children in the country, but many COs also reported there is also a strong focus on children with disabilities
(48%), children living in poverty (57%), children in remote/hard to reach rural areas (61%), children in poor
urban areas (48%), and children from marginalised cultural or ethnic groups (41%). A similar pattern of
results was seen for UNICEF-supported early learning programmes.
COs reported that UNICEF-supported parenting programmes typically work with parents of infants,
toddlers, and preschool age children. Programmes supporting children’s school readiness are generally
focused on preschool age children and kindergarten age children. For public education, community-based,
and humanitarian settings, the focus of the early learning programmes is on preschool and kindergarten
age children.
(2) Design: The design of UNICEF-supported programmes generally corresponds to the latest scientific
consensus regarding parenting (responsive care) and stimulation to promote healthy brain development. A
large majority of COs (90% or more) indicated that their parenting programmes UNICEF’s addressed the
following topics: (1) the developing brain, (2) the role of play in child development, (3) parental warmth, and
(4) parental responsiveness. In contrast, fewer COs (62-72%) indicated that the parenting programmes
their office supported addressed the importance of autonomy-supportive parenting, which has been found
to associated with healthy child development.77 78 Autonomy support refers to a set of parenting (or
teaching) behaviours that help children develop a sense of agency: (1) providing children with the
appropriate amount of help for their skill level (i.e., scaffolding, providing “just enough” support); (2)
encouraging and appropriately praising children; (3) taking children's perspectives; and (4) providing

243
children with choices and following their lead.79 80 In the future, UNICEF should place emphasis on
practices related to autonomy-supportive parenting and teaching.
(3) Scaling: see Annex H.
(4) Quality of Implementation: Fidelity is the extent to which frontline workers adhere to the protocol for
programme delivery. There are no available data concerning fidelity of programme implementation. High
quality fidelity data are essential for supporting frontline workers to deliver programmes as planned and
using outcome evidence to refine and improve programmes.81
(5) Impact: There are virtually no outcome data concerning frontline workers’ knowledge about ECD and
their actual practices. The limited data that do exist (e.g., from Thailand) indicate that frontline workers
participating in ECD programmes show increased knowledge about ECD. Data concerning outcomes for
parents and children are also limited. Moreover, all available data are based on parent’s reports of their
own practices or children’s behaviour, and generally do not include comparisons with parents and children
who do not participate in the programmes. For example, in Jordan, War Child Holland collected data from
parents receiving interventions in refugee camps and found that parents reported increased knowledge
about ECD and an acceleration of their children’s development. This evidence is promising and is consistent
with the possibility that the interventions are effective, but in the absence of a comparison group, these
findings could be attributed to placebo effects and/or demand characteristics and not the intervention itself.
A good example of a well-designed study is the World Bank-supported Quality for Preschool Impact
Evaluation 2017.82
(6) Lessons Learned: The impact of UNICEF’s efforts on the lives of frontline workers, parents, and children
needs to be measured by (a) assessing frontline workers’ knowledge of ECD and nurturing care, (b)
assessing parents knowledge and self-reported attitudes, and directly observing parenting practices, and
(c) assessing children’s cognitive, social, and emotional development behaviourally (i.e., directly) using
standardised, validated, and reliable measures of children’s development and parent-child interactions.
Equally important, evaluations should be designed as randomised-controlled trials experimental or quasi-
experimental evaluation designs, which are essential for establishing efficacy. Ideally, these designs would
randomly assign families to participate either in target ECD programmes or in another form of intervention
(e.g., a nutrition intervention that does not address stimulation and responsive parenting). A more
convenient but much less powerful design is to compare families who do versus do not participate in ECD
programmes, measuring outcome variables pre- and post-intervention.
Outcome data that are collected need to be integrated into a secure data management system that will
allow for ongoing monitoring of individual children and comparisons across countries. Jordan CO uses a
comprehensive monitoring and reporting system (Bayani) for its ECD programmes. Thailand’s

4. Programme Delivery
The institutional survey asked COs about one (or two, if applicable) parenting programme(s) and about one
early learning programme. The majority of UNICEF-supported parenting programmes are designed to
support parents of all children in the country, but many COs also reported there is also a strong focus on
children with disabilities, children living in poverty, children in remote/hard to reach rural areas, children in
poor urban areas, and children from marginalised cultural or ethnic groups. Namibia CO and the Niger CO
reported that UNICEF has not supported parenting programmes since 2014. COs that did support parenting
programmes were asked which child groups are the focus of the primary parenting programme (Survey
Question #17), and the numbers (and percentages) endorsing each option are shown in Table 40.

COs that did support parenting programmes were also asked which child age groups the focus of
programmes are targeting child development and school readiness, and the numbers (and percentages) of
COs endorsing each option are shown in Table 43. Nearly all parenting programmes to support children’s
development address parents with infants and toddlers and preschool age children. Programmes
supporting children’s school readiness are generally focused on preschool age children and kindergarten
age children.

agency (e.g., giving children choices, and respecting their opinions, while still
remaining “in charge”)
14. Encourage parent to support children’s health and physical development by 60 (87%)
providing children with adequate hygiene and nutrition
15. Encourage parents to practice stimulation (serve-and-return interactions, 56 (81%)
learning activities, modelling)
16. Encourage parents to provide support and responsiveness (trust, attachment, 58 (84%)
sense of security, encouragement, support for agency)
17. Encourage parents to provide structure (routines, consistent discipline, 55 (80%)
supervision, protection from harm)
18. Encourage parents to promote the socialization of children (conveying values, 41 (59%)
habits, and attitudes of society)
Source: Survey Responses
All 18 of these best practices were endorsed by a majority of COs (59% or more), suggesting that
the primary UNICEF-supported parenting programmes in most countries are of high quality and
informed by UNICEF’s messaging around ECD, such as the Nurturing Care Framework and The Lancet
series on Advancing Early Childhood Development: From Science to Scale (2017),84 which emphasised
the importance of stimulation, including play, for early brain development. Five of the practices were
endorsed by a large majority (90% of more) of COs. These highly endorsed practices reflect UNICEF’s
efforts to raise awareness regarding (1) brain development (2) play-based interactions, (3)
discouraging use of corporal punishment, (4) age-appropriate play and learning materials, and (5)
parental warmth. UNICEF messaging regarding these practices has been well reflected in the large
majority of ECD programmes. In contrast, 5 practices were endorsed by 75% or fewer COs. These include:
(1) providing children with developmentally appropriate challenges, (2) providing children with just enough
help, (3) encouraging parenting consistency, (4) providing children with age-appropriate problems to solve,
(4) support for autonomy and agency, and (5) promoting socialization. These least endorsed items all
reflect the importance of autonomy-supportive parenting, which has been shown experimentally to
promote healthy development.85 Future messaging could usefully place a greater emphasis on practices
related to autonomy-supportive parenting.

The six case study COs reported that the parenting programmes they support were all of high quality,
although there was variation in the number of best-practices included. In particular, COs in Thailand (ECD
Demonstration Programme), Serbia (ECD Programme), and Rwanda (Early Childhood Development and
Family Programme) endorsed all 18 best practices (100%). Serbia’s ECD Programme also encourages the
use of augmentative and assistive technology for supporting communication in children with disabilities.
Jordan endorsed 16/18 practices (89%) for the Better Parenting Programme and indicated that it did not
include encouragement of parents’ awareness of healthy brain development or encouragement of parents’
support for children’s health and physical development. Jordan reported that the Parent and Child
Programme included 17/18 practices (94%), omitting only a focus on brain development.
In contrast, parenting programmes in Paraguay (Educar sin Violencia) and Mali (no name provided) did not
include a number of practices related to nurturing care and autonomy support. Paraguay’s primary
parenting programmes includes only 11/18 best practices (61%). Practices not included in this programme
concern (1) brain development, (2) serve and return interactions, (3) age-appropriate play and learning
materials, (4) support for autonomy and agency, (5) health and physical development, (6) stimulation, and
(7) parental support and responsiveness. Mali’s parenting programme includes 12/18 practices (67%) and
does not include practices concerning (1) providing children with just enough help, (2) consistency of
parenting practices, (3) coercive parenting, (4) providing children with praise, attention, and
encouragement, (5) showing children warmth and love, and (6) providing children with age-appropriate
problems to solve.
Early Learning Programmes
Kazakhstan reported that UNICEF has not supported early learning programmes since 2014, and Cuba did
not provide a response. COs were also asked about best practices included in any early learning
programmes they support. The number and percentage of COs (out of 52) endorsing each best practice
are shown in Table 45. As with the parenting programmes, practices endorsed by 90% or more of the COs
(shown in bold) were considered the most highly endorsed. Given the overall high levels of endorsement,
practices endorsed by fewer than 80% (shown in red) were considered the least endorsed.

10. Provide children with age-appropriate problems to solve 45 (87%)
11. Support children’s developing autonomy and sense of agency (e.g., giving 41 (79%)
children choices, and respecting their opinions while still remaining “in charge”)
Source: Survey Responses
The most highly endorsed practices concerned (1) brain development, (2) play-based interactions, (3) age-
appropriate play and learning materials, (4) age-appropriate play and learning materials, and (5) praise,
attention, and encouragement. These are all key components of the Nurturing Care Framework.
In contrast, four practices were endorsed by fewer than 80% of COs. These practices concerned (1)
providing children just enough help, (2) serve and return interactions, (3) discouraging teaching that is
psychologically coercive, and (4) support for autonomy and agency. These practices again reflect the
importance of autonomy support and indicate the need for UNICEF to place a greater emphasis on
practices related to autonomy support not only in parenting programmes, but also in early learning
programmes.
Early Learning Programmes, Case Study Countries
The six case study COs were asked to share any UNICEF-supported training materials for frontline workers
who work in early learning programmes, and a review of these materials indicated that all programmes are
of high quality, with the exception that they are generally not well designed to allow for ongoing monitoring
of caregiver, parent, and child outcomes and programme evaluation. An exception is In Thailand, the CO
developed a training manual for teachers as well as a curriculum for training ECD workers.
Serbia CO developed the Years of Ascent Curriculum for pre-schools, and modules for training home
visiting nurses, which were added to the pre-service training curriculum. Jordan CO adapted and revised
existing parenting materials for the Better Parenting Programme (BPP) and made changes to the
kindergarten curriculum to include parental engagement. Paraguay CO developed training materials for the
Upa! Programmes and their Care for Child Development (CCD) trainings, and Rwanda CO prepared a
comprehensive training package and commissioned the drafting of a Parenting Curriculum (2019). Mali CO
also developed training modules. The training materials from all 6 case study countries correspond closely
to best practices and appear to be of good to high quality.
The six case study COs reported that the early learning programmes they support all included a majority of
the 11 best practices identified, although again there was variation. Thailand (ECD Demonstration
Programme), Serbia (Years of Ascent), and Rwanda (Early Childhood Development and Family
Programme) endorsed all 11 best practices (100%).
Jordan CO endorsed 8/11 practices. Not included were practices around (1) providing children with
challenges appropriate for the child’s developmental level, (2) providing children just enough help, and (3)
serve and return interactions. These practices are important for autonomy support. Mali CO also endorsed
8/11 practices. Not included were practices concerning (1) providing children with challenges appropriate
for the child’s developmental level, (2) providing children just enough help, and (3) age-appropriate
250
problems. These practices are important for autonomy support. Finally, Paraguay’s early learning
programme includes 7/11 practices, and does not include practices related to (1) coercive teaching, (2)
corporal punishment, (3) age-appropriate problems, and (4) support for autonomy and agency.
6. Programme Scaling (see Annex H)
7. Programme Quality of Implementation
In the survey, COs were asked to report on whether UNICEF supported providers in an assessing whether
frontline workers who work in this parenting programmes are implementing day-to-day practices effectively
(with fidelity), and according to programme guidelines (norms and standards).86
For the parenting programmes, 9 out of 54 CO’s did not respond, or indicated that the question was “Not
Applicable,” given the lack of a parenting programme. For example, Mali CO reported, “The parenting
programme is just at a pilot stage, we have not able to observe frontline workers implement it in their day-
to-day practice.” An additional 5 COs (Honduras, Columbia, Chile, Paraguay, and India) reported that
UNICEF has not supported assessing fidelity of implementation. For example, India CO reported, “No
assessment of implementation of parenting programmes is being done. There are no clear norms and
standards for parenting programmes.” Most of the remaining 40 COs indicated simply that UNICEF provides
supervision, or that the CO works with counterparts at national and local levels who are responsible for
monitoring the implementation of the frontline workers. There is no evidence that fidelity per se was
assessed for any of these programmes, even using self-report measures of fidelity. Fidelity of
implementation should be assessed through systematic observation, using a well-designed fidelity
checklist.
For the 52 COs with early learning programmes, no COs indicated that UNICEF has supported the
assessed frontline workers. 23 COs reported that UNICEF has not assessed frontline workers, and 29 COs
did not reply.
Programme Quality of Implementation, Case Study Countries
Among case study countries, Thailand CO reported that fidelity assessment is not part of the approach, but
that teacher certification includes pre- and post-testing (after training) of teachers at 27 ECD centres. Jordan
indicated that Better Parenting Programme training includes an M&E Protocol, and that programme
monitoring was done through UNICEF’s ECD staff and Makani ECD focal points. UNICEF Jordan uses a
comprehensive monitoring and reporting system (Bayani) for the programmes, but it does not appear that
fidelity per se was measured systematically. Serbia reported that assessment of preschool teachers is
regulated at the national level and implemented at the level of preschool institutions by psychologists and
teachers. Monitoring and evaluation of the programme is an integral part of the process of professional
development of practitioners, organised as a learning-centred and improvement-focused evaluation.
Moving forward, however, Serbia plans to “monitor the direct application of capacities developed for the
implementation of the new Curriculum Framework (utilisation of capacities) through formative and
summative monitoring and evaluation.” Similarly, Paraguay reported that together with academic
researchers and the MoE, UNICEF will start the development of norms and standards and use these to
develop observation protocols in order to assess that service providers are indeed implementing effectively.
86 Question 24: How has the UNICEF Country Office supported service providers in assessing whether frontline
workers who work in this parenting programmes are implementing day-to-day practices effectively (with fidelity), and
according to programme guidelines (norms and standards)?
251
The CO reported that at present, there is a “lack of fidelity data, we need a better system for monitoring,
[and] we need to keep track. [We are] planning to train FLW and follow-up, but [it] hasn’t happened yet.”
In Rwanda, a monitoring and evaluation system has been developed, and is being rolled out as more
funding becomes available. Minimum standards have been developed, but there is no evidence that fidelity
of implementation is being assessed systematically, however. Mali CO reported that UNICEF supported
“formative supervision by technical services” from ministries in charge of education, health, and social
development of relevant ministries. There is no evidence that this supervision included systematic
assessments of fidelity of implementation, however.
8. Programme Impact
Overall, there is limited evidence that any UNICEF-supported ECD programmes have an impact on parents
and children. Parent’s knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs are rarely assessed systematically, and many
measures of child outcomes are inadequate in their scope and developmental sensitivity. There is no
reported use of reliable, validated, standardised, direct behavioural assessments to measure children’s
developmental status, although several COs reported using high-quality parent-report measures of
children’s development. Few COs use the same instruments, however, with the exception of MICS, which
makes it difficult to compare outcomes across countries. Measures that rely on parent report have inherent
limitations, including risk for bias.
UNICEF Support for Data Collection (Parents)
For parenting programmes (1 & 2), the institutional survey asked COs to specify how UNICEF supported
data collection. COs were asked, “How has the UNICEF CO supported service providers in collecting data
on parent outcomes for this programme?”
For UNICEF-supported parenting programmes, 8 out of the 54 COs provided no response, and 11 countries
explicitly said no data had been collected. The Philippines CO reported, “No support yet.” India CO reported,
“Currently, family and parent level data is not being collected for the parenting programmes.” These 19 COs
represent 35% of the sample, a substantial minority. The remaining COs reported a range of support, from
providing questionnaires to developing M&E systems. For example, China CO reported supporting the use
of household surveys to understand the changes in parenting outcomes, including parenting self-efficacy,
parenting stress, maternal depression, family support for early stimulation, and appropriate discipline. When
relevant parent outcome data were measured, this was often through field visits and interviews of ECD
professionals. For example, Eritrea CO reported that “UNICEF supports data collection through field visits
or interviews, annual reviews, reports and meetings.” Kyrgyzstan CO reported, “Only through the review of
the results of the monitoring, supervision, and phone calls to parents. Unfortunately, [there is] no routine
system for the collection of this data.” Jordan CO reported, “The PCP was included in Makani in 2018, and
programme monitoring was done through UNICEF’s ECD staff and Makani ECD focal points.”
Many of the COs who reported UNICEF support for collecting parent outcome data were focused on the
numbers of parents and children reached by the workshops, rather than data that could show an impact of
the programmes on parents’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices. For example, Argentina CO reported that
“UNICEF supports local agencies in collecting data on specific indicators related to the numbers of parents
and children reached by the workshops. Each local agency adapts the collection of the information…”
Indonesia CO reported using the RapidPro platform to update the number of sessions conducted and the
number of parents participating.
252
Tools for Assessment (Parents)
COs were also asked what tools were used for assessment. Sixteen COs did not respond or indicated, “Not
applicable.” In countries that did collect data, a wide variety of locally adapted parent-rating scales of child
development milestones were reported. There is little overlap in measures across countries, however, and
it is difficult to compare data across countries.
Child Outcomes
In general, for UNICEF-supported programmes, data regarding child outcomes are not being collected in a
systematic way and not using the best possible behavioural assessments of parent and child behaviour
(including parent-child interactions). What is needed, especially for the ongoing refinement of programmes
and for scaling, is for direct assessments of parent and child to be embedded in government monitoring
processes, which would enable oversight of fidelity of implementation, accountability for resources, number
of beneficiaries and outputs as well as providing valuable resources for basic and intervention science and
allow for more. In Jordan, UNICEF uses a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system (Bayani) for the
programmes. Thailand also has such a system in place; what is missing is data based on a randomised
controlled trial and direct behavioural (i.e., more objective) measures. Such data could demonstrate efficacy
and allow for evidence-based refinement and strengthening of the intervention and its delivery.
Although many evaluations were not designed to assess the efficacy of ECD programmes in terms of
parenting KAP and child development, there are exceptions. UNICEF’s Global Evaluation Reports
Oversight System (GEROS) involves the review of the quality of final evaluation reports that were
conducted independent external companies. Few UNICEF-funded evaluations of ECD—with children
younger than 72 months and using direct assessments—are rated as “Outstanding, Best Practice.” One
exception is the 2014 evaluation of the Early Childhood Health Outreach Programme (ECHO) in Barbados.
Although not a randomised controlled trial, it did include child development outcomes measured directly for
both children who were part of the ECHO programme (treatment group) or not (non-treatment group),
controlling for variables such as age, gender, and socio-economic status. A total of 17 ECHO child
beneficiaries and 15 control children participated, and they were assessed using the Jamaican Ages and
Stages Questionnaire for children up to 60 months of age, or the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT)
for those 5 years and older. Results failed to find any significant differences between groups on any
measures, perhaps because it was so underpowered statistically. Overall, there was no evidence that the
ECHO programme led to improvements in either parent or child outcomes.
A better example, one of the BOURE 2020 Finalists, is the 2019 Evaluation of the UNICEF Mozambique
Accelerated School Readiness Pilot Programme.87 This evaluation used longitudinal, cluster randomised,
controlled evaluation with repeated outcome measures for children and parents. Thirty schools were
randomly assigned to the treatment group and to the control group. School readiness was measured directly
at 3 time points using the International Development and Early Learning Assessment (IDELA),88 which was
specifically developed for use in low-resource settings, and has undergone rigorous validation in 11

countries (Pisani et al. 2015).89 To measure caregiver outcomes, they administered a questionnaire to
measure frontline workers’ attitudes, educational aspirations for their children, and parenting practices at
the first two time points (baseline and midline). At Post-test, the authors found a highly significant impact of
the programme on children’s school readiness (except for the socio-emotional domain).
UNICEF Support for Data Collection (Children)
COs were asked, “How has the UNICEF CO supported service providers in collecting data on early learning
outcomes for this programme?” Of the 54 COs, 17 (31%) indicated that UNICEF has not collected any data
in this regard. Of the remaining 37 COs, 8 COs reported using the MICS, and the others mentioned a variety
of questionnaires or monitoring systems, such as the Developmental Surveillance Systems in Thailand.
South Africa CO reported supporting “Action research on the P.L.A.Y. online courses.” Kenya CO noted,
“This is collected through KSRAT however, there is a challenge of uptake of this tool by government
officials. Many frontline workers prefer interviewing children instead of assessing children development
status.” Chile CO reported that UNICEF’s contribution to the measurement of child development has been
solid, as reflected in the Encuesta Longitudinal de Primer Infancia (ELPI), 90 a national longitudinal survey
that includes questions on parenting (e.g., using the MICS module of Discipline). Guatemala CO answered,
“Baselines and instruments.”
Tools for Assessment (Children)
ECD assessment tools are useful for population monitoring, programme evaluation, or exploratory
research, and developmental screening tools help identify children who may be at risk for developmental
difficulties.91 These measures should be standardised, reliable, validated, normed, sensitive to individual
and developmental differences across a wide range of ability levels. Ideally, they should also be brief, easy
to administer, and culturally appropriate.
When asked what tools or instruments have/will be used to assess parent outcomes for parenting
programmes, of the 54 COs, 10 did not reply or indicated, “Not applicable,” and an additional 8 reported
that they did not currently assess parent outcomes or were in the process of developing tools for doing so
(18/54 = 33%). The remaining COs reported using a range of questionnaires, and in most cases, the
psychometric properties of these instruments is unclear.
For assessing children’s development, COs reported using a few high-quality (i.e., validated, normed,
standardised) parent-report measures of children’s development, including the Ages and Stages
Questionnaire-3 (used only in Uruguay) and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd ed.
(used only in Belarus in Early Child Intervention centres).92 Argentina reported they use the Battelle

Developmental Inventory, 2nd ed., as well as the PruebaNacional de Pesquisa, or PRUNAPE, a screening
test for developmental difficulties.93 Another high-quality tool is the International Guide for Monitoring Child
Development (GMCD).94 95 This is used in Turkmenistan, where UNICEF supports an effort to collect
disaggregated data on every 0-42 month child who participates in the ECD programme. China CO reported
using the Caregiver Reported Early Development Instruments (CREDI),96 which were designed to serve as
a population-level measure of ECD from 0-3 years. China CO also reported using for MICS6 and scales for
assessing parenting pressure and child neglect.
Overall, the use of different instruments to measure parent and child outcomes makes it difficult to compare
outcomes across countries, limiting the extent to which COs can benefit from research in other countries.
Measures that rely on parent report have inherent limitations, including risk for bias. For assessing
children’s developmental status, there is no reported use of direct behavioural assessments, although
several COs reported using high-quality parent-report measures of children’s development.
Programme Impact on Parents and Children, Case Study Countries
Parenting Programmes: UNICEF Support for Data Collection
In Thailand, routine and administrative data collection instruments are limited. UNICEF relies on MICS data,
initiated a KAP baseline in 2017 which will be repeated in 2021. The participating NGOs collect data on
select monitoring indicators in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior which is reported annually.
According to the UNICEF Thailand Mid-Term Review Report (July 2019), Thailand CO will invest in the
development of foundational skills through a greater focus on the quality of learning through strengthened
monitoring and measuring of learning outcomes, while it will also support the curriculum reform process.
Jordan CO reported that UNICEF has supported data collection through provision of data collection tools
(including pre-post assessments for each participating parent), conducting training on M&E protocols, and
helping to develop guidelines and databases for data recording. Self-reported results by the parents are
used to determine whether there has been an increase in their knowledge, skills, and/or confidence in
positive parenting for young children. In Serbia, implementation of parenting programmes usually includes
M&E methodology integrated that is monitoring on one hand achievement. Paraguay was among the COs
who reported that UNICEF did not support service providers in collecting data on parent or child outcomes.
However, they indicated that they plan to use interviews and case studies in the future. In Rwanda,
outcomes are measured through specific programme evaluations and periodic national surveys like the
Demographic Health Survey (DHS), but that is focused on adolescent and adult health, not parenting.
Finally, in Mali, UNICEF-supported financially and technically the development of a community-based M&E
system in the implementing areas. However, as this system is not institutionalised and integrated within an

existing system such as the Health Management Information System (HMIS), data collection and
aggregation has never been effective.
Parenting Programmes: Tools for Assessment
When asked what measures were used to collect parent outcome data, Paraguay indicated, “Not
applicable,” and Mali did not respond. In Thailand, parent outcome measures include a set of customised
questionnaires administered before and after trainings of teachers/parents. Satisfaction surveys were also
used. In Jordan, each participating parent is required to complete a pre-and post-intervention self-
assessments. The M&E Protocol has been revised and updated in conjunction with the revision of the BPP
manuals. In Serbia, a number of parent-outcome assessments were used (e.g., checklists for Home Visiting
Nurses [HVNs]). Data gathering methodology and tools are currently being revised for the new upgraded
parenting programme. The CO reported that different instruments will be used depending on the
outcome/output indicators, such as a KAP survey, a quality-of-service provision satisfaction survey,
implementation effectiveness and efficacy questionnaires/instruments, developmental checklists,
structured and unstructured interview questionnaires, and evaluation lists. They noted that some of these
will be internationally or nationally standardised, some have been adapted to the cultural context, and some
are newly invented. Rwanda CO reported using the DHS tools developed by the National Institute of
Statistics, as well as evaluation tools created by IKEA.
Early Learning Programmes
UNICEF Support for Data Collection
Paraguay and Mali COs did not respond when asked about UNICEF support for service providers in
collecting data on child outcomes. Among the other case study countries, Thailand CO supported the Office
of Education Council to launch the Early Learning Development Standards (ELDS) and create indicators
based on age-appropriate development. During visits to participating ECD centres, UNICEF also provides
guidance to the teachers on how they could improve ways to monitor individual children’s developmental
status. Serbia CO noted that during the piloting of the new PSE framework Curricula, preschool teachers
were using scales for monitoring the wellbeing and participation of children, but that the purpose of these
scales was not to assess the child's developmental status and achievements, but to better understand the
child and re-examine the context of the programme developed with children. Jordan CO reported that they
measure changes in children’s development through before and after tests. In Rwanda, UNICEF supported
the 2014/15 DHS, which is mainly focused on children’s health.
Tools for Assessment
In Thailand, UNICEF supported the Office of Education Council to launch the Early Learning and
Development Standards (ELDS) and the indicators based on age-appropriate development. Jordan relies
on national monitoring systems. Serbia reported that in piloting the new PSE framework Curricula,
preschool teachers were using scales for monitoring the wellbeing and participation of children, but that the
purpose of monitoring children based on the scales of well-being and participation was not to assess the
child's developmental abilities and achievements, but to better understand the child and re-examine the
context of the programme developed with children. Rwanda CO reported using the DHS tools, which are
administered by the National Institute of Statistics. Paraguay and Mali did not respond.
9. Lessons Learned
256
Survey responses and interviews with UNICEF COs, ROs, and HQ provided reflections on lessons learned
during 2014-2019. The HQ ECD team reported a need for more specification of exactly which parenting
knowledge, attitudes, and practices need to be encouraged. One member said, “Parenting is not part of the
advocacy agenda globally,” and also that, “The time of small-scale pilots (“boutique projects") is over; it’s
time to take it to scale.” The need for standardised measures for caregiver and child outcomes was noted.
At present, the outcomes measured are “number of parents reached” rather parent and child knowledge
and skills. As another EC team member put it, “COs have to report on parenting programmes, but we don’t
go all the way to say how and provide the tools.” They emphasised that MICS was not designed to be used
as measure of programme impact for children at the individual level: “It is a common excuse, you blame
the lack of data, but it is a lack of thinking of measures and investments of what to measure.” Another
member of the team noted: “We are still debating about how to measure the impact of frontline worker
training; there is still no monitoring framework from the nurturing care framework that we could draw upon,
and countries have been implementing very different types of interventions…”
A member of the MENARO attributed the absence of adequate measurement of outcomes to the fact that
not all partners have identified indicators and targets: “More work needs to be done with national partners
in terms of how to measure the outcomes of ECD programming at the level of child…” It was further argued
that UNICEF’s need to measure changes in parenting practices: “We need to… measure the impact. That
is not happening on a programmatic level, but even less on a national level. We need clearly defined
indicators on what parenting would mean.”
LACRO reported that measurement is a “huge challenge, especially in child development outcomes - how
to measure - there are no instruments - they are very expensive.” ECARO noted that their emphasis within
early learning is focused on the “quality and inclusiveness on early learning,” and reported that they have
been developing multi-country studies and methods that can be used by many countries in the region.”
A member of the ROSA emphasised the following: “[B]eing able to conduct studies that are multi-country,
facilitate exchanges, learning opportunities to see how different challenges have been addressed in
different contexts. This includes evaluations, for example the global evaluation of ELDS and the effect of
that on school readiness. So, we can exploit these global and regional evaluations and do a dissemination
in COs and to reflect on how best to take on recommendations in each context.”
WCARO reported that they have “conducted 6 evaluations related to ECD over the last 2 years, 3 linked
directly to ECD.” They stated that they used UNICEF tools for early learning measurement, and that they
were using MICS global data to demonstrate the prevalence of toxic stress in the region, but they noted,
“MICS is the best we have right now to measure things beyond stunting, etc.” They also stated, “In terms
of measuring impact on a regional scale, I don’t think we can respond to that question, because there is not
one common shared impact statement that … has an ECD index … It’s an issue in terms of how we measure
the impact of ECD.” They added, “The ECD guidance is very clear on what the programmes have to
measure and how, the issue we have is the ownership of the guidance on the sectoral level.”
An expert informant (#1) stated, “The measures are still very crude, but as at ECD we should be able to
work on this, with UNICEF leading the way.” Another expert informant (#3) highlighted the utility of MICS
at the population level.
Among case study countries, Serbia CO noted that early stimulation and responsive caregiving
programmes are implemented by strengthening all system components (including frontline workers
engaged in the health, education, and social welfare systems). Thailand CO reported that health and
257
nutrition get lumped in with ECD, which helps to integrate the different aspects of ECD, for a whole child
approach. They also noted the need to provide a more universalised vs. targeted approach, and the fact
that policy and national guidelines are less effective for advocating for wider adoption of programmes across
areas. They indicated that there is a lot more need for parental engagement and early child learning
throughout the country.
Jordan CO reported that an important lesson was the integration of ECD into Makani in 2018, which has
allowed UNICEF to increase access to ECD services across the kingdom in the past few years—reaching
35,000-45,000 parents and their children annually. Jordan CO was noted that they leveraged USAID’s
support for the ECD programme to create a position for an ECD Officer, who was upgraded to a Specialist
in 2018. That same year, another post for an ECE Specialist was also established. Demand for services is
growing fast, however. Jordan CO is currently developing a parenting portal to provide frontline workers
with resources and they are adapting an online version of the UNICEF-supported parenting programmes
to be offered virtually, which will facilitate scaling.
Paraguay CO cited the lack of fidelity data and indicated that they need a better system for monitoring
programme implementation and impact. Mali CO noted the need for funding and more data being collected.
These data are needed to build a case for investment in ECD. As one of the Paraguay CO members put it,
“Evidence is key!”
10. Conclusion and Recommendations
The number of parents and young children enrolled in UNICEF-supported ECD programmes has grown in
recent years, and the design of these programmes is generally of high quality, corresponding to evidence-
based best practices. In particular, UNICEF appears to have been effective in raising awareness about
nurturing care and the importance of early brain development. Messaging about the importance of
autonomy-supportive parenting and teaching has been less effective. Autonomy-supportive practices help
children develop a sense of agency and self-efficacy and include (1) providing children with the appropriate
amount of help for their skill level (i.e., scaffolding that provides “just enough” support); (2) encouraging
children to undertake challenges and praising children appropriately; (3) taking children's perspectives; and
(4) providing children with choices and following their lead.
Despite the high-quality design of these programmes, serious questions remain about the fidelity with which
these programmes are implemented and the impact that these programmes might have on frontline
workers, parents, and children. The impact of UNICEF’s efforts on the lives of frontline workers, parents,
and children can be more adequately measured in a variety of ways, including (a) assessing frontline
workers’ knowledge of ECD and nurturing care, (b) assessing parents’ knowledge and self-reported
attitudes, and observing parenting practices, and (c) assessing children’s cognitive, social, and emotional
development. New tools are needed for measuring parent and child outcomes directly using standardised,
validated, and reliable measures of children’s behaviour and parent-child interactions.
In those countries where data were collected, COs reported using a wide variety of locally adapted parent-
rating scales of child development milestones. There is little overlap in measures across countries, making
cross-country comparisons difficult. Eight COs reported using the MICS Early Childhood Development
Index (ECDI) to assess child outcomes.
UNICEF’s reliance on the MICS-ECDI is problematic, however. MICS data can help characterise children’s
environment and they are useful for population-level analyses. Consider, for example, the MICS measure
258
of school readiness, which is based on a single question about whether children in first grade of primary
school attended preschool during the previous school year. At the population level, it is indeed important
to know about enrolment in pre-school, but at the level of individual children, it does not provide a measure
of individual children’s school readiness, which is normally measured in terms of whether children have
sufficient early literacy, numeracy, and executive function skills to function effectively in kindergarten. The
MICS measure simply assumes that preschool was effective in ensuring children were ready for school; it
does not measure school readiness. MICS data can provide a compelling case for the need for ECD
programmes, but they do not provide adequate measures of the efficacy and impact of these programmes.
As one UNICEF HQ respondent noted, “MICS surveys are a contribution to system building; it is not meant
for programme purposes. We struggle to convey this to UNICEF colleagues as well as external partners…
the objective is not to monitor or evaluate UNICEF interventions…”
The criterion of “Developmentally on track in 3 out of 4 domains” is a weak standard; it means children may
be delayed in 1 out of 4 key domains. The criteria for being on track in a domain are also inadequate. For
example, children are judged as being on track for learning if they are reported by parents to do at least
one of only two things: (EC11) Does (name) follow simple directions on how to do something correctly? and
(EC12) When given something to do, is (name) able to do it independently?
When viewing children from a holistic (whole child) perspective, it is obvious that all 4 domains are part of
a single developmental system and mutually influence one another, so meeting standards on all 4 domains
is essential. Also, the MICS provides no data on early learning, stimulation, and care for children younger
than 36 months. The first 3 years of life represent a period of enormous development, and they provide a
foundation for the rest of the lifespan. As shown in Table D, 43% of COs reported that the public education
early learning programmes they support involves parents of infants and toddlers (0-2). If UNICEF continues
to rely on MICS data, the ECDI should be expanded to address these parents and their children.
The MICS is inadequate as measure of children’s cognitive and social-emotional skills. First, it is too limited
in scope and too insensitive to developmental changes across ages 0 to 5 years to provide sufficient
evidence of impact on child and parent outcomes. The developmental significance of the ECDI indicators
varies considerably across the age range 36-59 months. Second, parent-reports of children’s behaviour
are subjective, and vulnerable to bias, such as halo effects97 and self enhancement.98 Third, the indicators
fail to capture the most important foundational neurocognitive processes and skills, such as executive
function, episodic memory, and social understanding. The healthy development of these skills is essential
for learning and adaptation, and individual differences in these skills predict important developmental
outcomes, including educational achievement, innovation and job success, and parenting and interpersonal
relationships.99 100 Impairments in these neurocognitive skills are markers of numerous disorders emerging
in childhood or adolescence.101

For these reasons, parent responses to these MICS questions are inadequate to provide meaningful
evidence of the actual impact of programmes and services.
To summarise, data regarding child outcomes are not being collected in a way that allows for the
assessment of fidelity of implementation and programme efficacy. Most studies, with few exceptions, do
not use the best available behavioural assessments of children’s development. What is needed are direct
behavioural assessments that are brief, reliable, validated, standardised, and normed. An example of such
measures is the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery, which is administered on a computer tablet, and is currently
available in a wide range of languages, such as French, Spanish, Arabic, and a variety of African languages,
including Swahili and Dholuo.
Measures of foundational neurocognitive skills should be embedded within the implementation process and
be administered repeatedly. Early assessment is important for the early detection of potential difficulties
and for more timely therapeutic intervention. For use with diverse populations, including in resource-limited
settings, these measures need to be affordable, require minimal staff training, and be applicable across a
range of cultural contexts.
Monitoring and evaluation currently tends to emphasise measuring the number of children reached by ECD
programmes, rather than the impact of these programmes on frontline workers, parents, and children.
Without additional and better-quality data, including more relevant assessments of children’s development,
and the use of randomised controlled experimental and quasi-experimental designs, it is simply not possible
to evaluate the efficacy and impact of these programmes. Several well-designed evaluation studies have
been conducted outside of UNICEF’s support, and these could be used as models for future research.102
103
In the future, the ECD programmes should encourage autonomy-supportive parenting and teach as well as
ongoing direct assessment of (1) the frequency and fidelity of implementation, and (2) the outcomes of
interest (e.g., knowledge of parenting skills, use of parenting skills, direct measures of children’s cognitive
and social-emotional development). Frontline workers who deliver the interventions can assess such
outcomes with minimal training.
